FT  04 DEC 92 / British Coal proposes measures to save 13 pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL urged the government yesterday to adopt plans aimed at saving
13 threatened pits and 8,000 jobs and to change the law to enable it to
adapt working patterns and significantly increase pit efficiency.
The proposals were attacked by unions, which said saving fewer than half of
the 31 pits earmarked for closure was not enough, especially as British Coal
envisages that seven of the 'saved' pits and 6,000 of the saved jobs would
go within five years anyway.
The National Union of Mineworkers and Nacods pit deputies union also oppose
law changes by which British Coal could introduce 24-hour working, seven
days a week. Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, said in Sheffield yesterday:
'This latest statement by British Coal displays further incompetence and a
refusal to accept the overwhelming evidence in support of keeping all 51
pits open.'
Separately, Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, said it was unlikely that
contracts with electricity generators would be signed before the government
published its energy review scheduled for the end of next month. He called
for longer contracts with the power generators than the five years at
present envisaged.
In its evidence to the Department of Trade and Industry's energy review,
British Coal proposed a series of measures that would, it said, enable it to
sell an extra 15m tonnes of coal a year over the next five years to the
England and Wales electricity generators and another 5m to industrial and
domestic customers, taking the total to 64m tonnes in 1997-98.
Mr Clarke said if British Coal were to be profitable, extra sales to
generators would have to be at the same price as agreed for lower volumes in
existing tentative deals. British Coal's proposals include:
Deferring the commissioning of Sizewell B nuclear power station for a number
of years, saving 3m tonnes of coal by 1997-98, and phasing out most Magnox
nuclear stations over the next five years, saving 5m tonnes.
Reducing gas burning at committed combined-cycle gas turbine plants and
refusing permission for others to be constructed, saving 6m tonnes.
Extending the UK tax on electricity - the fossil fuel levy - to electricity
imported from France and eliminating the present net inflow into Britain,
saving 6m tonnes.
British Coal wants a slower reduction in coal stocks than is now envisaged
and limits on the burning of bitumen-based orimulsion. It also backs the
deferral of plans for the proposed liberalisation of the electricity market
due for implementation in 1994 and 1998.
British Coal warned that without policy changes there would be only 11,000
deep-pit miners and 15 pits by 1997. Even with the changes there would be 25
pits compared with the present 50 and 17,000 miners.
None of those calculations incorporates the effects of the the proposed law
changes on alterations to working practices. British Coal says the changes
may cut average deep-mine operating costs of Pounds 1.27 a gigajoule by a
further 15p.
British Coal wants the government to repeal the 1908 Coal Mines Regulation
Act, which limits underground shifts to 7 1/2 hours. Because of travelling
time, many miners work only five hours at the coal face. British Coal wants
to increase that to eight hours, and for some miners that would mean 10-hour
shifts.
The corporation also wants the government to repeal of Section 46 of the
1946 Coal Industry Nationalisation Act, which establishes machinery for
consultation and conciliation and the modernisation of mines and quarries
legislation to allow more efficient management and supervision. It wants to
be able to make compulsory redundancies.
The Trades Union Congress has called on the European Commission to take
legal action to halt the pit closure programme.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Land Rover set to win Pounds 150m order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 150M MINISTRY of Defence order for 6,500 light military vehicles
looks almost certain to go to Land Rover, the four-wheel-drive vehicle
subsidiary of British Aerospace-owned Rover Group.
Land Rover, based in Solihull, West Midlands, is the only company to have
been asked to build trial vehicles for the order out of 20 European and
North American manufacturers invited to tender in June.
The MoD normally selects three or four rival candidates to build evaluation
models for trials, typically lasting about 18 months. Land Rover will build
13 trial vehicles, based on its Defender 90 and 110 models.
If they are satisfactory, the company would expect to be given the volume
order, which is mainly for the Army. The MoD is Land Rover's biggest single
customer and the order is potentially the company's biggest single contract
for a decade. Delivery is scheduled over five years, starting in 1994.
Land Rover will also build some larger Defender trial vehicles for another
MoD contract for 200 four-wheel-drive utility trucks, in competition with
Steyr-Daimler-Puch of Austria. This year Land Rover expects to produce about
55,000 vehicles, 5,000 down on 1991. About two fifths of the total will be
its Discovery leisure vehicles, with the balance shared equally between the
Defender and up-market Range Rover models.
The Solihull plant is working overtime and on Saturdays to maintain its
output level and to cater for higher demand. Like Jaguar, Land Rover has
found robust demand starting to reappear in North America.
Land Rover's October sales in the US, at 521, were more than double levels
of a year ago and are the second-highest in its history.
The company said yesterday it expected last month's sales to set a new
record at more than 600.
Demand for Jaguars in North America has picked up only during the past month
and has yet to be quantified by the company. In October, its US sales were
down on the same month of 1991 - at 614 compared with 926 - but the company
is sufficiently encouraged to have resumed five-day working.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Accountancy pay 'up 2%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANTS' salaries rose by just 2 per cent in the past year, highlighting
the continued effects of the recession, Accountancy Personnel, the
recruitment firm, reported yesterday.
Demand for insolvency staff is beginning to level off in the north-east and
Scotland, suggesting that the worst of the downturn may be over in those
regions.
Wages for newly qualified accountants in industry and commerce fell by 3.5
per cent to Pounds 19,208, while those for qualified staff remained
unchanged at Pounds 23,222.
Salaries for students entering training contracts in accountancy firms rose
by 1.5 per cent to an average of Pounds 7,941. Wages for unqualified audit
staff in public practice were unchanged at Pounds 8,389, while those for
accounting technicians increased 2 per cent to Pounds 6,736.
Newly qualified chartered and certified accountants' salaries rose 2 per
cent to Pounds 19,041, while those with post-qualifying experience were up
3.5 per cent to Pounds 20,667.
Salaries for part-qualified accountants in industry and commerce jumped 4.5
per cent to Pounds 10,500, while certified and management accountant
trainees' salaries were level at Pounds 7,472.
Accountancy Personnel said technical skills, including using spreadsheets,
were a pre-requisite for job-hunters.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHNSON Controls, the US automotive components supplier, is to open an
Pounds 8m plant at Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, to supply seats to the
Toyota car assembly plant at Burnaston, near Derby, Kevin Done writes.
Johnson Controls, the world's largest independent supplier of vehicle seats,
has been rapidly expanding in Europe in the past five years. The Burton
plant, which will create about 80 jobs, will supply Toyota on a just-in-time
basis with final assembly of the seats taking place at Burton.
The US components maker supplies metal seat parts to Ford and Rover in the
UK from its components plants at Telford, Shropshire, and at Leigh-on-Sea,
Essex. It also has a 49 per cent stake in Ikeda Hoover, which supplies seats
to the Nissan car plant at Sunderland.
Johnson Controls said one production line would operate initially at the
Burton plant, but there was space for a second to keep pace with growing
production at the Toyota plant, which opens officially on December 16.
Johnson achieved an operating profit of Dollars 265.5m (Pounds 174.6m) on a
turnover worldwide of Dollars 5.156bn in the 12 months to the end of
September.

<TEXT>
PRUDENTIAL, Britain's largest life insurance group, has called for the
creation of a single regulator for all occupational pensions schemes.
The call was made in Prudential's submission to the Goode committee, which
was established to look into occupational pension law after the Maxwell
affair.
Mr David Linnell, Prudential's group actuary and compliance officer, said:
'What we need is a set of principles which apply to all occupational
schemes; clarification of the roles and responsibilities of everyone
involved; and a single pensions regulator responsible for investigating any
breaches, with powers to intervene where necessary.'
Prudential added that 'particular efforts should also be made to improve
communication to all pension scheme members'.
It favours a restricted compensation fund, limited to schemes where there
has been fraud and theft, and it has proved impossible to use other means to
recover the stolen money.
UK investment firms have criticised the recommendation that there should be
30 individuals on the board of the Personal Investment Authority, the
proposed regulator for the retail investment industry.
The PIA's formation committee has received views from 253 groups and
individuals.

THE POLLUTION Inspectorate confirmed yesterday that it told British Nuclear

Sellafield to complete commissioning the Pounds 2.8bn plant.
It denied that it had told BNFL that it could not start operation of the
plant, which is intended to reprocess nuclear fuel. It said: 'The Thorp
plant cannot start operation without an authorisation and no decision on
authorisation will be taken until all the representations from the present
eight-week public consultation period have been considered.'
Earlier in the week, the director of the Thorp plant had expressed surprise
at the delay in authorisation. Pending authorisation to start full
operation, BNFL wants to put material in the plant to finish testing the
monitoring systems.

CONSTRUCTION output is expected to decline by a further 1.5 per cent next
year, according to the National Council of Building Material Producers, one
of the industry's foremost forecasters.
The council warned that a further fall in output, after falls of 8.9 per
cent and 8 per cent in 1991 and 1992 respectively, might lead to more cuts
and redundancies among building material companies.
The main gain the industry could expect next year would be in the housing
market, where the value of output in constant 1985 prices was expected to
rise by 5.5 per cent to Pounds 3.51bn.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Societies at odds on house price rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S two largest building societies disagreed yesterday on whether
house prices were still falling or had started to rise, Andrew Taylor
writes.
Halifax, the country's largest society, with about a fifth of the mortgage
market, reported that house prices had risen by 0.1 per cent last month, the
first monthly increase recorded by the society since June.
Nationwide, its nearest rival, said prices had fallen on average by 2 per
cent in November, the second-largest monthly fall reported by the society
since October last year.
The difference between the figures illustrates uncertainty in the housing
market after sterling's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism in
September.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Lloyd's staff levels to drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 200 jobs are to go at the Lloyd's Corporation, the body that
co-ordinates and regulates activities at the Lloyd's insurance market.
The cuts, announced yesterday by Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief
executive, are part of plans to reduce the organisation's budget by 18.4 per
cent to Pounds 117.9m in 1993 compared with Pounds 144.5m in 1992. Staffing
levels will fall from 2,200 to 1,990 over the next 12 months.
Mr David Rowland, chairman-elect, said: 'There is no possibility of the
market prospering without a substantial attack on costs.' A radical review
of the corporation's activities is under way and further cuts are not ruled
out.
Lloyd's also announced that Mr John Gaynor, 57, head of finance at the
corporation, is to take early retirement, while the contract of Mr Brian
Nicholson, a senior public-relations executive, will not be renewed.
The moves are part of a reorganisation of the corporation's management
structure.
Lloyd's is freezing pay levels of corporation employees, abolishing
flexitime arrangements and consolidating some benefits into basic pay.
The spending cuts will allow Lloyd's to reduce the expenses of Names, the
individuals whose capital supports underwriting at the market, and
syndicates, which in turn should make a return to profitability more likely.
The cost of membership subscriptions that Names must pay will be reduced
from 0.5 per cent of gross allocated capacity (the amount of premium income
a Name is allowed to accept) in 1992 to 0.4 per cent in 1993.
Rents paid by syndicates for space in the underwriting room are being
reduced from Pounds 307 a sq ft to Pounds 280 a sq ft.
Lloyd's also announced that its council, or governing body, had nominated Mr
Robert Hiscox, chairman of Roberts &amp; Hiscox, a managing agency, and Mr
Stephen Merrett, a leading underwriter, to be deputy chairman to Mr Rowland.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Lords' ruling closes loophole in fraud prosecutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEGAL loophole preventing theft charges being brought in some cases of
alleged fraud was closed yesterday by the House of Lords.
By a majority of four to one, five law lords allowed an appeal by the
Director of Public Prosecutions against a Court of Appeal decision to quash
the conviction for theft of Mr Edwin Gomez, a shop manager.
The law lords' ruling is seen as having widespread implications for the
bringing of theft charges in cases of alleged white-collar crime.
After yesterday's ruling, theft charges could now be more easily brought
against dishonest company directors who persuade fellow directors to agree
to the transfer of assets, not knowing the improper purpose of the exercise.
Mr Gomez was originally convicted of the theft of electrical goods after
persuading his manager to accept cheques as payment from a Mr Jit Ballay
which he, Mr Gomez, knew to be stolen.
The appeal court quashed the theft conviction, ruling that since the shop
manager had authorised the transfer of the goods there could have been no
'appropriation' as required by the Theft Act.
After the ruling that the appeal court decision was wrong, Lord
Browne-Wilkinson said: 'The pillaging of companies by those who control them
is now all too common. It would offend both common sense and justice to hold
that the very control which enables such people to extract the company's
assets constitutes a defence to a charge of theft from the company.'
The decision may have implications for the prosecution brought by the
Serious Fraud Office against Mr Asil Nadir, the former chairman of Polly
Peck International.
Last June a High Court judge dismissed 46 charges of theft involving some
Pounds 119.5m against Mr Nadir after his counsel, Mr Anthony Scrivener QC,
had argued there was no evidence of appropriation of funds in connection
with transfers by Mr Nadir from PPI's bank to the account of a wholly owned
subsidiary, Unipac, or the Midland International account of the Industrial
Bank of Kibris, a bank owned by Mr Nadir.

FT  04 DEC 92 / 1,300 jobs to be shed at Royal Ordnance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL ORDNANCE, the armaments subsidiary of British Aerospace, yesterday
announced 1,300 job losses, the largest reduction since the company was
privatised in 1987.
The cuts, reflecting the general downturn in the defence business, affect 13
sites in England, Scotland and Wales and include management staff. Royal
Ordnance said it had to reduce its cost base to compete in the UK and
overseas.
An interim arrangement that guaranteed the company 80 per cent of certain
categories of ammunition purchases by the Ministry of Defence will end next
April. The company said it would be unable to sustain its present Pounds
550m annual turnover unless it increased its exports, now about 40 per cent
of its total business.
The latest cuts will reduce Royal Ordnance's workforce to about 6,100
against more than 15,000 when BAe bought the company from the government 5
1/2 years ago for Pounds 190m.
In the interim, the company has boosted its gun and ammunition businesses by
buying Sterling Armament and BMARC in the UK and Heckler &amp; Koch in Germany,
together employing more than 1,000.
Mr Jack Dromey, national secretary of the Transport and General Workers'
Union, said the cuts were 'a bitter pill we will not swallow'.
He claimed that union pressure had stopped the company from closing several
sites.
Royal Ordnance employees lobbied parliament on Wednesday amid union
predictions that up to 2,500 jobs might go, with the closure of three or
four plants. The company denied that it ever had such plans and hoped there
would not be further cuts. It said it planned to spend Pounds 40m next year
on capital investment and product development.
The US is to close four more military sites in the UK with the loss of at
least 81 civilian jobs. The bases are the US Marine Corps barracks in St
John's Wood, London; an airbase headquarters in High Wycombe, Bucks; and
contingency hospitals at Little Rissington, Glos, and Bicester, Oxon.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Post Office workforce to fall by 16,000 in five years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Post Office said yesterday it would reduce its workforce by more than
16,000 over the next five years, in the biggest reduction to date.
The move to scale down the corporation comes only weeks before the
government is expected to announce its conclusion of the review of the Post
Office's structure, which may lead to privatisation.
Mr Bill Cockburn, the Post Office's recently appointed chief executive,
denied that the planned job losses had anything to do with the government's
future plans for the corporation.
He said the Post Office wanted to set in motion a 'virtuous spiral' of
greater efficiency, improved services and low prices.
However, Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said: 'It is
also a dire warning of things to come if the government's so-called review
of the Post Office leads to privatisation.'
The Post Office said it intended to reduce its 200,000 strong workforce by
voluntary measures.
An official said 7,000 job losses last year were achieved with the agreement
of the workforce.
About 15,000 jobs will disappear from Royal Mail, the Post Office's letters
division, with a further 1,200 from Post Office Counters, which handles
social security payments and sell post office stationery.
In London, where the Post Office has suffered more severely in the
recession, 2,100 jobs will go next year, leading to a total reduction of
around 5,300 by March 1996.
Mr Cockburn said the Royal Mail job cuts were designed to increase
efficiency and secure the organisation's future.
The job cuts at Counters were aimed at driving out red tape, he said.
'What this is about is rationalising the overhead area to drive out red tape
and bureaucracy. It doesn't affect the number of post offices. That network
will be maintained.'
The number of Counters' administrative offices will be cut from 32 to seven.
The Welsh administrative office will be merged with one of the English
centres, but the Post Office will maintain its Welsh headquarters in
Cardiff.
The Parcelforce division has already gone through a major rationalisation
programme. The Post Office does not expect any 'dramatic' job losses in that
business.
Mr Cockburn said that the Post Office was planning on a growth rate in mail
deliveries of about 8 per cent or 9 per cent over the next five years.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Lender falls out with the modern generation: Bristol &amp;
West's proposal to back the nuclear family for mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Tony FitzSimons is worried about British society. 'There is a generation
that does not have the thrift mentality and does not fear losing their
homes,' he says. Unlike others who shake their heads at the ways of young
people, Mr FitzSimons is prompted by financial rather than moral concern.
Bristol &amp; West, the building society of which he is chief executive, has
fallen out badly with this generation in the past two years. After competing
with other lenders to sell mortgages in the overheated south-east housing
market of the late 1980s, it has paid the cost in the 1990s.
The society has suffered a wave of mortgage arrears and house repossessions
among its 190,000 borrowers. About 2.9 per cent of them were more than 12
months in arrears last year, the worst record of the top 25 societies. Its
half-year provision for bad debt quadrupled to Pounds 29.7m.
That is the reason why Mr FitzSimons is considering the bold step of pricing
mortgages by its assessment of the credit risk of borrowers. The policy will
mean that younger people, unmarried couples and, above all, young adults who
take out mortgages together will be charged more.
Mr FitzSimons says the move may be forced on Bristol &amp; West by its
experience of the past five years. The over-eager borrowers who were
encouraged by over-eager lenders in the 1980s have proved such a bad risk
that he believes it must discriminate in the future.
The underlying issue is that southern building societies lent in the 1980s
on the assumption that risk was largely covered by the boom in house prices.
Any repossessions would be covered by selling the property for a higher
price.
'We have not really examined people's ability to pay a debt over 25 years,'
Mr Fitz-Simons says. 'The fundamental tenet now should be that, rather than
the security value of the property.' Until now, societies have used only
people's income and the amount saved as a deposit as indicators.
That would change under Mr FitzSimons' proposal. Prospective borrowers would
be scored on various factors - most importantly age, marital status and
whether they have children - and the mortgage priced accordingly.
In spite of its unsettling implications, that was greeted with murmurs of
approval among societies yesterday. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of
Nationwide Building Society, said: 'Some growth in segmentation is
inevitable. We have to make more judgments about our borrowers.'
Mortgage rates have already started diverging to reflect risk.
In consequence, many young first-time buyers are being priced out of the
market. No society will now lend more than 95 per cent of the property
price, and higher rates of mortgage guarantee insurance in effect lower that
to about 93 per cent.
Bristol &amp; West's move raises the possibility that the mortgage market will
now become segmented according to family status. Yet there are sizeable
obstacles.
The first is social acceptability. Probably the most controversial aspect of
the proposal is its implication for the way people live. As Mr FitzSimons
admits, the lending criteria will favour the traditional nuclear family with
two children against young adults without family commitments.
There appear to be good financial reasons. Mr Fitz-Simons says the society
has found unmarried couples are 50 per cent more likely to fall into arrears
than married ones.
Even so, the society was forced somewhat on to the defensive yesterday.
After the disclosure, it issued a statement saying that any scheme 'will
have to be broadly acceptable in the mortgage marketplace', and young
families with special needs would be 'properly catered for'.
Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the Consumers Association, said
she accepted the principle of pricing for risk. However, she was concerned
that the society might breach the Sex Discrimination Act.
The second obstacle is that the pricing policy depends on past patterns of
behaviour continuing in the future. As Mr Melville-Ross of Nationwide puts
it: 'The experience of the past three years may be all that we have got to
go on, but it is not an ideal way of judging what will happen.'
The accuracy of Bristol &amp; West's pricing will depend on whether there has
been a long-term term shift in behaviour, or whether the late 1980s was a
blip. Mr FitzSimons argues that there has been a broad change in risk: 'We
are finding a lot of 'won't pays' as well as 'can't pays',' he says.
The final obstacle is whether the policy even makes sense for Bristol &amp;
West. Mr FitzSimons says
he regards with equanimity the prospect of high-risk borrowers taking
business elsewhere.
Yet Bristol &amp; West is burdened not only with bad debts but with an expensive
network of branches. Its cost-to-income ratio last year was 55.5 per cent -
the seventh-highest of the top 25 societies.
To keep the network profitable, he must keep new business flowing in what
will be a subdued mortgage market.
So there is some way to go before the mortgage market segments into pricing
according to demographic status. But whatever the outcome, it seems clear
that today's young adults will have to pay for the financial sins of their
carefree predecessors.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Ceiling on fees recommended to curb garrulous barristers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEFENDANTS and their lawyers may face heavy fines unless they disclose more
of their strategies in advance to judges, a consultation paper on ways to
shorten criminal trials suggests.
The paper, published yesterday, is by a working party set up by the Lord
Chancellor to consider reforms after cases such as the year-long Blue Arrow
trial.
Other ideas canvassed are to increase the powers of judges, introduce time
limits for trials and to pay lawyers fixed fees to discourage over-wordy
barristers.
A controversial measure suggested that judges should be given more powers to
order greater defence disclosure. 'Inadequate defence disclosure is seen by
many practitioners as a basic problem adding to the length of trials,' the
report says.
One option, it suggests, would be to order defendants to reveal a statement
of their cases in as much detail as the prosecution with a line-by-line
rebuttal of the case against them.
Sanctions for failing to make such disclosures might include financial
penalties on defendants and their lawyers and prevention of some
cross-examination of witnesses.
Other factors identified by the working group as responsible for over-long
trials include: the failure to identify key issues; inadequate procedural
rules; over-long indictments; verbose barristers; and the lack of a judge's
powers to control proceedings.
The report does not cover those issues relating to fraud trials being
considered by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, such as replacing
juries with tribunals, creating a general offence of fraud and introducing a
formal plea-bargaining system. Some defence lawyers yesterday expressed
concern that the report's suggestions, if implemented, might strengthen the
hand of prosecutors at the expense of defendants.
'This is the thin end of the wedge again,' said one QC, comparing the
suggestion for greater defence disclosure to the ending of the right to
silence for people interviewed by the Serious Fraud Office. Another
suggested that the failure of prosecutors to bring sharply focused cases
remained the main cause of over-long trials.
The report acknowledges the importance of prosecutors in ensuring trials
remain manageable, saying they bear the primary responsibility for deciding
the eventual shape and length of a case.
It criticises the Serious Fraud Office and Crown Prosecution Service for
past failures in not properly monitoring the effectiveness of barristers
they employed, although it notes that more attention is now being paid to
this.
The report, questioning whether trial judges have enough powers to manage
proceedings effectively, suggests that they should be allowed to set time
limits for the whole or parts of trials. It acknowledges that that would be
a 'radical departure from present practice' and admits strong arguments
exist against such a move.
Drawing on suggestions by Mr Justice Henry, the judge in charge of the first
two Guinness trials, it suggests the power of judges to exclude evidence
could be increased, as it is in the American federal legal system.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Housing market uncertain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S two largest building societies disagreed yesterday over whether
house prices were still falling or had started to rise after the latest
mortgage interest rate cuts.
Halifax, the country's largest society, with about a fifth of the mortgage
market, reported that house prices had risen by 0.1 per cent last month, the
first monthly increase recorded by the society since June.
Nationwide, its nearest rival, said prices had fallen on average by 2 per
cent in November, the second-largest monthly fall reported by the society
since October 1991.
The sharp difference between the monthly price surveys conducted by the
societies illustrates the uncertainty in the housing market after sterling's
withdrawal from the ERM in September.
Nationwide said yesterday: 'The number of transactions is very low at the
moment, so any movement tends to be exaggerated. It is very difficult,
therefore, to draw any firm conclusion from a single month's figures.'
Nationwide's survey was completed on November 23 while Halifax recorded
price movements until the end of the month. Indications from builders are
that sales, after a slow start to the month, picked up during the final week
of November, which may explain some of the difference between the two
societies' findings.
Halifax and Nationwide said that it would take time for the recent
reductions in interest rates to have an impact on the housing market.
Prospective buyers, they said, continued to be concerned about rising
unemployment and the state of the UK economy.
Halifax said: 'We would expect volume sales to increase by about 15 per cent
next year, in line with recent forecasts. Prices are much more difficult to
forecast and predictions range from another small fall to a small rise next
year. We would, however, expect prices to have begun to stabilise by the
second half of next year.'

<TEXT>
RICOH, the Japanese office equipment and camera maker, said yesterday it had
filed a patent infringement suit against Honeywell, the US technology
company that has aggressively sought to enforce its own patents in Japan for
autofocus cameras.
The suit is the latest in a series of trans-Pacific disputes over
intellectual property rights in which, more often than not, Japanese
companies have been accused of infringing on US patents. Increasingly,
however, Japanese companies are striking back.
On the same day that Ricoh said it had filed suit in New Jersey alleging
that Honeywell had infringed a patent on semiconductor sensors, it said it
had settled out of court with Honeywell in the dispute over autofocus
cameras.
Ricoh denied infringing on Honeywell's patents, but it said a reasonable
settlement was preferable to protracted and costly litigation. Although it
did not disclose the terms of the settlement, it said it would have no
material affect on the company's financial condition or operations.
Ricoh claims Honeywell sensors infringe a Ricoh patent for a semiconductor
device that enables high-precision and high-speed measurement of airflows.

company wins contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US telecommunications company MCI has begun work on a rudimentary telephone
system in Lebanon, the first significant US corporate involvement in
rebuilding the country's infrastructure since the civil war of the
mid-1970s.
A satellite-linked telephone network, with capacity for 5,000 lines, was
installed by MCI atop the post and telecoms building in Beirut last month.
It has also built an earth station linked to its own satellite and an
associated switch for telephone traffic.
The company is believed to be discussing a new telecoms system linking
Lebanon and Syria. This, like the Beirut installation, would be of political
as well as business importance given the influence Damascus wields over
Lebanon and the Bush administration's efforts to woo the Syrian government
since its participation in last year's Gulf war.
Siemens, the German electronics and engineering group, is already at work in
Damascus installing 700,000 telephone lines in a contract underwritten by
Qatari and Kuwaiti finance.
MCI said the Lebanese system, which guarantees connections for the 600-1,000
largest businesses and banks that need international links, takes the place
of hard-wire infrastructure and is 'the beginning of a new communications
network for the Lebanon'.
Mr Larry Codacovi, an MCI senior vice-president, said Lebanon's Council of
Ministers had issued a licence by decree last month. The value of the
initial contract is understood to be less than Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.6m).
Mr Codacovi added that MCI would pay the Lebanese authorities in hard
currency a share of revenues generated by the new system, with the
understanding that Lebanon would thus accumulate funds to buy equipment to
build a more permanent telecommunications infrastructure.
Although MCI is a service company that does not make equipment, it is hoping
to share in an eventual reconstruction of Lebanon's communications system.
But Mr Codacovi stressed he did not think Lebanon would be ready for
advanced services for about five years.
The estimated cost of rebuilding Lebanon's telecoms infrastructure is
Dollars 100m-Dollars 150m.

<TEXT>
THE International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which represents
record companies worldwide, and Philips, the Dutch consumer electronics
group, have reached an agreement on a method to combat music piracy using
digital technology.
The agreement between the federation and the inventor of the compact disc is
expected to help stem the loss of revenue to the recording industry
resulting from unauthorised copies of recordings on CDs, which the IFPI
estimates at 25m units worth up to Dollars 250m (Pounds 164m) in 1992.
Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding, Philips will introduce
codes into the manufacturing process that will make it possible to identify
the maker of a CD or Digital Compact Cassette, as well as the location and
equipment used. Philips is the licensor of CD and DCC, a tape launched in
autumn by the Dutch group.
For licensees of DCC, use of the identification codes will be mandatory.
The primary sources of unauthorised CDs are eastern Europe, South Korea and
Taiwan.
The concern over CD piracy comes when growth in the market has slowed in
Europe and the US.

FT  04 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Turkey under pressure to cancel Armenian
power deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey is under growing pressure to cancel a power supply deal recently
agreed with neighbouring Armenia after criticism from both Azerbaijan,
Ankara's ally in the Caucasus, and Turkish opposition parties, writes John
Murray Brown.
The Dollars 16.5m (Pounds 10.8m) deal signed two weeks ago in Ankara
envisages the transmission of Turkish power to Armenia through winter.
But the contract has angered Azerbaijan, which has been involved in a
four-year conflict over the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. Turkey's
main opposition party, the Motherland party (Anap), yesterday threatened a
parliamentary vote to censure the government over the contract, which it
claims is jeopardising Turkey's solidarity with the Turkic states of the
Caucasus and central Asia.
Ankara fears that, without the power supply, Armenia might restart its
nuclear plant close to the Turkish border. The deal, under which Turkey is
to supply Armenia with 300m kW/hrs of energy from December to April, is also
part of efforts to restore full political relations and resolve a border
dispute.
Turkey has initiated several regional power projects in an attempt to win
over its troublesome neighbours - despite projections by the Turkish
electricity utility Tek of energy shortfalls by 1994.

exporters
</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC hopes to reach accords on oilseeds with nine smaller exporting
countries by mid-December, following settlement of its dispute with the US
last month, officials said yesterday. The move, announced at the annual
meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva, was
welcomed by the countries involved.
The US estimates that the nine, which include Brazil, Argentina, Canada,
Poland and Pakistan, may have lost trade worth Dollars 1bn (Pounds 658m) a
year because of the EC's oilseeds subsidy regime, in addition to the Dollars
1bn lost by American farmers.
Negotiations under Gatt auspices were broken off last September when the US
and others rejected as inadequate EC offers of compensation for trade
losses. The US/EC deal, the legal details of which have yet to be settled,
according to US officials, does not directly cover other oilseeds suppliers.
Meanwhile, trade officials from the 108 countries taking part in the Uruguay
Round of global trade talks are gearing up for an intensive schedule of
bilateral and multilateral meetings designed to produce a final package of
agreements by the end of the year.
There is a widespread belief that Japan and South Korea will not hold out
against liberalisation of rice imports, which could otherwise prove a big
stumbling block now that the US and EC have largely settled their farm trade
differences.
European suggestions that US 'section 301' legislation for unilateral trade
action could provoke a confrontation were yesterday played down. 'We are
willing to enter into an agreement that would commit us all to an effective
and binding set of multilateral rules with multilateral enforcement,' said
Mr Rufus Yerxa, US Gatt ambassador.
Mr Andras Szepesi, Hungary's Gatt ambassador, is to be chairman of Gatt's
governing council next year, the first official from a former Communist
country to hold such an influential position in Gatt.

   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S President Itamar Franco began two days of meetings yesterday to
decide whether the country's largest privatisation should go ahead this
month, Christina Lamb writes from Rio de Janeiro.
The National Steel Company (CSN) is to be sold on December 22 for at least
Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.05bn) but Mr Franco has expressed considerable
doubts about the sale, and about the whole privatisation process.
Brazil's stock markets fell yesterday on fears of a delay. Last month Mr
Franco cancelled the sale of Ultrafertil, a fertiliser company, just 90
minutes before the auction was due to start, causing Mr Marcos Vianna,
vice-president of the National Development Bank, which oversees the
programme, to resign in anger.
The CSN auction could attract sizeable foreign investment. Among those
interested are the construction company Andrade Gutierrez and a German
consortium involving steelmaker Thyssen.
The sale is sensitive because of CSN's emotional significance as a symbol of
Brazil's economic development.
Mr Franco's talks will include Mr Paulino Cicero, mines and energy minister
and, like the president, a past opponent of privatisation, Mr Roberto
Procopio, CSN's president who strongly favours the sale, and Mr Jose de
Castro, Mr Franco's legal adviser who recommended the Ultrafertil
cancellation.
Analysts believe the CSN sale may be put off until March when Mr Franco is
expected to introduce rules stipulating that 30 per cent of any bids must be
in cash. Currently most purchases have been made using 'rotten currencies',
domestic debt swapped at par; less than 1 per cent of the Dollars 4bn raised
so far is in cash.

FT  04 DEC 92 / US health reform backed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN A significant reversal yesterday the Health Insurance Association of
America, representing 270 commercial insurance companies, endorsed the
principle of universal health coverage, coupled with cost controls and a
limit to the tax-free status of health care benefits.
The move serves to confirm that the ice is finally breaking in efforts to
reform the US health-care system, with some of the most powerful groups in
the health industry beginning to accept solutions that go directly against
their own interests.
Although health-care reform was a central plank this year in the campaign of
President-elect Bill Clinton, many observers believed fundamental reforms
would be obstructed by the conflicting claims of health insurers, doctors,
businesses, local governments and those who are left out of the current
system.
Most US citizens have health insurance provided by their employer, tax
deductible for employers and excluded from taxation for the employee.
A meeting organised by the National Governors Association and involving
local government and business representatives this week endorsed limiting
this tax-free status.
Critics argue that the tax exemption had helped allow inflation in the
medical industry, because neither employer nor employee is fully sensitised
to the costs of their health care.
At the same time, the estimated Dollars 25bn (Pounds 16bn) that could be
raised by taxing health care benefits above a certain basic level would help
to pay for coverage of those currently left out.
Businesses have in general remained firmly opposed to limiting the
employer's deduction, but Mr Thomas Pyle, a director of the American
Business Conference and a participant in the meeting, reluctantly concurred.
'I don't think any business group is enthusiastic about capping
deductibility and I think that most groups would prefer to see a reduction
in the amount that's exempt from taxation rather than capping deductibility.
But the bottom line is we end up feeling comfortable with this as a step
towards pushing down on costs in health care,' he said.
Yesterday's HIAA policy statement also favoured limiting the tax exclusion
on health care benefits for employees, and backed greater government
involvement in overseeing the prices charged by doctors and hospitals.
These new proposals may not fit exactly with Mr Clinton's plans for reform,
many of whose details remain unclear but health-care specialists believe
there are now clear signs of a reform consensus beginning to coalesce.

AS a tuberculosis epidemic spreads in the US, the New York Public Health
Research Institute yesterday announced an unusual collaboration between the
public and private sectors to research the most deadly strain of the
disease, multiple drug resistant TB.
A new centre, devoted to TB research, will concentrate on this strain,
looking at DNA fingerprinting, DNA patterns and drug resistance.
New cases of TB, which seemed close to eradication in the US in the
mid-1970s, increased more than 40 per cent between 1985 and 1990, and the
growth rate shows no signs of slowing. Factors contributing to TB's spread
include drug addiction, homelessness, overcrowded prisons with antiquated
ventilation systems and the susceptibility of HIV-positive patients.
According to the New York City Department of Health, nearly 25 per cent of
first-time TB patients were resistant to one or more drugs, and nearly 50
per cent of previously treated patients were resistant.
Participants in the centre include Pfizer, Hoffmann-La Roche and Lederle
Laboratories.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Paraguay's unimagined renaissance: The generals cannot stop
what they started
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DICTATORS and generals have ruled Paraguay for all its 181 years as an
independent nation. A general may still rule Paraguay today, but an
extraordinary renaissance is under way. A free press, an independent
judiciary, reasonably fair elections and a new constitution are bringing
Paraguayans unimagined liberties.
So great are these freedoms and the enthusiasm of the Paraguayan media in
raking up the disgraceful past of top government figures, that the 56-year
hegemony of the army and the ruling Colorado party is now at risk.
To his fury, President Andres Rodriguez, the general who toppled General
Alfredo Stroessner in a 1989 military coup, has been barred from standing
for re-election under Paraguay's new constitution.
Promises by Gen Rodriguez - himself closely identified with the Stroessner
regime that lasted 35 years - to introduce democratic reforms were met with
disbelief at first. However, he took to heart warnings from Washington,
Brasilia and Buenos Aires, that they would not tolerate any more
dictatorship.
The army and the Asuncion civilian elite assumed, though, that they would
not be held responsible for misdeeds committed under Gen Stroessner.
However, in August the opposition newspaper ABC Color reported that senior
army officers, including the army chief of staff, were involved in
trafficking in stolen cars.
ABC Color's reports were followed by more corruption stories and the
indictment of senior army and police officers. Says Mr Edwin Britez,
political editor: 'The military were still a taboo subject then. They had a
blank cheque from society that was thought necessary during the transition
to a new government.'
The transition to democracy will only be complete after Paraguay holds
presidential elections in May 1993 and Gen Rodriguez hands over power three
months later. The Colorados are holding primary elections to choose a
presidential candidate, but bitter infighting among the candidates, plus
daily revelations of corruption, now mean that an opposition figure could
win a presidential election for the first time in Paraguay's history.
Mr Domingo Laino, a courageous if eccentric opponent of 'Stroessnerismo' and
candidate for the Authentic Liberal Radical party, stands to gain most from
the disarray.
Even Gen Rodriguez is unable to halt a liberalisation process he started,
even if he never imagined the consequences it would bring.
However, there is no sign of long overdue land reform, a few wealthy and
powerful businessmen retain great influence, corruption and smuggling are
widespread and the police are still notoriously thuggish. Washington is
concerned over Paraguay's role as a corridor for cocaine shipments and money
laundering.
Although the transition to democracy is proceeding reasonably well, the
transition to a market-based economy is less smooth. True, the government's
technocratic economic team has opened and deregulated the economy - and
delivered South America's lowest annual inflation rate of 16 per cent.
The problem is that a business class more used to bootlegging contraband to
Argentina and Brazil or living off financial speculation and cosy
government-supported cartels is not ready to cope with economic reform. In
March 1991 Paraguay, together with Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, formed
Mercosur, a nascent common market that is already putting local businesses
under pressure.
Mr Jose Abreu, a member of the Union Industrial Paraguaya, which represents
manufacturers, admits that 'the traditional (business) mentality that does
not want change is a majority. Paraguay's strong businessmen got rich with
the government, not the market.'
However, he consoles himself that 'traditional people are older, they are
dying out. Change will come, it's just a question of speed.'
But sandwiched between the supremely efficient agricultural producer
Argentina and the stumbling giant Brazil, Paraguay's outlook is, at best,
mixed. This became brutally clear in October when Argentina retaliated
against Brazilian exports with a 10 per cent tax on all its imports, hitting
Paraguay in the crossfire.
As a mainly agricultural economy with an exploding birth rate, Paraguay
desperately needs growth. About 50,000 teenagers enter the labour market
every year. Investment equivalent to USDollars 1bn a year is needed to
provide jobs for them. However, the economy is stagnant and investment low.
Paraguayans are realising that their staple exports of cotton, soyabeans and
're-exports' of contraband consumer goods to neighbouring countries are no
recipe for sustained, balanced development. The trouble is that they have
yet to find a new strategy to pay their way in the world.

<TEXT>
HONG KONG'S small group of independent legislators, whose votes will decide
the outcome of Governor Chris Patten's proposals for more democracy in the
colony, are dismayed at the breakdown in relations between Britain and
China.
Yesterday's statement by the Chinese Foreign Ministry questioning the future
of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, shocked local politicians.
Mr Simon Ip, who represents the legal profession in a specially allocated
seat on the Legislative Council, said China's tactics 'were aimed at
rattling the Hong Kong people' so they would turn against Mr Patten's
proposals.
'I have not heard an argument why it is that Mr Patten's proposals are not
in accord with the Joint Declaration or the Basic Law,' he said.
Professor Andrew Wong, an elected but independent legislator who served on
Lord Wilson's Executive Council, said the people of Hong Kong felt
intimidated by China's actions and feared an economic slump.
'I think the people are now willing to yield to China,' he said. 'But if
China overplays its hand there could be a contrary reaction and the people
may rally behind Mr Patten.'
Mr Ip concurred. 'The longer China turns the screw the more likely it is
that the people will bend, like it or not.'
Both men urged Britain and China to return to the negotiating table, but
said in the current circumstances the prospects of that happening were
bleak. Neither politician, however, thought it would be a good idea for Mr
Patten to back down.
'If Mr Patten withdraws he will be delivering the rule of Hong Kong to
China,' said Prof Wong. 'He cannot do that.'
Mr Ip said Hong Kong could just not 'capitulate'. But he urged the governor
to change the way he presents his views. He said Mr Patten should adopt a
softer attitude and 'give some indication that he is prepared to repair the
damage' that has been caused.
He said the 'word going round' was that China was not prepared to deal with
Mr Patten. 'The question is whether they will be prepared to deal with Mr
Major,' he said.
Prof Wong said the governor should be less abrasive. 'They Chinese regard
him as being arrogant,' he said.
He said a possible way out of the difficulties would be if Legco could agree
a compromise package on political reform.

FT  04 DEC 92 / HK falls to China's market force: The fallout from Beijing's
row with colony's governor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is one word, and only one, that has been the force behind the Hong
Kong stock market this year: China.
The promise of the riches expected to flow from China's embrace of market
economics pushed the Heng Seng index to an all-time high of 6,447.11 three
weeks ago.
The fear of China's retribution for what it, and many in Hong Kong, see as
Governor Chris Patten's impudence in promoting democracy, is what brought
the index down to yesterday's close of 4,978.12 - a fall of 8 per cent on
the day and nearly 23 per cent down from the peak on November 12.
For a brief period last month, when the market kept on rising in the face of
daily, tougher rhetoric from China, it was possible to ask the question: had
the Hong Kong market been fundamentally re-rated because economics, not
politics, had come to matter more?
Attractive as that was to contemplate, the events of the past two weeks have
shown that Hong Kong is as 'political' a market, subject to the tenor of
relations between Britain and China, as ever it was.
So the questions being asked in Hong Kong's financial circles now are: Where
is the bottom? And what are the implications for Hong Kong's economy?
What has unsettled the market most this week is that no one knows the
boundaries of the conflict in which Britain and China are now locked.
History may be a guide. Past crises - such as the October 1987 stock market
crash, and the more localised reaction to the June 4 1989 Tiananmen massacre
 -suggest that the market reaches bottom when its prospective price/earnings
ratio as a whole reaches 6 to 7 times future earnings.
According to Mr Archie Hart, head of research at Crosby Securities, a local
brokerage, that would, in the worst case scenario, put the Heng Seng index
somewhere between 4,000 and 4,500, assuming 20 per cent earnings next year -
a fall of a further 10 to 20 per cent on yesterday's close. 'That's the real
base if all hell breaks loose,' he said.
Investors who bought Hong Kong equities at the beginning of the year were,
by yesterday's close, still more than 15 per cent ahead. If the political
atmosphere enveloping the market continues to deteriorate then many of them
may decide to take their profits.
Today the market may well have judged that all hell had broken loose. Late
yesterday China again raised the issue of future adherence to the 1984
Sino-British Joint Declaration - the cornerstone of Hong Kong's security.
In spite of the palpable uncertainty in Hong Kong, not a few analysts were
pointing out the artificiality of it all.
Nothing, they said, has changed the fundamentals. Corporate earnings growth
this year is expected to be between 20 and 25 per cent; the market is
working on 20 per cent for next year. The reason is simple: the Hong Kong
economy is expected to grow by 6 per cent in real terms next year, up from 5
per cent this year.
China - that word again - is the main reason for this bullish outlook. It is
expected to grow by more than 10 per cent in 1993. Guangdong, the province
bordering Hong Kong and the most dynamic economy in China, may grow by 12
per cent or more.
As Mrs Janice Wallace, head of research at Goldman Sachs, pointed out: 'The
fundamentals are still very strong. Unlike June 1989, corporate earnings are
on an upswing and GDP growth is accelerating. Also, this is a political
dispute; there are no tanks in the street.'
She is not alone in expecting a surge in share prices when the political
dispute is resolved. Mr Hart said Crosby is advising long-term funds to stay
in the market, although short-term performance-sensitive funds are being
encouraged to quit Hong Kong for Malaysia and Thailand.
Mrs Wallace said: 'I still believe that, 12 months out for those who buy
now, the rewards will be great.' However, 'no one wants to catch a falling
knife'.
But the real risk to the market and business is a protracted brawl between
Britain and China. No one has yet downgraded earnings or economic growth
forecasts on the basis of the current crisis, but if it continues for long
they will. The market is already pointing to potential problems in the
industrials and retail sectors. Both have fallen faster relative to the
overall decline in prices this week. The reason, analysts say, is that
people will be less likely to buy flats, consumer goods and cars if the row
is maintained at its current level for much longer.
The property sector in Hong Kong was worst hit in 1982-83 when Britain and
China went through a similar trial of strength and the markets took the
strain.
The difference now, analysts say, is that the financial strength of the
property companies could not be better.
In the early 1980s these companies were highly geared and had to dump
property to raise cash. This time, property companies have virtually no debt
and are well placed to weather a fall-off in transactions.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Zimbabwe wins Dollars 1.4bn from west
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN nations have agreed to provide Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 920m) of
grants, soft loans and commercial loans to Zimbabwe next year, to help the
country steer its economic reform programme through the worst drought in
living memory.
The package was agreed yesterday at a meeting of 15 country donors organised
by the World Bank, to which Mr Bernard Chidzero, finance minister, outlined
Zimbabwe's progress in slimming its bloated public sector, dismantling price
controls and encouraging the growth of private enterprise.
Western donors had feared that Zimbabwe would be unable to stick to the
programme because of the drought and recession, and were understood to have
set strict conditions for their help.
The package meets all Zimbabwe's needs for outside finance over the next
year. Of the total, 80 per cent is made up of loans and 20 per cent grants.
Within this the government plans to borrow just under 15 per cent - Dollars
200m - on normal commercial terms, bridging finance to cover the period
between aid allocation and payment.
Mr Chidzero said the drought had forced the economy into unexpected decline
this year, but stressed that the reforms were nevertheless going ahead as
planned. 'The people understand what needs to be done,' he said.
Government spending had been curbed from 53 per cent of gross domestic
product two years ago to less than 47 per cent now. That includes the 18 to
20 per cent of GDP which the state will have spent this year on importing
and distributing food to the drought-hit areas. 'So if you remove the
drought, government spending comes even lower,' said Mr Chidzero.
Spending had been cut in nearly all government departments, except for
education, health and defence. Mr Chidzero hoped that recent South African
incursions into Zimbabwean airspace would not hold up his plans for cuts in
the defence budget.

FT  04 DEC 92 / France offers troops for Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday offered to make a substantial contribution to a United
Nations military force in Somalia.
It is expected to contribute 2,000 men - half from its base in neighbouring
Djibouti and half from France - under command arrangements resembling the
Gulf war's Desert Storm operation.
French troops will be nominally under UN auspices, but effectively under US
command. The US has offered 20,000 men to protect famine relief supplies.
France may ask the US to airlift light French tanks to the area, while the
French base at Djibouti may in turn be used by American forces. President
Francois Mitterrand yesterday telephoned President George Bush, before
leaving for the Franco-German summit in Bonn.
A statement from the Elysee Palace said the French contribution was to help
'put an end to the intolerable situation prevailing in Somalia, where rival
warlords have been pillaging relief supplies'. Earlier this autumn French
schools collected a large amount of rice for Somalia, but little has got
through to starving Somalis. At the UN Security Council session last night
France was expected to pronounce itself in favour of 'firm and determined'
international action.
According to the Liberation newspaper, France plans to lobby for one of its
citizens to get the post of military adviser to the UN secretary-general, in
recognition of France's growing contribution to UN operations. It has 4,000
troops in Yugoslavia and 1,500 in Cambodia.
In Washington, although the use of force appears to command general public
and political support, some have voiced opposition.
Congressman John Murtha, who wields considerable power on defence issues as
chairman of the House of Representatives appropriations subcommittee that
decides the defence budget, complained yesterday that US intervention in
Somalia could be a precedent for demands in a host of other countries.
'This is a fundamental change in the direction of what we've done in
military policy for years. It's always been based on threat in the past,
it's always been based on national interests,' he said.
'We can only do so much. We cannot be the policeman of the world,' Mr Murtha
added.
Other influential members of Congress have backed intervention in Somalia,
but are wary of entering an open-ended commitment.
'The important thing is that we have a clear mission. . . that our military
people know exactly what they are supposed to do and we'll know when we have
succeeded,' said Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate armed services
committee.
Reuter adds from Addis Ababa: Mr Jan Eliasson, UN under-secretary for
humanitarian affairs, said yesterday he doubted that Mr Mohamed Farah
Aideed, Somalia's most belligerent warlord, would obstruct plans to deploy
the US-led troops.
'We have no reason to be concerned that Aideed would be against the
accelerated delivery of humanitarian assistance,' Mr Eliasson said after a
meeting of Somali clan leaders and western donors.
Mr Aideed stayed away from the three-day conference.

<TEXT>
THE African National Congress yesterday condemned Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi's plan for autonomy in Natal province, which is rapidly emerging
as a stumbling block to multi-party negotiations on a new constitution.
The ANC said yesterday it would boycott any referendum called to test the
plan, under which the KwaZulu black homeland and white-run Natal would form
a new state with strong autonomous powers within a federal South Africa. But
Chief Buthelezi, leader of the mainly Zulu Inkatha party, brushed aside
condemnation from the government and the ANC and said he would proceed with
the poll nonetheless.
The ANC said Chief Buthelezi's purpose was to sabotage national
negotiations. The chief 'has chosen the path of conflict and confrontation
which can lead to intensified violence,' it said, adding that his plan
amounted to 'enforced balkanisation on the model of the apartheid past'.
Meanwhile, the ANC and the government met for a second day at a secret venue
for constitutional talks, while the radical Pan Africanist Congress Youth
League threatened to kill whites if PAC leaders were arrested in connection
with the murder of four whites in a terrorist attack at a golf club last
weekend.
The PAC's armed wing has claimed responsibility for the attack.

UNITA rebels attacked Sumbe, another Angolan provincial capital, yesterday

of renewed civil war, Reuter reports from Luanda.
Police maintained control after more than two hours of fighting at Sumbe,
capital of central Cuanza Sul province, the new armed forces commander,
General Joao de Matos, told Reuters.
Diplomats said the conflict appeared to be part of Unita's drive to seize
provincial capitals and isolate Luanda.
There was no immediate response from Unita on the MPLA's offer of minor
posts in the new administration which is headed by Mr Marcolino Moco, prime
minister, who is a former secretary general of the MPLA.

FT  04 DEC 92 / 'If we have to suffer, it is preferable to being ruled by
the hypocritical British'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE anxiety on Hong Kong's streets yesterday was visible. Shaking heads in
disbelief, people lingered by bank screens watching the falling stock
market.
The market may have seen the biggest one-day fall since the June 1989
Tiananmen killings, but the talk of the town was of politics, perfidious
Albion and the strange ways of China.
Hong Kong may be a British colony but it is emphatically a Chinese city. The
result of Governor Chris Patten's proposals has been to divide Hong Kong
society. That division has produced strong reactions among a people adverse
to venting their anger, especially in public.
At what would normally have been a sedate business lunch yesterday, one
senior Chinese executive of a large Hong Kong property company lost control,
to general astonishment. He said the people of Hong Kong had taken so much
flak from Britain and China over the past 14 years. 'What does he think he
is doing now with so little time to go? China is changing; it has embraced
the market economy; it wants its people to get rich; Hong Kong can play a
key role in that. All we want is a quiet life.'
On the streets of Central, the main business, retail and tourist district on
Hong Kong island, Hong Kong Chinese vented their dismay and anger, but not
all oppose the governor's stand.
An assistant hotel manager declared himself for Mr Patten. 'I support
Patten's proposals because I think Hong Kong people should have the freedom
to decide what they want. That there are more protests now shows people are
beginning to know better what sort of society Hong Kong is and recognise
what their needs are.
'I think business people might not want changes because they do not want
what they are enjoying to be taken away. They are considering their own
interests.'
Ms Ella Kwok, a nurse, is also a strong supporter of the governor. An
investor in the stock market, who has seen more than a fifth of the value of
her shares wiped out in three weeks, she believes China is to blame.
'They should not say things like the statements made concerning the
container terminal and the airport contract. I think the governor is doing
everything for Hong Kong people's long-term interests.
'If one side has to back down, I hope it is not the governor.
'He has more guts than the other governors before him. I hope he can stand
firm.'
The worsening relations between Britain and China has stirred anti-British
sentiment within Hong Kong - something never far from the surface. Among
some people, China's staunch opposition to the governor is seen as repaying
the indignity of colonialism.
'I think China is right,' said one secretary. 'The British have lived well
in Hong Kong for a long time and they need to be put in their place.'
One hears echoes of these sentiments on the streets. Ms Chow, an office
administrator, is in no doubt about Mr Patten.
'I do not like Patten or what he is doing. I think he is making Hong Kong a
mess,' she said. 'He is doing everything for himself. It is naive to believe
that Britain has Hong Kong people's interest at heart; they enjoy the notion
of doling out democracy. If we have to suffer, it is preferable to being
ruled by the hypocritical British.'
A civil servant who gave his name as Mr Ho said the governor had gone too
far and should back down. 'When he deals with China, he should go one step
at a time,' he said. 'Hong Kong is still not used to his way of doing
things. I do not think China wants to do this but is forced to.'
Throughout the day, however, the overwhelming call was for Britain and China
to sit down and talk. This view was given expression by a housewife who
said: 'The two sides should sit down calmly and talk about what is good for
Hong Kong, what is good for its economy. They should look at the agreements
again or find a middle way to solve the problem.'
She also made the saddest observation on the fall-out from the controversy.
'I have lost confidence that Hong Kong will change for the better.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese economy is slipping dangerously close to outright recession,
according to government figures published yesterday which show the economy
contracting at 1.6 per cent a year in the three months to the end of
September.
The Economic Planning Agency, giving its figures for real gross national
product in the third quarter, said the outcome was down 0.4 per cent from
the previous quarter, largely because public spending failed to offset sharp
declines in corporate investment and sluggish consumption.
The most worrying aspect of the figures was a significant fall in public
investment despite the government's decision in March to bring forward
capital spending programmes. Public investment, which is the main engine of
domestic demand growth in an otherwise stagnant economy, fell by 2.7 per
cent in the third quarter to Y34,145bn (Pounds 180bn).
The worse than expected figures open what will be an intense fortnight in
which policymakers have to take crucial decisions about how to stave off
recession.
Both the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan maintain publicly that no
further easing of policy is yet justified. However, they are likely to come
under mounting political pressure to stimulate the economy. A string of
business leaders yesterday called on the government to cut taxes next year
to prevent a recession.
The supplementary budget needed to enact the Y10,700bn emergency spending
programme announced in August is likely to pass through the parliament next
week. Details of the 1993 budget are likely to be finalised the week after
that for publication over Christmas.
The Finance Ministry is predicting a rise in public spending of only about 1
per cent because tax revenues have fallen steeply. As yet it has shown no
signs of bowing to political pressure for tax cuts.
Speculation that the worse than expected performance in the third quarter
will lead to a further cut in interest rates will be fanned next week when
the Bank of Japan is expected to release a gloomy quarterly survey on the
state of the economy.
The Japanese parliament's lower house yesterday took a step towards reducing
the large imbalance in favour of sparsely populated rural constituencies in
the country's electoral system by approving the reallocation of
parliamentary seats.
Votes in the least populated seats are worth more than three times as much
as a vote in the most populated seats.
The bill will add an extra seat to nine electoral districts in densely
populated urban areas, while one seat will be removed from 10 less populated
districts. This will reduce the discrepancy.
The bill also includes 17 measures designed to meet public criticism of
corruption in political fundraising in the wake of the Sagawa Kyubin
scandal.
The LDP is expected next week to publish details of more comprehensive
electoral reform. This may include proposals to replace large multi-member
constituencies with smaller single-member ones.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Ford may cut Euro workforce by 10%: Heavy financial losses
are forcing the company to restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD, the US car maker, is expected to announce shortly a wave of
redundancies at its European plants with the elimination of several thousand
jobs.
The company, which has fallen heavily into loss in the second half of this
year following a record loss in 1991, is preparing a series of restructuring
measures which could include a cut of around 10 per cent of the workforce of
its European automotive operations which currently totals around 97,400.
In the UK a planned ballot by trade unions at Ford plants for industrial
action against compulsory redundancies and a cut in lay-off pay will
probably be postponed until January to take account of the next wave of job
cuts.
In the UK Ford has already had two rounds of jobs cuts this year with 2,100
redundancies announced in February and 1,550 in September.
Ford said yesterday that it was being forced to cut production at all its
European vehicle assembly plants during December in the face of continuing
weak sales and excess stocks.
The company, which has slipped to fifth place in the west European new car
market, has announced sweeping production cuts at its assembly plants in
Germany, the UK, Belgium and Spain as well as at several of its main
components plants.
At Genk in Belgium, which produces the Sierra, there will be no car output
after December 11 with the elimination of 12 production days, while output
of the Transit van there will stopped on six days.
Output of the Ford Fiesta and Scorpio cars at Cologne, Germany, is to be
halted for four days during December, while production of gearboxes will be
stopped for eight days.
Production of the Escort will be stopped for three days at the Saarlouis
plant in Germany, while output of the Escort at Ford's Halewood plant in the
UK will be stopped for seven days together with the elimination of four
night shifts. The Fiesta car assembly plant at Dagenham will be closed for
five days and the night shift will be cut on four more days.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Calls grow for tough action against Serbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SARAJEVO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE worsening plight of Bosnia's Moslem population is putting increasing
pressure on the international community for firmer action, including
military measures, against the Bosnian Serbs.
The Islamic countries, in particular, have stepped up their campaign for the
use of force against the Bosnian Serbs, whose 'ethnic cleansing' campaign
has been responsible for the deaths or expulsion from their homes of tens of
thousands of Moslems. Their outrage was expressed at a meeting of the
50-member Organisation of the Islamic Conference in Jeddah, which ended in
the early hours of yesterday morning with a call to the United Nations
Security Council to review the situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina and the
implementation of relevant UN resolutions before January 15.
The more militant of the Islamic countries, such as Iran, are urging the UN
to lift its embargo on arms deliveries to Bosnian Moslems and have even said
they are ready to send troops to Bosnia, albeit 'within the framework of
international law'.
Such concern is being treated very seriously by western governments, who
fear a spread of the Bosnian conflict to Kosovo and Macedoniaif the Serbs
are not kept in check.
If that happened, a general Balkan conflagration, with the participation of
neighbouring countries such as Greece and Turkey, to say nothing of Moslem
countries from outside the region, would be difficult to avoid. Even so,
most western governments continue to be opposed to full-scale military
intervention in Bosnia.
The reasons for this reluctance were summed up by the British foreign and
defence secretaries, Mr Douglas Hurd and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, yesterday. Mr
Hurd stressed a political solution could not be imposed by the use of
outside military force.
Mr Rifkind said he believed that 'tens of thousands, probably over 100,000,
would almost certainly be exposed to very heavy casualty and would be
unlikely to bring peace,' Mr Rifkind said.
If that is also the opinion of the other western powers - what are the
alternatives to be discussed at the emergency conference on Bosnia in Geneva
on December 16?
International sanctions imposed by the UN can still be tightened further,
but no one believes that this alone will change Serbia's policies.
The one military measure that appears to be acceptable to all the western
countries, is the enforcement of the 'no-fly' zone over Serbia, imposed by
the UN last October.
Although no violations of the flying ban by Serb fixed-wing aircraft have
been reported, the UN has become increasingly concerned that the Serbs are
using helicopters to transport their senior military officers throughout
Bosnia.
Any decision to shoot down Serb planes violating the ban would have to be
authorised by another UN resolution. The original reservations of several
members of the Security Council, including Britain and France, have been
swept away by the growing realisation that tougher action is necessary.
Other more imaginative steps, including perhaps the creation of safe havens
for Moslems on the northern Iraq model, will have to complement such a
limited military measure as the enforcement of the 'no-fly' zone, if Islamic
countries are to be satisfied.
UN peace-keepers halted all flights for 48 hours yesterday after a plane
carrying their commander in Bosnia was hit by gunfire, Reuter reports from
Sarajevo.
The UN said nobody was hurt and the plane carrying Major General Philippe
Morillon landed safely. British troops also came under mortar fire in the
town of Turbe but no-one was hurt. Heavy fighting raged throughout Bosnia
yesterday. The Sarajevo crisis centre reported 41 killed and 118 wounded in
the past 24 hours.

FIREFIGHTERS in the northern Spanish port of La Coruna were struggling
yesterday to contain a blaze on the Greek-registered tanker Aegean Sea which
ran aground entering the harbour yesterday morning, spilling thousands of
tonnes of crude oil into the sea from its shattered hull, Peter Bruce
reports from Madrid.
The tanker, whose captain has been held for questioning, was carrying 80,000
tonnes of North Sea crude. It grounded in bad weather while approaching a
refinery owned by the Repsol oil company. All 29 crew were taken off the
vessel, which was rocked by large explosions, sending a pall of smoke over
the city (pictured left). It was unclear how many of the nine segregated
storage tanks have been ruptured. Ecologists said they feared the spillage
would cause extensive damage to the area.

<TEXT>
MR Milan Panic, Yugoslav prime minister, yesterday rejected as 'insane' a
decision by Serbia's electoral commission to turn down his candidacy for the
Serbian presidency, Reuter reports from Belgrade. Opposition parties
threatened to boycott the elections on December 20 if the decision was not
revoked and they accused the authorities of trying to rig the result by
tampering with voter lists.
The electoral commission said Mr Panic was ineligible because he had not
lived in Serbia for the past year as required by law.
'It is insane. It is unfair. Above all, it is unconstitutional,' Mr Panic
said. 'I will not accept such a slap to democracy.' He added: 'It is clear
today that those who rule Serbia are afraid of free and honest elections.'
The decision was absurd, he said. 'I am the prime minister of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia since 1992. How is it possible that a prime minister
of Yugoslavia does not fulfil requirements to run for Serbian presidency?'
Serbia and Montenegro are the only republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
Mr Panic, a 62-year-old emigre businessman from the US, formally launched
his campaign on Tuesday with a promise to stop bloodshed in former Yugoslav
republics and end Serbia's international isolation.
A spokesman for the electoral commission said he had 48 hours to appeal
against the decision, which would end his attempt to remove Mr Slobodan
Milosevic, his hardline nationalist rival, from the Serbian leadership.
His aides said he fulfilled residency requirements because he had rented a
Belgrade apartment for more than a year. But the commission spokesman said
Mr Panic was a foreign citizen at the time.

PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin, has proposed a sweeping increase in his powers over
the economy, virtually excluding the Russian parliament from any competence
in the field.
A resolution released yesterday by Mr Yeltsin's office to be put to the
Congress of People's deputies later this week or next, and now the subject
of furious behind the scenes debate and negotiation, would also give Mr
Yeltsin the right to appoint the government and to make the final judgment
on all legislation proposed by the parliament. The proposal, in effect,
would usher in a system of presidential rule in most areas of government.
However, the draft resolution is being treated as a bargaining ploy rather
than a fixed intention, and is the subject of discussions between the
parliamentary factions and between the president, the government and the
powerful Civic Union group.
Mr Vassily Lipitsky, leader of the Free Russia party within the Civic Union,
said yesterday 'everything was open for negotiation' on the president's
powers.
A series of constitutional changes proposed by the deputies will be tabled
today - one of which will give parliament the right to veto not just the
prime minister, but all the deputy prime ministers and the main cabinet
ministers as well. In a fierce argument about whether or not the debate on
these constitutional points should be open or closed, liberal and hardline
deputies resorted to exchanging blows and wrestling at the base of the
podium last night.
This scene involved Mr Vladimir Varov, a liberal deputy, trading ineffectual
punches with Mr Ilya Constantinov, a leading nationalist.
It is now clear that both Mr Yeltsin and Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime
minister, have decided to show a determined face to a hostile Congress which
so far hasfailed to display a united resolve in moving against them.
A committee representing 600 international banks yesterday granted the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) another 90-day grace period on
principal payments on its foreign bank debt.

UKRAINE's budget deficit, which has grown to 44 per cent of gross domestic
product, has pushed the country into hyperinflation, the government's senior
economic minister said yesterday.
Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, deputy prime minister and the architect of Ukraine's
reform programme, said the deficit had more than tripled since the summer.
But price liberalisation and rapid privatisation measures were being delayed
by conservatives in the cabinet, he said.
Reformers hope the cabinet will decide tomorrow on a decree freeing prices
in the Ukraine.
Mr Oleksandr Savchenko, the government's top economic adviser, said the
underlying monthly inflation rate was 60 per cent in November and he
expected it to rise to 100 per cent this month.
The Ukrainian coupon is trading at 730 coupons to the dollar, a near 300 per
cent depreciation since August.

The cabinet may decide tomorrow on a decree freeing prices in the Ukraine

Monetary financing of the budget deficit has produced accelerating inflation
and contributed to the collapse in the value of the Ukrainian currency in
recent months.
'We have not yet managed to stop hyper-inflation,' Mr Pynzenyk said, 'but
the central bank is no longer issuing credits'.
Mr Oleksandr Savchenko, the government's top economic advisor, estimates
that the underlying monthly inflation rate was 60 per cent in November and
expects it to rise to 100 per cent this month.
The Ukrainian coupon, which, in effect, became a separate currency when
Ukraine left the rouble zone a fortnight ago, is trading at 730 coupons to
the dollar, a near 300 per cent depreciation since August.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Kohl calms foreign concern: Diplomats told of efforts to
stop racist attacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday sought to reassure the international
community that Germany was doing everything possible to curb right-wing
extremism and halt the violence against foreigners.
His remarks in his annual address to the diplomatic corps, coincide with
reports from Germany's ambassadors in Washington, Paris and Jerusalem about
the potentially adverse effect on trade and tourism if the violence
continues. Sixteen people have died in more than 1,900 cases of arson and
attacks on foreigners since January.
Mr Kohl, who has been accused of responding too slowly and too late to the
right-wing violence, said that attempts to curb it 'were not appreciated
everywhere. No one here is playing down the problems.
'The overwhelming majority of Germans condemn xenophobia,' said the
Chancellor, who only the previous day, during a Bundestag debate on the
Maastricht treaty, made an unusual and impassioned plea for tolerance and an
end to racist attacks. 'Anyone who puts human life at risk, who stirs up
hatred, or sows violence, must, and will, feel the full force of the law,'
he promised.
The German authorities have started to take steps to ban right-wing
extremist groups, following the murder of three Turkish citizens last week
and the resulting mass demonstrations against such attacks. Measures are
also being introduced to curb illegal immigrants seeking asylum in Germany,
by amending the contry's liberal asylum law, as well as restricting the
number of Aussiedler, or ethnic Germans, of whom 2m live in the former
Soviet Union, Romania and Poland. The Aussiedler have an automatic right to
citizenship, housing and social welfare benefits. More than 26,000 of them
arrived in November, nearly 9,000 more than in the same period last year;
200,000 have arrived since January.
The Interior Ministry this week proposed restricting the number by making
the end of 1995 the final day for applying to live in Germany, and by
allowing only the first generation of those born after the war to be
admitted as Aussiedler.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Twelve find an answer to the Danish question
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE key to re-establishing the whole process of European integration is the
Danish question,' a senior European Commission official said yesterday.
Although legal and political details remained to be cleared up, it seemed
last night that the conundrum raised by the Danish No to Maastricht six
months ago could be on the point of resolution.
The British plan put forward yesterday to meet Danish reservations on the
treaty - and allow a second referendum to go ahead next year - was a
delicately worded compromise.
It avoids tampering with the text of the Maastricht treaty, but would allow
Denmark to remain outside key areas of the treaty such as monetary union and
European defence.
The general welcome given to the proposals last night - above all from
France - indicates that EC governments realise they cannot afford discord
over the Danish issue souring next week's Edinburgh summit. The four-point
plan involves three clarifying 'declarations' and one 'decision' by the
Twelve. Although there was still uncertainty last night over the precise
legal status of the package, the latter part of the proposal would exempt
Denmark from being bound to follow the key goals of the Maastricht treaty.
Critical in this respect is the provision that the special regime for the
Danes 'should apply exclusively to Denmark, and not to other existing or
acceding member states'. This means that accession negotiations with
Denmark's Scandinavian neighbours and Austria and Switzerland would require
them to accept not only existing EC law but the full Maastricht treaty.
As part of the planned inter-governmental accord between the Twelve, the UK
proposal would also require Denmark to give up its right to block its
partners' advance towards integration. Article B of the intergovernmental
part of the draft accord not only enshrines Denmark's opt-out from a single
currency, but establishes that 'Denmark will not, in any way, prevent other
governments from proceeding with the realisation of Economic and Monetary
Union in conformity with the provisions of the Treaty on European Union'.
There was, however, apparent disagreement over the crucial point on whether
the Danish requirement for exemptions from monetary union, a future European
army and EC citizenship would be 'legally binding.' One senior EC diplomat
said the Danes were 'softening' this demand after the other members spelt
out the risks of Denmark torpedoing the Edinburgh summit.
But Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign minister, said the UK
proposals would provide the legally binding guarantee Denmark is demanding.
Danish opposition politicians, who will have their say, also expressed
reservations. Mr Bjorn Westh of the Social Democratic Party said: 'There is
much that needs to be formulated otherwise and more satisfactorily.'

FRANCE and Germany want to build on the stability between their two
currencies to achieve the 'ultimate stability' of a single money by the end
of the decade, Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said yesterday,
writes David Buchan in Paris.
Speaking just before the Franco-German summit opened in Bonn yesterday, the
French minister liberally invoked German backing in the long-term goal of
monetary union and in the short-term task of fighting off this week's
speculative attacks on the franc.
As during the franc's September crisis, he claimed: 'Those who want to break
the franc-mark link will find themselves confronted by the solidarity of the
two ministers (of finance) and the two central banks.' The franc closed
higher yesterday, at FFr3.40 to the D-Mark against FFr3.41 the day before.
Mr Paul Hammett, a Paribas analyst, said there was no economic or political
reason to believe the franc would be devalued. He said France supported the
idea of an EC growth initiative.

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN was yesterday accused of trying to undermine EC environment policy
by pressing for the withdrawal of certain sensitive proposals from Brussels.
According to a document obtained by Mr Ken Collins, the British Labour MEP
who chairs the European parliament's environment committee, the UK would
also like to abort or amend more than 20 proposals in the fields of social
affairs, company law, transport and telecommunications.
Mr Collins asked Mr Michael Howard, the UK environment secretary, to comment
on suggestions that environmental proposals might be withdrawn in the
interests of subsidiarity - the principle that EC decisions should be taken
at the most appropriate level.
Mr Howard told the parliament's environment committee he could not comment
because member states had not yet discussed the issue of subsidiarity, which
will be one of the central points on the agenda at next week's Edinburgh
summit.
Mr Howard said last month that the summit would not consider the abandonment
of environment proposals. After yesterday's meeting he said he could neither
confirm nor deny that the UK would ask EC leaders to examine a hit-list of
unwanted measures.
Mr Collins said he believed the UK had singled out measures which would set
minimum standards for keeping animals in zoos, require national authorities
to assess the environmental impact of long-range policy plans, harmonise
standards on waste landfill sites, and set requirements for the control of
water quality. On the zoos directive, Mr Howard said yesterday that this was
'something which member states should be perfectly capable of dealing with
themselves'.
The document cited by Mr Collins is undated and unattributed. It lays out
from a UK point of view a range of directives which would be undesirable,
including proposals on working time, workers' councils and data protection,
and suggests amendments to other measures, such as the controversial
proposals on management of packaging waste.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian Socialist party has suffered a damaging split following an
abortive attempt to topple Mr Bettino Craxi from the party leadership by his
one time protege, Mr Claudio Mar telli, the justice minister.
The split threatens to deepen as Mr Martelli, who made his challenge at a
special party assembly last week, has no intention of dropping his
leadership challenge.
Mr Craxi insists he is staying on. He appears to believe he is the person
most suited to renovating the party no matter how discredited he has become
as a result of the Milan municipal corruption scandal.
Mr Martelli mustered a surprisingly large 33 per cent of the assembly vote
against Mr Craxi. This formalised a split between what might be called the
official and opposition wings of the Socialists.
Before the corruption scandal broke in Mr Craxi's fiefdom of Milan in
February, such opposition was unthinkable. He was the unquestioned leader
who had pushed factionalism to the sidelines over the previous decade.

EUROPEAN unions and employers' organisations will join forces next week to
make representations to Mr John Major, UK prime minister, on boosting growth
and reducing unemployment in Europe, writes David Goodhart.
The European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), meeting in London yesterday,
complained that unemployment in Europe had reached an 'intolerable peak'.
The European Commission is predicting a further substantial increase to an
EC-wide rate of unemployment of more than 11 per cent. The ETUC,
increasingly disappointed by the slow progress of the EC's social dimension,
wants the Edinburgh EC summit to adopt the growth strategy it agreed last
July with the main European employers' organisations.
That includes a significant reduction of interest rates, a co-ordination of
national investment projects in the public and private sectors, and
restoring the credibility of convergence through EC-inspired job creation.
The ETUC also welcomed the EC's Ecu10bn (Pounds 8.9bn) infrastructure
spending plan.

FT  04 DEC 92 / IG Metall deal raises hope for inflation fight

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES are rising in Germany of a strike-free and inflation-beating pay round
for 1993 in the wake of two trend-setting settlements, writes Christopher
Parkes in Frankfurt.
In the early hours of yesterday, IG Metall, the most powerful union in the
country, accepted a basic deal for steel workers worth between 3 per cent
and 4 per cent over 18 months. This followed a 12-month, 4.2 per cent
agreement in the insurance industry.
Compared with forecast inflation of less than 4 per cent and expected
average productivity gains of around 2 per cent next year, the settlements
suggest that pay-induced pressure on the price index could ease
significantly if remaining negotiations reach similar conclusions.
Economists suggested that would remove one of the main obstacles in the way
of a cut in German interest rates, but they stressed that public spending
and money supply growth still had to be brought under control before changes
could be expected. The next test of the mood will come in negotiations
between federal, regional and local government employers and the oTV public
services union. Government advisers have urged rises of less than 3 per cent
 -nil in some cases - while oTV posted a claim for a 5 per cent rise.
Rising unemployment and sweeping job cuts have markedly dampened union
aggression. But Construction workers, whose current agreement runs out in
the spring, may be more ambitious. The building industry is one of the few
in Germany still growing.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Bleak forecast for German production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE OUTPUT of west German manufacturing industry is expected to decline by
1.5 per cent this year, and by up to 3 per cent next, according to the
latest industrial forecast by the Ifo economic research institute.
The gloomiest outlook of all is for truck and commercial vehicle
manufacturers, where output is expected to fall by 8 per cent this year, and
10 per cent in 1993.
The chemical industry is likely to be least affected by the downturn,
according to Ifo, with an expansion of output of 1.5 per cent in 1992,
followed by a slight decline of 1 per cent next year.
A bleak picture for the whole industrial sector in western Germany emerges
from the Ifo survey, the most reliable and comprehensive to be published on
the economy.
It says that the starting point for manufacturing industry next year is
significantly worse than it was one year ago. Thanks to a steady fall in
orders, order books now stand at an average of 2.6 months' production,
compared to three months' at the end of 1991. Capacity utilisation has
fallen from 87 per cent to 83 per cent over the same period.
In October, 1991, just 16 per cent of the companies answering Ifo's industry
survey reported disruption of production through a shortage of orders. The
figure was 28 per cent last month.
As for the number of companies intending to reduce their workforce over the
next three months, the proportion has shot up from 19 per cent last year to
44 per cent today.
The survey predicts a drop in output in the mechanical engineering industry
of 6 per cent this year and 3-4 per cent next year, although the plight of
the industry is less bad than it might have been, thanks to continuing
strong expansion in demand from east Germany: up 20 per cent in 1992, and a
forecast 18 per cent next year.
The massive publicly-funded investment in east Germany is also a key factor
in preventing a more serious downturn in the electrical engineering
industry, particularly because of spending on transport infrastructure and
telecommunications. The forecast for that sector is an output drop of 1 per
cent this year, and up to 2 per cent next year.
Where the downturn is most severe, its extent has been aggravated by the end
of the surge in demand between 1989 and 1991 fuelled by unification. In that
period, output of light commercial vehicles increased by 94 per cent, and of
heavier vehicles by 70 per cent.
In the first three quarters of 1992, deliveries of light vehicles in Germany
was down by 8 per cent, and of heavier vehicles by 11 per cent. That slump
is expected if anything to accelerate next year.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Toxic town plays for time at the edge of hell: Kerin Hope
reports from Mojkovac, Montenegro, where 3.5m tons of metallic waste
threaten an environmental disaster
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOR 15 years the town of Mojkovac in Montenegro, part of the rump of
Yugoslavia, watched the dam covering what used to be its football pitch fill
up with millions of tons of poisonous mining waste.
'In the summer the water on top evaporated and gave off a mist that affected
people's breathing. We knew the dump was hazardous, but our requests for a
study were ignored for years,' says Mr Miso Stanisic, the mayor.
Mojkovac's problem now threatens to turn into an international environmental
disaster. Freak floods in October caused the Tara river to burst its banks,
washing away the base of the dam along a quarter of its 600-metre length.
Despite United Nations-assisted efforts to repair the dam over the past two
weeks, there is still serious risk that the damaged part may collapse,
releasing some of the 3.5m tons of toxic waste it contains into the Tara,
which flows into the Danube above Belgrade.
'Below a sandy crust, the sludge is extremely unstable and it is steadily
pushing forward against the weak part of the dam. It could give way at any
time,' said Mr Thomas Dolder, a civil engineer advising the UN disaster
relief organisation.
Even a relatively small discharge could kill fish and aquatic plants in the
Tara, a Unesco-protected waterway which the Montenegrans call 'the cleanest
river in Europe', and make the water undrinkable in the Drina, Sava and
Danube rivers all the way to the Black Sea.
Floods, the worst that anyone in Mojkovac can remember, could not have come
at a more difficult moment, given that Montenegro is included in the UN
embargo on trade with Yugoslavia and now has little contact with the rest of
Europe. It was several weeks before the republic's request for aid following
the floods reached the UN.
Although sanctions were lifted to permit the delivery of 1,600 steel cages
and other dam protection equipment, Montenegran officials blamed the embargo
for the slow pace of repairs.
Not enough bulldozers and excavators are at work on the site. While
floodlights are positioned around the dump, allowing for round-the-clock
activity, there are no light bulbs to be found.
According to UN divers, the dam be touched up in just two days if work
speeded up sufficiently.
However, fuel is only available on the black market at high prices and
Montenegro's new private contractors are not necessarily willing to accept
the low rate offered by the public works ministry, responsible for repairs.
Some of Mojkovac's 11,000 residents will even admit to wishing the dump
could be washed downstream and out of their lives. Launched in 1976, the
Briskovo zinc and lead mine project was supposed to boost the local economy
by reopening a Medieval mine that had provided silver for Serbia's first
coinage.
At its peak, the mine produced 4,500 tonnes of lead and zinc annually, but
only a small quantity of silver.
'It was considered a successful enterprise, bringing in about Dollars 6m
(Pounds 3.9m) a year, so nobody paid much attention to the effects of the
dump,' says Mr Borislav Medovejic, the director of the ore processing plant.
Up to 35,000 tonnes a year of sludge containing high levels of both zinc and
lead - as well as other heavy metals like mercury and cadmium were poured
into the dam. The dam, made of compacted sand and gravel, was lined with
thick plastic sheeting to prevent the metal residue from seeping into the
ground water. When production at the mine was stepped up in 1980, in
response to demand from Zorka Savac, the federal Yugoslav mineral exporting
company, the dam had to be enlarged.
'It's in the past two years that we really started to notice the effect of
living next to the dump.
'The number of lung cancer cases has doubled and there have been 18
suicides, which I attribute to the effect of mercury on the central nervous
system,' says Dr Radovan Jovanovic, head of the town's medical centre.
When the mine shut down last year, after the Yugoslavs lost their market in
the former Soviet Union, it looked as if Mojkovac's increasingly active
ecological association would at last get a hearing.
The republic's post-communist government is keen to underline its concern
for the environment. A plan was begun for covering the 20-hectare site with
a thick layer of clay and topsoil.
That scheme has now been overtaken by events. 'Even if we manage to secure
the dam, the waste cannot just be covered up. There is proably lead and zinc
left, because of inefficient extraction, to make further processing
commercially viable. But after that's done, it will still be very expensive
to make the site safe,' Mr Dolder said.

THE RACE TO AVOID DISASTER
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1   An estimated 3.5m tons of toxic waste - lead, zinc, cadmium,
    cyanide - contained by the 600m long Jaloviste dam alongside the
    Tara River in the mountains of Montenegro
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
2   The flood-swollen Tara damages 150 metres of the compaced sand and
    gravel dam last month, threatening to cause what UN officials say
    could become an 'absolute disaster'
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
3   The system of back-fill and stacked gabions - chicken wire cages
    filled with gravel or crushed stone - which UN engineers are now
    racing to erect by Christmas
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
4   At stake, say UN officials, is not only the poisoning of 'everything
    that lives' in the Tara, but 'probably in the Danube as well' as it
    flows from Belgrade to the Black Sea

FT  04 DEC 92 / China threatens to scrap deal on Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROW between Britain and China over democracy in Hong Kong deepened
yesterday when Beijing hinted that it might revoke the 1984 Sino-British
agreement on the colony's future.
The warning is the latest move in the campaign by Beijing to persuade the UK
to withdraw its proposals to extend the scope of democracy in Hong Kong.
In the 1984 joint declaration, Beijing promised that the territory would be
allowed to maintain its capitalist system for 50 years.
The threat came after the Hong Kong stock market registered its largest
one-day drop in share prices since June 1989, when the Tiananmen Square
demonstration and the suppression of the Beijing democracy movement led to a
fall of more than 20 per cent in the market.
At the close yesterday, the Hang Seng index, the market's barometer, was
434.44 points, or 8 per cent, lower at 4,978.21. Since its peak three weeks
ago, the index has fallen nearly 23 per cent. Selling was frantic, with
turnover of HKDollars 5.3bn (Pounds 456m). A local investment banking group
became the first casualty of the collapse of confidence when it was forced
to withdraw its HKDollars 300m flotation. Other new issues appear likely to
be postponed.
The only outcome which would satisfy the business community would be for the
governor, Mr Chris Patten, to drop his proposals immediately. But, even with
the stock market down more than 1,000 points this week, there is little
expectation this will happen. In Beijing, the Foreign Ministry said that the
issue facing Britain was now 'whether the Sino-British Joint Declaration and
the other agreements reached between the two sides are still needed'.
The ministry added that the only way to solve the problem was for the
'British Hong Kong authorities to return to the agreements reached between
China and Britain'.
Last night the Hong Kong government said Britain had made clear it was
'prepared to hold discussions without preconditions' with China on matters
relating to a smooth transition of sovereignty in 1997. It said it was
committed to the full implementation of the joint declaration.
The rapid deterioration in Sino-British relations has caused serious concern
among the people of Hong Kong and their political leaders. Local legislators
were critical of China's scare tactics and feared for the effect they were
having on local morale.
Further volatility in Hong Kong share prices appears inevitable. Already
market conditions have undermined the new issues market, with South China
Brokerage yesterday withdrawing its HKDollars 300m flotation due to be
launched on Monday.
Separately, the company has also become the first securities house in the
current climate to invoke the force majeure clause in an underwriting
agreement. The clause permits the withdrawal of an underwriting commitment
in situations of material and unforeseeable change.
South China had underwritten a HKDollars 72m covered warrant issue on China
Light and Power shares; by last night, the shares were 22 per cent below the
warrant's strike price.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Clinton's backing sought
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, is expected to ask US president-elect
Bill Clinton to see Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, as soon as
possible after his January 20 inauguration.
Britain hopes to persuade the US not to place conditions on its renewal of
China's most favoured nation trading status, partly because of the adverse
effect it would have on the Hong Kong economy, in which US business has a
large stake.
At the same time, Mr Patten hopes to win Mr Clinton's endorsement for his
plans for more democracy in the colony. It is hoped that the US could,
behind the scenes, support the governor's proposals.
'The US is the only country in the world that has any influence on the
Chinese leadership,' said one British official.
The manoeuvre will have to be conducted carefully. China is already incensed
by what it sees as the 'internationalisation' of the Hong Kong issue.
Canada, Australia and the US have been criticised by Beijing for supporting
Mr Patten's proposals.
Mr Clinton will be required by June 3 next year to approve China's MFN
renewal.
During Mr George Bush's presidency, Democrats in both houses of the US
Congress have favoured placing conditions on MFN renewal because of China's
poor human rights record.
Mr Patten's planned mission to the US has been given added urgency by the
sharp deterioration in Sino-British relations. Officials in Hong Kong fear
that Congress may seek to link the colony's political development to the
renewal of MFN rights.
Congress and the new administration are expected to begin in the spring to
draw up their policy about MFN renewal.
This will be at the same time as Hong Kong's local legislature is debating
Mr Patten's proposals to extend democracy in the territory.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Weak D-Mark lifts French franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, EMMA TUCKER and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS that the French franc would have to be devalued retreated yesterday
after a much weaker D-Mark gave the currency a temporary reprieve.
A string of gloomy economic figures from Germany, and news that the steel
workers had agreed on a low wage settlement, sent the D-Mark sharply lower
against other European currencies and the dollar.
In London yesterday, the pound benefited from its position outside the ERM
to gain heavily against the D-Mark and the dollar. It ended the day almost 4
pfennigs stronger against the German currency at DM2.475, its highest close
for almost six weeks, slipping only slightly to DM2.4745 in New York.
Against the dollar it closed in London at Dollars 1.5665, just under two
cents stronger on the day. In New York it fell back slightly to Dollars
1.564. Ireland arranged to borrow up to DM4bn (Pounds 1.6bn) from German
banks to support the punt, which has been under strain within the European
exchange rate mechanism.
Ireland's National Treasury Management Agency organised the loans with a
group of German banks, including the country's three largest, Deutsche,
Dresdner and Commerzbank.
Dublin's strategy to defend the currency resembles the UK's Ecu10bn (Pounds
8.1bn) borrowing programme announced on September 3 in an effort - which was
ultimately unsuccessful in Britain's case - to hold sterling above its ERM
floor.
The franc was buoyed early in the day by a statement from Mr Michel Sapin,
the French finance minister, that France and Germany would do all they
could, jointly, to preserve the parity of the franc and D-Mark.
His statement, together with small amounts of intervention by the French
central bank, pushed the franc higher against the D-Mark to close at
FFr3.404, comfortably above its ERM floor of FFr 3.4305.
The D-Mark's loss was the pound's gain as investors switched funds. 'I think
the pound is benefiting from the fact that it has formed a solid base at
around DM2.40 and is outside the turmoil of the ERM,' said Mr Stephen
Hannah, head of research at IBJ International.
Mr Brian Hilliard, of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull said it showed there
was 'at least some floor under sterling'.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Tougher control of City urged by Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUGHER control of City institutions by regulators able to exploit 'the
power of fear' is needed to overcome short-comings in financial services
laws, Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday.
Bigger budgets, a higher calibre of people and more intrusive investigations
should be used by regulators to correct weaknesses in the six-year-old
Financial Services Act, Mr Nelson said in an interview with the Financial
Times.
He said the Securities and Investments Board, the main investment watchdog,
already had the powers to take a more aggressive line, but had failed to use
them. 'I am a believer in the power of fear and believe that SIB should be
bolstered in that regard . . . I want it to be more intrusive, incisive,
where necessary more penal,' he said.
Mr Nelson is the first Treasury minister to have responsibility for the City
since the supervisory functions were gathered in the department. Although he
admitted the 'self-regulatory' system had faults, he ruled out bringing
forward fresh legislation. 'I would prefer to see reform within the existing
system, rather than starting all over again,' he said.
Mr Nelson's first full interview since becoming a minister in April came
amid growing criticism by City practitioners of the current system.
He acknowledged that a succession of failures, including the Maxwell
scandal, had 'understandably given rise to anxiety among investors and
depositors'.
But his refusal to order a fundamental rethink may disappoint some critics
who had hoped Mr Nelson's concern over self-regulation, when a backbench MP,
would lead to widespread change in the City.
He moved to soothe City concern over legislation on insider dealing being
considered by parliament. Although it is more broadly based than existing
laws, Mr Nelson said: 'I'm not about to embark on some kind of witch hunt
for insider dealers.'
He also rejected calls for a public inquiry into costs imposed by banks,
particularly on small businesses. He said the government would continue to
draw the banks' attention to the criticisms but added: 'We have to remind
people that at the end of the day they must take a close interest in the
management of their own savings.'
Mr Nelson said he hoped to give further details of possible City reforms
after a Treasury-commissioned review by Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the
Securities and Investments Board, is completed next year.
He is also lobbying financial institutions to boost the quality of people
seconded to regulatory bodies. 'I'd far rather have an imperfect structure
with good human judgment than poor decisions being made within a perfect
structure,' he said. A move into regulation should be seen as a 'route to
the top', not a career 'sidewater'.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Hopes for EC breakthrough: UK plan to end Danish Maastricht
block - Summit prospects improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign and Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS for a break in the deadlock over the European Community's future
brightened last night following a UK initiative to resolve Danish objections
to the Maastricht treaty and a Franco-German agreement on EC enlargement.
The moves, which boosted hopes for a successful EC summit in Edinburgh next
week, could clear the way for the 12 to overcome other hurdles such as the
financing of the Community.
Britain's proposals, allowing Denmark to remain outside key areas of the
treaty such as monetary union and defence, were given a cautious welcome by
other EC members. The plan, submitted by Mr John Major to the UK's partners
after a tour of EC capitals, does not tamper with the treaty's text, on the
insistence of all 12 member states. The treaty can only come into force if
ratified by the 12.
At a bilateral summit in Bonn, Mr Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor, and
President Francois Mitterrand of France, agreed that negotiations on the
EC's enlargement should start at the beginning of next year and be concluded
by the end of 1993.
That has always been a top priority of the British and German governments.
Until yesterday, however, the French had been indicating they would not
agree to an opening of membership negotiations with new candidates until the
treaty was ratified by all existing members. However, a senior French
official warned that the negotiations could still be held up by a failure to
reach a compromise on the EC's future budget, including an increase in
so-called 'cohesion' funds for the poorer southern member states.
France's reaction to the British plan for Denmark was also cautiously
positive. Mr Jean Musitelli, President Mitterrand's spokesman, said in Bonn:
'We consider that there is a possibility of satisfying the demands presented
by the Danish government to its 11 partners by adopting adequate
declarations.'
Until now, France has been suspicious that a Danish compromise could water
down the treaty. Mr Poul Schlueter, the Danish prime minister, said the
British blueprint was 'an excellent starting point for arriving at a
satisfactory solution'.
But the opposition Social Democrats, Denmark's largest party, were less
enthusiastic. 'We consider the British proposals as a constructive draft
only,' Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the party's leader said, after a meeting of
the three main opposition parties.
The British plan provides for three separate 'clarifying' declarations which
would allow Denmark to submit the treaty to a second referendum next year,
probably in May or June.
A first statement would underline the EC's commitment to 'subsidiarity' and
greater openness in decision-making.
A second declaration would be made by the Danish government on its
interpretation of special areas of concern in the treaty. In effect, Denmark
would be permitted to establish its own legal criteria for the extension of
EC competence to areas such as citizenship and justice.
A third declaration, by all 12 states, would be designed to interpret the
treaty's provisions on defence, monetary union, citizenship and interior and
justice matters in a way which would reassure the Danish electorate.

FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: Kugelfischer to double losses in
second half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SECOND-HALF losses at Kugelfischer, the German bearings and industrial
systems group, will be more than double the DM45m (Dollars 29m) deficit
reported in the first six months, the company said yesterday.
Demand was expected to continue falling for the next few months and output
would fall by 10 per cent next year, it said.
Figures for the first 10 months of this year showed an accelerating fall in
sales. Turnover at the end of October was down 7.8 per cent, compared with a
7 per cent fall reported a month earlier.
The group, which recently announced the closure of its loss-making works in
east Berlin with the loss of 470 jobs, said results would be affected by the
costs of the shut-down and heavy losses in its other east German businesses.
Kugelfischer said total losses this year would be well over DM135m, compared
with a deficit of DM80m in 1991.
Cost cutting measures so far this year have included an 8 per cent cut in
the workforce, reducing the payroll to 32,000.

FT  04 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Japanese warn on Russian ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LEADING Japanese regional banker yesterday said ventures in Russia had
failed to materialise because foreign companies were uncertain of the status
of property they need to acquire.
Mr Ryutaro Ohmori, president of the Niigata Chuo Bank, which has formed a
Russian investment association in north-western Japan, said foreign
investment interest in Russia would remain weak until banking and property
management regulations were overhauled.
He said investors had lost confidence in the Russian banking system, and
were confused by the regional and central governments' competing claims to
authority over investment approval. In an attempt to improve banking ties,
Niigata Chuo and several other banks in the area have trained Russian bank
staff.
Banks and trading companies in the Niigata region had hoped the Russian far
east would be a prime site for resource and services investment, but after
many trips to the region, including Mr Ohmori's nine visits in the past two
years, enthusiasm for joint ventures has begun to wane.
Trade between Japan and Russian will fall about 60 per cent this year,
according to trading house officials who say they are reluctant to deal with
Russian clients unless certain of receiving payment for goods exported.
An official responsible for Russian trade at a Tokyo-based trading house
said confidence had also been undermined by the introduction of a new tariff
system in July. He said the system was applied unevenly.

THE INTERNATIONAL community is likely to place greater emphasis on nutrition
in combating hunger and poverty as a result of a UN-sponsored conference
which opens in Rome tomorrow.
The seven-day International Conference on Nutrition is the first time the
UN's resources in the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health
Organisation have been pooled on such a scale in the struggle to eliminate
hunger and reduce malnutrition.
The conference, at which 150 countries will be represented at ministerial
level, will absorb Dollars 6.9m in UN funds. It will produce no binding
resolutions, but the draft declaration contains an ambitious commitment to
reduce starvation and famine.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY and France agreed last night that negotiations on enlarging the
European Community should start at the beginning of next year and be
concluded by the end of it.
The clear commitment to a rapid start in the negotiations emerged from
discussions in Bonn yesterday between President Francois Mitterrand and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl at their regular Franco-German summit.
However, a senior French official warned that the negotiations could still
be held up by failure to reach a compromise on the future financing of the
Community, including an increase in funds for the southern member states.
Mr Dieter Vogel, the German spokesman, said that the two leaders were agreed
on pressing ahead with the enlargement talks as rapidly as possible. This
has been a top German and British priority.
Mr Jean Musitelli, the French spokesman, said the two had also discussed the
current state of the Gatt trade liberalisation talks, and agreed they should
not be a significant issue at the EC summit in Edinburgh summit next week.
'The problem of Gatt should not weigh down the negotiations in Edinburgh. It
is not the central problem.'
He said it was clear that the most complicated problem problem was now the
future financing of the Community, although this was not a problem between
Germany and France.
The budget problem particularly concerns the southern countries of the
Community led by Spain, which insist that a substantial increase in funds
must be made available before there can be any start to enlargement
negotiations.
German officials said earlier that there had been very close and extensive
co-operation between London and Bonn and London and Paris on the proposals
for Edinburgh.
Mr Vogel said: 'The chancellor and the president agreed that an acceptable
compromise for the future financing of the EC must be found. On this
question the European Council at Edinburgh must come to an acceptable
solution.'

FIVE months after it dropped plans to go public because of unfavourable
stock market conditions, Dr Pepper/Seven-Up, the big US drinks group, has
revived its plan to sell shares in an initial public offering of common
stock.
But the size of the issue has been scaled down. The original plan was to
sell 38m shares between Dollars 17 and Dollars 18 each, but Dr Pepper said
it would sell only 20m shares, with a target price of Dollars 14 a share.
Over the summer a number of planned flotations were temporarily withdrawn or
abandoned because investor appetite for IPOs had waned. But shares have
performed well recently and demand for new stock has recovered.

dismissed

<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER Christoffersen, chief executive of the Baltica Holding insurance
group since 1987, was dismissed yesterday. He will leave on December 6.
Mr Christoffersen, 46, was responsible for taking Baltica Holding into new
areas of business, including banking, ambulances, vehicle recovery, property
construction investments and real estate agencies.
He also masterminded a strategic alliance with France's Suez group, which
holds 23 per cent of the shares in Baltica Holding. This was a defensive
measure against a hostile takeover by Danish rival Hafnia.
A major reorganisation of Baltica was announced in October, when the company
warned of a loss of DKr2.5bn to DKr2.8bn for 1992 and raised DKr2.5bn
(Dollars 410m) by selling 32 per cent of Baltica Insurance.
In the October reshuffle, Mr Christoffersen was named as prospective chief
executive of Baltica Insurance, with Mr Steen Hemmingsen taking over the
running of Baltica Holding.
Yesterday, however, Mr Hemmingsen was made chief executive of both Baltica
Insurance and Baltica Holding.
The group's losses this year will reduce equity capital from DKr9bn to
DKr4.5bn, the group said in October. The losses include large write-offs on
property investments in Gibraltar, where Baltica has invested DKr1.8bn in
property developments.

AFTER two encouraging months, US retailers yesterday reported a diverse
sales picture for November.
The figures cast fresh doubts over the Christmas season - reported to be off
to a good start after Thanksgiving - and caused retail stocks generally to
ease on Wall Street.
Among the biggest retailers, K mart, which takes in specialty chains and a
discount store operation, saw total same-store sales fall by 1.1 per cent in
November. This masked a 2.3 per cent decline in general merchandise, partly
offset by a similar rise in the specialty store division.
Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest retailer in sales terms, also reported
more modest sales growth. Same-store sales were up by 7 per cent, which
compares with double-digit growth rates seen by the Arkansas-based retailer
for much of this year. Same-store sales growth for the first 10 months of
the fiscal year was 12 per cent.
Woolworth was another loser, with comparable domestic sales falling by 1.1
per cent, while - among the specialist retailers - The Gap reported an
increase of just 1 per cent in same-store sales last month.
More positively, Sears, Roebuck posted a 5.1 per cent gain in same-store
domestic sales.
Some major department store groups also fared well: Federated, saw a 5.3 per
cent increase in November same-store sales, Neiman Marcus saw a 7.5 per cent
rise, and May Department Stores enjoyed a 3.6 per cent advance. At JC
Penney, there was a 5.1 per cent gain.

FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: UAP fights for a bridgehead -
The French insurer's foray into Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT first glance, the announcement on Wednesday that Union des Assurances de
Paris, the biggest single French insurer, was buying a minority stake in
Nordstern of Germany from the Winterthur group looks like an ordinary
business transaction.
UAP has made no secret of its ambitions of expanding into Germany, and
Nordstern is an attractive vehicle. Moreover, the deal, whereby UAP cedes 3
per cent of its equity to Winterthur for 37.4 per cent of Nordstern, seems
reasonably priced and should not dilute UAP's earnings.
But there is a hidden agenda. Nordstern is the latest offensive in UAP's
increasingly bitter battle with Suez, the French holding company that
controls Nordstern through Colonia, the German insurer which UAP has long
hoped would be its bridgehead into Germany. Last week, Suez scuppered UAP's
hopes by breaking off its long-running negotiations over Colonia.
Mr Jean Peyrelevade, UAP chairman whose high standing in French financial
circles could be imperilled if he cannot clinch the Colonia deal, has
described the Nordstern deal as part of his 'friendly chess match' with
Suez.
The European insurance industry is now waiting to see how 'friendly' the
rest of the game will be.
The chess match began three years ago when UAP paid FFr14.3bn (Dollars
2.66bn) for 34 per cent of Victoire, a French insurer controlled by Suez,
which had bought it for FFr25bn. UAP then tried to swap its Victoire shares
for part of the latter's controlling stake in Colonia.
The transaction, or so Mr Peyrelevade hoped, would be eased by his own
connections with Suez, which he chaired for three years until 1986, and with
Mr Gerard Worms, its current chairman whom he had hired in 1984.
But UAP's only bargaining tool was a minority holding in Victoire, which was
of little value to Suez given that it already controlled the company.
Moreover, as Mr Worms was well aware, the French financial community saw the
Colonia affair as a test of his influence over Suez and of his independence
from his old patron.
Mr Peyrelevade was in an even trickier position. UAP is state-controlled and
its chairman is chosen by the French government. He is a socialist appointee
who could lose his job if the Right returns to power in next March's
elections. He really needs to clinch Colonia before March.
Only eight days ago he seemed to have succeeded. Suez was poised to approve
UAP's offer of all its Victoire shares plus FFr1bn in return for a
controlling 50 per cent stake in a new holding company which would own
Victoire's majority stake in Colonia.
But Suez held out. It wanted another FFr1.5bn. 'Suez is smart,' said Mr
Michael Huttner, insurance analyst at Banque Nationale de Paris. 'It knows
UAP is desperate and has seized its chance to raise the price.'
Mr Peyrelevade needs to bring Mr Worms back to the negotiating table.
Nordstern is his latest ploy. It provided roughly two-thirds of Colonia's
profits last year, with net profits of FFr300m on sales of FFr9bn. UAP could
try to use its minority holding to block Suez's strategy, notably its plan
to merge the administration of Nordstern and Colonia.
It remains to be seen how influential UAP will be. Winterthur failed in its
legal attempt to scupper the merger. 'Maybe this will give UAP a little more
leverage over Colonia, but Nordstern is a very small piece in the jigsaw,'
said Mr Derek Elias, insurance analyst at Paribas.
Most analysts suspect UAP will be forced to resort to another ploy -
threatening to raise its 6.3 per cent stake (with 10 per cent voting rights)
in Suez. Mr Peyrelevade has squashed speculation about an outright bid, but
UAP said guardedly that it did 'not intend to substantially raise' its
stake.
Mr Peyrelevade must now be pondering his next move in the chess game.
'Anything could happen,' said one analyst. 'All we can be sure of is that he
does not want to be remembered as the man who spent FFr14.3bn for nothing.'

FT  04 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Turkey gets central Asia on the line - How
Ankara has plugged ex-Soviet republics into its network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ambitious project linking Turkey's telephone network with that of the
five republics of central Asia was formally inaugurated this week with a
visit to the region by Yasar Topcu, the Turkish communications minister.
Telecommunications is proving the industrial frontiersman in Turkey's
efforts to forge ties with its cousins to the east. Under a turnkey
arrangement, the PTT, Turkey's state-owned telecom monopoly is supplying
public exchanges with 2,500-line capacity to each country - Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.
Through earth stations also supplied by the PTT, the five existing networks
will be linked via the Intelsat satellite to the Turkish gateway exchange
and the outside world. The PTT has contracted Netas, a Turkish subsidiary of
Northern Telecom of Canada, together with Teletas, part owned by Alcatel of
France, to deliver the switching equipment.
The deal is a straight donation at a cost of Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.4m)  - a
considerable sum given Turkey's budget problems.
In the long run the PTT will comfortably recover the cost in transit
revenues.
As the republics look to upgrade their infrastructure, bigger gains should
be had by Turkish suppliers. Turkish companies already have considerable
experience in the former Soviet Union, on the back of a Dollars 300m-a-year
gas protocol under which Turkey receives gas from former Soviet republics in
exchange for Turkish goods and services.
As a location for foreign joint ventures, Turkey offers cheap labour costs.
Moreover Turkey and the central Asian republics speak broadly the same
language.
Turkish telecommunications has long enjoyed priority status in a country
where the president used to boast there was a telephone in every village.
Between 1986-1991 the number of lines installed increased by 163 per cent,
faster than anywhere.
As growth in Turkey's domestic phone market slows with the PTT cutting
investment, sales to the republics will provide welcome revenues.
'We've learned our lesson, not to be too reliant on a single customer,' says
Mr Tanju Argun, Netas president. In 1988 the company recorded losses
resulting in large scale lay-offs. Today the corporate structure is much
more robust. Thanks in large part to the former Soviet market, exports now
account for about 10 per cent of turnover, which in 1991 is estimated at
around Dollars 230m. Mr Argun's target is to boost exports to a third of
total sales.
Netas has long been testing the waters. In 1986 its engineers were working
with the Leningrad Institute of Technology to create a signalling system for
the southern republics.
'We were present in Moscow. We'd had relations with the Ministry of
Communications for a long time. But we were reluctant to go to the republics
independently,' says Mr Argun.
The demise of the Soviet Union accelerated the company's plans. In October
last year the company connected the Northern Telecom-designed DMS switch in
Azerbaijan, the first foreign digital switch to be installed in the former
Soviet Union. Mr Argun was in Baku again earlier this month to see the
installation of a third digital exchange, with cables being laid along the
city's underground. Netas has also opened a DMS in Kazakhstan.
The export effort has been spurred by substantial investment in home-grown
research and development. Netas for example, devotes between 6-10 per cent
of sales revenues to R&amp;D. The company earned Dollars 2.7m exporting software
to both Northern Telecom and Bell Northern Research. It also contributed to
London's Mercury gateway system.
Netas has joint ventures in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan to manufacture its
DRX-4 digital switch used for exchanges in rural areas, which the company
developed in its Istanbul laboratories.
Netas is excited by the prospects for this product which it feels is ideally
suited to the ex-Soviet market. 'It has been designed by customer input - it
is not a technology driven product,' says Mr Argun.
The DRX comprises a 512-line cabinet structure easily assembled in a small
office, and, unlike many systems, it will function in extremes of
temperature. Netas has already delivered test equipment and started
construction work near Baku. Ultel, its 51 per cent owned venture in
Azerbaijan, has produced 150,000 handsets, and expects to be selling the
switch soon.
Finance remains a bigger headache. Payment for the Azerbaijan deal involved
a complex telephone-sets-for-oil countertrade. Mr Argun hopes also to be
able to tap the Dollars 1bn line of credit extended to the republics by
Turkey's Eximbank.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Where paper profits are growing
up a gum tree
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MONKEY puzzle is probably Chile's best-known contribution to the world
of trees. But its commercial use being prohibited, the country's timber
business is built on the pine and other softwoods that thrive in its
temperate climate, writes David Lascelles in Santiago.
Five hundred miles south of the capital, near the provincial town of Los
Angeles, a newer industry is evolving round the eucalyptus. Once imported
from Australia, the tree is now a familiar sight in the rolling hills of
Chile's south central region.
The eucalyptus has taken well to Chile. In the right conditions it grows as
much as a foot a month, reaching a harvestable height of 25 metres within
eight to ten years.
Much of the pioneering work is being done by Santa Fe Group, a wood pulping
joint venture 60 per cent owned by Royal Dutch Shell, and 20 per cent each
by Scott Paper and Citibank, which converted some of its outstanding Chilean
debt into the investment. Founded in the late 1980s, Santa Fe now owns
49,000 hectares (120,000 acres) of plantations, of which 32,500 are planted.
According to Mr Ian Powell, resource manager in the forestry division, much
of the land needed thorough restoration before it could be used. Years of
cattle farming had compacted the soil, requiring it to be ploughed to a
depth of 80 cm to loosen it up. Large quantities of fertiliser and
weedkiller were also needed to 'control the competition', as he puts it.
In the nurseries on the outskirts of Los Angeles, the company is developing
two strains: eucalyptus globulus and the more frost-resistant eucalyptus
nitens. Considerable work has gone into genetic improvement using cloning
technology developed by Shell researchers at their laboratory in
Sittingbourne in Kent.
The highly automated nurseries have a capacity for 10m seedlings, which are
grown under wide net tents and watered with a special mix of nutrients fed
by sprinklers. The seedlings are kept for up to 10 months before being
planted out.
The nursery and plantations will eventually provide all the raw material for
Santa Fe's pulping plant to the west of Los Angeles. But at the moment the
18-month-old facility still has to buy in a third of its annual
800,000-cubic metre requirement from other sources.
The importance of eucalyptus is that it provides a ready source of
short-fibre pulp, as opposed to the long fibre in pine wood. Short fibre has
special uses, such as tissues.
The plant's output is 250,000 tonnes a year and the bulk of its Dollars
100m-a-year sales go to Scott Paper affiliates.
Although Santa Fe marks an advance for the Chilean timber industry, its
timing has been bad. Mr Nick Whalley, the executive vice president, expects
recent softness of the pulp market to delay the venture's move into profit.
'The short term profitability is not good,' he says, 'but we project
substantial financial returns two to three years from now.'
One of the heavy costs in establishing the plant has been environmental
control, which Mr Pedro Navarette, the plant's environmental engineer,
estimates to have accounted for Dollars 28m of the investment. Like many
foreign ventures, Santa Fe is expected to abide by the highest environmental
standards, while local, state-owned competitors have more leeway.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Belgium (9):
Regionalism may not be such a great handicap - Flemish-Walloon compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the better books on Belgium appearing this autumn had the modest
title: 'The Belgians'.
Sponsored by the Foreign Ministry and the Office for Foreign Trade, it
offers a readable, well-illustrated account of Belgium's history, its
government and its multilingual culture, interpersed with disarming nuggets
of information such as: 'Since the end of World War II, Belgium has already
had 36 different governments.'
The divisions between a Flemish North and Walloon South may have left
Belgium politically weak; but from an economic standpoint, the country has
remained surprisingly resilient - to the point where its increasing
regionalism may be less of a national handicap than is often imagined.
'The Belgians' was published just before a long weekend of horsetrading
between Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the prime minister, and the leaders of the four
main parties in his government. It culminated in what may prove a historic
compromise between the Flemish and the Walloons. If passed by parliament, it
will redraw the map of Belgium as a federal state, wrapping up the third
stage of constitutional reforms first set out in 1988.
Part of the plan means that the regions will assume new responsibilities
from the national government, notably for agriculture and foreign trade.
Responsibility for scientific research and for legislation concerning social
assistance agencies will be shared between the regions and the communities -
the other main political divisions built around the Dutch, German and French
languages.
From an investor's point of view, the three increasingly autonomous regions
 -Brussels, Flanders and Wallonia - stress that the reforms will not change
the long-standing decentralised approach to job-creation. Mr Philippe
Maystadt, Belgium's finance minister, makes clear that the three will market
themselves in the same way as other European regions, such as Bavaria or
Catalonia.
Each Belgian region has developed its own distinctive sales pitch. In
Flanders, the accent is on its location at the heart of the European single
market due to come into effect on January 1, 1993. Equipped with the three
major seaports - Antwerp, Ghent and Zeebrugge - Flanders has first-class,
toll-free highways backed up by a dense railway network which puts London,
Paris, Bonn, Cologne and Dusseldorf all less than 300km away. Not
unreasonably, the region can lay claim to being ideally situated as a test
market for northern Europe.
Indeed, there are times when what regional officials call 'Flanders/Belgium'
is portrayed almost as an extension of Netherlands and Germany in terms of
productivity, low inflation, and skilled, multilingual workforce. With only
58 per cent of the Belgian population, Flanders accounts for 74 per cent of
the country's exports to Europe.
Automobile sub-contracting is an important source of jobs since Ford,
General Motors, Renault and Volvo plants are all nearby. Ms Josee Mercken,
managing director of Flanders Investment Office, stresses that small, clean,
high-technology businesses such as microelectronics are what the region
wants. But Europe's deflationary cycle has made it much harder for Flanders
to pull in foreign investment, with companies postponing decisions until
early next year, she adds.
Wallonia's experience this year is similar. The region has largely recovered
from the corporate horror story of the late 1970s, when steel and glass
industry closures took their toll; but unemployment is still between 12 and
14 per cent, forcing the Walloons to dream up new ideas on how to sell
itself to the outside world.
One aim is to revive Wallonia's pioneer heritage in industry. Walloons set
up a steel plant in Sweden around 1800, and the first glass manufacturing
operation in Japan in the late 19th century.
Mr Jean-Marie Agarkow, deputy general manager at the office of foreign
investment, describes the pioneer theme as similar to an American Wild West
movie; but this time the 'good guys' in white hats are the Japanese who are
being welcomed in Wallonia with a fervour more readily associated with
job-hungry Britain.
One of the latest Japanese investors is Tsuji, the Osaka-based school for
cooks. Tsuji bought a chateau near Mons for BFr30m and is prepared to put in
a total of BFr110m to train Japanese cooks for six months in the fine arts
of Belgian and European cuisine. Pushing the Brussels bureaucracy to ease up
on visa restrictions was a bit of a nightmare, says one Walloon official,
but in the event it worked.
Wallonia has moved faster than Flanders to adjust to EC demands that richer
countries (such as Belgium) rein in national investment assistance to their
own regions, so as to avoid undermining the effect of Community aid to
poorer member states. The Walloon response was typically practical: the
definition of a small-to-medium business was raised from its original level
of a company employing 40-to-70 people to the EC level of 250 people and
BFr20m turnover. These companies can now expect the same level of tax
write-offs or capital relief of up to 21 per cent, plus some aid if they
locate in a special assistance area.
For much of the late 1980s, Brussels might have looked up at its nose at
such inducements. With its newly-minted image as the 'political capital of
Europe', Brussels seemed to be riding the crest of a wave created by the
single market 1992 project. More recently, the economic downturn has dented
confidence.
Some 15,000 civil servants work in Brussels, three-quarters for the European
Commission. With families, that means 37,000 people. If one includes the
growing press corps and the diplomatic corps, conference goers, lobbyists
and international visitors, this group alone is estimated to generate
BFr22.5bn, of which all but BFr1.5bn stays in Belgium. This combination of
spending power and political influence is the real drawing power of Brussels
 -even if it has a long way to go before it can match Washington DC, the
capital with which it is often compared by Eurocrats.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour presses PM on growth debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday stepped up its charges that the government has backtracked
on its pledges to use the Edinburgh summit to promote a Europe-wide growth
strategy.
At a news conference Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, produced
documents allegedly confirming that Mr John Major's commitment to debate
economic expansion were in reality 'minimalist' and 'insubstantial'.
The papers included a confidential Conservative Research Department briefing
note that relegated talks at Edinburgh on economic expansion to the eighth
and last place on the agenda.
The second was the British presidency's compromise proposal for last
Friday's meeting of foreign and finance ministers on community financing.
That confined the discussion to noting that the European Investment Bank was
considering creating a new financial instrument to promote transport
networks and small and medium-sized businesses.
Backing a warning yesterday from Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics
commissioner, that the economic outlook was grave, Mr Brown said Mr Major
should take up the scheme for an Ecu5bn (Pounds 4.02bn) European Investment
Fund.
He dismissed as inadequate the UK's proposals that fellow EC partners should
adopt measures similar to its Autumn Statement on spending which sought to
promote capital spending while reining in public-sector pay rises.
A senior Conservative official close to the Edinburgh planning process
indicated last night, however, that the government was looking for little
more than useful language on growth from the summit.
Downing Street has made clear that discussion on growth is likely to be
confined to talks over lunch.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht bill clears first hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT cleared the first of many hurdles last night in the debate
over the detailed provisions of its Maastricht treaty legislation.
With a comfortable majority of 132 (296 votes to 164) it succeeded in
forcing an end to discussion of the first suggested amendment to the
European Communities (Amendment) Bill after almost two full days of debate.
The amendment - tabled by Sir Russell Johnston, a Liberal Democrat spokesman
 -was then overwhelmingly rejected with a government majority of 364
(392-28).
Although Euro-sceptics succeeded in delaying proceedings with a series of
long speeches and much tactical manoeuvring, the outcome will enable prime
minister John Major to point to some tangible progress along the road to
British ratification of the Maastricht treaty when he plays host to other EC
leaders at the Edinburgh summit next week.
The House is not scheduled to return to the bill until the new year.
In what turned out to be the final speech of yesterday's second day of the
committee stage, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign office minister, emphasised
that MPs were not 'discussing ratification of the treaty'.
He said: 'We are engaged in detailed examination of a piece of domestic
legislation required to incorporate into the framework of UK law those
provisions of the treaty that need to be so incorporated.'
In conciliatory vein, Mr Garel-Jones said the House owed a debt to Sir
Russell for placing an amendment that went right to the heart of the matter
at issue.
Earlier, Mr Tony Benn, the former Labour cabinet minister, called for the
abolition of the European Commission. 'No civilised democratic country would
allow any power whatever to be in the hands of people who were not elected
and cannot be removed,' he said.
Mr Benn's was one of a number of heartfelt speeches which interspersed bouts
of tactical thrust and counter-thrust as inveterate Euro-sceptics vied with
government forces for strategic advantage.
Interest had focused on whether Mr Bill Cash, Tory MP for Stafford, would
break the modern-day record for the longest Commons speech by extending his
2 1/2 -hour contribution of Tuesday night by a further two hours.
In the event, Mr Cash sat down after 14 minutes.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Aspinall fails to block rival
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN ASPINALL, the casino and zoo operator, failed in a court move to
close down a rival club, The Sportsman, yesterday.
London Clubs International, which owns the West End casino in Tottenham
Court Road, was granted a new licence by North Westminster Licensing
Committee at Horseferry Road magistrates court at the end of the four-day
hearing.
Mr Aspinall had told the magistrates he was making a stand because he loved
the gambling industry and felt the sheer size of LCI would have an adverse
effect.
Six weeks ago Mr Aspinall was left with a bill for Pounds 160,000 of costs
after failing to block similar gaming licences for five other London Clubs
casinos - The Ritz, The Palm Beach, Les Ambassadeurs, The Golden Nugget and
The Rendezvous at the Hilton Hotel in Park Lane.
The latest case brought another Pounds 75,000 of costs.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Brazilian Senate vote seals Collor's fate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Brazilian Senate last night voted by a landslide to approve the
recommendation that suspended President Fernando Collor be definitively
stripped of office for 'crimes of responsibility'.
Although the final judgment of Mr Collor takes place only on December 22,
yesterday's vote made clear that his political career is over for the coming
years. Of the 81-member Senate only three voted in his favour and 67 voted
against, far more than the two-thirds that will be needed to condemn him. A
repeat vote in three weeks will mean Mr Collor is barred from running for
public office for eight years.
Only two senators spoke in Mr Collor's favour. The pleas of Mr Ney Maranhao
that 'we shouldn't condemn this young Brazilian full of enthusiasm' fell on
deaf ears in the three-hour session.
As Brazil's first directly elected president for 30 years, Mr Collor was
suspended from office in September by the lower house of Congress after
allegations by his younger brother had brought to light a multi-million
dollar corruption scandal and provoked nationwide protests.
Mr Collor has never had much support in the Senate and was not expected to
survive its judgment. In a recent interview with the Financial Times he
complained that he was undergoing 'summary execution'.
Mr Collor has contracted Mr Paul Lombard, a French lawyer, to help with his
defence. However, after the weight of last night's vote there is growing
pressure on him to resign and avoid further humiliation. One of his aides
has recently been in Paris where Mr Collor has a luxury apartment,
apparently negotiating a visa. Mr Collor may not, however, be able to avoid
a criminal trial recommended by the Attorney General.
In the run-up to the Senate vote on December 22, President Itamar Franco,
the former vice-president, has opted to put the government on hold, ignoring
the country's desperate need for direction.
Tuesday night's decision to call off negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund over a new accord was the strongest evidence of the confusion
within the two-month-old administration.
Mr Franco has cancelled a planned address to the nation, delayed a new wage
policy and dithered over privatisation.
Last week he cancelled a privatisation by fax and issued a decree putting
himself in control of all prices in order to be able to readjust tariffs
below inflation - in direct contradiction of IMF recommendations.
His rejection of the orthodox economic programme elaborated by Mr Gustavo
Krause and Mr Paulo Haddad, the economy and planning ministers, because it
was 'too Collorite' almost caused the two men to quit last weekend.
Not only has Brazil failed to meet the targets of the Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds
1.4bn) accord signed in January, there seems little prospect of improvement.
Inflation has been more than 22 per cent a month for the last year, the
fiscal deficit is estimated at 7 per cent of GDP, domestic debt is at its
highest since 1989, and tax receipts are down 25 per cent. GDP per capita
has fallen 10 per cent since 1990.
Financial institutions are in chaos. The Federal Savings Bank has a Dollars
21bn hole. Petrobras, the state oil monopoly, is raising costly short-term
money to cover Dollars 5bn owed by the government and other state companies.
Mr Murilo Portugal, the Treasury secretary, says the government's cash
situation is critical.
The lack of policy definition has destroyed hope of a rapid economic
turnaround. Consultants are revising forecasts downwards weekly and the
government research institute IPEA has changed its projections from a 2.5
per cent growth in GDP to a 1.5 per cent fall, despite an expected trade
surplus of Dollars 15.5bn.
This is the backdrop to the economics team's reluctance to re-open talks
with the IMF. The official reason for the delay was the congressional
impasse over a Dollars 12bn fiscal reform project crucial to balance next
year's budget. The project is unlikely to pass before the year's end.
This year had been seen as crucial for economic stabilisation as the next
two years will be taken up with a referendum on the political system, a
constitutional revision and elections for congressmen, senators, governors
and president.

FT  03 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: BankAmerica to set up Dollars
2bn MTN programme
</HEADLINE>

   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKAMERICA Corporation has established a Dollars 2bn Euro medium-term note
programme to give it greater flexibility in tapping markets in local
currencies other than US dollars.
The new programme is part of a rearrangement of its existing global MTN
arrangements for the issue of paper in the domestic US market and the
Euromarkets.
Merrill Lynch International, the arranger, said BankAmerica would now find
it easier to issue paper in a number of currencies than under the old
documentation which had not always kept pace with developments in the
Euromarkets since it was established in October 1988. The main currencies
newly available are the D-Mark and the Japanese yen.
'The dealers will now hope to be able to show Bank of America funding
opportunities in virtually ever major currency,' said Mr Kevin Regan, a
managing director at Merrill Lynch International.
Notes will be issued with maturities of one month or longer, but will
typically be in the three to five-year range. Following the growing trend,
the programme will also allow for the issue of Eurobonds.

strengthen merger trend

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FMC, the diversified chemicals group, and Harsco, the equipment
manufacturing business, plan to combine their military vehicle businesses in
the latest example of a merger wave in the US defence industry.
The two said the combined business would have estimated sales in 1993 of
about Dollars 1.2bn and would be owned 60 per cent by FMC and 40 per cent by
Harsco.
FMC, with interests ranging from chemicals to machinery and equipment, will
put into the partnership its Defence Systems group, which employs more than
6,000 people. Its best-known product is the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, a
tracked vehicle armed with automatic cannon which saw extensive action with
US troops in the Gulf war.
Harsco will put into the group its BMY-Combat Systems division, which
employs 2,000 people and makes tracked vehicles for artillery and combat
support functions.
The deal is part of a trend for US defence companies to merge their
activities to achieve greater efficiencies as the US defence budget shrinks
following the Cold War.
Mr Malcolm Gambill, chairman of Harsco, said the two businesses were a
natural fit and would be a 'powerhouse in tracked vehicles'. The deal would
lead to some consolidation, with the removal of unneeded higher cost
capacity.
The two companies have signed a letter of understanding for the combination,
but still have to reach agreement on specific plans and timing.
The new company will include FMC's naval systems division and its steel
products division, which makes military track.
However, Harsco will retain its BMY-Wheeled Vehicles division, which makes
five-ton army trucks and has been suffering a dearth of orders.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CENTEL, the Chicago-based telecommunications group, said yesterday that it
was confident its shareholders had approved a controversial plan for the
business to be taken over by Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance
telephone company, in a Dollars 3bn deal.
Centel investors held a special meeting yesterday to vote on the deal, which
stirred up strong opposition from some shareholders when it was announced
last May.
The results of the vote will not be announced officially until December 11.
Many large shareholders registered their votes by proxy ahead of the
gathering, and Mr John Frazee, Centel's chairman, said: 'We're confident
that, when the votes are counted, based on proxies received to date, that
the merger will be ap-proved.'
The takeover involves Centel shareholders receiving 1.37 shares of Sprint
stock for every Centel share.
On the basis of Sprint's closing price yesterday of Dollars 25 7/8 , down
Dollars  1/8 , that values each Centel share at around Dollars 35 1/2 .
Centel closed unchanged at Dollars 33 7/8 .
However, Centel shares were trading at over Dollars 42 before last May's
announcement, and some shareholders argued at yesterday's meeting that the
company was being sold on the cheap and would do better to remain as an
independent provider of local and cell-ular telecommunications ser-vices.
However, Mr Frazee replied that the recent deal under which American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the biggest US long-distance telephone group, will
acquire a 33 per cent stake in McCaw Cellular, the largest cellular
telephone service, 'validates the price' of the Sprint offer.

SALOMON yesterday announced a restructuring of its Phibro Energy subsidiary
that will involve separating the unit's commodities trading and oil refining
businesses and laying off about 30 per cent of its employees worldwide,
writes Patrick Harverson.
To cover the costs of the changes at Phibro, Salomon will be taking a
pre-tax charge of between Dollars 25m and Dollars 35m in the fourth quarter.
In addition, Salomon will be reporting another charge of between Dollars 60m
and Dollars 70m to cover the cost of moving most of its 3,000 New York-based
staff into one Manhattan location.
As part of Phibro's restructuring, its oil refining and other asset
business, as well as its partnership in the White Nights Russian oil
production venture, will be run separately from the rest of Phibro by its
current management, under the guidance of the Salomon parent group.
Salomon said it would eventually consider selling these operations, or
entering into a joint venture, or any other manoeuvre that would 'maximise
value for share-holders'.
The remainder of Phibro will be run as a commodities trading firm.

FT  03 DEC 92 / International Company News: Former Salomon bond chief faces
charges over bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday charged Mr Paul Mozer,
the former head of bond trading at Salomon Brothers, and Mr Thomas Murphy,
his chief assistant, with submitting fraudulent bids at auctions of US
government securities between 1989 and 1991.
The lawsuit alleges Mr Mozer violated the anti-fraud and record-keeping
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 when he submitted eight
false bids worth Dollars 13.5bn in seven separate auctions of US Treasury
securities between August 1989 and May 1991.
Mr Murphy, who was the senior trader on the bond desk at the time, is
accused of having been involved in three false bids. Last night, Mr Murphy
denied that he had violated securities laws and said he would contest the
charges vigorously, and Mr Mozer denied all the allegations except that in
February 1991 two unauthorised bids were submitted in one of the auctions.
Yesterday's suit represents the first legal action the government has
brought against individuals involved in the Salomon scandal of August 1991,
when bond traders at the Wall Street securities house were found to have
faked customer bids for Treasury bills in an attempt to buy more newly
issued securities than was allowed by government rules.
Salomon itself settled all charges related to the scandal in May of this
year, when it paid Dollars 290m in fines and compensation to the government.
Mr Mozer is also charged in the civil suit with insider trading involving
the sale of 46,000 Salomon shares, and with arranging false trades to create
an artificial tax loss for Salomon. The fixing of false trades was allegedly
conducted in 1986 with the help of individuals at other, unnamed, firms, and
allowed Salomon to claim the bulk of about Dollars 168m in trading losses
against taxes.
The insider trading charge relates to Mr Mozer's sale of 46,000 shares of
Salomon on August 6 1991. The SEC says Mr Mozer sold the shares knowing that
information about the false Treasury bids would soon be released. A few days
later details of the activities were released and Salomon's share prices
fell sharply.

FT  03 DEC 92 / UK-China relations 'worst for years'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Percy Cradock, the former policy adviser to both Lady Thatcher and Mr
John Major, the prime minister, warned last night that the present crisis in
British-Chinese relations over Hong Kong was the worst for many years.
To find such tension in relations between the two countries it would be
necessary to go back to the days of the cultural revolution in China in the
1960s, he indicated on BBC television's Newsnight programme.
Referring to Beijing's threat to revoke any contracts concluded in Hong Kong
before sovereignty over the colony reverts to China in 1997, if they have
not got China's approval, Sir Percy said the Chinese meant precisely what
they said. 'To discount their seriousness would be a very great mistake.'
Sir Percy, a former British ambassador to Beijing, said it was a fallacy to
believe that China was bluffing and that it would change its tune because of
economic considerations.
'This is a matter of national pride for them. They will not give way.'
Nor did Sir Percy think that if a more liberal regime came to power in China
there would be any change in its opposition to the democratic reforms
proposed by Mr Chris Patten, the Hong Kong governor, which are believed to
be the cause of Beijing's present anti-British campaign.
The Foreign Office said last night that nothing that Sir Percy had said
could invalidate Mr Patten's proposals.
Officials stressed that these were no more than proposals and that Hong Kong
and the British government were still waiting for the Chinese to make
counter-proposals if they did not like Mr Patten's reforms.

THE UN Security Council agreed last night on a resolution to send a
multinational force under US command to Somalia to disarm warring clans and
ensure food aid gets through to the starving, reports Michael Littlejohns at
the UN in New York.
After private consultations, western diplomats said a text drafted by the US
appeared certain to be approved at a Security Council meeting today. China
is expected to abstain.
About 20,000 US troops could take part in the operation. Heeding African and
other third world objections to an overriding role for American troops, the
US apparently agreed to accept a substantial degree of UN control.
Under the terms of the draft resolution, UN Secretary General Boutros
Boutros Ghali would have a liaison staff at the force's field headquarters
in Somalia and a Security Council commission would monitor the operation.
Mr Boutros Ghali would advise the council when he believed a 'secure
environment' for humanitarian aid had been created. Normal UN peacekeeping
would then take over from the US-led operation.
The Indian president of the Security Council said the US-led intervention
would not involve financial cost to the UN.

<TEXT>
GREECE'S prime minister, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, yesterday reappointed
his economy and foreign ministers hours after sacking his cabinet to clear
the way for a reshuffle, Reuter reports from Athens.
He renamed Mr Stephanos Manos national economy and finance minister and Mr
Mihalis Papaconstantinou foreign minister. Mr Ioannis Varvitsiotis was also
reappointed to the defence portfolio.
The only surprise in what had been billed as a 'new beginning' was the
elevation of his daughter, Ms Dora Bakoyannis, to full ministerial rank in
the Culture Ministry.
Mr Mitsotakis, 74, sacked his cabinet earlier in the day after a stormy
emergency meeting on Tuesday with conservative party deputies in the
300-seat parliament, where his calls for unity went unheeded.
Dissident deputies in his conservative New Democracy party have poured
criticism on him for several months, saying his austerity programme and
alleged foreign policy bungling were steering the party to defeat in
elections in 1994.
Mitsotakis, who led the conservatives back to power for the first time in a
decade in April 1990, has clung precariously to power with a one-seat
absolute majority in parliament.
His showdown with rebel deputies came in the week when his 1993 budget is
being debated in parliament and when Mr Manos must present his plans for
economic convergence with other European Community economies.
It also comes just before the EC summit in Edinburgh, starting on December
11, where Greece will once again try to shore up support for its campaign to
reject recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.
All three issues - budget, convergence and recognition - are vital to the
survival of the government and the prime minister obviously felt like taking
no chances. Other than his daughter's promotion, the only real change was
the advancement of a large group of relatively young deputies to junior
ministerial ranks.
This appeared to be aimed at promoting unity in view of the constant
criticism that Mr Mitsotakis is cut off from much of his party and
surrounded by a tight political clique and his family.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Engineers divert river in race to shore up weakened dam:
Kerin Hope watches as Montenegro tackles an environmental hazard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE

<TEXT>
ENGINEERS have held off the threatened collapse of a dam holding back
millions of tonnes of toxic mining waste by diverting a river in the
mountains of the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
But United Nations advisers have warned that a 150-metre length of the
600-metre dam is still in danger of crumbling.
'It's against all theory that this part should still be standing,' said Mr
Thomas Dolder, a Swiss civil engineer. 'It has to be filled at once,
otherwise even heavy rain could be disastrous.'
The weakening of the dam has turned into a major environmental hazard for
the Danube river system. Environmentalists have warned that if the dam
collapses, the mountain of toxic sludge it has been holding back will poison
the Tara river and eventually the Danube.
The 12-metre high dam, made of compacted sand and gravel, rises in a
mountainous gorge at Mojkovac in Montenegro, a republic which along with
Serbia makes up what remains of the old federation of Yugoslavia.
The dam was damaged by two flash floods on October 6 and 17, when surging
water swept away concrete slabs at its base.
But now the fast-flowing river Tara has been channelled to the other side of
the rocky gorge.
At the same time a temporary breakwater is preventing the dam from further
erosion, while workers race against time to build an access ramp to start
replacing 5,000 cubic metres of lost filling.
At the moment only a thin wall of gravel backed with plastic sheeting is
stopping some 3.5m tonnes of sludge containing lead, cadmium and cyanide
from slipping into the river.
It would be carried down the Tara into the Drina river and then the Danube,
poisoning aquatic life and drinking water.
The Tara, a Unesco-protected water flowing between two national parks, is
one of Montenegro's main tourist attractions.
The protests of people living at Mojkovac were ignored in 1976 when the
government decided to re-open an abandoned lead and zinc mine and when an
East German company built an ore processing plant just outside the town.
The mine was eventually shut down last year - after its toxic waste had
built up to the present proportions.
The waste pipes from the plant cover a 20-hectare area. A hard crust two
metres thick covers sludge 'with the consistency of pudding', Mr Dolder
said.
The sludge now appears to be slowly moving forward and adding to the
pressure on the weak dam, he said.
Despite efforts by local officials and the UN disaster relief organisations
to keep the dam repair programme on track, the slow pace of work is causing
anxiety.
The UN last week flew in 1,600 sealed cages, which will be filled with rock
and used as a core for three permanent breakwaters directing the river away
from the dam.
But the Montenegrin public works ministry, in charge of rebuilding the dam,
has had trouble finding local contractors who can provide bulldozers and
other earth-moving equipment.
'We are in the process of moving from state control to a private system in
the building industry and there is a lot of confusion,' said one official.
The United Nations lifted trade sanctions against Montenegro (which has been
allied with Serbia in the bitter fighting between Yugoslav ethnic groups) in
order to send in equipment for repairing the dam.
The operation is being hampered by a severe shortage of petrol, one of the
main results of the embargo against the rump state of Yugoslavia.
More requests for exemption from the UN embargo will have to be made so as
to procure additional equipment needed to complete the rebuilding work.
Drilling machinery and explosives, for instance, are in short supply at the
quarry, where hundreds of huge boulders will have to be extracted to shore
up the dam.

<TEXT>
NORWAY'S central bank said yesterday it expected a moderate upswing in the
economy in the period to 1996, with low inflation and a continued rise in
the current account surplus, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
The bank warned the upturn would be insufficient to reduce unemployment
unless wage growth is restrained. Unemployment is currently 7.9 per cent, a
post-war record.
The central bank calculates that if wage growth can be restrained to 2 per
cent below Norway's main trading partners, there could be a modest decline
in unemployment up to 1996, followed by stronger falls.
Norway's GDP growth rate is expected to slow markedly in 1993 to 0.6 per
cent from 2.6 per cent this year, and 1.1 per cent in 1991.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Belgium (7):
Impact of 'little bang' is slightly muted - Computer delay hits Belfox
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Belgium's 'little bang' - the government reforms which came into force at
the beginning of last year - was supposed to energise the Belgian financial
markets. But external events conspired to undermine some of the effects of
the programme.  Whether it can yet be counted a complete success depends, to
an extent, on which sector of the financial markets one looks at. Below,
Andrew Hill considers its effect on the stock market, futures and options
and the bond and money markets
FUTURES and options have had a slow start in Belgium. Belfox, the new
futures and options exchange, was sup- posed to open for business in May or
June 1991. As it was, dealers did not start buying and selling futures until
December 6, and the options market was launched only six months ago.
Getting the British-designed computer system up and running efficiently was
the main problem, according to Mr Remi Vermeiren, chairman of the
Brussels-based exchange. 'The delay caused a lot of negative elements -
financial- ly, psychologically and for the image of Belfox in the market,'
he says. 'It also absorbed a lot of management time.'
Even now, with the computer problems largely ironed out, the market is
small. Two options are traded - on Belgian retailer Delhaize, and on
Petrofina, the large Belgian natural resources company - and two futures,
one on Belgian government bonds (BGB) and one on the three-month Belgian
interbank offered rate (Bibor).
Even leaving aside the technical problems, this has been a difficult
teething period. The cornerstone of futures trading was supposed to be the
BGB future, which Belfox hoped would capitalise on the success of the
underlying government bond market. But after a reasonably buoyant start,
volume collapsed in June and July.
Mr Vermeiren puts the slump down to the relative inexperience of the Belgian
market, combined with competition from the market in German Bund futures.
Some investors thought they could hedge their Belgian franc exposure in the
German market - relying on the fact that the franc is tied to the D-Mark. In
addition, the more liquid German market could offer narrower spreads to
futures dealers - two to three basis points, rather than eight to 10 on
Belfox.
That gap has now narrowed, according to Mr Jos Schmitt, Belfox general
manager, with the Belgian exchange offering a four to five basis-point
spread. Mr Schmitt also believes investors have begun to realise that they
cannot cover all their risks on the Belgian markets with Bund futures.
The situation was eased by a 'gentleman's agreement' between 15 financial
instit- utions, put in place in the middle of August, when BGB futures
volume was in the doldrums. The institutions agreed to deal a minimum number
of BGB futures contracts until the end of the year. The effect on BGB
futures trading has been dramatic: between April and August volume only
occasion- ally burst through a daily average of 1,000 contracts dealt, and
was mostly below 500, but in the last two weeks of October, volume averaged
2,413 contracts daily.
Financial institutions now seem to be dealing contracts voluntarily, but it
is clear that the first months of next year - when the gentleman's agreement
is supposed to expire - will be crucial.
The options market, which has faced stiff competition from the
better-established Amsterdam exchange, is in need of more products. By
mid-February 1993, Belfox hopes options will be available on some of
Belgium's other large shares - such as Electrabel, Societe Generale de
Belgique, Solvay, Union Miniere, GIB Group, and the large banks - as well as
a future and an option on the Bel-20 index of top Belgian stocks.
But Mr Vermeiren is not yet prepared to declare victory in his campaign to
educate scep- tical investors in the delights of futures and options
trading. 'I hope (the market) is recovering, but honestly speaking I have
some doubts,' he says. 'I think it will only recover fully when we have a
complete system and products on the (stock market) index.'

Impact of 'little bang' is slightly muted - Bond market becomes attractive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Belgium's 'little bang' - the government reforms which came into force at
the beginning of last year - was supposed to energise the Belgian financial
markets. But external events conspired to undermine some of the effects of
the programme.  Whether it can yet be counted a complete success depends, to
an extent, on which sector of the financial markets one looks at. Below,
Andrew Hill considers its effect on the stock market, futures and options
and the bond and money markets
THE bond and money markets were the success story of the wide-ranging
financial reforms. The state reduced withholding tax on new fixed yield
securities, tied the Belgian franc to the D-Mark, and, later, reformed the
money market, and gave a kick-start to the market in linear bonds (which are
known as OLOs).
The result has been a reduction in interest rate differentials between
Germany and Belgium, and active primary and secondary markets in government
debt instruments and treasury bills. In the secondary market, total
transactions in OLOs averaged BFr25bn daily between the beginning of 1991
and mid-1992, and BFr30bn in treasury bills.
On a recent finance ministry mission to Asia, investors complained about the
lack of liquidity in Belgian bonds during their morning trading period - an
indication, say Belgian officials, of the growing attractiveness of these
instruments to international investors.
Domestically, debt costs for the Belgian state have been reduced, and the
investor now has a much wider choice of instruments.
The reform is not over. Since October, primary dealers in OLOs have been
able to 'strip' the long-term 2007 linear bonds, allowing principal and
coupon to be dealt separately - adding Belgium to France and the US as the
only countries in the world which offer such a facility.
The government also wants to diversify the market by allowing securitisation
of government debt and encouraging the corporate bond market, an area where
Belgium has always lost out to Luxembourg with its combination of tax breaks
and banking expertise.
The key, according to Belgian officials, is to attract issuers to the
market, and to that end, a draft law aims to cut the upfront cost of issuing
corporate bonds. It will also extend to corporate bonds the complex
book-entry clearing system used for OLOs.
This would allow Belgian corporations and non-Belgian holders of bearer
bonds - usually difficult to identify for tax purposes - to benefit from
their exemption from withholding tax on such instruments.
Officials hope the framework for such a system will be in place by the
middle of next year.

Impact of 'little bang' is slightly muted - Choice shrinks for investors
</HEADLINE>

Belgium's 'little bang' - the government reforms which came into force at
the beginning of last year - was supposed to energise the Belgian financial
markets. But external events conspired to undermine some of the effects of
the programme.  Whether it can yet be counted a complete success depends, to
an extent, on which sector of the financial markets one looks at. Below,
Andrew Hill considers its effect on the stock market, futures and options
and the bond and money markets
THE Brussels stock market has been hit, like most world markets, by the
downturn in the global economy.
Alas for Belgium's stockbroking community, liberalisation coincided with
that slump in volume. Consequently - as everybody from the president of the
bourse downwards is prepared to admit - changes to the broking system and
improvements in the structure of Belgian commissions have had only a limited
effect.
This year will be more profitable than last, but Brussels, hampered by
illiquidity and a limited range of domestic stocks, still struggles against
more active European rivals.
Mr Jean Peterbroeck, the bourse president, says part of the reason is that
the government gave the bond market a leg-up in the same series of reforms
by reducing withholding tax on fixed interest financial instruments from 25
to 10 per cent. Combined with the turbulence of European stock markets, that
made bonds much more attractive than equities for traditionally cautious
Belgian investors.
At the same time, he claims that large Belgian banks did not act on their
promises to invest heavily in stockbroking operations. The delay in
implementing a Belgian futures and options exchange has also held back the
market, and Mr Peterbroeck continues to fight for the abolition of the tax
on stock market turnover, which penalises investors up to BFr10,000 for each
transaction.
There is little the bourse can do to cope with more lasting structural
impediments to growth of the exchange. In 1950, for example, there were some
550 Belgian stocks quoted on the exchange; in 1992 there are just 170. They
are larger companies, formed from mergers, but the investment choice looks
restrictive to buyers who are used to the British or German exchanges.
The gradual shrinkage is continuing: for example, had Banque Bruxelles
Lambert been swallowed up by the Dutch financial services company
Internationale Nederlanden Groep, then the bourse, while benefiting from the
short-term takeover excitement, would have lost one of its most
heavily-traded and best-known stocks.
In the long term, flotation of publicly-owned companies may help increase
the liquidity of the market, although the first wave of privatisation is
likely to involve sales to single buyers rather than British-style share
offers. Brokers are also trying to persuade family companies - for example,
the owners of the Stella Artois beer brand - to float some of their shares
on the exchange and excite new investor interest.
For the future, like other EC stock exchanges, Brussels has work to do to
implement changes introduced by EC directives on investment services. In
particular, the Belgian exchange will try change to a London-style
market-making system by early 1995. Mr Peterbroeck fears the costs
associated with introducing such a system might drive more small brokers out
of the market, although he hopes to collaborate with other EC exchanges to
ease the burden.
Even if he seems unhappy about the administrative changes involved, the
bourse president agrees that in general a single European market will be
good news - it was, after all, what the 1991 reforms were partly meant to
prepare for. 'Belgium can only gain. Belgian investors have already invested
a lot outside the country - but outside investors have not spent very much
in Belgium. The possibilities are great,' says Mr Peterbroeck.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Belgium (3):
State asset sales may ease deficit - The privatisation bandwagon has finally
arrived
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCHANT banks and brokers are licking their lips, potential buyers are
readying their cheque-books, and politicians are sharpening their
ideological oratory: the privatisation bandwagon has finally rolled into
Brussels.
Its arrival is not a surprise - the last government passed a law in March
1991 permitting sales of public assets - but it is ahead of the original
schedule and far more heavily laden than most observers expected.
A year ago, privatisation was hardly discussed in political circles. That
was natural. Belgium's political establishment, still reeling from a
confused protest vote in the November general election, had better things to
think about. Even in March, when Hill Samuel, the British merchant bank, and
Brussels- based Petercam Securities produced a valuation of state
enterprises, the chances of a sell-off beginning before the end of the year
seemed slim.
But Mr Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance minister, has been considering
a preliminary list of mainly financial institutions which could be
privatised. He indicated to the Financial Times early in November that one
of those companies could be selected for an early sale, to test the water
before Christmas.
The new centre-left coalition, which was put in place only in March, has
moved fast, and the main reason is money. In an interview with the FT in
June, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Flemish Christian Democrat prime minister,
tentatively suggested that privatisation might be considered as a way of
easing Belgium's large budget deficit - the principal obstacle to the
country joining the first wave of EC member states in economic and monetary
union.
In July, the government promised a BFr50bn (Pounds 1bn) four-year
privatisation programme as part of its budget for 1993. But in October, the
worsening European economic situation obliged the government to adjust next
year's budget to cover a likely shortfall of BFr21.8bn. Privatisation will
bridge half that gap. The government has increased its target for next
year's sell-off proceeds from BFr15bn to BFr25bn. A further tranche of
BFr15bn will be raised in 1994, and then BFr10bn in each of the next two
years.
Meanwhile, the politicians have stepped up the ideological argument. Shortly
after the supplementary budget measures were presented, Mr Dehaene told an
investment seminar in Brussels that it would be a no-holds-barred
privatisation programme - despite the strictures of the 1991 legislation
which indicated that at least 50 per cent of public enterprises should
remain in state ownership.
The prime minister said that the committee of 'four wise men', appointed to
investigate the possibilities for privatisation, had been given a very wide
mandate. 'No possibility should be excluded, either in the selection of
assets to be sold, the identity of the buyer, or the size of the
shareholding for sale,' he told the seminar.
The speech upset Mr Dehaene's socialist coalition partners. Mr Guy Coeme,
the deputy prime minister, who is also responsible for public enterprises,
hit back a day later, arguing that the prime minister's comments did not
reflect the government's position.
Amid all this excitement, Mr Maystadt - a French-speaking Social Christian,
and therefore in the same political camp as Mr Dehaene - remains calm. For
one thing, he argues that the state needs the money, and that if politicians
do not like the idea of privatisation then they may have to settle for
further unpopular cuts in public spending. 'If you put the matter on the
theoretical level, then of course there are differences of opinion,' he
says. 'But I'm sure that when we come up with concrete proposals, we will
overcome all ideological difficulties.'
As for the question of selling off more than 50 per cent of state
enterprises, Mr Maystadt concedes that in some sensitive areas - including
energy and railways - the state might retain control through a 'golden
share'; but he adds: 'If it appears that we can get a better deal and we are
able to sell our participation on better terms if we allow control by a
newcomer, then why not?'
In fact, the government does not have much family silver to sell, partly
because it never had a strong nationalisation policy, partly because some
publicly-owned enterprises belong to regional, community or municipal
administrations rather than the central government.
The Petercam/Hill Samuel report estimated that a range of industrial and
financial enterprises could raise up to BFr318bn if all the shares held by
the state were sold. That would take time. Large state industrial and
commercial companies like Belgacom, the telecommunications group, the state
railway and the post office are only in the first stages of conversion to a
new management philosophy, aimed at transforming bureaucracies into private
sector businesses.
Analysts believe the preliminary list will be more modest. It is likely to
include stakes in financial institutions such as the Caisse Generale
d'Epargne et de Retraite (CGER), the Societe Nationale de Credit a
l'Industrie (SNCI) - some shares in which are already listed on the Brussels
bourse - and the Societe Nationale d'Investissement (SNI). Shares in
Distrigaz, a natural gas utility, may also be earmarked for sale.
The government says the terms of the sale will be decided on a case-by-case
basis, but for the time being it seems unlikely that major public flotations
will be considered until larger state enterprises such as Belgacom are ready
for privatisation in two to three years' time. Finance ministry officials
argue that the capacity of the Brussels bourse is too modest to cope with a
large influx of new shares.
If Belgium does go down the route of sales to specific buyers, rather than
the British-style public flotation, those with a stake in the future of the
bourse are likely to be disappointed.
'I think it's in the Belgian interest to do this in the British way,
especially as we have a (stock) market with much more depth than, say,
Italy,' says Mr Alain Camu, managing director of Petercam and a director of
Hill Samuel. 'There have been so many companies leaving the stock exchange
that we would love to take a good chunk (of the sell-off).'
Uncertainty about exactly how the Belgian government will achieve its
BFr60bn target does not seem to have deterred potential investors. According
to the finance ministry, many tentative approaches have already been made by
potential buyers from inside and outside Belgium; and London-based advisers,
starved of privatisation business at home, have been filling Mr Maystadt's
in-tray with inquiries. The first sale prospectus is eagerly awaited.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Belgium (5): Tax
privileges still on offer - Co-ordination centres have not lost their allure
after 10 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIAN 'co-ordination centres' will be 10 years old on December 30. That
was the day in 1982, when the government - endowed with special powers to
cope with the growing economic crisis - authorised tax-breaks for companies
operating certain financial and management services out of Belgium.
If there is a birthday party, it could be a particularly crowded one. As of
February this year, there were some 295 co-ordination centres in Belgium,
employing 6,550 people and total capital of BFr900bn (Pounds 18bn). The
corporations involved include Goodyear, General Motors and IBM; while a
number of Belgian companies with international interests have also found it
worthwhile to spin off some of their activities and form co-ordination
centres.
Mr Philippe Maystadt, the finance minister, smiles at the idea that the
concept's allure may have diminished over the past decade. In fact, he has
recently made a number of technical amendments to the original legislation,
because, 'it was really too attractive,' he says. 'Even after those
adjustments, it is still attractive, as you can see from the number of
inquiries I get.'
The basic attraction of the co-ordination centre is that it allows the
multinational to make cost savings, by shielding centralised management
activities from income tax. Centres are also exempt from tax on initial
capital or capital increases, and from real-estate tax.
As the Belgian finance ministry points out, in its brochure on the centres
scheme: '(The legislation) allows a broad range of sophisticated intra-group
financing operations to be carried out in a virtually tax-free environment.'
The co-ordination centre concept is not specifically aimed at encouraging
the establishment of international holding companies on Belgian territory.
Separate fiscal attractions help Belgium compete with neighbouring
Luxembourg and the Netherlands in that area - for example, under general
Belgian rules, dividends received are 95 per cent tax-exempt. But the
legislation on co-ordination centres stipulates that the centres cannot hold
shares in any other company.
In addition, the centres' activities are carefully restricted. For example,
they cannot sell accounting services outside the group to which they belong,
but they can do the accounts for affiliated companies, and charge for it.
Leasing, factoring, reinvoicing and financing can be done from the centre,
as can insurance, research, publicity and information, data-processing and
advertising.
The list is not exhaustive: all co-ordination centre proposals have to be
vetted by the Belgian authorities, which collaborate with potential
investors to tailor a centre to the multinationals' needs.
Apart from anything else, the scheme was fortuitously timed, coinciding with
the rapid growth in Brussels' political influence. As Mr Julian Oliver, of
American Express Europe, which was in the first wave of companies to set up
co-ordination centres, points out, tax-breaks alone are not responsible for
the idea's success: 'Brussels is geographically close to the industrial
heartland of Europe, and obviously it's the political capital of Europe.'
According to Mr Remi Troch, of Deloitte &amp; Touche's Antwerp office, the
recent legislative changes - which allow existing centres to apply for
renewal of their status for a further 10 years - have not reduced the basic
financial attractions of the concept. For example, the holding HQ can borrow
funds from the co-ordination centre to buy shares: the borrowing charges
relating to the purchase of shares are tax-deductible under Belgian law, but
the interest income earned by the co-ordination centre is tax-exempt.
Some who have benefited from the tax privileges of the scheme are amazed
that this apparent 'tilting of the level playing field' can still happen as
the single European market is put in place. But as Mr Troch told a recent
seminar on European tax: 'Nobody knows how long this government will last
and they do need a lot of money, but so far with all the changes they have
made, this has not yet been questioned.'

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Belgium (4):
Grip remains tight on crown jewels - A look at prospects for foreign
predators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM operates one of the most open economies in Europe, and yet has a
reputation for being sensitive about foreign hands getting near its
corporate crown jewels.
The psychological starting point for this concern was the unexpected and
predatory raid on Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding
company, launched by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Italian financier in 1988.
Its latest benchmark was the planned bid for Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL),
one of Belgium's three leading banks, by Internationale Nederlanden Groep
(ING), the Dutch banking and insurance company.
Discussion of this topic is usually peppered liberally with reference to the
need for an 'ancrage Belge' - an anchor of Belgian control over its
manufacturing base and financial resources, to ensure that corporate
strategy and economic development are designed at home rather than abroad.
As in most EC countries, a distinction is made between foreign investment
(invariably welcome) and takeovers by foreign companies - to be regarded
with suspicion.
But in practice, as opposed to the debate, there is little resistance to
outside encroachment among Belgium's business elite, and little more than
faint regret among government policy-makers.
'I think it's unrealistic to think that we could prevent the sale of Belgian
assets,' says Mr Phillipe Maystadt, Belgium's highly-regarded finance
minister. 'We are interested in a European market, so there are some rules
we have to apply. The European single market doesn't allow us to prohibit
sellers and buyers from other members of the EC.
'To put it another way,' he adds, 'in the period 1985-90 there were 222
sales of Belgian assets. Of these 59 went to French companies, 57 to Dutch
companies and 28 to British companies. Most of them, indeed, are sales to
European companies, and in fact to neighbours. We have no way to prevent
that, and there may be no desire to prevent that.'
If there were, it would be a bit late to start.
Belgium is a small country which relies on its open economy, good ports and
infrastructure, and high productivity, to earn a much better than average
living in the international marketplace. According to Generale de Banque,
Belgium exports per capita twice as much as Germany, and five times as much
as Japan.
From the 1960s onwards it has turned itself progressively into an attractive
base from which multinationals can serve the European market. As a
consequence, 32 per cent of Belgium's top 3,100 companies are owned by
foreign interests, according to a University of Louvain study. The Louvain
analysis points out, moreover, that this greatly understates the position,
since these multinationals account for 43.5 per cent of total added value
generated in Belgium.
Yet familiarity and ease with foreign investors did not prepare Belgium's
tightly-knit corporate clans for the De Benedetti attempt to take over La
Generale. Part of the reason was sheer lack of exposure to corporate
raiding.
When Mr De Benedetti made his move, Belgian business had experienced only
one real assault from abroad. Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL), Belgium's
second largest holding company, in 1987 saw off a hostile bid by Axa of
France for Royale Belge, Belgium's second-biggest insurance group. To do so,
however, it had to combine forces with Union des Assurances de Paris,
another French group.
The following year, La Generale was finally rescued by a French 'white
knight', the Compagnie de Suez conglomerate. By last year, the French had
sent in one of its top executives, Mr Gerard Mestrallet, to get a grip on
the sprawling holding, leading to fears that decision-making would shift
from Brussels to Paris.
However, Mr Mestrallet has punctiliously observed local form and
sensitivities, in a way that some La Generale executives felt Mr De
Benedetti would not have done. For instance, he delivered part of his first
presentation of annual results in Flemish, which he set about learning.
This is more than anecdotal in a country constantly beset by rivalries
between the French and Dutch-speaking communities. But it is, nevertheless,
hard-headed business logic that takes precedence. What was remarkable about
the near-paranoia unleashed in 1988 about La Generale falling under outside
control was how quickly it subsided. Mr Maystadt says the fears 'have not
completely died, but, I repeat, we have no choice. We are a member of the EC
and part of the single market, and we are a small country.'
Subsequently, leading Belgian companies such as Solvay, the chemicals group,
moved fast to plug the glaring gaps in their defences exposed by Mr De
Benedetti - who had secretly amassed a nearly 18 per cent stake in La
Generale before revealing his hand. But this was logical protection against
any form of hostile takeover, more than an assertion of specifically Belgian
control.
The search by Sabena, the troubled national airline, for a foreign partner
provides another example. Regionalist rivalries surfaced among employees
during 1990's abortive link-up with KLM, the Dutch carrier, and when Air
France acquired a chunk of Sabena equity after the Belgian government
refloated the airline.
The 'ancrage Belge' argument was plausibly fanned because the Belgian state
led the Dollars 1bn bail-out, in what looked to be straightforward, flag
carrier nationalism. Senior officials in the debt-strapped government
underlined, however, that it would have been more expensive to close Sabena
than to refloat it, mainly because of costly social transfers to its 12,000
workers.
In the event, ING's proposed takeover of BBL will not resolve the issue. Ten
days ago, BBL announced the bid plans had been scuppered by differences over
the price to be offered. However, the basic idea of a merger to set up a
'big player' group on the Allfinanz or Bancassurances model, selling
insurance and banking services throughout the Benelux countries through an
integrated network, had a logic and appeal to BBL's management which has
added fuel to the discussion.
The bank's main shareholder, the entrepreneur Mr Albert Frere, chairman and
managing director of GBL, is thought to favour a link-up with Credit
Communal, the credit institution jointly owned by all Belgium's provinces
and municipalities. That idea - an ancrage as Belge as you could get - could
now become a reality, despite suspicions that it was merely a tactical
flirtation, aimed at jacking up the ING offer price.
Mr Maystadt told the FT before the outcome of the ING-BBL talks was known
that the government had no intention of preventing a Dutch takeover, but
'would prefer that BBL remains in so-called Belgian hands'. Now it looks as
though he may get exactly what he wanted all along.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Belgium (2):
Maystadt faces the greatest challenge of his career - Andrew Hill profiles
the finance minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING AN almost uninterrupted 13-year period in government, Mr Philippe
Maystadt has headed each of Belgium's three money ministries - budget,
economic affairs and, since 1988, the top job of finance.
In 1990, aged only 42 and just two years into his term in office, he was
named Finance Minister of the Year by Euromoney magazine. The award  - which
he character- istically described at the time as an accolade for the
ministry team, not for him alone - was based on the series of financial
reforms which he had helped put in place.
He is justifiably proud of those achievements. In part- icular, he claims to
have changed 'the rules of the game' for takeovers, to prevent a repeat of
the clan- destine stake-building through which Mr Carlo De Benedetti nearly
gained control of Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding
company, five years ago.
Now that the smoke has cleared away from Belgium's 'big bang', it is obvious
that, in some cases, the noise was greater than the actual changes wrought.
Recession has held back some of Belgium's financial markets. In particular,
the Brussels stock exchange does not yet compete with larger European
markets in the way in which Mr Maystadt might have hoped, and the embryonic
futures and options exchange has not yet taken off.
On the other hand, Mr Maystadt's policy of linking Belgium's currency firmly
to the Deutsche Mark has certainly paid off, both in terms of general
investor confidence, and in the government bond market, where, helped by
parallel reforms of the market itself, Mr Maystadt has had no difficulty in
overfunding the government deficit in successive years.
Now, however, he faces the greatest challenges of his career, at home and
abroad. Within Belgium, as a member of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene's shaky
centre-left coalition, he must convince fellow citizens that a stringent
economic policy is essential to their future well-being. At the same time,
he must seek ways of reviving the run-down industrial areas of Belgium -
including Charleroi, where he was brought up - and making them attractive to
outside investors.
As a francophone Social Christian, Mr Maystadt speaks with the same
political voice as Mr Dehaene, a Flemish Christian Democrat. If the
government fails, or goes soft under domestic political pressure, then the
risk is that the budget deficit will 'snowball' out of control, and Belgium
will miss the first train to European monetary union (Emu).
In fact, Belgium's European and domestic economic ambitions are identical.
Mr Maystadt believes it is 'essential' that his country is in the same Emu
group as the Netherlands, France and Germany. In addition, the Emu target
figure of a budget deficit of 3 per cent of gross domestic product
'corresponds exactly to what is needed in Belgium to get rid of the snowball
effect'. In that sense, says Mr Maystadt, the Maastricht treaty is only 'one
more good reason' for reducing the country's budget deficit.
Parliamentary approval of the parallel constitutional reform programme -
which devolves more powers to Belgium's regions and lang- uage communities -
will strengthen Mr Maystadt's hand. The government has already had to revise
its orig- inal 1993 budget plans - critic- ised as too soft by economic
analysts - to take account of slipping growth forecasts.
According to Mr Maystadt, who fronts his country's economic policy in the
EC, those adjustments have been welcomed by Belgium's Community partners.
Critic- ised in the past for a lack of political courage, he is sure that
the country can make it into the promised land of monetary union.
'We really have no choice: we have to go on with the convergence programme
even if the Maastricht treaty is not ratified, because that is the only way
to cut the snowball effect definitively. We are determined to go on,' he
says.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Belgium (1):
Keeping in the fast lane - Business wants to attract outside investment and
yet retain a degree of national management autonomy. This is a perennial
dilemma for Belgium, which is certain to be at the core of the European
single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM is inexorably moving towards economic and monetary union with its
neighbours - Maastricht treaty or no Maastricht treaty.
EC-wide approval of Maastricht would of course profit a small country like
Belgium, but if ratification cannot be achieved and a two-speed economic
Europe is the only alternative, Mr Philippe Maystadt, the country's finance
minister, says Belgium will be in the fast lane.
'We export 75 per cent (of total exports) to our partners in the European
Community, and 60 per cent towards our three direct neighbours,' he says.
'It is essential for Belgium to be in the same group as Germany, France and
the Netherlands.'
It was Mr Maystadt who decided to tie the Belgian franc to the D-Mark in
June 1990, a policy acclaimed by both the IMF and OECD in recent reports on
the Belgian economy.
'In a way, we have already lost our sovereignty, at least in the monetary
field,' he admits. 'We see monetary union as a way to recover collectively
that sovereignty. At least in a European central bank we would have
something to say. Today (when the Bundesbank makes monetary decisions which
affect the Belgian economy) we have no say.'
With or without the treaty, Mr Maystadt says Belgium must continue to aim
for the Emu criteria - in particular, the strict requirement to bring the
country's large budget deficit down to 3 per cent of gross national product
by 1996.
For the long-term outside investor in Belgium, such determination must be
good news. It means that, geographically and politically, Belgium is certain
to be at the core of the European single market.
Recent events have shown the value of this strategy - particularly links
with the D-Mark. Mr Marcel Cockaerts, chairman of Kredietbank, one of
Belgium's three largest banks, points out that the Belgian franc stayed firm
amid September's European currency turmoil, and at one point was even
stronger than the D-Mark.
'To step back from (the policy of shadowing the D-Mark) would mean the loss
of our credibility for the next 100 years,' he warns.
However, in spite of this stable foundation, the government must overcome a
number of short-term domestic hurdles before it can rest.
The centre-left coalition - formed in March - has introduced rigorous 1993
budget measures aimed at bringing the budget deficit down to 5.2 per cent of
GNP by the end of next year. That compares with 6.3 per cent for 1991 and a
forecast 5.9 per cent for the end of this year.
But whether the government has the political clout to keep to this line
largely depends on the parallel attempt to push through long-awaited
constitutional reform.
This package would devolve more powers, including financial
responsibilities, to Belgium's regions and linguistic communities. The
latest signs are that the government will be able to win the two-thirds
majority it requires in parliament for such reform, albeit narrowly.
Approval would immeasurably strengthen the government - and its economic
policy.
Where does that leave the humble investor or business in Belgium?
Analysts say the political turmoil - as always in Belgium - has made little
difference to business. Most Belgian companies remain in the doldrums,
becalmed by the same economic downturn that is hampering their counter-
parts in the rest of Europe.
Few forecasters predict GNP growth of more than 1.6 per cent this year, and
2 per cent next year. The average forecast is more like 1.4 or 1.5 per cent
for 1992. Since 1990, annual investment growth has slowed down from 12 or 13
per cent to less than 3 per cent.
Mr Jan Herremans, director of the economic department at the Federation des
Entreprises de Belgique (FEB), says that orders from overseas are very low
and there is little sign of improvement this year or in the first half of
1993.
Domestically, according to a recent report from Namur Assurances du Credit,
Belgian companies are suffering from the diminishing profitability of
capital stock, high interest rates and the general drop in profits. As a
result, the Belgian credit insurer expects bankruptcies this year to exceed
5,000 for the first time. Company failures, Namur says, have increased by
26.7 per cent against 1991 in the third quarter alone.
The gloom is reflected in the stock market, where most industrial stocks
which dominate the Brussels bourse are still bumping along the bottom of
their cycle.
Exceptions include the Belgian banks, buoyed up by takeover news and ripe
for rationalisation. Analysts admit it is not clear how such changes will
come about. The social and financial cost of a merger between the big
players - each of which has a branch on every Belgian high street - would be
too great to countenance.
Nonetheless, it is obvious that banks which continue to concentrate on the
Belgian market are not going to prosper once internal EC frontiers come
down.
One possible route is takeover from outside Belgium, or co-oper- ation with
other financial institutions. For example, Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL),
another of the Belgian big three banks, has been courted recently by
Internationale Nederlanden Groep, the Dutch banking and insurance group. A
bid and co-operation in the lucrative 'bancassurance' field was under
consideration.
BBL's announcement 10 days ago that the bid would not take place has spared
Belgian business further heart-searching about one of the country's
perennial dilemmas: how to attract outside investment and yet ensure that
Belgian companies retain a certain national management autonomy.
Mr Cockaerts of Krediet- bank, for example, says he would consider it 'an
impoverishment of the whole of Belgium' if too many great Belgian names were
lost to foreign buyers.
Abandonment of the ING/BBL deal will not kill this highly political issue.
It is bound to come to a head when the government - bent on privatisation -
announces the first sales of state-owned enterprises before Christmas.
In the context of the long-standing tension between French- and
Flemish-speakers in Belgium, this is not just a question of national pride.
For example, the government of Flemish-speaking Flanders is already
expressing its concern that the state might favour sales to francophone
buyers.
In reality, however, there is little that can be done to prevent foreigners
buying into Belgium - and indeed there is little that the government wants
to do.
Belgian business can only lament that after the war, when other countries
were building up national champions through restrictive share structures and
general protectionism, a job-starved Belgium was opening its borders and
boardrooms to all-comers.
It was perhaps a case, agrees Mr Jean Peterbroeck, the distinguished broker
who heads the Brussels bourse, of too much free trade, too soon.
More optimistically, however, it is now an indication of the continuing
attractiveness of Belgium to foreign investors, in spite of the downturn.
The government has done its best to maintain the incentive for inward
investment, by pursuing its successful 'co-ordination centres' initiative -
tax breaks for multinationals which establish administrative headquarters in
Belgium.
At the same time, Belgium's regions - Flanders, French- speaking Wallonia
and Brussels itself - play an important role in attracting investment, as
befits a country which will formally become a federal state if
constitutional reform is approved.
Mr Georges Walckiers, who heads BBL's corporate finance department, warns
potential investors against reading too much into the unduly gloomy picture
of a Belgium saddled with large debts and riven by regional strife.
If Belgians were asked to be frank about their country's attractions, Mr
Walckiers suggests they might quote Talleyrand.
Asked what he thought of himself, the French statesman replied: 'Tres peu
quand je me considere, beaucoup quand je me compare' - not much when I
consider myself, but a great deal when I compare myself to others.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (19): A variety of skills
needed - A look at how to stage a buy-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST buy-outs have one thing in common. They are carried out by management
teams who have never done it before. This makes negotiating a buy-out a
particularly stressful experience for the managers involved.
Executives, often from small corporate divisions or subsidiaries and without
a financial background, find themselves dealing with venture capitalists,
bankers and other financial specialists for the first time.
However, a wealth of specialist advice can be called upon from accountants,
lawyers and the venture capitalists themselves. The buy-out is now much
better understood as a means of restructuring business than it was a few
years ago and wide range of literature is available.
The first step is to put together a management team. Financial backers
expect to see a well-balanced group of managers headed, preferably, by some
with managing director experience. It will probably also have to include
people with financial, marketing and production skills.
The financiers will be looking to back people with senior experience but who
have also not lost touch with the realities of doing business. Running your
own small company is very different from managing part of a large
organisation with extensive support systems in place.
Keep the buy-out team to a manageable size. Most involve three or four
people. This is enough to provide a spread of skills while reducing the risk
of disagreements.
It is also important at an early stage to find out whether your business
might be available to buy. Some large companies refuse outright to allow
buy-outs on the grounds that if there is untapped potential in the business
it should be exploited within the corporate structure.
However, the depths of the present recession have meant that far more
corporations are being forced to consider the sale of non-core or
under-performing parts of the business. Managers are still advised to tread
warily when approaching head office about a buy-out in case an unwelcome
approach damages their career prospects. It may make sense to use an
accountant or another business advisor to make an anonymous approach in the
first instance.
If it is for sale, will your proposed buy-out be able to attract finance?
Venture capitalists and other financial backers prefer to support mature
businesses in low technology areas with strong positive cash flows.
The bankers in particular want to be sure that cash flows will amply cover
interest charges and will not be keen to support businesses with uncertain
prospects.
Advisers should be chosen for their experience in the buy-out field and for
their ability to get on at a personal level with the management. You will
soon know if the size of the deal contemplated is suited to the financial
backer.
The adviser will be able to help management over what is often the most
daunting obstacle - negotiating with the boss. Many managers find it
difficult to adopt a dispassionate negotiating stance.
The professional adviser can take the heat out of the negotiations and is
also freer to point out any the weaknesses of the business.
The advisers will also be able to help with the preparation of a business
plan though it must remain demonstrably the work of the management team. It
should explain the background to the buy-out and describe the managers'
experience, the products, the market and the strategy for future
development. Summaries of past and projected profits, balance sheets and
cash flows should be included.
The plan should start with a short summary of the main points. Unless this
grabs the venture capitalist's attention he is unlikely to go on and read
the rest of the plan. Avoid unduly elaborate plans. Financial backers are
rarely impressed with elaborate projections of the future which can be upset
by any number of unforeseen circumstances.
The financial commitment demanded of the managers may be small in terms of
the overall cost of the deal - managers would typically be expected to put
up between Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 50,000 each - but it is still likely to
be a considerable sum in relation to the individual's financial resources.
In return, the managers will obtain a stake in the ordinary equity which far
exceeds their relative financial contribution. Backers are happy to go along
with this because they believe the managers will be highly motivated to do
well.
Some buy-outs involve 'ratchets' - agreements whereby the managers increase
their shareholding if they meet certain targets. Ratchets have fallen out of
favour recently because they are seen as further complicating the deal and
encouraging a short-term approach on the part of the management.
What happens if the buy-out does not go ahead? Professional fees may already
have mounted up. It is common practice to reach an agreement with the vendor
for him to meet these costs. If this is impossible the leading financial
backer will normally agree to pay.
Even as they are negotiating their independence, managers need to give some
thought to what will happen in three to five years time when their financial
backer may be thinking of an 'exit'. Financiers normally expect to sell or
float the business so as to realise their capital gain. The route chosen
will depend on how well the business does, on stock market sentiment and on
whether a potential buyer is looking for acquisitions at the time.
The buy-out period is an exhausting time because management has to run the
business while conducting negotiations. Once the deal is struck managers can
concentrate on the business. They are then likely to find that running a
completely independent company without head office to rely on for support
requires a new set of management skills.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (16): A conflict of interests
 -The role of accountants in MBOs has come into question
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFLICT and economic uncertainty are vexing many of the accountancy firms
involved in the buy-out market of the early 1990s.
Most remain bullish about prospects for business. But they are having to
adapt their cultures to match new demands on their services.
Mr Richard Mead, national director of corporate finance at Ernst &amp; Young,
says: 'It's been a funny market recently and very different from two years
ago. But we have had a relatively good flow of business, particularly in our
regional offices.'
Mr Andy Pollock, senior partner of Rees Pollock, a small firm started just
over two years ago by accountants from Ernst &amp; Young, is optimistic. 'There
is money around,' he says. 'As interest rates fall, there will be a better
rate of return.'
What does continue is what he calls the 'lunchtime entrepreneurs' who say
they are interested in MBOs. He says he can screen out those who will not
make it when they start asking about the hours involved, their salary and
whether they will be able to keep the company car.
For others, the volume of business has slowed to some degree, in part
because deals are taking longer to come to fruition. The difficulties have
been particularly intense for the larger prospective MBOs.
The main problem, according to Mr Mead, is the paucity of senior debt. Banks
which need to syndicate loans for the larger MBOs have lacked the confidence
to do so.
'We are much busier than we were three or four years ago,' says Mr Chris
Beresford, head of the MBO unit at KPMG Peat Marwick. 'But there is a degree
of nervousness around.'
He says banks realise they are more vulnerable after some of the highly
leveraged deals of the late 1980s failed. They also face the uncertainty of
the UK economy.
The accountants' role in MBOs needs to be kept in perspective. Mr Beresford
pours scorn on those firms claiming to hold sway in deals. 'It's not
realistic,' he says. 'You can only say you have lead a deal if you have
structured, financed and negotiated its terms.'
There is a possibility that accountancy firms could provide for finance for
deals. But the prospects are negligible - even apart from the issue of
expertise. 'We haven't got the money,' says Mr Mead.
More importantly, accountants financing deals would raise further potential
conflicts of interest, he says. 'As soon as we do that, we are out of the
contest for on-going audit work and we like to develop a long-term
relationship.'
That is because existing professional ethical rules forbid an auditor from
holding shares in a client company. Mr Mead says that, as far as Ernst &amp;
Young is concerned, it would apply equally to other on-going services for a
client.
In fact, the accounting firms' activities in MBOs involve two principal
areas:
Personal and corporate tax, business structuring, business plan development
and other advisory work to the management team.
Investigating accountancy and due diligence work for the financiers
considering backing the MBO.
Mr Beresford estimates that his firm spends about three times as many hours
on investigation work as on advisory work for management teams.
On the one hand, management advisory work can be far more commercially
attractive, he says. On the other, a good relationship needs to be
maintained with the finance houses by bringing them deals, to ensure that
they turn to the firm to pass on due diligence work. That means bringing the
teams to finance institutions.
One aspect of the work which can raise tensions with other, more
conservative parts of the accountancy firms is the application of
contingency fees, geared around payment only if the buy-out is successful.
'We prefer not to have contingency fees,' says Mr Beresford. 'We are still
very old-fashioned. We think of working for an hour and getting paid for an
hour. But we have got used to the idea, with a premium for success and a
modest fee for failure.'
A second area that is causing increasing tensions is the possibility of
conflict of interest. Mr Pollock's firm tries to generate most work from
finance houses such as 3i and AIB Capital Markets. 'Can you be truly
independent if you introduce MBOs?' he says. 'It's a very grey area. On the
other hand, you need to bring them in if you want the finance houses to
bring deals to you. We don't want to be cut off.'
He asks whether an accountant can be objective. In the extreme, they may
strike a bargain with financiers to whom they have made the introduction but
from whom they are looking for other business.
They could be carrying out due diligence on numbers they have have audited
and on projections they may have prepared. They may ultimately hope to gain
the audit of the numbers once the deal is done.
Mr Douglas Llambias, chief executive of the Business Exchange, a network of
professionals for buying and selling businesses for up to about Pounds 20m,
says he will not accept the accountants trying to introduce potential deals
to levy contingency fees, or for the company's auditor to carry out advisory
work.
'Contingency fees are not appropriate,' he says. 'When the potential fees
are large, the pressure is enormous to get the deal done whether it is for
the best or not.'
With regard to the auditor, he sees it as 'improper' that a firm supposedly
acting in the best interests of the shareholders should be able to support a
buy-out.
Mr Beresford admits that some finance houses not happy with the accountants
bringing them the deal and also conducting the due diligence. But he says:
'You have to be grown up about it. I would far rather it was a friendly guy
from my own firm who found an error rather than someone from a rival firm.
If there is a problem it is in everyone's interests that it is unearthed.'

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (14): Quick work needed -
Profile: Fifth Avenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HESTER THOMAS

<TEXT>
MR PAUL FABIAN divides the six days which followed the fateful afternoon of
Friday September 4, 1992, into various parts: the surreal, the worst and the
best.
This was the week he and Mr Brian Worth, through a new company they formed -
 -Idealdirect, which would trade as Fifth Avenue - acquired the business and
assets of Fifth Avenue Ltd, for an unspecified amount, from the receivers of
the Berkertex Group.
Based just off London's Oxford Street, Fifth Avenue supplies retailers and
mail order houses such as Littlewoods, C&amp;A, Etam, British Home Stores and
Burtons, mainly with ladies garments.
With a turnover of Pounds 13.6m and a profit of Pounds 525,000 in 1991-2,
Fifth Avenue Ltd represented approximately 30 per cent of the activities of
its parent, Berkertex Group.
There was little synergy between Berkertex and Fifth Avenue Ltd. The former
made dresses, the latter made separates and each operated virtually
independently of the other.
It therefore came as no surprise when, in November 1991, Berkertex asked Mr
Fabian and Mr Worth if they would like to conduct a management buy-out.
A price was agreed on and Fifth Avenue Ltd's directors put together a deal
which involved financial backing from the Bank of Ireland and 3i. At the
last minute Berkertex Group decided it had undervalued the business and
asked for an extra Pounds 500,000 more or, as Mr Fabian puts it, 'a golden
wave goodbye'.
The deal fell through. Disappointed as he was, Mr Fabian says: 'It did give
us a chance to put our toes in the water, go through all the necessary
budgeting, cash-flows and presentations to financial institutions.'
Fifth Avenue Ltd went on to have a successful year of trading. By September
1992, it had accrued Pounds 2.2m in its account at the Bank of Scotland and
owed creditors around Pounds 650,000.
In the meantime, it was becoming increasingly apparent to Fifth Avenue Ltd,
that Berkertex was experiencing trading difficulties. 'We could see they
were in trouble,' says Mr Fabian, 'but the problem was determining when they
would become insolvent.'
As the situation deteriorated, Mr Fabian got in touch with Blick Rothenberg
(the accountants which had assisted with the failed 1991 MBO) and 3i, to
warn them that their services might be needed again.
At midday on Friday, September 4 Mr Fabian was contacted by the Bank of
Scotland. He was told the directors of Berkertex Group had informed the bank
that they were unable to continue to trade. The bank was drawing in its
loans and overdraft facilities. Touche Ross had been appointed as receivers.
Mr Fabian was summoned to an immediate meeting with the bank at which Fifth
Avenue Ltd, under its joint guarantee responsibility for the overall debt of
the group, was asked to deposit Pounds 12.5m to cover the debt. 'It became
surreal,' recalls Mr Fabian. 'I told them they could have the Pounds 2.2m
(accrued in its account at the Bank of Scotland) but that I didn't happen to
have the other Pounds 10.3m on me.'
Mr Fabian and his co-director went into action. They contacted Blick
Rothenberg and 3i, then made an appointment to see the receiver.
On Saturday, the receiver explained that he had a duty to sell the business
to the person who came up with the best offer. Sunday was spent with Blick
Rothenberg working on a business plan.
Monday morning, Mr Fabian had a meeting with Barclays Bank, Langham Place to
ask for a Pounds 500,000 overdraft facility. The afternoon was spent in
negotiations with the receiver and contacting solicitors to put the MBO
paperwork in place.
On Tuesday, the directors organised funding. On Wednesday morning, Barclays
Bank confirmed the overdraft facility and negotiations continued with the
receivers. By Thursday afternoon, the MBO purchase from the receiver was
complete. Idealdirect had been formed.
Mr Worth and Mr Fabian hold 77. 5 per cent of the shares in equal quantities
between them, while 3i holds the rest. Funding for the directors' part of
the business came from a large, short-term loan from a supplier, personal
savings, guarantees and loans. 'That was the worst part,' says Mr Fabian.
'Having to give personal guarantees and realising what that commitment
meant.'
Mr Fabian and his partner paid substantially less for the business than the
1991 asking price. 'It was a forced sale and you've got all the risks
inherent in purchasing from the receiver,' he explains. 'There are no
warranties.'
Among many issues was that of whether suppliers and customers, affected by
the receivership of Fifth Avenue Ltd, would want to trade with Idealdirect.
'We were desperately lucky,' says Mr Fabian. 'We have a history of trust and
mutual respect built up over 18 years of trading and it served us well.'
The MBO was completed as quickly as possible for sound reasons. 'It was a
question of confidence; given a further week we thought the business would
disappear,' he explains.
Although Idealdirect is not liable for the debts of Fifth Avenue Ltd, Mr
Fabian and Mr Worth are making agreed ex-gratia payments to suppliers. 'We
feel our reputation is at stake,' explains Mr Fabian. Employees have also
been paid wages overdue from the period of collapse.
Mr Fabian has no qualms about conducting a MBO in the middle of a recession.
'We're trading well with turnover 10 per cent up on last year, we've got our
costs under control and I'm confident about the future,' he says.
Eight weeks on, Mr Fabian admits he still has not quite come down from the
high he experienced at the end of the MBO.
'The best part,' he says, 'was coming back to the office after it had all
gone through, knowing we'd saved everyone's job and finding the staff had
put on a surprise party.'

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (13): Deals flow steadily -
The Regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE-and-a-half weeks ago, Interactive Media Services (IMS), a Leeds-based
telephone information specialist, was bought by its management from the
troubled Brent Walker Group in a Pounds 12.7m deal.
The Leeds office of 3i arranged the funding, bringing in Murray Johnstone
and County NatWest Ventures jointly to buy Pounds 7m of equity. Debt
facilities came from the Bank of Scotland's Edinburgh office, a specialist
in assessing risk for IMS's low asset, high cash-flow type of operation.
IMS is the largest UK user of British Telecom's premium rate network,
providing sports information services using 0891 numbers.
Its most recent coup was to secure an exclusive three-year contract with the
Test and County Cricket Board so people can dial in for the latest scores,
making money for both IMS and the game.
The deal was typical of the sort of buy-out activity under way in Britain's
regions. A large group needed to divest a sound but non-core business.
Selling to the management made the most sense for continuity and
professional expertise was on hand locally.
Crucially for the industrial and commercial infrastructure of the regions,
the parent group's own problems did not automatically spell doom for a
healthy subsidiary, as has happened in past recessions.
In the IMS case, Mr Bill Wilson, the chief executive, turned to Coopers &amp;
Lybrand in Leeds for financial advice and to Booth &amp; Co, one of the Leeds
'big five' commercial law firms which have made the regional capital
Britain's strongest legal centre outside London.
Two weeks later, it was Manchester's turn, when its network of professionals
arranged the management buy-out of Celmac, the UK's leading manufacturer of
toilet seats, from Burmah Castrol, which had picked up the non-core business
last year when it acquired Foseco.
Nearly all the same national firms of professionals were involved in Celmac
as with IMS. However, it was their Manchester offices this time, with
Barclays Development Capital investing rather than Murray Johnstone and the
Manchester firm of Eversheds Alexander Tatham doing the legal work.
As Mr Charles Richardson, a 3i main board director, puts it: 'While some
people thought the buy-out was a late 1980s phenomenon, time is proving them
wrong. There are some very good ones around now - especially in the regions,
and at lower prices.'
Mr Richardson is responsible for the seven 3i offices in northern England
and Scotland. A drive on overheads has seen 3i close its small bureaux in
Sheffield and Hull this year, to centre operations on Leeds. It is also
moving to smaller, more economic offices in Edinburgh, putting its
prestigious but over-large building in Charlotte Square on the market.
Mr Richardson says this is to save overheads in cost-conscious times, not
because there is a shortage of work. Indeed, 3i's latest published figures
show Pounds 66.5m invested in 81 management buy-outs in the Midlands, north
and Scotland in the year to last April.
The north-west had most money - Pounds 18.5m - for 12 deals. The East
Midlands used Pounds 16m in 17 deals and Scotland Pounds 14.5m in 24.
While most deals are relatively small compared with the highly-leveraged
ones of the late 1980s, regional work is steady.
The past six months have even seen some larger deals. Standard Fireworks,
based in West Yorkshire, was bought from Scottish Heritable Trust in a
Pounds 27m deal; Swift Transport, in the East Midlands, was a Pounds 26m
buy-out from LEP; in the north-west, Tulchan Textiles' management needed
Pounds 15m to separate from a privately-owned leisurewear parent, and Taco
Holdings was in a Pounds 10m deal with its parent, a polyethylene film
manufacturer.
Ten years ago, the local networks of professionals who put these deals
together did not exist, so neither did the deals. With local knowledge and
contacts essential to good deal-making, the change from the recession of
1980-1982 is profound, enabling more businesses to survive and corporate
ownership to spread.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand's experience illustrates how fertile this ground is. In
spite of his name, Mr Paul Southern is in charge of northern operations,
which he says have grown at a rate of 70 per cent a year for seven years and
now involve 37 fee-earners, plus supporting staff, in the north alone.
According to the latest report of the Centre for Management Buy-out Research
at Nottingham University, the south-east's pre-eminence in buy-out markets
is slipping. It accounted for only 35.9 per cent of buy-outs in the first
half of this year, compared with 38.1 per cent in 1991.
The north-west has accounted for 10 per cent of the national total in the
past 18 months, while the south-west's share rose from 5 per cent in 1990
and 1991 to 8.2 per cent in the six months to June this year. Meanwhile, the
north-east and Cumbria achieved a record share of deals at 5.2 per cent of
the national total for the six months.
Scottish and Yorkshire's shares dipped slightly in the six months, but this
may reflect a slowdown in the time taken to do them. Mr Southern says the
more cautious economic climate means it takes three or four times longer to
close a deal now than in the late 1980s. Six or eight months is typical.
Discussions with IMS started last year.
Raw numbers may well be a better indicator: the south-west recorded 19
buy-outs in the first half of 1992, after averaging 10 per half-year since
the beginning of 1989.
By contrast, the bigger south-east regional economy saw more than 100 deals
in the first half of 1991, but only 67 in the second half. The figure picked
up to 83 in six months to last July, but the directions of the two regional
trends is obvious.
Mr Richardson of 3i says: 'There is more caution all round, but there is a
good enough flow of buy-out proposals for this to be our main activity
today.
'Prices are well into single-figure multiples of earnings, compared with up
to 14 four or five years ago, when earnings were also higher.'
Four or five times earnings is the current price level quoted by other
professionals, such as KPMG Peat Marwick's Manchester office.
Does this mean, therefore, that the higher-priced buy-outs of previous years
have run into trouble in the recession because their managers paid too much?
'Most have proved remarkably resilient,' Mr Richardson says.
'One or two have failed, a few have been refinanced, but most have been able
to continue. It proves the virtues of owner-management: they have an
incentive to succeed. Also, good managers see things coming, adjust to
problems, take difficult decisions early and plan their way through.'
Capital providers say this latter point is a principal reason managers win
their backing in the first place. Mr Southern says three other ingredients
also have to be present: 'Cash, cash and cash.' These always improve
recession-resistance.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (15): Leading the blind - The
Lawyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX FINDLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MBO LAWYERS think of themselves as businessmen and women first and lawyers
second.
Often their key role is to supervise the deal. 'There's a huge amount of
transaction management,' says Allen &amp; Overy's Mr Anthony Keal. 'Particularly
in multi-jurisdictional MBOs.' According to Mr John Kitching from Lovell
White Durrant, this is particularly true when acting for the finance
providers: 'The institutions are looking for lawyers to project manage a
transaction.'
That means the legal advisers are not asked simply to handle the formal
technicalities. 'The client would be disappointed if you just gave legal
advice,' says Mr Geoffrey Green from Ashurst Morris Crisp.
'You're also asked to be a constructive problem solver and to give a much
more rounded, judgmental view of the transaction.'
It is an approach shared by others, including Mr Derham O'Nell at Clifford
Chance: 'Lawyers are increasingly involved at the strategic level and are
used as a commercial sounding board. For example, we're sometimes asked
about the public relations effects of a deal.'
Buy-outs are now fewer and smaller, so an outsider would assume that
competition between leading law firms has heated up considerably. MBO
lawyers are split on the issue, however.
Mr James Davis from Freshfields thinks not. 'Although occasionally
financiers will go to a new law firm as a trusted second string -
particularly when there is a conflict of interest - they're more concerned
with quality and value for money than nitpicking on price.'
Mr Green from Ashurst Morris Crisp would agree with the insistence on
quality but is certain that 'competition between lawyers is much fiercer
than, say, a year ago'.
It is a view shared by his counterparts in other firms. Mr Anthony Lewis
from Cameron Markby Hewitt says: 'Increasingly, venture capitalists won't
take all their work to just one law firm.' Stephen Barnard from Herbert
Smith adds: 'Clients are now much more likely to move around and people are
working harder to keep the client happier.'
If the financiers are staying with their established lawyers for the larger
deals, it may be that they are more cautious because of the economically
tight conditions. Mr Jonathan Blake from S J Berwin believes that
'institutions like to deal with lawyers they feel comfortable with and who
they know can handle the technical issues'.
As Mr Peter Turnbull from Macfarlanes points out, 'if you're the person
buying in the external legal services, you can't go wrong instructing a
recognised name. Someone who does the job more cheaply won't do it better.'
Perhaps the greatest benefit experienced practitioners can offer clients is
the saving of time. Lawyers well versed in MBOs know which are the main
points in the transaction and can save time, money and their clients'
patience by not wrangling over minor details.
However, the senior regional firms have not - as was once predicted - broken
into the top ranks of MBO legal advisers. Many believe this is because the
larger London firms have far greater resources and experience than their
country cousins who are best at doing small deals more cheaply than their
classier City brethren.
Lovell's Mr Kitching disagrees. 'Law firms can break into this market. It's
the relationships with the finance providers which count and in many cases
the regional firms have built and continue to build those relationships.'
So does it matter which of the top firms you go to? It is generally agreed
that the leading firms can handle the technical issues equally competently.
But as Mr David Ereira from Freshfields points out, 'there are distinct
differences in terms of the approach and the culture. So it's a question of
how the service is delivered by a particular firm'.
That is all very well for the financiers who have long-established
connections with a wide range of suitable law firms. But for the management
team, this will almost certainly be their first and only MBO the choice of a
lawyer is more difficult.
'The venture capitalists are keen to advise management on which firm to use
as lack of expertise slows the whole process down,' says Mr Ian Sears from
Clifford Chance.
'The management will have their accountants sitting beside them and the
accountants will know the form and who's worth going to,' says Mr Lewis from
Cameron Markby Hewitt. 'In the end, personal chemistry is often the reason
why a management team chooses a particular law firm,' he adds.
Legal fees are a critical issue. 'If the deal hits the buffers, then we
would expect to share the financial burden with the banks by charging at a
lower rate,' says Mr Keal from Allen &amp; Overy. The rigorous control of
expenditure is confirmed by Mr Barnard from Herbert Smith: 'People are very
tight on fees these days and you have to justify your charges every step of
the way.'
Often great pressure is put on a law firm to operate on a flexible fee
basis. Rarely will a leading London practice agree to work on a strict 'no
deal, no pay' arrangement but more flexible arrangements are possible. For
instance, initial discussions and certain categories of preliminary work may
well be carried out for no - or a heavily reduced - fee.
Mr John Penson from Lovell White Durrant says: 'It is easier for me to adopt
a more flexible approach to billing for an established client than for a
complete newcomer. It also gives the client less incentive to shop around
and demonstrates that we're being sensitive to the transaction.'
In an economically depressed market, lawyers are clearly as aware as
everyone else of the limitations of one-off deals.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (11): Damage not permanent -
France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA CASASSUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE buy-outs may be suffering from the general economic downturn, damage
should only be temporary since a sizeable pool of candidates for such deals
still exists.
The lack of takers when founders of medium-sized family firms retire
continues to lead to a number of closures each year - a problem aggravated
by today's shaky corporate climate. 'There is a large reservoir of
enterprises to be financed by leveraged buy-outs,' said Mr Dominique
Peninon, director of Alpha Associates and vice-president of the French
Venture Capital Association, AFIC.
Even more small companies close because of handover problems, but most of
these are not in line for leveraged deals, in some cases, simply because
they do not want to sell out to anyone at any price.
However, the MBO is not the panacea for the problem of succession that some
thought it would be, according to Gilles Cahen-Salvador, president of LBO
France, the largest adviser and practitioner in France. 'Targets must be
profitable with clear prospects since they must reply a large debt. Very few
fit this bill,' he said.
The recent progress of the sector is difficult to asses. Changes in
statistical definitions deprive most year-to-year comparisons of meaning,
according to AFIC. The only figure that stands up is that for the average
size of buy-outs and buy-ins, which rose from FFr3.3m (Dollars .61m) in 1990
to FFr5.5m in 1991.
Most operators are biding their time until the economy turns around, banks
become braver and the prices of companies fall to more realistic levels.
Asking prices are lower than they were two years ago, but the drop is 'not
very significant yet', says Mr Daniel Toutlemonde, a partner in Suez Finance
Conseil. He expects further declines in 1993.
Banks have been more cautious about lending for highly-leveraged deals, even
though the gearing - or debt-to-equity ratio - has come down sharply over
the past three years.
Although this reflects leaner times, the reverse was welcomed at a time when
fears were mounting that France would follow the US with its over-leveraged
transactions and sometimes spectacular corporate collapses.
Buy-ins are increasing in importance. Nearly all deals used to be buy-outs,
says Mr Cahen-Salvador, because there was no supply of proficient outside
managers to be tapped. Now, however, more quality managers are available
and, says Mr Maurice Tchenio, director of Apax Partners &amp; Cie, since the
companies involved are less profitable, they need an fresh injection of
expertise as well as cash.
For Mr Cahen-Salvador's LBO France, buy-ins are now running equal to
buy-outs numerically, while for Mr Toutlemonde at Suez, buy-ins are now in
the majority.
While most agree on the direction of MBO activity, obstacles caused by tax
issues are hotly debated. Fiscal integration is allowed only if the
transaction covers 95 per cent of the new company's capital, which upsets
some operators but not others.
Mr Cahen-Salvador is an outspoken critic of the rule, claiming that one
recalcitrant member of an owning family with a stake of only 5.01 per cent
can prevent an attractive deal taking place. He claims that even a 5
percentage point cut in the threshold would help under current tax laws.
Mr Tchenio, however, believes the 95 per cent rule is not much of a brake.
Problems can arise, he says, with listed companies and dispersed
shareholdings, but these have little impact on the underlying need for MBOs
or other LBOs.
There are ways around the difficulty, says Mr Jean-Francois Court, chairman
of AFIC's fiscal and legislation committee. One way is for a holding company
to charge the operating subsidiary management fees, which reduces the tax
bill and neutralises the lack of integration.
Scrapping the rule is 'not a priority', even though it would be simplify
procedures, he says. More important is to obtain greater flexibility over
exoneration of capital gains tax on venture capital funds' investments in
companies with at least 50 per cent of their shares listed in EC countries.
The problem is that this applies only if the target holding company holds at
least 40 per cent of the voting rights in its operating subsidiary, which is
rarely the case with multi-tier corporate structures, Mr Court explains. He
has been lobbying the Finance Ministry for a change, and hopes for a reply
before the end of the year.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (10): Activity still sluggish
 -The US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN AIR of dreary inactivity hangs over the management buy-out business in
the US. Few deals are being done, many leveraged buy-out funds are
embarrassingly flush with funds and existing MBOs, undertaken in the heady
1980s, are mainly interested in refinancing their balance sheets, replacing
high levels of borrowings with either equity or a less expensive debt
securities.
Industry figures paint the picture clearly. According to Securities Data,
the financial information services group, the current year has generated 124
management buy-out deals, with a total value of Dollars 4.87bn (this is
measured in terms of deals announced, not necessarily completed, and the
cumulative total runs up until November 16).
This level of activity is roughly on a par with the equally drab levels seen
in 1991. Then, in the 12-month period, 170 transactions were announced, with
an aggregate value of Dollars 4.79bn. This, in turn, repeated the 1990
experience, when managements and deal-makers produced 175 deals, with a
combined total value of Dollars 5.61bn.
But in all three years - 1990, 1991, and 1992 - activity was way short of
the veritable feast of MBOs undertaken in the late-1980s. In 1989, for
example, the industry notched up 296 transactions, with a value of Dollars
34.4bn while in 1988, the figures ran at 294, with a heady aggregate value
of Dollars 84.5bn.
The reasons for this drop-off in activity have been well-explored. For a
start, the crisis in the US commercial banking sector - fuelled by its
exposure to ailing property assets - has meant that banking support for
anything but the most conservatively-structured deal has been hard to
obtain.
Second, the recession has made the profitability of many businesses
unpredictable, and hence the stable cash-flow projections, essential to a
successful MBO, cannot be guaranteed.
In fact, the only significant management buy-out deal undertaken this year
has been the purchase of American Re-Insurance Company, a subsidiary of the
large Aetna Life &amp; Casualty insurance group, by a group led by Kolhberg,
Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street LBO specialists.
The deal put a price-tag of around Dollars 1.4bn on the reinsurance
business, and represented the first billion-dollar-plus deal engineered by
KKR since its record-breaking Dollars 25bn purchase of RJR Nabisco in 1989.
It was all the more surprising that this single billion-dollar MBO should
occur in the insurance sector, which was generally kept out of the
debt-financed takeover binge of the 1980s - not least by wary state
insurance regulators.
The AmRe deal, however, was complex and a less than 'clean' disposal on
Aetna's part. Although the seller received around Dollars 1.3bn in cash and
took a Dollars 78m gain on the sale into its third quarter results, the
Hartford-based insurer also provided a reinsurance contract to AmRe. This
provided that Aetna would meet 80 per cent of any AmRe incurred losses for
1991 or earlier that are still outstanding at January 1, 1992, and in excess
of Dollars 2.7bn. The maximum potential payment was capped at Dollars 500m.
After the AmRe transaction, the value of individual deals announced this
year falls away sharply. The next largest is the pending offer by a
management group and First Chicago Venture Capital, part of First Chicago
bank, for a variety of timber-related assets put up for sale by Procter &amp;
Gamble. According to Securities Data, the estimated bid price is Dollars
700m. P&amp;G announced that it intended to divest its entire wood pulp division
back in March, and has already agreed to sell part of the division to
Weyerhaeuser, the large West Coast timber company.
After that, there is the Dollars 525m purchase of MS/Essex Holdings, a New
York-based manufacturer of electric cable, wire and wire insulating
materials, by Bessmer Capital Partners, acting in conjunction with the
management and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the New York brokerage house.
In this case the seller was also an LBO investor - namely, the Morgan
Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II.
It is difficult to envisage any dramatic improvement in the climate for MBOs
in the US in the immediate future. Although there are some signs of an
improvement in the economic climate, they are tentative and the confidence
which suffused the 1980s is still sadly lacking. The banking industry, if
slowing recuperating, is scarcely healthy - and the real estate market
remains tough. In short, the MBO market could be caught in the doldrums for
a while yet.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (12): Cost of finance acts as
a deterrent - Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THIS year's results are not encouraging. The economic situation, high
interest rates and fiscal tightening mean that 1992 will definitely be worse
than 1991 for buy-outs in Italy,' says Mr Franco Papa, corporate finance
partner at KPMG Peat Marwick in Milan.
Not that last year provided much reason for enthusiasm. The firm's data base
shows that 16 operations in total were announced in 1991 - three fewer than
in 1990. Moreover, KPMG Peat Marwick says that the market value of deals
plunged by 53 per cent.
This year the value will probably decline further. According to Mr Dante
Razzano, Morgan Grenfell Italia's managing director, there have been no
significant buy-outs, above Dollars 100m, in Italy in 1992. 'A combination
of high interest rates and heightened consciousness of lending risks among
Italy's banks has reduced buy-out activity,' says Mr Razzano.
The cost of finance is the factor most frequently mentioned as a deterrent
to buy-outs. 'It is almost impossible to consider leveraged operations at
current interest rates,' says Mr Guido Belli, a senior executive with Sopaf
Group's Invest, a leading Italian investment bank.
The MBO deal by which Invest took a 70 per cent stake in the building
materials company SADI at the beginning of the year was one of four
mentioned by KPMG Peat Marwick. 'It is the only operation that we have
completed in 1992,' says Mr Belli.
The fact that yields offered by buy-outs in Italy are unattractive is not
only because of the high cost of money. Prices sought for businesses have
often been high, a factor that has also prevented the growth of buy-out
numbers. 'Many owners have held inflated ideas about the value of their
companies. Moreover, they believed that prices could only go up. But, after
the shocks of the summer and autumn, a sense of reality is beginning to
show,' says Mr Razzano.
Mr Jonathan Bliss, director of 3i, also remarks on greater pricing realism.
'Results in the corporate sector were disappointing in 1991 and businessmen
now recognise that outturns will be poor this year and that recovery is
unlikely next year. Prices are starting to reflect this.'
3i is not typical of buy-out operators in Italy, where it started business
two years ago; it wants only minority stakes and looks for longer term
investments. It also wants low gearing in operations in which it
participates, with debt to equity ratios of about one. 'We want to avoid the
higher risk that accompanies high gearing,' Mr Bliss says.
Schroder Associati is less concerned about debt/equity, but looks carefully
at debt/cash-flow.
'Interest cover is the key measure. The number of times that financing costs
are covered by the company's cash-flow is what counts,' says Mr Paolo
Colonna, the firm's director.
Schroder Associati has been involved in about 40 operations over the past
four years, taking majority stakes in small and medium-sized companies with
the aim of creating mini-industrial holdings. 'Italian industry is
characterised by one-man entrepreneurial businesses. There are rarely
outside managers in family companies, so our deals are buy-ins rather than
buy-outs,' says Mr Colonna.
The trade sale offers the main exit route in Italy. 'Nobody is enthusiastic
about the 'borsa',' says Mr Bliss about the option of stock market
quotation. Italy's is a small market lacking the public limited companies
and large scale investment by institutional investors that typify those of
New York and London.
Yet in spite of the absence of action over the past two years, investment
bankers in Milan have not lost hope. Schroder Associati's Mr Colonna
believes opportunities will arise next year from two developments in Italian
industry.
First, it now seems that privatisation will become a reality. Most observers
believe facts will soon follow the torrent of words that the subject has
generated. 'Management buy-outs will not happen directly, but will occur as
a by-product when new owners of privatised companies start rationalising,'
says Mr Colonna.
'The second source of buy-out operations will be the corporate restructuring
that major groups have started to put in motion. Until now the sale of
subsidiaries has been seen as a sign of weakness. That attitude is
disappearing, and focusing on core businesses is seen as the right
strategy,' he says.
Mr Bliss also sees corporate restructuring as a source of buy-outs, although
he believes that management will only have small equity stakes. 'Succession
problems in family companies will continue to provide good opportunities for
buy-out operations,' he adds.
In which sectors are the opportunities likely to occur? Most bankers agree
that food is at the top of the list. 'It will always be an interesting
sector, even when the economy is in recession,' says Mr Bliss.
High quality clothing will continue to produce opportunities. However, in
spite of the density of Italian engineering, conditions are tough and
prospective deals will be subject to extremely close scrutiny.
Invest is examining several potential operations, and Mr Belli believes that
there will be no shortage of good opportunities over the next six months, as
owners decide to pass the burden of management to others and as their asking
prices start to fall.
If this happens, the patience of some investment banks should be rewarded
after the lengthy period of scarcity. There have been many players on the
field and at the sidelines of Italian buy-outs. It will be interesting to
see which make the winning plays when the game really gets moving.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (9): Showing potential -
Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SPEAKS volumes for the nature of the German buy-out market that when LBO
France opened up a German operation earlier this year, it decided it had to
change its name.
'The problem is that the term LBO means something evil in the German
market,' says Mr Eberhard Crain, managing director of Vector
Beteiligungsberatung, as LBO France's new German operation is called.
'Anything to do with leverage provokes images of unfriendly asset
stripping.'
German businessmen are averse to financial innovation. The very idea of
selling a business, let alone selling a business to a financial buyer, is
often an anathema. Perceptions are not helped by the fact that the first
large buy-out in Germany - that of Lignotock in 1989 - went wrong after the
vendor fled Germany amid allegations of fraud.
In spite of these obstacles the potential market for buy-out finance in
Germany is huge - if only because at present it is relatively
underdeveloped.
Mr Max Romer, chief executive of CWB Capital Partners in Frankfurt
calculates that there are 70 or 80 institutions pursuing venture capital
business in Germany, and that over the past decade the market has grown
sixfold to DM4bn. This compares to a market size of DM6.5bn in France,
DM17bn in the UK and DM65bn in the US.
Of the total invested in Germany, he says that MBO finance accounts for a
relatively modest DM620m-DM630m. While the bulk of the DM4bn financing is
start-up or expansion capital, he says about a dozen firms are concentrating
on the buy-out segment of the market, where risks and returns are high - and
the prospects for growth better than in mainstream venture capital.
The first oft-cited cause for optimism is the so-called 'succession problem'
in the 'Mittelstand', or mid-sized companies. These family-owned companies,
which play a central role in the western German economy, were often built up
after the war and have now reached the point where the first two post-war
generations of family-managers have retired or are approaching retirement.
Earlier this year a study produced by the German arm of 3i, the UK venture
capitalist house, argued that third generation inheritors often lose
interest in managing the business. Mr Romer thinks 700,000 companies out of
the total of 2.3m companies in Germany will have problems with succession
during the course of the next decade.
Mr Frederich Graf von der Groeben, chief executive of Schroders &amp; Partner,
the German arm of Schroder Ventures, says that in addition to the succession
problem there are pressing industrial reasons why owners of medium-sized
companies will make increasing use of buy-out finance.
He argues that many Mittelstand are simply too small to preserve their
independence and that they need to merge to achieve economies of scale in
increasingly competitive world markets. Buy-out specialists can act as a
catalyst to this needed rationalisation.
Another cause for optimism is that most of Germany's biggest companies are
conglomerates which owe their shape to chance rather than coherent strategy,
and in the long term it is likely that they will start thinning out their
portfolios.
This is another potential buy-out market, as companies may prefer to sell to
management and employees rather than to an unknown third party. (However, at
present, it is often seen as a mark of corporate weakness to sell a
subsidiary, however marginal the business in relation to the group's core
activities.)
The slow-down in the German economy may act as a catalyst to such sales.
But, says Mr von der Groeben, its main effect so far has been to slow down
the already slow process of putting together transactions, introducing
additional pricing and financing complications.
'You can't make a quick buck in this market.' he says, 'You need patience,
continuity and solid financing.'

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (8): Buy-outs back on the
agenda - Eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MIKE WRIGHT, IGOR FILATOCHEV and TREVOR BUCK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGEMENT and employee buy-outs are back on the eastern European agenda.
Fears that 'red directors' would profit from new free market economics as
privatisation fever gripped the region, have faded and the extent of
buy-outs - especially for small to medium sized firms and spin-offs from
large state firms - seems greater than earlier indications would suggest.
The widespread ability of managers associated with the former communist
regimes to acquire their firms in so-called 'nomenklatura buy-outs' produced
considerable resistance to the phenomenon. However, it is now recognised
that, in many cases, such managers are the only available entrepreneurs for
such a deal.
Information on buy-out activity in eastern Europe is difficult to obtain. As
well as an unknown number of nomenklatura buy-outs, several thousand hundred
buy-outs of retail premises and small workshops have been completed.
In Russia, half of the smaller sales - an estimated 6,500 transactions  -
have involved buy-outs.
Similarly, in Romania, 270 out of 1,100 smaller activities sold up to
October this year were to employees. But apart from those in the former
German Democratic Republic (GDR), buy-outs of sizeable enterprises have so
far been limited.
By June this year, of the total 8,175 privatisations carried out by the
Treuhandanstalt (THA), the German state privatisation agency, 18 per cent
were buy-outs and about 1 per cent were buy-ins.
Over 1,100 buy-outs have involved companies with fewer than 100 employees.
However, large buy-outs are possible with two of the largest to date being
Anhaltiner Stahl und Anlagenbau (Asta) and Industriemontagen Leipzig.
The Privatisation Law in Poland allows for a procedure of 'liquidation'
whereby a buy-out occurs when incumbent management and employees create a
private enterprise to lease state assets. The original state-owned
enterprise is subsequently wound-up.
By October 1992 more than 450 out of a total of about 800 sales were
buy-outs. In Hungary, around 20 buy-outs are estimated to have been
completed under the recently introduced self-privatisation legislation, with
its emphasis on foreign trading companies and services.
In Romania four companies have been selected to be sold through management
buy-outs as part of a pilot privatisation project, three of which have so
far been completed.
In Estonia, two of the first seven pilot privatisations (Sami and Mareta)
were full buy-outs and four others (Baltika, Valga, Voit and Talleks) were
buy-outs in which management and employees were obliged to leave minority
stakes with the state or to sell them to the general public.
Slovenia, which under its initial Draft Privatisation Law gave pre-eminence
to buy-outs, has seen them completed via several routes. Seven have been
completed in the past 18 months through arrangements whereby workers
councils transfer ownership to the privatisation trust which then sells the
shares back to the employees.
A further 17 have involved privatisation through the internal acquisition of
shares using the old Yugoslavian legislation.
Most, however, have occurred through the 'drop-down' method in which a newly
created company owned by management and employees buys or leases the assets
required from the old company.
Finance can be a problem in the completion of buy-outs in eastern Europe in
the absence of established venture capital firms and where management lacks
the necessary personal resources meet down payments.
The so-called 'E-credit' guaranteed by the National Bank makes it possible
in Hungary to obtain loans for buy-outs on favourable terms. In order to
obtain the credit management must pay at least 10 per cent of the purchase
price with their own resources.
Elsewhere, down payments range from 15 per cent in Slovenia to 30 per cent
in Romania. In the former GDR, to help solve the problem of limited personal
finance, a programme of Eigenkapitalhilfe (equity support) of loans up to
DM1m were introduced for managers wishing to acquire at least 20 per cent of
a firm's equity - as long as this amounted to less than 40 per cent of the
total invested.
The valuing of enterprises presents problems, it is difficult to satisfy
political demands that assets are sold at a fair price without bringing the
privatisation process to a grinding halt as the limited staff of
privatisation agencies struggle to investigate fully each deal.
The result has been the development of decentralised or self-privatisation.
In September 1991 self-privatisation was introduced in Hungary principally
for smaller firms. Buy-out teams have to provide an independent valuation of
the company using a government-approved consultant. The consultants have to
give priority to management and existing employees.
Maintaining their reputation and position on the government's list gives
consultants an incentive to make a fair valuation. This can be difficult in
an uncertain environment where incumbent managers may try to influence the
apparent value of a business.
A number of countries now insist on an auction but outsiders may be
unwilling to bid against incumbents. Attempts to deal with the problem of
undervaluation in the privatisation of former GDR assets include purchase
price adjustment and clawback clauses if the enterprise is sold within a
relatively short period or without accompanying property.
In addition, penalties can be incurred if investment and employment
guarantees made by the purchaser are not met. The pilot privatisation
buy-outs in Romania have also made use of clawback arrangements whereby
purchasers are not allowed to sell land and buildings within a 10- to
20-year period. If they do, all proceeds above the inflation-adjusted
figures in the initial buy-out contract are clawed back by the state.
Uncertain conditions in many markets pose questions about the viability of
MBOs. For this reason, buy-outs are frequently only considered as options
for viable firms. Western industrial partners who can provide capital and
marketing expertise may be unwilling to buy unless they can obtain majority
control - something management may be unwilling to concede.
Identifying suitable buy-in managers where a buy-out is not feasible also
presents problems, as the THA found when it launched such a program in
January. Of the more than 1,000 enquiries received from interested western
managers, less than 50 are expected to acquire a suitable target.
However, a small number of buy-ins by western managers have taken place, the
largest being the estimated DM409m buy-in of Elpro and TGE by a partnership
of three ex-Mc Kinsey consultants and three industrialists.
The future of buy-outs in eastern Europe is also linked to the development
of voucher schemes. The political benefits of voucher-based mass
privatisation schemes for some segments of the population has frequently
caused problems for the advocates of buy-outs.
Both schemes can co-exist for different sized companies and recent
developments indicate that it may be possible to include both elements in
the privatisation of a particular firm. A minority of shares in a company
can be acquired through vouchers, including the possibility for employees to
exchange vouchers for shares in their company, with the majority of the
shares being sold at auction to incumbent management and employees.
Taken with signs that delays in passing privatisation legislation are coming
to an end, the indications are that buy-outs are set for considerable growth
throughout eastern Europe. However, great care still needs to be taken in
balancing incentives for management and employees to take the risk, with
continuing public concern about the nature of such deals.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (7): Building up the team
spirit - Esops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HESTER THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEE share ownership plans (Esops) may be on the periphery of many
people's minds during a buy-out but those who have opted for them believe
they offer great benefits - especially during highly competitive times when
it is important for the workforce to pull together.
'For employee human relations, it's exceptional,' says Mrs Jacqui Martin,
financial director of People's Provincial Buses. 'The union representatives
wear two hats when they're negotiating because they're shareholders as well.
They don't demand anything silly or go on strike because they'd be striking
against themselves.'
Based in Fareham, Hampshire, People's Provincial Buses established its Esop
in 1987, when the management and most employees conducted a buy-out from the
National Bus Company for Pounds 730,000. Each contributor put in Pounds 750
to support the bid.
At the time of the buy-out, 20 per cent of the shares were in the
workforce's hands and the remainder in the Esop. Now, after distributions of
free shares and offers to buy shares, the workforce holds 60 per cent of the
shares with the rest in the Esop.
Esops were established as a means by which employees could acquire a large
shareholding in their company - whether public or private - without
necessarily laying out personal capital.
A company sets up an employee benefit trust (EBT) to acquire some of its
shares. The trust buys shares from an existing shareholder using proceeds
from a loan guaranteed by the company and serviced by the company's cash
flow. Repayments are tax efficient since payments from the company to the
EBT are treated as payments to employees, while the trust uses the funds to
repay the principal of the loan as well as meet interest charges.
Shares are then distributed to employees, usually through an Inland
Revenue-approved profit sharing trust (PST). Although shares can be sold to
employees, most are gifted by the company. As long as the shares are held
for five years, employees pay no income tax on the sale of gifted shares.
The EBT can repurchase shares from employees, creating an internal market
for the benefit of the workforce.
During an MBO, an Esop is the simplest way of including employees in the
buy-out, purchasing shares on their behalf and distributing them once the
buy-out has been completed.
Not only is the Esop a means of raising a proportion of cash for the MBO. It
is also a means of gaining the participation and commitment of the
workforce.
In a competitive bid, the support of employees for the current management,
may be a critical factor for the management and for the fund providers.
Perhaps not surprisingly, given the recession and market for buy-outs, the
number of MBO-related Esops is down this year.
'The greatest momentum was in the late 1980s,' says Mr Robin Slagburn,
senior corporate finance manager at Unity Trust Bank, which has funded
several Esops.
'They aren't the kind of thing companies think of doing when they're just
trying to survive.'
In spite of this, money is still available, even if it is only in the hands
of employees. At least two of this year's Esop-related buy-outs have been
over-subscribed by their workers.
When the Port of Tilbury completed its buy-out from the Port of London
Authority in March for Pounds 33.5m, employees could buy 17 per cent of the
shares. The offer was over-subscribed by 21 per cent as 55 per cent of the
workforce came forward to buy.
'The average purchase was for Pounds 2,400 of shares,' says chief executive,
Mr John McNab. 'It's a heck of a lot of money and people are already asking
if they can buy more,'
Why companies should attract so much financial support from their employees
in such straitened times is open to debate. However, it may be a sign that
those who are employed are keen to back and be part of their company.
Numerous attempts have been made to broaden the appeal of Esops. The
statutory Esop, introduced under the 1989 Finance Act, can operate like the
popular case law Esop but receives additional tax advantages.
For example, shareholders selling at least 10 per cent of their shares to an
Esop may be able to claim capital gains tax rollover relief.
In 1991, the Esop Centre launched a model Esop in an attempt to make it
easier and less expensive for companies to establish a statutory Esop. The
model steers companies and their advisers through recent legislative changes
and includes a model trust deed.
Unfortunately, the qualifying requirements for a statutory Esop have proved
so onerous that even the model Esop has failed to woo companies.
The Esop Centre is now lobbying government to make radical changes to the
statutory Esop, to make it more attractive. Its 10-point plan includes
proposals to:
Make the trustee a subsidiary company (so that no individual - such as an
employee - has personal liability as a trustee);
Allow part-time and new employees to benefit; and
Make statutory Esop trusts tax neutral.
Malcolm Hurlston, director of the Esop Centre, established to encourage
Esops, is hopeful that these points may be accepted in the next Budget. 'It
will be the main way of making Esops popular.'
In the meantime, some of the trade unions are beginning see the attractions
of Esops. The MBOs of Coolkeeragh Power and People's Provincial Buses had
the backing of their respective unions.
However, some trade unions remain sceptical. 'Many have a problem of coming
out in support of Esops at national level, as it smacks of capitalism,' says
Mr Blagburn. 'They're also wary of Esops being seen as pension
substitutions, as they have in the US.'
Mr David Tankel, director at the management and buy-out consultancy, New
Bridge Street Consultants, believes that management attitudes to Esops and
wider share ownership are changing. 'Managers are beginning to see the
benefits of employees having a sense of ownership of the company and being
committed to it.'
Mr McNab at the Port of Tilbury, has seen his employees attitudes to the
company changing. 'People feel they're working for themselves, they can have
an impact on the company and see a return on their investment by being
co-operative,' he says.
It is still early days for Esops. They will, of course, only be successful
if the company is successful. That, in the long-term, may be the best - or
worst - advertisement they can have.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (6): Hybrid deal seen as a
less risky option - Problems associated with pure buy-ins have deterred
backers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGEMENT buy-ins, which involve an outside management team moving in to
take control of a company, have proved more difficult than many people first
thought.
Their place is increasingly being taken by 'bimbos' - buy-ins/management
buy-outs - which involve a combination of outsiders and the existing
management.
With a risk profile closer to that of a start-up than a buy-out, buy-ins in
their purest form are now only attempted when the financiers are convinced
the deal will work.
'We are not keen on pure buy-ins because the risk is high,' says Mr Hugh
Mumford, managing director of Electra Kingsway.
Special factors, as well as a belief in the new managers, often play a role.
Mr Mumford says his decision to back a buy-in at Gower Furniture was
influenced by the fact that he knew the business well, having had an
investment in the company for the previous seven years.
This shift towards hybrid deals undoubtedly contributed to an increase in
the share held by buy-ins in the total buy-out market in the first six
months of this year. Buy-ins accounted for nearly 24 per cent of the number
of buy-out/buy-in deals compared with just 18.5 per cent in the first half
of 1991, according to Nottingham University's Centre for Management Buy-Our
Research.
Most of the buy-ins carried out in the first half of 1992 were of
family-owned businesses with the second most common vendors being public
companies divesting themselves of divisions or subsidiaries. Buy-ins of
large listed groups, a feature of the late 1980s, have fallen out of favour.
In September, Continuous Stationery, which includes the Prontaprint copying
chain, was taken private in a Pounds 6.8m deal by its existing management.
Although the deal was predominantly a buy-out, the incumbent managers
brought in an outsider with experience of general management and finance as
part-time executive chairman.
3i, the largest buy-in (and buy-out) backer in terms of deal numbers, took a
hard look at its buy-in portfolio two years ago to analyse the features
which made for success. 'We had the choice of saying that buy-ins were too
difficult and pulling out or of marketing them more aggressively and giving
the managers more back-up,' says Mr Patrick Dunne, who heads 3i's buy-in
programme.
3i decided to stay in the buy-in business but has had to commit considerable
resources to making sure that the deals work. It subjects would-be buy-in
managers to a tough selection process and devotes training sessions to
getting to know them.
The result has been an increase in the number of buy-ins/bimbos carried out
by 3i from 31, in the year ended March, 1991 to 55, in the year ended March
1992. But whereas in the late 1980s only 10 per cent of deals were accounted
for by bimbos, by 1992 this had risen to 50 per cent.
The attraction of the buy-in is that it broadens the range of managers
available to carry out a deal, particularly if the existing management lacks
the ability or the range of skills required to run an independent business.
The problem has been in matching outside managers with a business with which
they are not familiar.
'Skeletons in the cupboard' emerged as one of the most frequent problems
encountered by incoming managers according to Nottingham University.
When 3i reviewed its buy-in programme it identified a number of factors
which made for success in a buy-in/bimbo. They were:
The more senior the incoming management team, the greater the chance of
success. Managing director experience was preferable.
Given a choice of backing someone with experience of the sector or someone
with managing director experience, the latter was a safer bet.
Backing someone with experience of having previously turned round another
business.
Combining incoming managers with some of the existing management - staging a
bimbo - and ensuring both acquired equity in the business. Giving incoming
managers experience of working in the business beforehand.
Buy-ins are also best avoided when the business concerned is itself a
candidate for 'turnaround' treatment, says Mr Ian Forrest, managing director
of Montagu Private Equity (formerly Midland Montagu Ventures). Combining a
buy-in with a corporate rescue increases the risk of failure, he says.
Buy-ins may be difficult to stage but this is unlikely to act as a deterrent
to managers seeking independence. If anything, the supply of senior
executives keen to run their own business seems set to increase.
Managers in their mid-40s are aware that their next promotion may be their
last. Recession and the removal by large corporations of middle tiers of
management have brought forward the retirement age for many executives.
Managers aware of how vulnerable their jobs are, often see the attraction of
running their own business, Mr Dunne says.
At present most buy-ins are initiated by the managers themselves. They put
together a team comprising people they know from their own industry and
identify the target company or division they would like to acquire.
But buy-ins, as opposed to buy-outs, create greater opportunities for the
financier to play a role in shaping the deal.
'We have had more involvement lately in crafting teams and in plugging
gaps,' says Mr Gordon Bonnyman, managing director of Charterhouse
Development Capital.
This trend has been strengthened by an increasing desire on the part of
vendors to approach financial groups directly to see if they are willing to
make a bid.
The advantage of this approach for the vendor is that it shortens the
sometimes drawn-out process of establishing whether funding will be
available.
This does not mean, however, that the financiers are taking over complete
responsibility for the deal as is the case in the US.
'I don't see the US model developing here,' says Mr Bonnyman. 'We would not
buy a company over the head of the management.'

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (5): Flotation seen to lack
lustre - Smaller firms prefer to dispose of a buy-out through trade sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR a few short weeks after the Conservative election victory in April the
buoyancy of the London stock market prompted a surge of flotations of
buy-out companies. In July MFI Furniture Group, Kenwood Appliances, Anglian
Group and Taunton Cider were listed with a combined market capitalisation of
more than Pounds 1.1bn.
The continuing recession and political uncertainty have since made a public
listing unattractive for all but a handful of companies.
Such swings in the political and economic cycle are to be expected but of
greater concern to managements and the organisations which finance buy-outs
is a more fundamental decline in the opportunities for flotation.
While the early 1980s saw the launch of the Unlisted Securities Market (USM)
followed in 1987 by the creation of the Third Market, recent years have led
to a narrowing of the options for flotation.
The failure of the Third Market to attract sufficient high quality stocks
and attempts to make the main market more accessible have brought about the
demise of the Third Market and a decline in the attractiveness of the USM.
Big Bang and the subsequent restructuring of the UK stock market have led to
a concentration on the larger quoted stocks and a neglect of the smaller
company.
Even the main market has been unable to provide sufficient liquidity for the
smaller quoted company. A number of large securities houses have withdrawn
from making markets in many of the smaller stocks.
'The USM is a shadow of what it was at its peak,' says Mr Michael Smith,
managing director (Europe) of Citicorp Venture Capital.
'We probably wouldn't take a company to the USM now but would encourage it
to wait until it was of a size to go to the main market.' Even there the
absence of market makers at the bottom end is worrying.
Some buy-out financiers say that they never used the USM anyway because it
was only a half-way house to a full flotation.
Others point out that some companies which were never suited to a listing
were floated in the heady days of the late 1980s.
But even if excesses were committed during the boom, the effective removal
of flotation as an option for the smaller company represents a loss to the
buy-out sector. It may also have implications for the way deals are
structured in future.
'People will have to be more conscious of the need for a running yield
rather than just an exit realisation to get a reasonable return,' says Mr
Gordon MacLean, responsible for larger buy-outs at 3i. This could lead to a
greater emphasis on, for example, preference shares in deal structures.
In the short term, at least, managers of buy-out companies may have mixed
feelings about the narrowing of the flotation option. They are only too
aware of the problems which many small companies have encountered after
obtaining a listing.
Companies have frequently been unable to make rights issues and have found
the pressures of listed status too burdensome. They have to spend a lot of
their time keeping shareholders informed while the stock market is
unforgiving of any temporary set back in performance.
But while a flotation is the most high profile means of obtaining an 'exit',
a sale to a corporate buyer has proved to be the most common next step in
the development of most buy-outs.
Ten per cent of buy-outs completed between 1981 and 1991 were subsequently
sold on to a trade buyer while just 4.4 per cent were floated, according to
Nottingham University's Centre for Management Buy-Out Research.
A trade sale is often the only option open to the company which is too small
to go for a flotation.
This usually allows the financial backer to realise all of his investment
while managers, if they wish, can normally withdraw after a handover period.
A corporate buyer may also be prepared to pay a higher price than could be
realised by flotation if it sees synergies resulting from combining the two
businesses.
Swedish Match, which was sold to Procordia, a Swedish food pharmaceuticals
group, earlier this year, considered a flotation, says Mr Smith of Citicorp,
which had backed the earlier Swedish Match buy-out.
But the company's activities had a wide geographical spread, making it
difficult to value its overseas assets and to decide on which market to
float.
A sale meant investors could get their money back, gave the management the
opportunity for added responsibility within the larger group and allowed
Swedish Match to benefit from Procordia's distribution network.
Del Monte Foods International got as far as announcing plans for a flotation
in February 1992 amid suggestions it might attract a valuation of Pounds
450m. In October, however, it opted for a sale to a joint venture between
two South African companies, Royal Foods and Anglo American Corporation, for
Pounds 360m, citing stock market uncertainty.
Sometimes a company is too small to consider a public flotation. A market
capitalisation of at least Pounds 60m is needed to consider a float while
Pounds 100m often makes a more realistic minimum, says Mr David Hutchings,
deputy managing director of Montagu Private Equity.
For all the thought that is given to 'exits' only a small proportion of
buy-outs over the past decade have reached this stage of development. Only
just over 23 per cent of buy-outs completed between 1981 and 1991 have
achieved any form of exit whether flotation, sale, receivership or
refinancing, according to the Centre for Management Buy-Out Research.
This may be partly explained by the fact that it was not until the late
1980s that buy-outs began to be done in large numbers - 315 in 1986 rising
to a peak of 485 in 1990.
But the result is that the financial backers of buy-outs will have to devote
much of their energy to exits over the next few years if they are to achieve
their expected returns.
One option which has yet to be explored in any detail is the refinancing
deal which allowing the buy-out management to retain its independence. A
refinancing which leaves the existing management in charge would depend on
the business producing sufficient profits to fund the deal.
Buy-outs have in the past been criticised for encouraging short-term
thinking on the part of managements and financiers. A refinancing formula
which ensured continuity of management and ownership might go some way to
counter this as well as meeting the wishes of managers.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (4): Banks take a tough line -
Lenders are becoming more involved in the structure of the deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORGET about the venture capitalists and the other providers of equity
finance: the key to completing a buy-out nowadays is the banker.
The banks are still recovering from the losses and provisions they made on
some of the highly geared deals completed in the late 1980s and take a far
more cautious attitude to any lending secured on future cashflows rather
than more tangible assets.
'Banks are no longer competing for market share but rather are seeking
quality assets and good returns,' says Mr Anton Fawcett, head of buy-out
finance at Barclays Bank.
In the past banks would often allow a buy-out to breach lending covenants
only to see the equity provider walk away when the company's fortunes
continued to deteriorate. If the bank had pulled out when the terms of the
loan agreement were first breached it could have probably recovered all its
money, he says.
The result has been that banks are usually reluctant to lend more than half
of the value of the deal and they insist on interest cover of at least two
times from projected profits.
'It is still difficult to get debt in quantity on larger deals,' says Mr
Robert Smith, chief executive of Morgan Grenfell Development Capital.
Figures from accountants KPMG Peat Marwick show that the ratio of debt and
mezzanine finance to equity fell back to 1.3 to 1 in the first half of 1992
from 1.7 to 1 in the second half of 1991.
The decline from the peak of the buy-out market in 1989 is even more
pronounced. In the second half of that year the ratio was 5.9 to 1.
A more detailed break-down of debt structures carried out by the Nottingham
University Centre for Management Buy-Out Research showed that in smaller
deals, valued at under Pounds 10m, in the first half of 1992 equity and debt
each accounted for 44 per cent of total finance with the balance made up by
small amounts of mezzanine and loan notes.
In deals of more than Pounds 10m, equity accounted for 41 per cent and debt
for 38 per cent.
Growing familiarity with buy-outs has meant that the banks now look more
closely at projected cash flows and the interest cover ratio than at balance
sheet ratios.
This reduction in gearing has meant that the equity providers have had to
reduce their expectations of returns. Some are now starting to worry that
deals are 'under-geared'. The result is that even greater pressure is being
put on the venture capitalists to force down the price of deals. If vendors
will not go along with this then the deal will often not get done.
The role of mezzanine - high-yielding unsecured lending often with equity
conversion rights - has also been squeezed as deal prices have fallen.
Mezzanine came in to bridge the gap between what the equity houses were
willing to provide and bank lending in the 1980s but is now in less demand.
Slightly more mezzanine was used in the first half of 1992 than in 1991 but
over the past four years the trend has been downwards. 'Large deals still
need mezzanine but smaller deals can be put together with just equity and
debt,' says Mr Ian Forrest of Montagu Private Equity (formerly Midland
Montagu Ventures).
He also estimates that nearly 70 per cent of deals have some form of
participation by the vendor company.
'This can be more flexible than mezzanine from an independent institution,'
Mr Forrest says. But some other providers of buy-out finance take the view
that vendor loan notes complicate a deal, especially if something goes wrong
and more money is needed later.
What has become noticeable over the past year is an increased desire on the
part of the banks to involve themselves more closely in the terms of the
deal. This is not always welcomed by the equity providers.
'The bankers are trying to take over the deals,' says one venture
capitalist, who fought off an attempt by one bank to obtain a power of veto
of changes in the company's articles of memorandum.
The banks are acting tough because the shortage of debt finance puts them in
a stronger position and because they realise they needed to take a closer
interest in the deals they were backing.
In the early days the banks relied on the venture capitalist to carry out an
appraisal of the management and the company that they were backing.
'After one or two bad experiences we came to realise that this was a job we
could not delegate,' says Mr Fawcett. Barclays now often commissions a
survey of the market in which the buy-out will be operating as well as
carrying out a financial investigation of the company.
The banks have also grasped the opportunity to increase their interest
charges on buy-out lending and to push up their fees. They would aim for
around 2 per cent over base rate and 1.5 to 2 per cent in up-front fees
although they might not always achieve these levels.
In the longer term, some venture capitalists believe, the financial backers
of buy-outs will have to pay increasing attention to obtaining a running
yield on their investments as well as the capital gain on realisation.
This is because buy-outs are taking longer to reach an 'exit' than some
thought. Less than a quarter of the buy-outs completed between 1981 and 1991
have obtained an 'exit', according to the Centre for Management Buy-Out
Research.
'More deals will have a yield element,' says Mr Gordon MacLean, a director
of 3i. This is likely to lead to increased use of, for example, preference
share capital and will increase pressures on management to perform.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (3): Industry participants
begin to thin out - The Deal Leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BUY-OUTS have proved a profitable niche for the British venture capital
industry - so profitable, in fact, that while interest in start-ups and
other early-stage deals has waned, many venture capitalists have made
buy-outs the focus of their activities.
A growing number of the smaller venture capital funds which backed early
stage ventures have ceased making new investments.
So far, the attrition visible elsewhere in the industry has yet to show
itself among the buy-out funds but, many participants expect, it will not be
a long time coming. 'The industry is rationalising itself and polarising
around a dozen or so players,' says Mr Ian Forrest, managing director of
Montagu Private Equity (formerly Midland Montagu Ventures).
The reasons for this thinning out of the industry are not hard to find.
Poorly performing funds will be unable to raise new finance from outside
investors or, if they are 'captive' institutions owned by a larger financial
services group, will be unable to persuade head office that they deserve
more money.
The decision earlier this year by Hill Samuel, the merchant banking part of
the TSB group, to put its development capital arm up for sale, showed that
even the captive organisations are not as secure as was previously assumed.
Hill Samuel's move reflected a decision to concentrate on activities which
provided a quicker pay-off than development capital.
The increased vulnerability which the captive funds feel has persuaded their
managers that they must be more active in promoting their activities within
their own organisations.
'We make sure that we publicise internally any cross-referral business we
create,' says one.
So which are the most active buy-out funds and those most likely to form the
slimmed-down core of the industry in a few years' time?
Any list of the leading players active in the UK market would include
Candover, Charterhouse Development Capital, CINVen, Morgan Grenfell, 3i,
Phildrew Ventures, Schroder Ventures, County NatWest, Montagu Private Equity
and Electra.
A shorter list of buy-out teams active in continental Europe would also
include Candover, 3i and Schroders, but with the addition of other
organisations such as Citicorp Venture Capital.
Membership of either of these lists denotes a serious commitment to the
buy-out field but does not necessarily mean that all the funds have been
active recently. Morgan Grenfell Development Capital has not made a large
buy-out investment for nearly a year because it has not seen a sufficiently
attractive deal, says Mr Robert Smith, chief executive.
3i continues to head the KPMG Peat Marwick deals table, completing 15 new
deals in the year to the end of September 1992, but has not been noticeable
bidding for the largest deals recently, several other buy-out specialists
report.
This may reflect a decision by 3i to close what used to be known as its City
office and to put more effort into helping its area offices to do larger
deals.
Other leading funds include Midland Montagu Ventures, which has completed
seven deals in the past year, Schroder Ventures with six deals, and CINVen,
which manages pension funds for the British Coal, British Rail and Barclays
Bank, with four deals.
One factor which is likely to lead a further concentration of the buy-out
industry is the desire for many players to take a deal completely on their
own books or to limit the size of the syndicates they form.
The large, unwieldy syndicates put together to finance deals in the late
1980s were not well suited to dealing with the problems experienced by their
portfolio companies. So deal leaders are now only willing to work together
with small teams of like-minded funds they feel they can trust.
Syndicates - such as those which backed the buy-out of Mecca Leisure in 1985
involving 23 members, and that of Mallinson Denny in the same year with 19
members - are unlikely to be repeated.
The average number of investors in a Pounds 100m-Pounds 250m in 1986 was 16,
Electra has calculated. By 1991 it had fallen to four members. Deals of
between Pounds 10m and Pounds 25m involved on average six investors in 1986
but only two in 1991. 'People want to take bigger stakes in companies
because they want to be closer to them,' says Mr Hugh Mumford, Electra
managing director. 'Investors don't want to be passive.'
'The shortage of larger, high quality investment opportunities has led to
the originators of deals hanging on to what they have,' says Mr Gordon
Bonnyman, managing director of Charterhouse Development Capital.
'If they do syndicate they choose partners who can reciprocate.'
3i and Prudential Venture Managers went a step further with the announcement
in June of a collaboration agreement to underwrite jointly medium-sized and
large buy-outs and buy-ins - those with a purchase price of Pounds 15m or
more.
Five deals have already been jointly funded under this arrangement which
actually took effect from the beginning of the year.
But to concentrate solely on the impending concentration among the larger
buy-out funds would be to ignore the large number of smaller deals. The big
transactions have disappeared but considerable activity still takes place in
deals valued at less than Pounds 5m. A broad range of equity funds and banks
continues to finance these deals, some which use only debt.
The shake-up among the banks providing debt for buy-outs has been no less
severe than among the equity funds. The banks, many of them from the US,
which piled into the highly leveraged deals of the late 1980s, have
departed. For the past year or so the debt side of buy-out funding has been
dominated by a trio of British banks, the Bank of Scotland, National
Westminster Bank and Barclays Bank.
These three still have a commanding role but there are signs that other
banks are starting to revive their buy-out financing teams, says Mr Anton
Fawcett, who heads Barclays' buy-out activities. Two UK merchant banks,
Morgan Grenfell and NM Rothschild have begun providing buy-out debt while
continental European banks, particularly the Swiss, are showing increasing
interest.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-outs (2): Of collars and cylinders
 -The tangled web of industry jargon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY trade or profession has its technical terminology or jargon and the
buy-out sector is no exception. Buy-outs in Britain have traditionally been
handled by venture capitalists so some of the terms derive from venture and
development capital areas.
Other expressions have come from the world of corporate finance. But
whatever their provenance, they can be confusing to buy-out teams, many of
which have no previous experience in this field.
Bimbo
A somewhat controversial term coined by 3i to describe a deal involving both
existing and outside managers: a buy-in/management buy-out or bimbo. About
half of all deals take this form.
Bought deal
This is when a deal maker provides all of the finance needed for a buy-out
deal and then sells on or syndicates part of the funding to other investors
later. Carried out by the larger providers of finance when speed or
confidentiality are particularly important for the deal to succeed.
Bridge financing
Short-term funding provided when a company is about to raise a new round of
equity or is about to go public.
Business plan
The document put together by managers to justify their application for
finance. Should contain summaries of past and projected profit and loss
accounts, balance sheets and cash flows.
It should also include details of products and services, markets, future
strategy and profiles of the managers. A warning, however: don't get too
carried away. Most financiers will not go beyond the two-page executive
summary.
Caps, collars and cylinders
Clauses in buy-out deals which limit the extent to which the interest rate
charged on borrowed funds can rise or fall. A safeguard against borrowing
costs rising to the point where they endanger the company. Such agreements
usually have a limited life of one or two years. The longer the period of
cover the more expensive the collar or cap.
Carried interest
A stake taken in the investee company by the venture capital or buy-out fund
managers. Can be in the form of options.
Deal flow
The rate at which investment propositions come to the deal-maker or
financier. Many claim to select only one deal in 50, although deal flow
numbers are treated by some as a sort of virility symbol.
Development Capital
Later stage finance for more established companies which are profitable or
nearly profitable. Less risky generally than early stage finance.
Due diligence
Detailed analysis and appraisal of the background of the entrepreneur and
his business plan.
Earn-out
Either a formula for relating the final purchase price of a company to
actual future earnings or a means of encouraging management to perform by
payment on the basis of future performance (see also Ratchet).
Employee buy-out
A deal involving not just the top management but also all or a large number
of the more junior employees of the organisation. The difficulty of
involving large numbers of employees without disclosing a deal prematurely
has meant that relatively few of these deals have been done.
Some managers get round this by staging a buy-out and then involving other
staff later at a later stage.
Employee share ownership plan (Esop)
A trust which is established to acquire shares in a company for subsequent
allocation to employees over a number of years.
Exit
The point at which the financier sells his holding in the buy-out company
either through a trade sale to a larger company, by the management buying
out the other investors to assume complete control, or by a stock market
flotation. It is essential the managers and their financial backers agree
from the outset on the exit strategy.
Gearing or leverage
The ratio of debt to equity in a company's capital structure. Intermediate
forms of capital, such as redeemable preference shares and convertible
loans, can complicate the calculations and mean a variety of ratios may be
applied to the same company.
Hands-on/hands-off
The degree to which an investor in a buy-out becomes involved in its
management. A hands-on investor would normally nominate a non-executive
director to the board and might commit some of its other executives to help
out if the company ran into difficulties. Hands-off investors would have
little or no active involvement in the company.
Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
Different investors work this out in different ways but the term generally
refers to annual compound rate of return to the investor over a given period
of time.
Returns normally include dividend distributions and profits from either
disposals or a fair valuation of the buy-out company.
Junior debt
Loans which rank after secured or senior debt for repayment in the event of
a default.
Junk bonds
High yielding, unsecured debt used in US buy-outs. Since the debt is in the
form of a bond certificate, it can be bought and sold more easily than the
mezzanine loans (qv) used to finance UK buy-outs.
Lead investor
Venture capitalist or other deal-maker with the largest share in the
syndicated investment.
He or she usually initiates the deal and then takes a hands-on role on
behalf of the other partners.
Lemons and plums
Bad deals and good. Bad investments usually go wrong before the good ones
produce a profit: the lemons ripen before the plums.
Leveraged buy-out
Similar to a management buy-out, though usually applied to US deals where
the transaction will have been initiated by a financial group rather than
the management. The name refers to the high level of borrowing which the
company takes on, using the assets being purchased as leverage.
When British buy-outs seemed to be going the way of their US counterparts,
with large, highly speculative deals being put together by City financiers,
the term started to be applied to UK buy-outs. Nowadays the idea of high
levels of leverage is a distant memory.
Living dead
Companies which are just about trading profitably but which are unlikely to
do really well.
A slightly dated term used about investments the deal-makers prefer to
forget.
Lock-out agreement
An agreement to give the buy-out team time to negotiate the purchase of
their company free of pressure from other bidders.
Management buy-in
An offshoot of the management buy-out industry. The purchase of a business
by one or more outside managers with the help of a group of financial
backers.
The term was applied indiscriminately in the late 1980s to any bid which
involved a well-known City figure on the grounds that a buy-in sounded more
constructive than the hostile takeover that it usually was.
Buy-ins are now seen as being considerably riskier than buy-outs because
they involve an outside management team which does not know the company as
well.
Many deals are neither pure buy-ins nor buy-outs but bimbos (qv).
Management buy-out
The purchase of a business by its existing management with the help of a
group of financial backers.
The managers put up a relatively small amount of the total finance but
usually gain a disproportionately large share of the equity. Buy-outs are
funded largely by loans secured on the assets of the company itself.
Mezzanine finance
This refers to loans, that are usually unsecured, which rank after secured
or senior debt but before equity in the event of the company failing.
To compensate for the greater risk, they usually carry interest 1 to 3
percentage points above secured loans and often carry an equity 'kicker' to
give the lender a stake in the equity.
Newco
The management buy-out is usually carried out through a newly created
company which is normally referred to as a newco.
Preferred ordinary shares
This refers to the ordinary shares which are taken up by the outside
investors in a buy-out.
These shares rank ahead of the plain ordinary shares which are owned by the
management in terms of dividends and the pay-out in the event of a
winding-up.
Ratchet
An incentive arrangement whereby the managers get a bigger share of the
equity if the venture performs well. Sometimes managers forfeit shares if
they do particularly badly (see also Earn-out).
Second round financing
Increasingly needed to help buy-outs which have run short of funds. Can also
be given to businesses which have done well and are able to raise new money
for further investments.
Senior debt
Secured debt which ranks first in terms of repayments in the event of a
default (see also junior debt).
Slippage
Happens when the buy-out company starts to eat up more cash than expected
because development costs exceed budget or sales grow too slowly.
Syndicated investment
An investment which is too large and risky to be handled by one investor and
which needs to be shared among several partners.
Fewer deals are syndicated in present market conditions, while syndicates
also involve fewer participants.
This is partly because the smaller deals do not require so many players.
However it also means that if trouble arises, fewer people have to be
consulted in order to sort out the mess.
Vendor finance
Finance provided by the vendor in the form of either a deferred payment or a
retained minority stake in the bought-out company, usually in the form of
loan notes.
It allows the vendor to share in the profits of the company if it does well
and can also be used to boost the sale price, thereby impressing the
vendor's shareholders.
Venture capitalist
This is the deal-maker who provides the funds and the advice for
entrepreneurs who are either starting a business from scratch or staging a
management buy-out.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-outs (1): Proving their worth -
Recession has seen the buy-out gain widespread acceptance as a way of
restructuring businesses. But times are tougher for backers as deals fall in
value and more effort is required to put them together

<TEXT>
MANAGEMENT buy-outs have had a good recession. They have proved their worth
as a means of restructuring companies and almost redeemed the mistakes of
the 1988-89 boom. Nothing, it appears, succeeds quite like a buy-out in
motivating managers and in revitalising tired businesses.
Few corporate boards will now reject the idea of selling a non-core or
under-performing business to management as an alternative to a sale a
corporate buyer. ICI, BP and Hanson have all disposed of parts of their
operations by means of a buy-out in recent months.
Some idea of the scale of activity in the UK can be gained from the fact
that there were more buy-outs in 1991 than acquisitions of independent
companies. Total buy-out activity over the past decade has amounted to
nearly 4,200 deals worth more than Pounds 26bn at current prices, according
to Nottingham University's Centre for Management Buy-Out Research.
Buy-out transactions have declined throughout Europe over the past two years
from the feverish levels of 1988-89. But they still accounted for 55 per
cent of all UK venture capital investments by value last year and for 35 per
cent of European venture capital spending.
That is the good news. But life has grown tougher for the organisations
which arrange and finance buy-outs. They are having to devote more effort to
putting deals together and, with less debt finance available to gear up the
equity, face the prospect of lower returns in the next few years.
The size of deals and hence the return for the effort involved has also
fallen. The largest buy-out completed by the end of November was the Pounds
140m purchase of Gaymer Group Europe - owner of the Olde English cider,
Babycham and Sanatogen Tonic Wine brands - from Allied-Lyons. Compare this
with the late 1980s when every year set a new record: MFI valued at Pounds
718m in 1987, Reedpack worth Pounds 805m in 1988 and Gateway at Pounds
2.37bn in 1989.
The number of large buy-outs - those worth more than Pounds 50m - is closely
linked to the economic cycle because the bigger deals are more dependent on
the willingness of the banks to provide debt finance, according to a recent
study by London Business School. But investment in smaller transactions -
valued at less than Pounds 25m - remains fairly constant throughout the
economic cycle because these deals usually have lower levels of gearing, the
researchers found.
Overall, 1992 seems set to mark a slight recovery in the UK buy-out sector
after two years of decline. Forty four large deals (each valued at Pounds
10m or more) worth a total of Pounds 1.47bn were completed in the first nine
months of the year. This compares with the same number of deals, although
with a total value of Pounds 1.88bn, completed in the whole of 1991,
according to accountants KPMG Peat Marwick.
Buy-out fund managers believe there will a sharp increase in the number of
deals completed in the final three months of the year. 'There are more signs
of life in the market,' says Mr Hugh Mumford, managing director of Electra.
'Financially stretched companies which deferred a decision to dispose of
parts of their business now realise they have to sell.' Several vendors are
under pressure to complete disposals by the end of the year so that they can
include the sale price in the 1992 accounts, says another buy-out
specialist.
This pressure to complete a sale has meant that many vendors have become
more realistic about the price they can expect. Some deal-makers remain
concerned about price levels however. This is one reason Morgan Grenfell
Development Capital has not completed a large deal in the past year,
according to Mr Robert Smith, chief executive.
Deal activity is only one measure of the buy-out sector's success, however.
Realisations are just as crucial to its health. MFI, seen by many as
bell-wether of the buy-out industry, finally achieved a public listing, at a
valuation of Pounds 669m, in July but in general 'exit' options have
narrowed.
After a brief opening of the listing 'window' in the immediate aftermath of
the Conservative's election victory in April the stock market has not looked
kindly on flotations.
The Unlisted Securities Market and even the small end of the main stock
market lack liquidity and are less attractive to company boards, while
corporate purchasers have had less time to look for acquisitions as they
wrestle with their own problems.
'We have been hanging on longer to our buy-out investments than in boom
times,' says Mr Stephen Curran, chief executive of Candover Investments.
'Returns will come down over the next few years,' forecasts Mr Mumford. 'Big
returns were made from leverage in the 1980s. To achieve results in future
the venture capital community will have to become more creative.'
A few years ago venture capitalists saw a profitable market in taking public
companies private again once the gloss of a public listing wore off. But
these deals have proved difficult. The institutions are reluctant to see the
diversity of their listed company portfolios reduced and frequently suspect
managers of misusing inside information on the business.
The banks are often reluctant to finance such deals because of problems in
securing their lending and it is frequently difficult to suggest a plausible
'exit' strategy when the buy-out is removing the most obvious exit of all.
After six 'going private' deals in 1991, only one deal - of Continuous
Stationery, the Prontaprint franchise group - has been done this year.
In October Mr Alan Sugar, founder of Amstrad, the consumer electronics
group, announced plans to take his company private but ran into criticism
over the price he was offering for the shares and the amount of information
provided on his future plans for the company. Buy-out fund managers believe
the number of companies going private will be restricted to businesses still
dominated by a strong founding entrepreneur but, as Amstrad illustrates,
even these deals are not trouble-free.
Public-to-private deals may be difficult to do but the privatisation of
public sector organisations continues apace. Local councils, bus operators
and port authorities have been selling parts of their operations while the
proposed privatisation of British Coal opens up further opportunities.
British venture groups have played a leading role in spreading equity
financing techniques throughout Europe but some British groups are now more
cautious about doing deals there. Eastern Europe appears to offer great
opportunities as state industries are privatised.
However UK groups are wary. 'A huge amount of work needs to be done on the
physical, legal and accounting infrastructure in eastern Europe,' says Mr
Michael Smith, managing director of Citicorp Venture Capital. In spite of
this Citicorp has backed deals in Hungary and has been more active than most
in financing buy-outs in continental Europe.
Throughout continental Europe, buy-out activity declined by an estimated 15
per cent in 1991 with just 354 deals being completed, according to the
Centre for Management Buy-Out Research. The total value of deals rose
slightly however, from Pounds 4bn to Pounds 4.2bn.
The buy-out has gained widespread acceptance as a means of restructuring
overstretched businesses and inefficient national economies. Even if nothing
else emerges UK funds will have a job to do arranging more sensible
financial structures for the over-borrowed buy-outs of the late 1980s.
But their main challenge will be to continue to give investors the high
levels of return they have come to expect. Many UK pension funds and other
institutions are reviewing their commitment to unquoted investments as an
asset class. The buy-out specialists will have their work cut out to meet
their expectations.

FT  03 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Granada in active session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESULTS well ahead of even the most optimistic forecasts sent shares in
Granada ahead, stimulating good, two-way business as the recent surge in the
shares opened the way for some profit-taking. The shares had jumped up 30 at
one stage in before falling back, one line of 2.7m being sold into the
market at 330p and placed immediately at 332p, in late trading. They closed
at 334p, a rise of 25 on the day. Profit forecasts for the current year were
upgraded to a range of Pounds 150m to Pounds 165m. Smith New Court was one
of a number of houses to turn positive on the stock.
The results, mostly achieved through rationalisation and efficiency
measures, again raised questions over Granada's strategy in maintaining
earnings growth. However, Mr Hamish Dickson at Hoare Govett, joint brokers
to the group, said that acquisitions were not an urgent need and he
predicted reputable profits growth over the next two years. Others were less
sure. Mr Mark Finnie at County NatWest said: 'We believe that the need for
an acquisition to propel long-term earnings growth is a real one.'
Possible targets touted in the market ranged from other television groups,
which the Granada management is said to be acknowledging as a matter of 'not
if, but when', to catering companies. With a counter bid for Gardner
Merchant, the Forte catering subsidiary, all but ruled out (an imminent
announcement is expected that Forte has sold it to its management), Sutcliff
Catering, owned by P&amp;O, may be a target.
Tarmac alert
Housebuilder and building materials group Tarmac resumed its position as one
of the market's favourite takeover plays. BTR, the conglomerate was widely
tipped as a potential predator There was more intrigue for the market when
Cazenove, the broking house was said to have been a keen buyer of Tarmac
Cazenove is broker to BTR, but also to Tarmac.
The shares sped up 6 to 96p, after 97p on turnover of 12m, the heaviest
single day's activity since late September.
Takeover stories have surrounded Tarmac for many months. Minorco, the
overseas arm of the Harry Oppenheimer group of companies, was widely
rumoured as a potential bidder for Tarmac earlier this year. Tarmac's
building materials operations were seen as the star attraction. In the late
1980's Minorco launched an ultimately unsuccessful bid for Consolidated Gold
Fields, the mining group.
More recently, however, the market has warmed to the acquisition by Tarmac
of the previously government-owned Property Services Agency.
GEC displeases
The market gave a decided 'thumbs-down' to GEC shares after the group
delivered a 3 per cent increase in half-year profits and a 5.1 per cent rise
in the interim dividend. Both figures were at the top end of the market
range, but failed to please some of the super-optimists.
'The headline number was a shade below the figure the market was going for,
but it was certainly not disappointing, nor was the dividend,' said one
specialist who believed the market had 'simply got over-excited.'
Analysts quietly trimmed estimates for full year profits from the Pounds
860m-plus pencilled in ahead of yesterday's figures to around Pounds 840m.
GEC shares settled 9 off at 263p on disappointing turnover of 6.3m.
Dull figures from Bass coupled with a cautious statement sent the shares
into retreat and the shares slipped 15 to 585p. The market had hoped for
some positive news on the hotel and leisure sector, but the company remained
reticent. Although the Holiday Inn division was said to be improving in a
difficult market, discussions with Queens Moat Houses over extending the two
groups' interests produced little comment from Bass management. Queens Moat
shares slipped 1 1/2 to 44p. Analysts suggested that Bass was discussing
potential deals with other, mostly US hotel groups, and that a deal over
extending the Holiday Inn flag was still alive.
The cautious Bass comment sent shares in Scottish and Newcastle tumbling 8
to 413p. Prudential took its stake in Vaux, the hotel and brewery group,
below 3 per cent. The shares shaved a penny to 206p. Whitbread Investment
Company took its holding in Greene King to 6.5 per cent, the shares adding 2
to 470p.
There was further severe punishment for HSBC shares after the latest slide
by shares on the Hong Kong market. HSBC plunged a further 22 to 480p in
London yesterday with dealers highlighting the exceptionally high level of
turnover in the stock - 22m shares - which they said indicated unusually
large selling pressure. Standard Chartered closed 15 off at 528p. Barclays
benefited from switching from HSBC and Standard, the shares moving up 6 to
388p on 9.5m traded.
Merchant banks with marketmaking activities rose sharply, with institutions
aware that recent record performances by the equity market could well mean
good profits for dealing firms. But there were hints that more job losses
could be in the pipeline. SG Warburg settled 10 firmer at 496p and Kleinwort
Benson rose the same amount to 289p.
The prospect of an avalanche of claims arising from the floods affecting the
UK, hit the composite insurance stocks. Commercial Union fell 15 to 607p,
General Accident 13 to 588p, Guardian Royal 6 to 177p and Royal 12 to 265p.
Sun Alliance settled 10 down at 336p. A switch out of BOC, down 15 at 758p,
and into ICI was said to be being advised by Smith New Court. ICI shares
rose 14 to 1027p.
A weak US dollar depressed many drug stocks. Profit-taking also affected
Wellcome leaving the shares 20 adrift at 1042p.
Reports that the ministry of defence had signed a memorandum of
understanding with Kuwait for the UK to supply defence equipment caused a
late run in GKN. The shares jumped 15 to 419p. The company is expected to be
one of the main beneficiaries of such a deal through the supply of the
Warrior and Piranha armoured vehicles.
One analyst speculated that such a deal may be worth as much as Pounds 750m
to GKN. The availability of a sizeable line of stock was said to have been
the reason for the early decline of P&amp;O. The stock was later reported to
have been been cleared but sentiment remained depressed by a sell
recommendation from Yamaichi. The shares closed 6 off at 491p. US buying
helped Tiphook bounce 30 to 305p.
Bid speculation returned to Lucas Industries with GEC being the new name
among possible predators. The shares jumped 10 134p. BTR has also in recent
weeks been mentioned as a possible bidder for Lucas.
US buying was reported in Rolls-Royce where the shares firmed 2 to 104p, in
trade of 4.7m. FR Group were wanted and the shares jumped 9 to 200p. A
positive recommendation from SG Warburg helped T&amp;N add 9 to 147p, though the
broker was said to be negative on Kwik-Fit which caused the shares to give
up 8 to 94p.
Speculation that Vickers may soon win a tank order from the Middle East
caused the shares to firm 5 to 89p.
Shares in Booker advanced 26 to 370p as James Capel was reported to be
recommending the stock.
News of slightly disappointing new connection figures for November at
Vodafone, the cellular phones group, were behind the 9 drop in Vodafone
shares to 397p on turnover of 2.9m.
Telecoms specialists said the new 'Lowcall' sales initiative, which promotes
a new low rental tariff, had proved a disappointment with 'Lowcall'
subscribers of 16,500 said to have been made up of 8,500 brand new customers
and 7,500 customers shifting to 'Lowcall' from the existing Vodafone system.
MicroFocus continued their excellent recent performance, adding 50 more at
2658p while there was further discreet support for Scholes Group which moved
up 9 to 119p. US buying of Sears helped the shares advance 4 to 96p with
9.8m traded.

FT  03 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Advance reversed on modest selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOUR day run of gains in the London stock market was abruptly reversed
yesterday. Although traders maintained that selling pressure was light, the
FT-SE Index listed stocks reacted sharply to a batch of discouraging
developments. At least two leading securities houses were buyers of the
non-Footsie stocks, however and selected demand from the US was reported in
the store sector.
At the close, the FT-SE Index was down 27.9 t 2,764.1, a shade above the
day's low but lacking support after Wall Street had come in with an early
loss of 12 point on the Dow Average. London was 17 points off when its day
started and could not sustain an attempt to rally during the first hour of
trading. But the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which has been lagging the main
market, added 6.3 yesterday and trading volume in non-Footsie stocks well
exceeded that in Footsie listed shares.
Among factors negative for the stock market yesterday, strategists pointed
to criticisms of the European exchange rate mechanism from Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank. Although sterling remains outside
the ERM, currency distress is unhelpful for international investors in
equities. However, a US securities house commented that forced devaluations
and cuts in national interest rates would help the re-stimulation of the
global economy on which the UK stock market is pinning its faith.
Weakness in the Hong Kong markes and in global oil prices continued to
unsettle some UK stocks and there was a mixed response to a batch of trading
statements from blue chip names.
Firmness in sterling together with a lower dollar restrained the
international stocks.
The premium on the December Footsie futures contract, which had been a
positive force for equities, was reined in yesterday, when the contract fell
back below the 2,800 mark briefly gained in the previous session.
There was a modest sell-off in shares in the afternoon when the market also
took aboard warnings against over-confidence on economic growth from both
GATT and the European Commission. However, the selling bout was soon over,
although share prices made little recovery.
Seaq reported trading volume remained high at 624.2m shares against 631.1m,
with yesterday's total boosted by good volume in the smaller stocks.
Tuesday's retail business was worth Pounds 1.2bn, re-emphasising the weight
of investment cash now moving through the stock market.
Trading results from Bass, the brewing group, were not well-received in the
stock market but Granada, the entertainments company, rose sharply on its
profits statement. Traders noted that neither factor appeared to shift the
market's overall view of the consumer sectors, which remained relatively
steady yesterday.
Market strategists appeared alarmed by the shakeout which was regarded as
only to be expected after the recent advance. Some believe that confidence
could be tested after Christmas if the French and German economies remain
sluggish. However, equity chartists believe that the Footsie could be tested
down to the mid-2,600 range without abandoning its currently bullish stance.

FT  03 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFIT-TAKING saw Footsie futures surrender most of the gains acquired over
the last four sessions as turnover fell back to more modest levels, Joel
Kibazo.
The opening trade in the December futures contract on the FT-SE was struck
at 2,792. The contract then traded in a narrow range of 2,790 and 2,799 for
the next few hours occasionally breaching the 2,800 level, though trading
volumes were very light.
The fall in gilt prices following the gilt auction, along with early falls
on Wall Street took their toll in mid-afternoon and the contract retreated
sharply, falling to a day's low of 2,773 and pulling the underlying cash
market lower.
December finished at 2,777, a decline of 30 on the previous session and
around 9 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 4.
Turnover was just under 6,000 contracts.
Volumes in traded options continued to decline and reached a meagre 22,310
lots. Turnover in the FT-SE 100 option was a poor 6,058 contracts.
Rolls-Royce was the most actively dealt stock option with a total of 2,642
lots, with the March 160 calls and the December 100 puts equally busy. This
was followed by HSBC, in which 1,402 contracts were traded.
NatWest Stockbrokers announced it had pulled out of the traded options
market after a strategic review.

FT  03 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Profit-taking keeps Dow under
pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
ALTHOUGH profit-taking continued to afflict US stock markets, underlying
sentiment remained positive and losses were kept to a minimum, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 8.11 at 3,286.25,
although off its lows for the day when it had been down almost 15 points.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended slightly lower, down
0.88 at 429.90, while the Amex composite gave up 0.41 at 392.56. The Nasdaq
composite's recent record-breaking streak finally ended, with the index
dropping 1.06 to 652.88. Turnover on the NYSE was 241m shares, and declines
outnumbered rises by 931 to 856.
The day's only economic statistics, a 10.3 per cent fall in October new
single-family home sales, were virtually ignored by the market because of
their inconsistency. Analysts and investors were reluctant to read much into
the latest numbers after the commerce department announced a big upward
revision in the previous month's data.
Most of the damage to prices was inflicted by profit-taking, and a fall in
Caterpillar, one of the biggest constituents of the Dow average.
The market was also nervous ahead of today's all-important employment report
for November, which will give the best indication yet of current economic
conditions. Investors were worried that because of structural weaknesses in
the labour market, recent, positive economic data might not feed through
into the job figures as some had hoped. Economists are expecting a rise of
about 50,000 in non-farm payrolls.
Among individual stocks, Caterpillar dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 54 3/8
after the management said that it appeared possible that the company would
report a 'modest loss' in the fourth quarter. Caterpillar had previously
said that it expected to post a small profit in the October-to-December
period.
LA Gear plunged Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 10 1/4 on a warning from the
sports-shoe maker that it expects to report a loss from continuing
operations of between Dollars 27m and Dollars 31m in the forth quarter, and
a loss of between Dollars 69m and Dollars 73m for the full year of 1992.
Consolidated Stores eased Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 17 in busy trading after
the broking house Merrill Lynch lowered its intermediate-term rating on the
stock from 'buy' to 'above average' in anticipation of a technical
correction in retail stocks during the first quarter.
Standard Federal Bank bucked the trend with a rise of Dollars 1 3/4 to
Dollars 24 following a statement from the company pre dicting 1992 earnings
of Dollars 3 a share, up sharply from the Dollars 2.11 reported a year ago.
On the Nasdaq market, LaserMaster Technology dropped Dollars  25/32 to
Dollars 2 23/32 after warning that it would not meet analysts' forecasts of
earnings and revenues for both the second fiscal quarter and for all of
1993.
Canada
TORONTO stocks finished mixed after a financial statement from the Canadian
government failed to deflect attention from Wall Street, dealers said.
The TSE 300 finished 8.4 lower at 3265.3 on volume of 41m shares valued at
CDollars 353m. Advances outstripped declines, 331 to 276, with 279 issues
unchanged.
Traders said the heavy volume was primarily due to traditional December
tax-loss selling of small-capitalisation issues.

FT  03 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses retreat on poor
corporate news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CURRENCY worries and some negative corporate news caused bourses to retreat,
writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS fell back after its recent gains as the possibility of a devaluation
in the franc began to worry the market for the first time. There were
reports that the Caisse des Depots bought shares late in the afternoon to
support the market. The CAC-40 index ended 8.96 down at 1,783.33 in turnover
of FFr2.6bn.
Eurotunnel was the day's most active issue, losing 95 centimes or 3.2 per
cent to FFr29.15 after its chairman Mr Andre Benard said the channel tunnel
project expected to raise new capital to help plug a funding shortfall which
he estimated at FFr5bn.
Also on the way down was Peugeot which dropped FFr7 to FFr536 after negative
car sales data for November. Last month Peugeot car sales in France fell 13
per cent from the same period in 1991, while sales by Renault rose 41.6 per
cent.
Euro Disney dropped a further FFr2.90 or 4.9 per cent to FFr56.50 as the
fallout from recent broker downgrades continued.
FRANKFURT saw a flurry of activity in late trading, having moved in a narrow
range for most of the day. The DAX index closed down 10.93 at 1,533.96 as
turnover rose to DM4.8bn from DM4.5bn.
Henkel fell DM23.20 or 4 per cent to DM569.00 following a presentation on
Tuesday at which the group said it expected 1992 pre-tax and net profit to
be below 1991 levels.
The implementation by the US of tariffs on steel imports from Europe failed
to have a negative effect on the sector, analysts said. Mr Michael Geiger at
County NatWest in London said that Thyssen and Preussag have been exempted
from the US measures and were therefore not directly affected. Thyssen
closed down 50 pfg at DM160.50 and Preussag, which announced a rise in
earnings for the year to September, slipped DM5.40 to DM342.10.
Commerzbank was 30 pfg higher at DM244.80 ahead of its 10-month results
today, while Deutsche Bank eased DM4.50 to DM672.50.
Volkswagen fell another DM8 to DM255 as analysts revise downwards 1993
forecasts following weekend reports of big 1992 losses.
MILAN was dragged down by weakness in Fiat and fears that interest rates
would start to creep back up. At the Bank of Italy's repurchase tender
yesterday, the average rate rose to 12.41 per cent from 12.23 per cent. The
Comit index fell 8.51 or 1.9 per cent to 433.26 in turnover estimated at
L180-200bn after L164bn.
The decline in Fiat accelerated after the share broke below the chart
resistance point of L4,000. It was officially fixed L265 or 6.2 per cent
lower at L3,975 and later sank to L3,905 in volume of around 7.7m shares, of
which 5m were traded off-market.
Ciga, the hotel group, dropped L116 or 10.1 per cent to L1,035 on continued
worries about its financial position. Fondiaria fell L1,350 or 4.6 per cent
to L28,250 as the speculative fizz evaporated from the stock.
Privatisation stocks showed some resistance to the downward pressure, as Sme
eased LL35 to L5,465 and Credito Italiano gave up L27 to L2,703.
ZURICH was affected by the weaker dollar and Ciba-Geigy was again the day's
most active issue with overseas selling reported. The SMI index closed 5.3
down at 1,923.9 as Ciba registered shares slipped SFr4 to SFr578.
Swiss Re went against the trend with a rise in its bearers of SFr40 to
SFr2,260 while the certificates firmed SFr2 to SFr466. Winterthur bearers
and registered shares rose SFr20 to SFr2,700 and SFr2,480 respectively
following an announcement that it had sold its 37 per cent stake in
Nordstern of Germany to UAP of France and would also take a 3 per cent stake
in the latter.
STOCKHOLM continued to decline on profit-taking following last month's
strong gains. The Affarsvarlden general index lost 10.90 to 885.20 as
turnover dropped to SKr77m from SKr793m.
Volvo B shares fell another SKr12 to SKr328 following the release earlier in
the week of bad new car registration figures for November.
AMSTERDAM remained quiet with chemicals again featuring among the day's most
actives. The CBS Tendency index put on 0.1 to 104.4. A large trade in
Heineken was noted as the stock slipped Fl 2.60 to Fl 170.80. Daf registered
another all-time low, losing 60 cents to Fl 6.20, as the company denied
reports that it was to withdraw from a joint venture with Renault to build
vans in the UK.
MADRID's general index lost 2.68 to 209.33 with Repsol slipping Pta40 to
Pta2,545.

FT  03 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong's weakness
remains in focus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOKYO closed marginally higher after fluctuating in a tight range and
activity was limited to small-lot trading by public funds and investment
trusts, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed 80.64 higher at 17,393.68 after a low of 17,254.76
in the morning and a high of 17,408.83 in the afternoon. After firming at
the start, following Tuesday's approval of the government's fiscal
supplementary budget by the House of Representatives, early gains were
erased by investment trusts' selling. However, bargain-hunting by public
funds supported prices in the afternoon.
Volume fell to 200m shares from 266m as advances led declines by 479 to 468
with 176 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
gained 4.23 to 1,308.31 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.26 to
1,056.50.
Investors said that aside from public funds and dealers' trading, genuine
buying was scarce. Some investors supported small-capital shares, and the
second section rose for the 10th consecutive day.
Toy makers and video game makers were strong ahead of the Christmas season.
Konami rose Y230 to Y2,950 and Sega Enterprises rose Y300 to Y10,000.
Bandai, the largest toy maker, gained Y170 to Y3,750, while Takara rose Y130
to Y1,330.
Semiconductor equipment makers rose on prospects of a recovery in the US
chip industry. Kyocera, the semiconductor ceramic package maker, rose Y70 to
Y4,240. Toshiba, which has strong business ties with US companies, rose Y2
to Y622. Other high-technology issues fell on profit-taking, with NEC down
Y7 to Y668 on earnings worries, and Matsushita Electric Industrial
retreating Y10 to Y1,140.
Speculative favourites rose on short-term buying by dealers, with Nippon
Carbon up Y33 to Y513 and Clarion rising Y30 to Y472.
On the over-the-counter market, TSD, the computer software maker, lost Y47
to Y573 after announcing that it expected to see losses on the pre-tax and
after-tax level for the September year-end.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 0.21 to 18,773.28 in volume of 30.2m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, gained Y500 to Y11,000 on reports of
an upward earnings revision by a leading Japanese broker.
Roundup
A further fall in Hong Kong depressed many of the region's markets
yesterday.
HONG KONG fell nearly 2 per cent at the opening following Governor Chris
Patten's statement that he intended to press ahead with democratic reforms.
But bargain-hunting helped to lift the Hang Seng index off the day's low of
5,391.71 to close 91.23 down at 5,410.48 in turnover of HKDollars 2.4bn.
Some analysts fear that the uncertainty could last until next February when
the draft reform proposals are presented to the legislative council.
Mr Michael Franklin at Kim Eng Securities said it was likely that
international fund managers were seeking to lock in their profits before the
year-end and would attempt to buy back in early 1993.
AUSTRALIA drifted lower on worries about the domestic economy and the weak

FT  03 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Santiago weighed down by overheated
economy - Traders fear another rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Santiago's stock exchange is suffering from a bout of year-end blues, due to
fears of another rise in interest rates to cool down the country's
overheated economy.
The latest projections show the Chilean economy growing by over 9 per cent
in 1992. Inflation has also quickened in November and may overshoot the
government's target of 13 per cent for the year.
So in spite of rises in interest rates in August and October, traders
believe the central bank will try to dampen Chile's frenzied economic
activity with a further adjustment in base rates before the end of the year.
High yields on government paper have siphoned off funds from the bolsa. The
Ipsa index of the 40 most traded shares fell by 7 per cent in November,
continuing a downward trend that began in August.
Compared to previous years, the performance of share prices has been modest
this year. The Ipsa has risen by 17.7 per cent in nominal peso terms since
January, or by 10.4 per cent in dollar terms, according to the International
Finance Corporation. By contrast, Ipsa shares more than doubled their value
last year.
'We do not see much year-end enthusiasm in the stock market given low
third-quarter corporate earnings and high risk-free government yields,' say
investment analysts at Celfin, the managers of Solomon Brothers' Chile Fund.
Other factors are also undermining confidence. The government has announced
a major reform of the capital markets in Chile, but details of the new
regulations are being kept under wraps. They are expected to affect the
equity portfolios of private pension funds - the biggest players in the
stock market - and the ensuing uncertainty is holding back investors. Daily
turnover has dropped to Dollars 6.5m from an average Dollars 11m in the past
year.
In addition, Chile's electricity companies, the most actively traded stocks,
have taken a pounding following a very public row over electricity tariffs.
These come under review every four years, and the government has ordered
tariff cuts for the 1993-97 period. By protesting too loudly electricity
companies appear to have triggered a run on their shares.
Enersis, the holding group which owns Chilectra, the biggest power
distribution company in Chile, saw its shares plunge by 9 per cent in
November, for a 24 per cent drop since their peak in June. Not even the
company's healthy third-quarter earnings, up 34 per cent compared with the
first nine months of 1991, have been able to revive interest in the shares.
The offloading of utility shares has also affected Endesa, the biggest power
generator in Chile, even though the tariff cuts apply only to the
electricity distribution companies. Endesa shares, which account for 30 per
cent of daily trading volume, were down 6.3 per cent last month. They have
lost 26.8 per cent of their value since June, even though profits were up by
22 per cent in the first nine months of the year.
Traders, however, are expecting a rally as Endesa was recently awarded an
'investment grade' rating by Standard &amp; Poor's, making it the only
private-sector company in Latin America to attain international standards of
creditworthiness.
One foreign investment fund manager believes that the market has overreacted
to what is essentially good news. While investment and exports continue to
grow at almost twice the rate of the economy, he thinks that fears of
overheating are unwarranted.
Most traders believe the market will bounce back early next year, once the
new legislation affecting Chile's capital markets is in place. They expect
the Ipsa index to rise by 10 per cent in real terms between now and March,
given the underlying strength of the economy and the growth potential of
Chile's leading companies.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Germany props up weak franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANKFURT and the franc-fort dominated the foreign exchange markets
yesterday as the Bundesbank propped up the french currency only hours after
its president hit out at central bank intervention, writes Peter John.
The moves took the spotlight from a strong pound and from the Danish krone
which was supported by intervention from the Belgian and Dutch central
banks.
In Paris, foreign exchange dealers said the Bank of France dipped in to the
market in the morning but they had seen no sign of the French central bank
intervening determinedly to prop up the franc, as it had been on Tuesday.
On the other hand, the announcement that the Bundesbank had chosen to buy
francs before the french currency hit its floor of FFr3.4305 to the mark
provided relief. There was no indication of the extent of the early
intervention but the Bundesbank bought FFr50m at the midday Frankfurt bourse
fixing and the inference was that it had bought a similar amount early on.
That level of intra-marginal intervention was relatively slight compared
with the massive flows of currency in September. There was a strong feeling
that France's currency problems were still very much in evidence and
devaluation was a growing possibility.
The franc rallied a centime to FFr3.4030 against the mark following the
intervention but drifted back again later and closed barely changed at
FFr3.4110.
Selling of the German currency also took some of the pressure off the dollar
which has suffered in the past two days despite several pieces of
encouraging economic news. Nevertheless, yesterday's figures on new home
sales gave no strong impetus and profit-takers took the US currency down to
DM1.5710 against DM1.5800. The dollar remained steady against the Yen at
Y124.40.
The krone remained at the bottom of the ERM league table despite
intervention by the Danish central bank to support the currency against the
Belgian franc and Dutch guilder, the two strongest currencies in the EMS.
The Belgian and Dutch Central banks also lent their support. The Belgian
National Bank said its support for weak ERM currencies totalled some BFr70bn
in the week to November 30.
The principal gainer yesterday was sterling which lifted half a pfennig to
DM2.4325 from DM2.4275 and improved against the dollar to Dollars 1.5485
from Dollars 1.5365.
One theory was that the very short-term refinancing following German
intervention surrounding Black Wednesday, had been carried out and selling
pressure on the pound had been lifted. The general consensus, however, was
that the UK currency was benefiting from being on the sidelines and away
from the contortions being suffered by the ERM member currencies. The Irish
punt also improved allowing short term interest rates in the country to be
cut to 30 per cent from 100 per cent.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Futures drift lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISAPPOINTMENT over the lack of interest in a big gilts auction overflowed
into the short sterling market yesterday. However, an increasing number of
dealers have already closed their positions ahead of the Christmas break and
much of the business was technical, writes Peter John.
At the opening, the sterling contract for March delivery was squeezed to its
high of 90.44. Then it was realised that the Pounds 2.5bn auction of gilts
was only covered 1.26 times and the contract was sold down to 93.35. The
auction interest was particularly disappointing because the gilts were
partly-paid.
One trader asked; 'If people don't want a partly paid stock that is free of
tax to overseas funding what do they want?' One interpretation was that
growing realisation of the extent of forthcoming UK borrowing requirements
were deterring overseas buyers.
The March contract, which has now moved decisively into the lead position
over December closed 7 points lower at 93.35 with some 14,200 contracts
traded, low compared with the previous two days. CIBC, the Canadian bank, is
a seller arguing that the yield differential between March and September is,
at seven basis points, too narrow and should widen to around 25 basis
points.
Meanwhile, the Bank of England said it expected a money market liquidity
shortage of around Pounds 500m. Among the main factors affecting the
position, the take-up of Treasury Bills and paper maturing in official hands
drained Pounds 685m from the system while a rise in note circulation removed
some Pounds 150m and bankers' balances below target took out some Pounds
50m. Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions were expected
to add some Pounds 365m.
The clearing banks declined to take up the early offer of assistance feeling
that at 6 per cent the overnight rates offered better value.
By the afternoon, overnight money had firmed to seven per cent and the
central bank provided Pounds 256m of assistance, buying Pounds 216m of band
one bank bills at 6 7/8 per cent and Pounds 40m of band two bank bills at
the same rate.
The Bank provided Pounds 25m in late assistance but the help came too late
for most of the clearers and there was still around Pounds 400m of the
revised Pounds 700m forecast shortage that was not taken up.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bad weather dampens US maize
hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COLD, WET weather and early snow storms ended the maize harvest prematurely
in some parts of the upper midwest last week, and set market bulls in
Chicago talking about quality problems that could reduce the size of the
bumper crop.
However, state agronomists and crop analysts say the quality problems are
localised. The US maize crop is so large, and the quality of harvested grain
is so high, that there is little chance that the US Department of
Agriculture's estimate of a 9.33bn bushel crop will be revised downward by
more than a few million bushels.
The USDA next reports preliminary crop estimates on December 10. Final
numbers on the US maize harvest will be released in January.
Still, high moisture content in much of the nation's maize crop will require
costly drying and special handling, trimming grower's profits. And in
scattered areas, high moisture and a short growing season have lowered test
weights and generated mould growth - a condition that leaves the maize unfit
for export or livestock consumption.
'What we have is an abundance of good quality corn (maize) nationally, and
an abundance of low quality corn in small areas,' says Mr David Miller, an
Illinois-based American Farm Bureau analyst.
The US maize harvest is usually complete by the end of November. However,
about 7m bushels, or about 20 per cent of the crop, is still standing in the
fields in Iowa and Illinois, the biggest maize-producing states. About 30
per cent of Indiana's maize crop is still in the field. Most of that grain
will eventually be harvested, although farmers might wait until mid-winter
freezes make the muddy fields safe for combines. In the meantime, the grain
will be subject to moisture and mold.
The situation in northern states is more severe. Only half of Wisconsin's
maize crop has been cut, and in Michigan, three quarters of the acreage is
awaiting harvest. Those states were projected to harvest about 500m bushels,
with more than half grown for on-farm livestock feed.
Much of that crop will not be harvested. Green, or underdeveloped, kernels
and mold have reduced the value of the maize there. County officials report
that farmers are plowing some fields under, or chopping the maize for
silage. 'Very little of our corn is intended to be abandoned, but a lot may
end up that way,' says a farm agent from Wisconsin's Sauk County.

</HEADLINE>

The firmer tendency in Australian wool prices came to a halt this week.
Despite lower offerings at the three selling centres, demand in the middle
Merino Categories was insufficient to maintain firmness fully, quite apart
from pushing prices into higher ground. Business has in general shown a
modest improvement as the price rise did proceed, and early ideas now are
that buyers are more cautious again. Buying never became fully confident,
with short-term needs only being covered. The Australian Wool Corporation's
market indicator yesterday was at 539 cents a kg.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Producer resistance blamed for
lack of progress at coffee pact talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE PRODUCING countries have come under fire from consumers for being
unprepared for the 10 days of talks on a new international agreement that
ended in London on Tuesday with little progress.
'I am very disappointed,' said Mr Myles Frechette, head of the US
delegation, who was annoyed to have missed the Thanksgiving holiday only to
find that 'producers resisted talking about the issues'.
'The whole process could be speeded up if we had constructive proposals from
the producers,' said Mr Robert van Schaagen of the Netherlands, chairman of
the International Coffee Council.
The producers appear not to have taken on board the advice given by Mr
Alexandre Beltrao, the International Coffee Organisation's chief executive,
in the run-up to the latest talks. Coffee exporters would have to co-operate
much more than in the past if a future international coffee agreement was to
be successful, he said.
Delegates have given themselves more time by extending the deadline for
negotiations for three months from December 31. The pact expires in
September next year and at least six months will be needed for member
countries to ratify any new agreement.
The ICO will meet again on January 25 when discussions will continue over
so-called 'selectivity', under which consumers will be able to choose the
type of coffee that comes into the market.
This is an important issue. One of the main reasons for the collapse of the
ICO export quota system and consequent halving of world prices was the fact
that consumers were unable to exercise their increasing preference for mild
and arabica coffees over robustas because of the system's rigidity.
Producers as ever put a cheerful face on the little progress made. Mr
Valdemar Carneiro Leao, Brazilian delegate and producer spokesman, told the
Reuter news agency there was a wide recognition that members were dealing
with something different from the past. 'But the whole mechanism of
selectivity is becoming clearer and clearer,' he said, adding that the
meeting had 'almost been in an exploratory mood'.
Nevertheless, prolonged talks on selectivity have prevented any bilateral
discussions of quota shares and price range targets.
One major hurdle was overcome in September with agreement on the principle
of a universal quota system - under which exporting countries would send
coffee to all destinations 'without distinction between importing member and
non-member countries'. Now the momentum appears to have been lost.
There have been suggestions that one reason for the slowdown has been the
change of administration in the US. But throughout the talks Mr Frechette
has insisted there has been no change in the US position. 'The US remains
committed to finding an agreement that addresses the issues of the past,' he
said on Tuesday.
The coffee agreement was likely to be low on President Clinton's list of
priorities, and was unlikely to be looked at until 'late summer or early
fall,' said Mr Frechette.
Ms Judy Ganes, analyst with Merrill Lynch, said observers should forget
about differences between producers and consumers and look at the potential
areas of disagreement among the producers. 'Think about what has really
happened at these talks,' she said. 'They did not even get on to quota
shares and price targets'.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London brokers, pointed out that
the biggest stumbling block at the latest talks had been the world's biggest
producer. There was no doubt that the lack of progress was caused by
intransigence, lack of preparation and a downgrading of the delegation by
Brazil, he said yesterday. 'This was seen as a clear sign that Brazil still
does not know where it stands on coffee policy, and there is a general
feeling that it will continue to block until it has a domestic structure in
its industry.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MEETING of producer and consumer members of the International Natural
Rubber Organisation has ended here with little apparent progress being made
on the issue of whether or not to negotiate a new international rubber
agreement.
The present International Natural Rubber Agreement expires at the end of
next year though Inro rules allow for an extension of two years, subject to
agreement.
A communique issued at the end of the Inro council meeting here said that a
decision on the renegotiation of Inra would be made before March next year.
Producer countries say they want a new agreement which will reflect changes
in the rubber trading system and safeguard the livelihoods of thousands of
rubber farmers.
Natural rubber prices have fallen by about a third over the past five years.
Consumer countries have argued that producer countries have not put forward
any real negotiating proposals and say that until that is done then the
present agreement should stay in place. The consumers also say that
producers have not made attempts to improve quality in line with requested
price increases.
However, there were some signs that the consumers had not closed the door
completely on a new Inra. 'I am rather optimistic that there will be a
renegotiation of Inra', said Mr W. Bastiaanse of the Netherlands, chairman
of the present INRO council. 'Consumer countries have shown interest and
want more information.'

FT  03 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Disillusioned traders push oil
prices still lower
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIDENCE IN the oil market weakened further yesterday when prices for
North Sea Brent crude oil for delivery in January slipped by another 20
cents to Dollars 18.30 a barrel.
World oil prices have lost a dollar a barrel in just over a week as traders
have become disillusioned with the ability of the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to support the oil price.
'The market is not convinced by last week's Opec agreement. There have been
no signs that Saudi Arabia and Iran will actually cut back their
production,' said Mr Peter Bogin, at Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
Mr Alirio Parra, Venezuela's energy minister and Opec's current president,
said in comments to the Reuter news agency yesterday that he could not
understand why the market had weakened following the agreement to cutback
output to 24.58m barrels a day from 25m b/d.
He said it was a realistic agreement and had the full support of all
members.
But weak prices for oil products have also been dragging the crude market
downwards. Europe remains well-stocked with products such as gasoil for
which prices have dropped by Dollars 5 to Dollars 10 a tonne over the past
month to Dollars 174 a tonne.
The weather in Europe and North America remains warmer than forecast leading
traders to fear that stocks of oil will not be run down very quickly and
could further depress prices early next year.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: More cuts in nickel production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER NICKEL producer, Western Mining Corporation of Australia, announced
production cuts yesterday. However, analysts suggested the cuts would make
no difference to present low prices and depressed market sentiment.
Suggestions that there was another boat carrying more than 10,000 tonnes of
nickel from the Commonwealth of Independent States waiting outside Rotterdam
because there was not enough equipment yet available to cut it, were also
weighing heavily on the market.
Analysts estimated that WMC's moves, which include the closure of its Foster
mine in Western Australia, would cut about 2,000 tonnes from its nickel
output in the year to the end of June.
Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque
Indosuez Group, said London Metal Exchange nickel stocks, at nearly 64,000
tonnes, represented 10 per cent of western world annual consumption and 'it
needs a big increase in demand to have an impact on that. But demand is
still very weak, particularly in Japan'.
There was no sign of a revival in demand for stainless steel, the biggest
user of nickel, he pointed out. 'And stainless steel scrap prices - a lead
indicator for nickel - are not moving.'
Mr Bielski suggested, however, that nickel prices should move to a level
representing the average world-wide cost of production - about USDollars
6,171 a tonne.
Nickel closed at Dollars 5,622.50 a tonne, up Dollars 35, on the LME
yesterday. WMC said its nickel division, which produced nearly 49,000 tonnes
of metal in the year to the end of last June, was operating at a loss. It
aimed to push production costs below Dollars 5,510.
Analysts suggested WMC's announcement was mainly for the benefit of its
domestic unions - contracts at its Kambalda nickel operations in Western
Australia expire this month.
WMC also announced that its Chibougamau copper-gold mine in Canada would
close if it was not sold by January. The company has already written off
ADollars 120m from the mine's value.
Present low nickel prices are causing expansion projects to be deferred and
this could result in production shortfalls from the mid-1990s, the Metals &amp;
Minerals Research Services consultancy group, warns in its latest study. The
same is true for aluminium, MMRS adds.
Tin and lead prices have been depressed for even longer and this will hold
back production capacity, 'leading to sharp price increases in 1995-96 (for
those metals), perhaps sooner for tin'.
In contrast, the relatively stronger performance of copper and zinc prices
may have stimulated enough expansion to ensure that supplies keep pace with
demand.
MMRS predicts that between 1992 and 1997 nickel demand will rise by 22 per
cent, aluminium's by 19.3 per cent, copper's by 18 per cent, zinc's by 17.4
per cent, lead's by 14.3 per cent and tin's by 12.5 per cent. This results
in an aggregate rise for the LME-traded metals of 18 per cent or 3.4 per
cent a year.

A surge in PLATINUM prices in early Nymex trade lifted precious metal prices
in London, dealers said. The Nymex January platinum contract pushed through
resistance at Dollars 365 a troy ounce, taking spot metal above resistance
at Dollars 364 before the it fell back on profit-taking. Dealers said they
were looking for platinum to close above these levels to confirm an
extension of the rally of the past two days into a new, higher range. The
key upside target would then be Dollars 370, above which individual Japanese
investors are expected to re-enter the market. A sharp rise in TIN prices
dominated afternoon LME trading while other metals tried to stabilise after
the wide movements of the past few days, dealers said. German consumer
buying appeared to prompt short covering that took three-month through
Dollars 5,800, triggering buy stops. 'The trouble with tin is that it is
very thin and once the buy stops are satisified we could have an equally
sharp setback (today),' one trader said.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Protection planned for banana
suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK and France are planning 'intermediate measures' to protect
traditional banana suppliers, in case disagreement over reform of the
European Community's banana import regime prevents settlement by the start
of 1993, Mr John Gummer, Britain's farm minister, said yesterday.
Addressing a House of Commons Agriculture Committee, Mr Gummer defended a
recent British move to break deadlock over the shape of reform by suggesting
tariff-based options. At present, traditional suppliers are protected by
quota arrangements: 'We are not tied to a method: we are tied to an end,' he
said.
He emphasised that the UK was pressing hard for an 'imminent' breakthrough,
but at the same time expressed concern at the lack of progress towards
settlement of differences between countries like Germany, Belgium and
Denmark, which import cheaper 'dollar' bananas from Latin America, and the
UK, France, Spain and Portugal, which reserve their markets for more
expensive suppliers (mainly in the Caribbean) as part of aid obligations
under the Lome convention.
Controversy has arisen because when the single market is set up on January 1
next year, cheap dollar bananas will be able to flow freely across the EC,
putting the plight of traditional suppliers in jeopardy. Mr Gummer warned
that whether the new regime were tariff-based or quota-based, 'countries
(like Germany or Belgium) that never previously had to bear any burden now
realise this is a community burden' which will inevitably have an impact on
banana prices.
'Everybody has an interest in getting a solution by January 1. If we don't
then there will be five EC countries insisting on interim arrangements. . .
Do we want the community, on the very first day of the single market, to be
rent asunder by political obligations?' he warned.
Meanwhile yesterday the European Commission approved a French request
effectively halting further imports this year of bananas from Ivory Coast
and Cameroon, which exceeded their quotas by 16.4 per cent and 10 per cent
respectively in November, according to a French official.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentina threatens Falklands'
fish earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALKLAND islands is facing a heavy financial loss as Taiwanese and
Korean fishing companies prepare to follow Japanese companies' defection to
Argentine fishing grounds.
The Argentine government recently decided to abandon its requirement that
foreign fishing vessels register in an Argentine port and fly the national
flag, while also cutting the price of licences issued to Japanese, Korean,
Taiwanese and Spanish companies to fish for Illex squid in Argentine waters.
The moves threaten to precipitate what Penguin News, the islands' newspaper,
has described as the worst crisis to face the British crown colony since
Argentina invaded it in 1982.
A large proportion of the Far Eastern companies that were offered licences
by the Falklands government three weeks ago have elected not to take up
their allocations, opting instead for the cheaper Argentine licences, which
are unrestricted in terms of control and last two to three years.
Three of Japan's largest fishing companies, KSJ, OSA and CTC, were
originally offered 70 licences by the Falklands government. They have
indicated that they will take up just 12: resulting in a revenue loss of
many millions of pounds to the Falklands.
Taiwanese and Korean companies are set to follow the Japanese and
indications now are that the Falklands will suffer a revenue loss of about
Pounds 16m a year, although pessmistic estimates put the figure much higher.
Revenue from the sale of licences last year amounted to more than Pounds
30m, which comprised 64 per cent of the islands' annual revenue.
The islands' government also fears damage to stocks. It is understood that
the Argentines believe squid live only one year and that what is not caught
is lost. An official in Port Stanley said this showed they did not
understand basic squid biology. 'What is not fished is not lost,' he said.
'It survives to breed and produce next year's crop.'

FT  03 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts tumble following disappointing
auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK GOVERNMENT bonds fell a quarter-point after the Bank of England's
disappointing auction of government bonds.
The Bank offered Pounds 2.5bn of a newly-created stock, the 8 per cent gilt
due 2003, which is expected to take over as the new 10-year benchmark gilt.
However, demand for the stock was poor: the Bank reported a cover ratio (the
ratio of bids to the amount on offer) of only 1.26 times, and the auction
was dominated by domestic players as foreign investors continued to shy away
from the gilt market.
The lowest accepted price was 96 13/16 , to yield 8.48 per cent, while the
highest accepted price was 96 15/16 , yielding 8.46 per cent. The spread of
bids was relatively narrow, as dealers pointed out that it was not difficult
to price the new gilt.
'The bids were very tightly grouped around the market level', said Mr John
Shepperd, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities.
The auction was the first since sterling left the European exchange rate
mechanism in September. Foreign investors have been reluctant to invest in
gilts since then because of the greater exchange rate risk, and were largely
absent from yesterday's auction. Both domestic and foreign investors have
become concerned about the heavy funding pressures on the market and the
possibility of rising inflation.
Dealers said that quite a lot of the auction stock ended up with
marketmakers, and warned that this could overhang the market for a while.
GERMAN government bonds ended weaker as the Bundesbank emphasised its
commitment to low inflation, wiping out any hopes of lower German interest
rates.
In addition, the new issue of bonds from Treuhand, the privatisation agency,
had a poor reception which further depressed the bund market.
The Liffe bund futures contract fell from its opening 91.03 to a low of
90.71 on around 45,000 contracts.
The fall in bund prices followed comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, that Germany should not give up its tight monetary
policies to fall in with the wishes of other European countries.
The Treuhand agency yesterday allocated DM 4.05bn of its new ten-year 7 3/8
per cent bonds in a tender. The minimum accepted price was 99.51, and the
average was 99.54, for a yield of 7.44 per cent.
JAPANESE government bonds closed higher on expectations of a cut in interest
rates. The benchmark No 145 opened with a yield of 4.605 per cent and
climbed steadily all day, to close at 4.58 per cent.
The rate on three-month certificates of deposit fell from 3.8 per cent to
3.75 per cent, encouraging hopes that the Bank of Japan may cut the Official
Discount Rate this month. Dealers said the passage of the supplementary
budget in Japan's lower house added to the bullish mood.
US TREASURY prices were mixed across the maturity range yesterday as dealers
and investors traded cautiously ahead of today's all-important November
employment report.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/32 at 100
21/32 , yielding 7.564 per cent. But prices were slightly firmer at the
short end of the market with the two-year note up  1/32 at 99 5/8 , to yield
4.808 per cent.
Eyes were focused on jobs data due this morning. Recent statistics have
painted a picture of gradual recovery, but the employment report should give
the best indication yet of economic conditions. Economists expect a rise of
about 50,000 in non-farm payrolls.
Nervousness ahead of the figures partially explained the slight reaction to
the 10.3 per cent plunge in home sales in October. But the chief reason for
indifference was the unreliability of home sales data, and the fact that the
big drop in October was offset by an upward revision for September.

FT  03 DEC 92 / International Bonds: Allure of dollar and D-Mark underlined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTENTION fell on the performance of the UK government's Dollars 3bn
Eurobond yesterday. The 10-year issue continued to trade at its launch
spread of 22 basis points over US Treasuries, proving, said traders, that
the borrower had got the pricing right.
The day's new issues helped to underline the attractions of the US dollar
and the D-Mark at a time of currency uncertainty. Defying the sceptics who
believe the market has had its fill of such instruments, Kidder Peabody said
its Dollars 100m 10-year collared floater for GECC enjoyed good sales in
continental Europe, especially in Switzerland.
Kidder Peabody's Dollars 200m five-year floating rate note for Nacional
Financiera, the Mexican government agency, uses a guaranteed pass-though
structure. It is guaranteed by Nafinsa and has the additional security of
loans from Nafinsa to 18 other Mexican banks. Nafinsa will use the
repayments of these loans to retire the debt, giving it a short, 2 1/2
 year, average life.
The yield to average life is 260 basis points over Libor.
Confirming the demand for D-Marks, Lehman Brothers said the DM100m five-year
issue it launched for SBAB, the Swedish National Mortgage Housing
Association, was driven by a lead institutional order. It was issued under
the borrower's existing medium-term note programme and targetted at German
institutions.
Swiss Bank Corporation in Germany increased another GECC issue after strong
demand, raising to DM300m from DM250m the seven-year bonds launched a day
earlier.
Rabobank Nederland brought the Bank for Dutch Municipalities to market with
a Fls 1bn 12-year issue targetted at retail investors and small portfolio
managers.

FT  03 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: EC conflict over proposals
for deposit protection scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEPOSITORS at UK banks could get greater compensation when a bank fails, if
a European Community directive on deposit protection schemes is agreed.
However, EC members are at loggerheads over the proposed directive, and will
air grievances at a Financial Attaches' meeting in Brussels today.
Most EC members agree to the principle that if a bank from one country has a
branch in another country, depositors of that branch should be covered by
the deposit protection scheme operating in the home country of the parent
bank. At the moment, depositors are protected by the scheme operated by the
country in which the branch is operating, or the host country.
However, Germany, which is receiving some support from Italy, questions
whether it is necessary to have an EC directive at all, arguing that deposit
protection schemes are a matter of national rather than EC concern.
Most EC members also agree that a minimum level of deposit protection should
be provided in all EC countries, though countries should be free to decide
the maximum level of protection they are prepared to give.
Thus Germany and Italy would be able to continue to give a guarantee to
depositors at their banks that they would not lose anything in the event of
a bank failure. On the other hand, the UK would continue to pay no more than
Pounds 15,000 to each depositor.
But there are three important issues on which there is little agreement
between EC members:
France believes that the minimum level of insurance for the EC should be
Ecu60,000, compared with an Ecu15,000 minimum proposed in the draft. The UK
supports the Ecu15,000 minimum.
Italy and Germany are opposed to a proposal that bank branches whose home
country has a low level of deposit protection can opt into the higher level
of protection offered in a host country, such as Germany and Italy.
The draft directive proposes that depositors should always face some risk of
loss on their deposits, which is known as the principle of co-insurance,
whereas France, Belgium, Denmark, Germany and Italy all oppose co-insurance.
Thus the draft directive says that any country which implemented only the
minimum level of protection would compensate depositors in a failed bank for
only 90 per cent of their deposits up to Ecu15,000.
On the other hand, France and it allies want 100 per cent protection up to
Ecu15,000. The British Bankers Association wants the UK to retain its
current 75 per cent compensation rate.
Meanwhile a US Federal Reserve economist, Ms Sydney Key, will argue in a
paper to be delivered in Brussels today that the directive is seriously
flawed by the absence of a maximum level of deposit protection for EC
members.

case
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIAN Consolidated Investments (ACIL), the investment company which
owns the former Bell Resources, has been refused leave to appeal against a
Court of Appeal decision in favour of bondholders earlier this year.
The dispute arose when bondholders tried to exercise a put option for early
repayment of principal at 117.7 per cent of par value on November 13, 1991.
Instead, bonds were redeemed at only 103 per cent of their par value when
the company exercised its call option.
The decision means the company must repay investors the remaining 14.7 per
cent plus interest.

FT  03 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: SIB issues guidance on
derivative instruments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Investments Board yesterday published two guidance papers
on trading derivative instruments on exchanges, designed to clarify how the
UK's Financial Services Act should be applied to derivatives.
The first paper deals with incentive schemes initiated by exchanges in order
to encourage trading activity, while the second paper provides guidance on
what constitutes a proper trade and a proper market.
Both reviews were sparked in part by last year's scandal on the London
Futures and Options Exchange (FOX), which involved the rigging of its now
defunct property futures contract.
Mr Barry Gittins, who is in charge of derivatives and securities regulation
at the SIB, said the papers were designed to make it simpler to apply the
Act to derivatives. The FSA's rules on acceptable practice are focused on
securities, and do not give specific rules on how to deal with derivatives.
Mr Gittins added that a review of over-the-counter derivatives trading, an
even more complex area, may be undertaken in the future.
Mr Michael Jenkins, who took over as chairman of FOX in the wake of the
property futures trade-rigging scandal, welcomed the guidance papers, which
he described as 'overdue'. He said that it was 'right for regulators to
issue guidance on the interpretation (of the FSA) so that exchanges can
issue rules accordingly'.
Comments on the draft guidance on proper trades and proper markets are
invited by the SIB.

speculation intensifies

<TEXT>
ASTRA International, Indonesia's troubled automotive company, reported net
profits of Rp59.2bn (Dollars 28.6m) for the nine months to December, a 69
per cent fall on year-earlier figures.
The results coincided with renewed speculation that the Soeryadjaya family,
Astra's majority owners, are preparing to sell a substantial stake.
Net of extraordinary items, Astra made Rp16.6bn in the third quarter, an
improvement on the Rp5.2bn loss in the second quarter but slightly below
brokers' forecasts. Brokers said net profits for the year were unlikely to
break Rp80bn, against Rp210bn in 1991.
The Soeryadjayas own 57 per cent of Astra but are under pressure to sell
shares to raise finance for their privately-owned Bank Summa. Bank Summa was
suspended in mid-November with bad debts exceeding Rp1,000bn.
Brokers say Mr Prajogo Pangestu, a prominent Indonesian businessman and a
close associate of the family of President Suharto, has emerged as a
potential purchaser for a large portion of the Soeryadjayas' Astra holding.
Bank Summa's problems have prompted public concern over the wider health of
the banking sector, resulting in a run on two banks.
Bank Subentra and Bank Surya have reported large withdrawals following
speculation they had fallen into arrears with the central bank. This has
been denied by the central bank, which has declared them to be in sound
financial health. Mr Sudwikhatmono, a shareholder in both banks and a
relative of President Suharto, has called for rumour-mongers to be charged
with subversion.
Mr Eka Widjaja will step down as president commissioner of Bank
International Indonesia, Indonesia's third largest private bank and a listed
company.

FT  03 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: WMC to cut nickel production
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN Mining Corporation (WMC), the Australian metals producer, has
confirmed production cuts at its Western Australian nickel operations in
response to low world nickel prices.
The company has also announced that its Chibougamau gold/copper mine in
Canada will be put up for sale. WMC directors said yesterday the company's
nickel division was operating at a loss at current nickel prices.
Directors did not spell out the exact extent of nickel production cuts
likely for the current full year, but they said operational changes would be
made at both the Kambalda and Leinster complexes.
'The nickel division will continue with its previously-announced long-term
expansion and cost-reduction strategy with the objective of lowering total
costs below Dollars 2.50 per pound,' they said.
'Every endeavour is being made to urgently reduce current spending and
enhance WMC's competitive position. The nickel division operations will
remain under review having regard to the continuing necessity to reduce
costs and the fluctuations in the nickel price.'
The Chibougamau oper-ations were marginally economic and could not be
sustained at current metal prices. If a sale could not be completed by
January 31 1993, the operations would be closed and site reclamation
commenced, the company said.
The Australian Mining Industry Council (AMIC) has released figures
indicating that net profits of Australian mining companies fell 27 per cent
in the 1991-92 year to ADollars 1.87bn (USDollars 1.2bn).
It was the industry's second consecutive year of significant decline, with
earnings peaking at Dollars A4.33bn in 1990. It was also the industry's
lowest level of profits since 1987.

FT  03 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Hungary spices up investor
appeal - A look at a mould-breaking government bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN investors in the Hungarian stock market, until now limited to
slow-performing equities, have won direct access to the far more vibrant
market in government bonds.
The breakthrough comes with Hungary's invitation to foreigners, along with
domestic investors, to subscribe to a mould-breaking five-year state bond.
The 'paprika bond,' nicknamed after the peppers which spice Hungarian food,
is the first long-term government security in post-communist central and
eastern Europe to offer a truly fixed coupon.
Kulturvest, a subsidiary of Banque Indosuez Hungary is marketing a Ft7bn
(Dollars 84m) issue.
The bond, priced at 99.5 per cent, bears a coupon of 16 per cent with both
interest and redemption convertible into dollars at the prevailing exchange
rate.
A separate B tranche is to be marketed internationally.
The government claims that the issue yield of 16.2 per cent should
compensate outside investors for currency risks, which this year has
amounted to little over 5 per cent.
The move to widen investor appeal opens up an important new route into
Hungarian government paper for foreign investors, who could to date only
participate through intermediaries.
The paprika bond provides an alternative to the investment funds focusing on
government securities set up by CA Securities, the Hungarian investment
banking arm of Austria's Creditanstalt, and four other institutions.
The funds have limited use since they are permitted to sell up to 20 per
cent only to foreigners, although some have effectively worked around the
rule.
The latest issue is potentially much more attractive to investors than the
three-year bond which launched the government bond market last October but
was closed to foreign subscribers.
However, brokers tend to agree that no rush of money is likely to result
from the five-year bond issue, symbolically important as it is.
First of all, the Finance Ministry is beginning with a small transaction to
'test the market.' Moreover, Mr Peter Zelnik, manager of Europartners, the
Finance Ministry's adviser on the transaction, admits that western interest
for the five-year bond is relatively low.
'Investors are simply not aware the opportunities and the risks attached to
the Hungarian forint,' he says.
Western brokers argue rather that the yield of just over 16 per cent is
simply too low for a path-finding issue, some saying that it would need to
be closer to 20 per cent to be attractive internationally.
The five-year bond's significance is more that it sets a standard for
follow-up issues. 'We are speaking about a new market, not just a new issue:
now the forint market is opening to foreign investors,' says Mr Zelnik.
Treasury bills and the three-year state bond have recently accounted for
more than 90 per cent of turnover on the Budapest stock exchange and have
dwarfed equities' trading.
The government needs to broaden further the debt market to to finance a
growing budget deficit.
The Finance Ministry calculates on a shortfall in central government
finances next year of Ft185bn and a total public-sector deficit equivalent
to about 6 per cent of GDP.
Reforms of public finances limit the amount that the state can borrow at
preferential interest rates from the National Bank of Hungary, the central
bank, and pressure is increasing for further securitisation of the existing
state debt of Ft1800bn.
The government is moreover eager to diversify state borrowing which
currently leans dangerously on commercial bank purchases of Treasuries and
central bank borrowing on international bond markets.
The authorities feel the timing is right for the move because Hungary's
economy seems to have stabilised.
Inflation, interest and currency depreciation rates have fallen sharply  -
and have brought investors' economic expectations closer into line with the
government's optimism.
However, not everyone is convinced that a wider bond market is an
unadulterated benefit for the stock market as a whole.
'It works for the debt market but against the equity market,' says Mr
Zsigmond Jarai, the Budapest representative of James Capel, the UK
brokerage.
'It depends on what you call a stock market. The real sign of building
capitalism is equity rather than debt,' he added.
However, other brokers hope that deep markets in government debt will
establish a true yield curve and bond benchmarks by which other issues can
be priced.
'It is helpful for the stock market as a whole,' says Mr Andras Simor,
managing director of CA Securities.

FT  03 DEC 92 / International Company News: Nomura to shed 1,400 jobs as
part of cost-cutting plan
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NOMURA Securities, Japan's largest broker, will shed 1,400 staff - 10 per
cent of its workforce - over the next three years and close at least half of
the 18 broking 'boutiques' opened in Japanese department stores and shopping
malls.
The broker has broadened a cost-cutting programme intended to increase
profitability after a net loss of Y8.49bn (Dollars 68.3m) during the first
half, when stock brokerage commissions fell by 39.6 per cent and the value
of stocks underwritten was 77.4 per lower.
A continuing fall in retail investment has prompted Nomura to close or plan
to close nine of its 18 'boutiques', which were opened to make investment
more convenient for shoppers. The future of the remaining nine sub-branches
is apparently under review.
These boutiques, opened during the late 1980s, are also on the cost-cutting
list of other leading brokers. Yamaichi Securities, which had a net loss of
Y15.8bn for the first half, has closed all 10 of the sub-branches
established since the Finance Ministry approved the concept in 1985.
Nomura also plans to cut computer system spending by 20 per cent over the
next three years, and has asked staff to reduce general expenses, including
entertainment and transport costs, by 20 per cent in this half. General
expenses were supposed to be 5 per cent lower during the first half.
The reduction of 1,400 jobs will be done by cutting the annual intake of
graduates and by not replacing general staff who retire or resign. Nomura
said yesterday that none of its employees in Japan would be sacked.
Cutting staff and computer expenses is in stark contrast to the industry
trend of the late 1980s, when companies installed computer networks able to
handle a share trading volume far in excess of their needs in the 1990s.
Daily share turnover on the Tokyo exchange last month was about a fifth of
the 1988 level.
Nomura has already announced a lowering of its international profile.
The broker recently cut 35 staff from its London operations and closed three
continental European offices.

<TEXT>
HONG Kong's enthusiasm for Chinese flotations has not seemingly been
effected by this week's share price plunge. The public offer of shares in
Guangzhou Investments, a mainland-owned property company, was provisionally
subscribed around 230 times when the offer closed yesterday.
The colony's Hang Seng Index has shed 575 points, or 9.6 per cent, in just
three days of trading, yet small investors showed sufficient confidence in
corporate China to put forward in the region of HKDollars 100bn (USDollars
12.9bn) for a Dollars HK446m issue.
Guangzhou Investment is wholly-owned by the Guangzhou (Canton) Municipal
Government and is involved in sizeable property developments in both Hong
Kong and China.
Armed with immaculate connections across the border, investors are assuming
the company will be able to cash in on booming property prices in southern
China, while remaining sufficiently insulated from the current political
uncertainty in Hong Kong.
The most recent mainland new issue in Hong Kong, China Travel Service, was
411 times subscribed in early November. Despite the subsequent stock market
performance, it closed yesterday at a 127.5 per cent premium to its issue
price, providing some justification for the response to Guangzhou
Investment.
The property company is offering 425m shares at Dollars 1.05 and has the
backing of Mr Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong Holdings, which is taking a 7.5 per
cent stake, thereby building up contacts with a potentially useful source of
property projects.
The offer period for another major Hong Kong flotation opens today but
analysts are less confident over the outcome. National Mutual Asia is the
largest public offer since June 1990, but despite the uncertain market
climate the underwriters decided to go ahead with the issue.
In May 1989, the colony's largest rights issue by Hopewell Holdings was
withdrawn as stock market confidence shattered in the midst of the student
demonstrations in Beijing. Merchant bankers had considered it possible the
National Mutual flotation would receive a similar response.

<TEXT>
CATERPILLAR, one of North America's largest heavy equipment exporters,
yesterday said it expected to take a loss in the fourth quarter.
The company had earlier told shareholders it expected a modest profit in the
quarter, excluding the gain from the sale of its lift truck joint venture
and the impact of adopting new accounting standards.
Caterpillar reversed its profit projection after recording weak sales in
Europe and higher-than-expected losses from its Brazilian opera-tions.
The company said it was now projecting a 'modest' loss if the Dollars 50m to
Dollars 65m gain from the truck operation was included, and the impact of
the new accounting standards excluded.
Mr Thomas Burns, securities analyst for County NatWest USA, said the
projection translated into a loss of about 60 cents a share from operations
in the fourth quarter, or a deficit of about Dollars 2.20 a share for the
year.
The group said it would have to take additional write-offs in the quarter
for consolidating its two Brazilian plants.
Higher forecasts for losses from foreign exchange translations would also
hurt fourth-quarter results, the company said.
Caterpillar said its outlook for 1993 continued to depend on the strength of
economic recoveries in North America and Europe.
The company also said that some US customers might be deferring purchases
originally intended for 1992 until 1993 because they were waiting for
details of a new investment tax credit programme
Caterpillar shares fell Dollars 2 1/4 yesterday to close at Dollars 43 3/8
in New York following the company's forecast.

BOMBARDIER, the Canadian aerospace and transit equipment group building
shuttle wagons for the Channel tunnel between England and France, reported
sharply higher revenues and earnings for the third quarter and at nine
months, partly due to consolidation of two recent acquisitions.
All segments of the business contributed higher sales and operating profit,
except transit equipment which was affected by problems with the CDollars
650m (USDollars 505m) tunnel contract.
The results now include De Havilland Canada, the commuter aircraft builder,
and UTDC, an Ontario producer of mass transit equipment.
Third-quarter profit was CDollars 28.3m, or 18 cents a share, against
CDollars 21.5m, or 15 cents, a year earlier on revenues of CDollars 1.13bn,
up from CDollars 734m.
Nine-month profit was CDollars 90.7m, or 58 cents, against CDollars 70.9m,
or 49 cents, on sales of CDollars 3.04bn, compared with CDollars 2.08bn.
Bombardier, which includes Canadair, Short Brothers of Belfast and Learjet
of the US in its aerospace group, where the total order backlog is nearly
CDollars 5bn. Its Eurorail group in France and Belgium is handling the
tunnel shuttle order.
Mr Laurent Beaudoin, chairman, said the transit equipment group was testing
prototype shuttle wagons and deliveries should start in the first quarter of
1993.
'Because of design changes and other customer requirements, there has been a
substantial increase in workload and costs,' he said.
The contract with Transmanche Link, the Franco-British group carrying out
the tunnel project, 'is of a fixed-price nature,' said Mr Beaudoin. 'But it
does provide a mechanism for remunerating Bombardier for additional work and
for dealing with resulting schedule changes.'

military vehicle merger

<TEXT>
FMC, the diversified chemicals group, and Harsco, the equipment
manufacturing business, plan to combine their military vehicle businesses in
the latest example of a merger wave in the US defence industry.
The two said the combined business would have estimated sales in 1993 of
about Dollars 1.2bn and would be owned 60 per cent by FMC and 40 per cent by
Harsco.
FMC, with interests ranging from chemicals to machinery and equipment, will
put into the partnership its Defence Systems group, which employs more than
6,000 people. Its best-known product is the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, a
tracked vehicle armed with automatic cannon which saw extensive action with
US troops in the Gulf war.
Harsco will put into the group its BMY-Combat Systems division, which
employs 2,000 people and makes tracked vehicles for artillery and combat
support functions.
The deal is part of a trend for US defence companies to merge their
activities in a bid for greater efficiencies as the US defence budget
shrinks following the end of the Cold War.
Mr Malcolm Gambill, chairman of Harsco, said the two businesses were a
natural fit and would be a 'powerhouse in tracked vehicles'. The deal would
lead to some consolidation, with the removal of unneeded higher cost
capacity.
The new company will include FMC's naval systems division and its steel
products division, which makes military track.
However, Harsco will retain its BMY-Wheeled Vehicles division, which makes
five-ton army trucks and has been suffering a dearth of orders.

LACTA, the market leader in Brazilian chocolates, suffered a loss of
Cr40.4bn (Dollars 5.6m) for the first nine months of 1992. In 1991, the
company earned Dollars 1.5m for the entire year.
The Brazilian chocolate market has fallen by 15 per cent this year, but
Lacta said it managed to hold the company's decline to 12 per cent.
Lacta is one of Brazil's big three chocolate makers. It enjoyed a 43 per
cent market share for January-July, compared with 28 per cent for Nestle,
the subsidiary of the Swiss multinational, and 24.6 per cent for Garoto, a
Brazilian competitor.
A dispute has been simmering between the controlling group, headed by
Brazilian businessman Mr Adhemar de Barros Filho, and minority partner
Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss company owned by Philip Morris. Jacobs Suchard
held 40 per cent of voting capital before it was purchased by Philip Morris.
Earlier this year, a planned stock issue was held up by a judicial
restraining order sought by Jacobs Suchard. Lacta is now authorised to make
the issue, but no date has been set.

FT  03 DEC 92 / International Company News: Tel Aviv urged to ride the
raging bull - The Israeli government's attempt to divest itself of its bank
stakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON the face of it, the Israeli government's long, drawn-out effort to divest
itself of its majority holdings in the country's four largest banks took an
important step forward this week.
The placing of the state's 42.5 per cent stake in IDB Holding, the rich
industrial investment arm of Israel Discount Bank, on the Tel Aviv stock
exchange (Tase) on Sunday was no less than 120 times oversubscribed, despite
being the biggest issue the market had ever undertaken.
If all the options involved are taken up, it will yield the government more
than Dollars 350m.
Officials at the Tase, well aware that a surging bull market this year is
unlikely to carry on indefinitely, are urging the government to speed up
privatising the banks and the state's big industrial holdings while demand
remains strong.
Mr Gil Leidner, managing director of MI Holdings, the government agency
charged with selling off the state's stake in the banks, agreed the success
of the IDB issue underlined the importance of moving ahead quickly with
other bank share flotations.
The government is committed to privatisation and says it is prepared to sell
off big industrial companies such as Bezeq, the communications monopoly. But
the government's complex involvement in the banking system remains fraught
with difficulties and a swift resolution still seems unlikely.
The IDB Holding issue was probably the most straightforward in the bank sale
process. The company had been separated from Israel Discount Bank and
majority control had already been sold back to the original owners, the
Recanati family of Tel Aviv.
It has proved much more difficult for the government to decide what to do
about Israel Discount Bank itself and its two bigger rivals, Bank Hapoalim
and Bank Leumi.
Even the disposal of a controlling stake in Bank Mizrahi, the fourth-ranking
bank, has apparently run into difficulties over the winning bidder's ability
to gain approval from the banking authorities.
The problem dates back to 1983 when the government was forced to acquire
majority holdings in the four banks - at a cost of Dollars 7bn  - after an
elaborate system run by the banks of ramping up their own shares collapsed.
The government has never run the banks because a preferential share system
left control and management in the hands of the original owners. However,
under agreements reached with each of the controlling interests, all shares
will have equal voting value after the state's holdings are sold off.
The government has been grappling with the sale for at least five years
without managing to dispose of one of the banks. Now a deadline is looming,
adding pressure on it to deliver.
Under the terms of the 1983 share buy-out, the banks will, in effect, fall
under direct state control from October 1993 unless they have been disposed
of by then.
MI Holdings did reach agreement with Mr Gad Ze'evi, an Israeli businessman,
in September to sell him a 51 per cent share of Bank Mizrahi (previously
owned by the World Mizrahi religious organisation) for Dollars 185m. The
balance of government-held shares in the bank would be sold on the Tase at a
later date.
But, so far, the Bank of Israel has not given its approval. It is understood
one of the problems is the reluctance of the US Federal Reserve to approve
the sale of Mizrahi's US subsidiary. This week, Mizrahi's board threatened
to resign if the sale did not go through by the end of January.
The Bank of Israel makes no secret of its unhappiness over the whole conduct
of the bank sales. It originally wanted to break up Bank Hapoalim and Bank
Leumi, which encompass a broad range of financial services from retail
banking to fund management and insurance. Now it is pressing the government
to form a committee, with Bank of Israel participation, to review the
process.
It is not convinced that the MI Holdings strategy of selling a controlling
stake by private tender, followed by a share flotation, is the best way to
proceed.
In the case of Israel Discount Bank, for example, this is likely to lead to
the bank reverting to the control of the Recanatis as they already hold 13
per cent of the bank through IDB Holding. Two of the Recanatis are on trial
on criminal charges connected to the 1983 share scandal.
Even Mr Leidner of MI Holdings admits the method of tendering a controlling
shareholding as the first step will not work for Bank Hapoalim and Bank
Leumi, respectively controlled by the Histadrut trade unions and the Jewish
Colonial Trust, because of their size.
Their combined assets of more than Shk150bn (Dollars 55.6bn) are more than
twice the combined assets of Israeli Discount Bank and Mizrahi. Given creaky
performance in recent years and lingering bad debt problems, the Bank of
Israel reckons finding a group of investors able and willing to buy even a
10 per cent share would prove difficult.
Mr Leidner is planning a test flotation on the Tase of a 10 per cent share
in both Bank Hapoalim and Bank Leumi within three months.
But it is becoming clear is that it is highly unlikely the process will be
completed by the deadline of next October. This leaves the government with
an additional headache of how to avoid the full nationalisation of the banks
just when it is trying to privatise them.

amid bid backlash

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHIEF executive of Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), one of Belgium's big
three banks, resigned yesterday following the failure of Internationale
Nederlanden Groep (ING), the Dutch financial services group, to bid for BBL.
Mr Theo Peeters, together with most of the BBL management, was a strong
supporter of the ING proposals, but the Dutch group abandoned its plans last
month after disagreeing with the Belgian bank over the price to be offered.
ING, which had conducted a full audit of BBL's books, wanted to pursue a
co-ordinated 'bancassurance' policy with the bank.
'Let's just say that Mr Peeters personified a certain policy,' said a bank
spokesman yesterday. 'As this policy seems to have failed, he preferred to
withdraw.'
The group's chairman, Mr Jacques Thierry - another supporter of the ING
link-up - confirmed that he would step down in April, having reached the
statutory retirement age.
The announcements are an indication that Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, the
Belgian holding company and largest shareholder in BBL, is reasserting its
hold over the bank.
GBL, which is headed by Mr Albert Frere, had lobbied hard against an ING
bid, suggesting that it could come up with an alternative solution. One
possibility which Mr Frere was thought to favour was a link-up with Credit
Communal, the banking network owned by Belgian municipalities.
But BBL said yesterday that there were no further negotiations in progress,
and stressed that the reshuffled board of directors would concentrate during
1993 on improving the bank's profitability.
The announcement is unlikely to end speculation about the bank's future as
ING continues to hold a 10 per cent stake in BBL. A BBL statement welcomed
the promise by GBL and other shareholders to 'guarantee the stability of the
shareholder structure'.
'Numerous studies of the bank made recently by external consultants have not
revealed any new problems and have highlighted the existence of several
areas of excellence,' the statement added.
The group is to re-examine its foreign operations, although BBL said it
would not be withdrawing altogether from overseas activities.
Mr Peeters has been replaced as chief executive by Mr Daniel Cardon de
Lichtbuer, a board member, while Mr Thierry will be succeeded by Mr Jacques
Moulaert, who is also a managing director of GBL.

status
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S much-mocked securities analysts have pleaded to be taken as
seriously as their counterparts in Europe and the US, and asked that
employers no longer force them to change unwelcome 'sell' recommendations.
The plea from the Conference for Securities Associations follows a survey of
2,024 Japanese analysts at brokerages and other financial institutions, 79.8
per cent of whom felt that they have a lower status in society than European
and US analysts have in their home countries. 'We want to establish an
environment in which analysts are more highly respected,' the securities
body said, suggesting the speculative excess of the 1980s has caused
investors to doubt brokers' integrity.
Japanese analysts' reputations have suffered because of the reluctance to
issue a 'sell' recommendation. Analysts are also under pressure not to
deviate from a company's forecast profits, the securities body said, as
'they would be criticised by officials in the underwriting department'.
The survey, conducted by the Security Analysts' Association of Japan,
discovered analysts are often torn between pride in their profession and
loyalty to their company. About 63 per cent of surveyed analysts
'compromise' with their employer in preparing a recommendation.
A mere 14 per cent said they had 'no friction' within their institution in
preparing reports, while only 21.3 per cent said they had 'no friction' with
outside companies, presumably those about which reports are being prepared.
Mr Yoshikatsu Sato, director of the Security Analysts' Association, said the
credibility of the profession was harmed by the common Japanese corporate
practice of staff rotation. 'We would like analysts to be to be regarded as
professionals, and it does not help if they are transferred after a short
period,' he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VIAG, the energy-based German conglomerate, expects little improvement in
profit and sales growth until the end of next year.
Net profits fell in the first nine months of the current financial year by 9
per cent to DM292m (Dollars 185m), while turnover eased marginally to
DM17.75bn, compared with the same period in 1991.
Mr Alfred Pfeiffer, Viag's chairman, said the results were affected by the
slowdown in growth in the domestic market, as well as currency fluctuations
on the international markets.
Two sectors of the group appear particularly vulnerable, with turnover
rising less than 1 per cent for aluminium, and falling by 7 per cent for
fire prevention equipment.
At the same time, surplus stocks, increasingly common across German
industry, are also hitting Viag's packaging arm and primary aluminium
sectors. Gerresheimer Glas, under which Viag's glass manufacturing sector is
grouped, also showed a sharp fall in turnover from DM142m to DM67m. However,
the group's interim results have been partly cushioned by the chemical
sector, where turnover rose by 7 per cent.
Total spending on new investments also fell from DM2.03bn to DM509m,
although this was expected following a rapid expansion of Viag throughout
1991.
Sales at Preussag, the German industrial group, fell 3.9 per cent to
DM24.5bn (Dollars 15.5bn) for the fiscal year which ended on September 30,
however net profits were slightly above last year's DM425m .
Mr Ernst Pieper, the group's chairman, said last year's dividend of DM10 per
share would be unchanged. He added that order inflows continued to be stable
at DM28.1bn, and the order backlog had risen by 5.3 per cent to DM11.8bn.
However, Preussag Stahl, the group's steel subsidiary, yesterday announced
that it was planning to introduce a shorter working week, which will last
for three months, starting in January. Preussag Stahl profits fell 51 per
cent, from DM91m in 1991 to DM45m this year.

THE RECESSION continued to dampen Seagram's wine and spirits business in the
third quarter, while the Tropicana fruit juice unit performed strongly and
benefited from lower overheads.
Third-quarter net profit was USDollars 178m, or 47 cents a share, down 9 per
cent from Dollars 193m, or 51 cents a share, a year earlier.
Mr Edgar Bronfman Jr, president, said in a statement that the Canadian
group's flat performance in the third quarter was due mainly to the
recession's impact on several key global markets, but also to higher
advertising outlays to support its most important brands. Seagram spends
around Dollars 500m a year on advertising worldwide.
He said: 'But we expect our overall operating income for the full year
ending January 31 will exceed the Dollars 760m reported for fiscal 1992.'
Sales from the worldwide drinks business dipped 3.7 per cent to Dollars
1.45bn following the sale of several spirits brands in the US in the final
quarter of fiscal 1991.
In the third quarter, sales from continuing operations were steady.
Operating income was Dollars 198m, against Dollars 206m.
Results included Dollars 73m in dividends from Du Pont of the US, against
Dollars 69m, and Dollars 41m equity in unremitted Du Pont earnings, against
Dollars 51m.
Net income for the nine months to October 31 was Dollars 497m, or Dollars
1.32 a share, down 6.5 per cent from Dollars 530m, or Dollars 1.40 a share,
a year earlier. Sales were Dollars 4.9bn against Dollars 4.28bn. Results
included Du Pont dividends of Dollars 214m, compared with Dollars 207m, and
unremitted earnings of Dollars 121m, against Dollars 185m.
Seagram is one of the world's top four drinks groups, selling in 150
countries and with subsidiaries and affiliates in 34 countries. Its main
expansion thrust is in Asia and Europe because of the long decline in the
North American spirits market.

His resignation follows revelations that the bank made loans of SFr220m

boards of five other Rothschild companies in Switzerland.
No reason for the resignation was given.
Mr Hartmann has been involved with other troubled banks. He was a director

<TEXT>
HENKEL, the German chemicals, cosmetics and personal products group, expects
profits to fall this year, but will maintain its dividend.
Forecasting a moderate fall in pre-tax and net earnings, Mr Hans-Dietrich
Winkhaus, chairman, said sales after nine months had risen 11 per cent to
about DM11bn (Dollars 7bn), due mainly to the effects of acquisitions, and
profits were still level with 1991 rates.
However, sales growth had slowed in the final quarter and the company
expected turnover for the year to grow only 8 per cent to around DM14bn.
Germany's leading chemicals groups have been hit by a recent sharp fall in
both volume sales and prices. The effects have been compounded by the
appreciation of the D-Mark.
Henkel is likely to suffer less than others, however, because of its wide
interests in consumer products such as detergents and toothpaste which are
less susceptible to cyclical swings.
Even so, the company plans to reduce its workforce, increased by
acquisitions, by 2,000 over the next two years. Investment next year will
total DM730m, down from this year's DM800m.
Henkel's dividends last year were DM10 for preference stock and DM7 for
preference shares.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNION BANK of Finland, the country's second-largest bank, yesterday said it
would take a FM1.7bn (Dollars 328m) injection from the Finnish government to
strengthen its capital base.
The move makes it the last of the leading Finnish banks to take advantage of
a FM8bn preference capital fund which the government set up earlier this
year to help support the country's ailing financial system. The state has
also established a FM20bn guarantee fund.
UBF said it decided to take the injection because of the continuing
difficulties being faced by the Finnish banking sector, which has been
battered by heavy credit losses and the deterioration in the country's
economy. It also noted that the option to apply to the fund expired at the
year-end.
The bank said the provision would strengthen its capital ratio by about 1
per cent from 9.5 per cent and would increase its lending capacity by about
FM20bn.
The injection takes the form of a preferred capital certificate and carries
a coupon of 0.5 per cent a year over one-year Finnish government Treasury
bills until the end of 1997.
If heavy losses prevent UBF from repaying the amount, conversion rights will
allow the state to take a holding of up to 30.4 per cent in the group.
Unitas, UBF's holding company, disclosed a FM1.5bn loss for the first eight
months of 1992, and predicted a FM3bn loss for the whole year.
Like other Finnish banks, it has been rationalising heavily. Staff numbers
will have been cut to 8,500 by the year-end, 2,000 less than in 1987.
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, UBF's main commercial competitor, said in August
that it would also take a FM1.7bn injection from the government.

UNION des Assurances de Paris (UAP), France's largest insurance group,
yesterday provided the latest sign of the severity of the collapse of the
Parisian property market when it announced a FFr1.4bn (Dollars 259m)
recapitalisation for its banking unit, Banque Worms.
UAP warned at the end of October that it would have to pump more than FFr1bn
into the lossmaking Banque Worms, but yesterday's package was bigger than
most analysts had expected. Some of the recapitalisation, to take place by
the end of the year, is to cover losses on the bank's large Parisian
property portfolio, for which it has had to make heavy provisions and will
make more to come.
The bank lost FFr179m net last year after a FFr310m provision against
property risks, rising to a FFr350m net loss in the first half of this year
after FFr150m of property provisions. Mr Didier Pfeiffer, UAP's managing
director, warned that property provisions in the current half could rise,
though analysts expect overall provisions in 1992 to be lower than last
year.
The fresh capital would bring the bank out of difficulty, said Mr Pfeiffer.
Part of the cash would be used to set up three property and financial
intermediation companies, jointly owned by Banque Worms and UAP, to
encourage 'better synergy' between the insurance group and the bank, he
said.
The French cabinet yesterday named Mr Philippe Lagayette, 49, deputy
governor of the Bank of France, as the new chairman of the Caisse des
Depots, the state-controlled financial institution.
The post is one of the most important in French finance because the Caisse
is France's largest institutional investor. It manages the state savings
system, has influential holdings in many top industrial companies and has as
a result been an important player in several of France's most important
takeovers. Mr Lagayette replaces Mr Robert Lion, who resigned last month on
the grounds that he had always planned to leave after 10 years in the job.

Freighters in the six months to September 30.
Announcing the 19.5 per cent fall from a previous Dollars 1.24m the tanker

Scoresby, a fellow company in the Kulukundis family stable.
In the six months under review net freights and hire income was little
changed at Dollars 5.8m (Dollars 5.77m) and vessels' operating costs rose to
Dollars 2.8m (Dollars 2.44m). Provision for deferred repairs took Dollars
365,000 (Dollars 279,000).
Earnings per share translated to 4.3p (5.89p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TV-am, which has lost its breakfast-time licence, is to start repaying
assets to shareholders through a substantial dividend.
On December 29 it will pay a second interim of 40p per share, at a cost of
Pounds 26.7m, excluding associated ACT of Pounds 8.9m, from distributable
reserves.
Results for 1992 should be announced in February and the directors intend to
recommend a final dividend. No ultimate decision will be taken on the future
of TV-am, in its much reduced form, until then, and possibly not for some
time thereafter.
Assuming no further investment opportunities have arisen, the directors
expect to recommend a liquidation or distribution of the assets.
The Stock Exchange will suspend the USM quote unless the company identifies
a new core business to shareholders by the end of the year. However, the
company will seek cancellation of the listing on January 4 so that dealings
can take place under Rule 535(2).

FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: GEC edges ahead to Pounds 356m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC REPORTED a 'notably strong' performance in its three main divisions for
the six months to September 30, though market conditions were not always
favourable. Several other of its businesses were hit by recessionary
conditions, however.
The company said 'the devaluation of sterling and the recently announced
improvements in ECGD cover will help us in our drive to win vital overseas
orders'.
On sales of Pounds 4.26bn (Pounds 4.49bn), pre-tax profits were Pounds 356m
(Pounds 346m). After tax of Pounds 119m (Pounds 117m) and minorities
unchanged at Pounds 21m, attributable profits were Pounds 216m (Pounds
208m). Earnings were 8p (7.7p) and the interim dividend has been raised to
2.68p (2.55p).
Divisional pre-tax profits were: electronic systems Pounds 87m (Pounds 86m);
power systems Pounds 77m (Pounds 65m); telecommunications Pounds 61m (Pounds
60m); consumer goods Pounds 7m (Pounds 9m); electronic metrology Pounds 9m
(Pounds 17m); office equipment and printing Pounds 15m (same); medical
equipment Pounds 14m (Pounds 13m); electronic components Pounds 6m (Pounds
7m); industrial apparatus Pounds 8m (Pounds 12m); distribution and trading
Pounds 5m (Pounds 7m); less other activities losses Pounds 4m (Pounds 5m).
The order book rose to Pounds 11.9bn, an increase of 12 per cent since the
March year end. Orders within GEC Marconi, the defence subsidiary, were 7
per cent higher at Pounds 4.9bn.
Privately-funded research and development, including the company's share in
joint ventures, was 12 per cent lower at Pounds 184m. Capital expenditure
was 30 per cent lower at Pounds 67m.

FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Dairy Crest 39% up but warns on margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAIRY CREST, the milk and dairy products group which is to float in 1994,
announced a 38.7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 17.2m for the
half year to September 30.
The company, a subsidiary of the Milk Marketing Board, will be divested when
the MMB is replaced by a co-operative in 1994.
Mr Geoffrey John, chairman of Dairy Crest, said that the business was
constrained by its ownership. He said the group could not issue shares for
acquisitions, was strictly limited in its operations to liquid milk and milk
manufacture in England and Wales, and was still regarded as 'user of last
resort' for milk, putting it at a disadvantage to other buyers.
He said the company's strategy was to be in a position to compete with other
dairy groups by the flotation.
A rationalisation programme was aimed at making Dairy Crest a low cost
producer.
It had also made two strategic deals. It bought half of Unigate's liquid
milk activities in 1989, giving it a 17 per cent share of that market. Last
year it formed a joint venture with Yoplait of France on fresh products,
such as yoghurts and desserts, which is the fastest growing sector of the
dairy market but one where Dairy Crest had not been represented.
Mr John said that in the half year the volume of milk it was able to buy for
processing fell by 5 per cent as quotas on milk began to bite. However,
higher selling prices allowed turnover to rise 1.4 per cent to Pounds
574.8m.
In the second half significantly higher milk prices for milk used for
manufacture would put margins under pressure, he warned.
Mr John Houliston, chief executive, said cost cutting, including a reduction
of 1,000 in staff over the last year, helped push operating profit up 9.6
per cent to Pounds 28.5m. Operating profits per employee had risen by 21.6
per cent in the half year.
Associates, mainly the joint venture with Yoplait, contributed Pounds
500,000 (Pounds 100,000).
A fall in interest charges of Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 4.9m, of which about
Pounds 2.8m came from lower borrowings and the rest from lower interest
rates, more than offset a rise in exceptional costs from Pounds 5.4m to
Pounds 6.9m. Those costs related to the rationalisation programme and the
cost of moving doorstep delivery milk rounds to franchises.

FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Christian Salvesen rises 12%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIAN Salvesen, the distribution, specialist hire and manufacturing
group, yesterday announced slightly higher than expected profits and a 10
per cent dividend increase.
Pre-tax profits rose 12 per cent, from Pounds 36.1m to Pounds 40.4m, in the
six months to September 30, helped by strong growth from mobile power
generator hire and steady gains from UK distribution. All divisions
increased profits except for Salvesen Brick, the specialist brickmaker which
continued to suffer from lower prices.
Mr Chris Masters, chief executive, said the group's main markets were
affected by recession. 'Despite that, we're well ahead,' he said.
The distribution division, where customers include Marks &amp; Spencer and
Sainsbury, increased operating profits 8 per cent to Pounds 16.8m. New
contracts helped profits in the US and Benelux, although the lorry drivers'
strike reduced profits in France by Pounds 250,000. The loss-making
Langnese-Iglo contract in Germany, which was fully provided against in
previous years, was terminated on November 30.
Aggreko, which hires out power and temperature control equipment, escaped
the downturn in UK construction because of its wide customer base. Profits
increased 33 per cent to Pounds 15.4m. About Pounds 1m of profit came from
supplying equipment to the Barcelona Olympics.
Manufacturing, which includes food services, saw profits fall Pounds 500,000
to Pounds 10.3m after the brick division's profits fell Pounds 1m to Pounds
1.5m.
Turnover increased 3 per cent to Pounds 254.5m while operating profits
gained nearly 12 per cent to Pounds 43.6m. Interest costs were Pounds 3.2m
(Pounds 2.9m). Proceeds from the Pounds 28.5m sale of Salvesen (Oilfield
Technology), where Pounds 11.2m was booked as an extraordinary profit,
helped reduce net borrowings Pounds 20m to Pounds 60.7m. Gearing fell from
35 per cent to 23 per cent.
Earnings increased to 10.12p (9.01p). The interim dividend is lifted to 3.2p
(2.9p).
COMMENT
These figures earned well deserved applause and Salvesen's shares gained 15p
to 346p, an all time high. Distribution continued to provide the backbone
and although markets such as the UK look mature, there is further growth in
Europe. But Aggreko was the star performer, even discounting the one-off
gains in Barcelona. Its strengths are that it makes its own equipment and
owns its distribution network, allowing healthy margins and flexible
deliveries. The same advantages are now being applied to temperature control
equipment, recently introduced in Europe from the US, and initial results
are promising. Full year profits of Pounds 74m put the shares on more than
18. This does not look excessive. But after rising nearly 40 per cent in the
last year, the shares may need a breather once follow through buying from
the results dies down.

FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: National Express offer twice subscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFER for sale of shares in National Express, the biggest scheduled
coach service operator in the UK, was more than twice subscribed, it was
announced yesterday.
This means only applications for 250 shares will be met in full. Others will
be scaled down - in the case of the largest ones, to a third or less of the
number of shares requested.
The total number of shares sold in the flotation was 27.8m, of which 75 per
cent was placed at 165p per share with institutional investors and the
remainder offered for sale.
Valid applications were received for 14.7m shares, but with only 6.9m
available in the public offering, the result is a heavy scaling-down.
The allocation was as follows: for 250 shares - in full; for 500 shares - 75
per cent; between 600 and 1,000 - 65 per cent; between 1,500 and 5,000 - 50
per cent; 6,000 to 10,000 - 45 per cent; 15,000 to 100,000 - 40 per cent;
120,000 to 150,000 - 34 per cent; 180,000 to 500,000 - 33 per cent; for more
than 500,000 the allocation will be about 29 per cent.
Advisers to National Express will be hoping that large investors left short
of stock because of the rationing will top up in the after-market, so
leading to a premium when dealings begin on December 10.
Morgan Grenfell is sponsor to the issue, with Smith New Court as broker.

FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Pub sales bring in Pounds 440m for Bass
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASS, the UK's leading brewer, yesterday spelt out the full effects of the
enforced sale of 2,700 of its pubs to comply with government beer orders.
Total receipts from the sales in the year to September 30 were Pounds 440m -
an average price per outlet of Pounds 162,000 and 18 per cent above book
value.
'We secured better value for shareholders by selling rather than leasing
free of exclusive beer supplies,' said Mr Ian Prosser, chairman.
The group benefited from an early start to its disposal programme. The 1,500
outlets sold before the end of 1991 realised Pounds 256m, an average of
Pounds 169,000; the remaining 1,200 fetched Pounds 184m, an average of
Pounds 152,000.
This decline prompted a revaluation of all Bass properties, resulting in a
write-down of Pounds 496m. Of this, Pounds 480m has been taken to
revaluation reserve, and Pounds 16m charged to the profit and loss account.
The write-down compares with a Pounds 1bn surplus at the last revaluation in
1989.
Pub profits were 25 per cent lower at Pounds 174m (Pounds 231m) on turnover
of Pounds 1.1bn (Pounds 1.17bn).
Bass estimates that Pounds 40m of the profits decline was accounted for by
the reduction in the estate. The rest was due to lower consumer spending,
allied to a shift to drinking at home, and increased overheads and repair
costs.
All of the beer volume lost with the reduction of the tied estate, however,
was recouped by the brewing division's success in the more competitive free
houses trade and take-home market.
Free-trade volumes grew nearly 10 per cent, and loans to free outlets
increased from Pounds 398m to Pounds 485m. Supplies to the free trade now
represent two-thirds of total production. There was a 5 per cent increase in
volume sales to the take-home market; and a 6.5 per cent rise in exports.
Bass is left with an estate of about 4,600 pubs, nearly a third of them
under direct management. Spending on refurbishment and information systems
amounted to Pounds 110m last year, and a further 1,000 pubs will be
renovated this year.
An exceptional charge of Pounds 75m this time for rationalisation and
reorganisation costs within the brewing and pubs operations follows a
similar charge of Pounds 55m last year. 'We do not expect any further
provisions,' Mr Prosser said.
With the UK restructuring almost completed, he is beginning to think
tentatively about the possibilities of expanding the group's brewing
operations overseas.

FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Mountview shows marginal growth to Pounds
3.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOUNTVIEW Estates, the property dealing group, reported a modest 2 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.54m to Pounds 3.62m in the half
year to September 30, as higher rental income offset its exposure to the
depressed south-east property market.
Turnover improved to Pounds 7.31m (Pounds 6.89m). In spite of higher
earnings per share of 52.8p (51.7p), the Mountview board believed any
increase in the interim dividend would be 'injudicious in the uncertain
economic climate' and is holding the pay-out at 8p.
Mr Duncan Sinclair, chairman, said trading income was flat, but rental
revenue more than twice covered the company's administrative costs and
finance charges.
Mr Sinclair said the availability of repossessed homes was 'the most
depressing factor' on the market, and it would take time before lower
interest rates had an impact in improving market conditions.

FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: TT in Pounds 13m bid for AB Electronics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TT GROUP, the industrial holding company, yesterday ended five months of
friendly talks with AB Electronics by making a recommended Pounds 13m bid
for the Welsh-based group that has been mauled by falling contract assembly,
defence and automotive markets.
TT's offer of 10 new shares for 37 AB shares has the unusual feature of
valuing its target's shares at 49.2p, or nearly 7p below the market price
before the bid.
In July TT took a 6.3 per cent stake in AB, which pushed the share price up
to 90p, since when it has slipped back. It now controls an 8 per cent stake.
TT is offering a full cash alternative of 45.1p, underwritten by Samuel
Montagu. In conjunction, Samuel Montagu is raising Pounds 7.7m through a
placing of 4.59m shares at 167p, subject to clawback by existing
shareholders.
TT's gearing is likely to rise to 60 per cent as a result of the deal, which
comes hard on the tail of the acquisition of Magnetic Materials in July.
Mr John Newman, TT chief executive, said the offer price reflected AB's
trading outlook. He said the two companies had compatible businesses. TT is
likely to focus on the costing and range of AB's products and integrate
distribution and manufacturing facilities.
Sir Peter Phillips, AB's chairman, said in a statement that his company had
faced tough trading conditions coupled with rationalisation and
reorganisation costs. There was also evidence of a 'faltering in the recent
improving trend in order taking'.
Mr Newman is the third ex-Hanson employee to launch bids in the past few
months. He follows Mr Greg Hutchings at Tomkins, which is bidding for RHM,
and Mr Chris Miller at Wassall, who is bidding for Evode.
For 10 years after leaving Hanson's acquisitions department in 1977, he ran
private companies before reversing two of them into Tyzack Turner.
Since then, the renamed TT has developed a reputation as an acquisitive
industrial mini-conglomerate. But the purchase of Crystalate in 1990,
Magnetic Materials earlier this year and now AB, has effectively transformed
the group into an electronics product group for the time being.
AB's fall, from a market capitalisation of more than Pounds 120m in 1987 to
less than Pounds 16m yesterday, has been in line with the waning fortunes of
the electronics industry.
Based in the Rhondda Valley in Wales, AB has been a large contract assembler
of electronic systems and surface mount boards (SMT) for blue-chip customers
such as IBM, Olivetti-Acorn and Jaguar.
But AB has been hit hard in all three of its markets. Demand for board
assembly has fallen with demand for computers; its automotive division has
been hit by a fall in demand for sensors, particularly from the luxury end
of the market; and its components side has been hit by the slowdown in
defence spending.
Sir Peter Phillips has been invited to join the TT board, at least until
next year's AGM.
NM Rothschild has advised AB shareholders that the TT offer is fair.
TT's share price fell 4p to 182p yesterday.

FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Standard Chartered chief to quit -
Management changes will result in splitting of leadership roles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RODNEY GALPIN is standing down as chairman and chief executive of
Standard Chartered, the UK-based international banking group.
From the beginning of the year, the post of chief executive will be held by
Mr Malcolm Williamson, currently Standard's managing director.
Mr Galpin, who is 60, will hand over the chairmanship in May to Mr Patrick
Gillam, former managing director of British Petroleum. Mr Gillam is
currently Standard's deputy chairman.
Mr Galpin joined Standard in July 1988 and became chairman and chief
executive three months later. His appointment was encouraged by the Bank of
England, which feared that confidence in Standard was eroding as a result of
its poor financial performance.
Immediately before he joined the bank, Standard had narrowly escaped being
taken over by Lloyds. However, its shares were controlled by three Far
Eastern investors, the late Mr Robert Holmes a Court, Mr Tan Sri Khoo Puat
and Sir YK Pao, known as the White Squires.
Since then Mr Galpin, who had been an executive director of the bank with
responsibility for supervision, reorganised Standard's management and has
overseen a steady improvement in profits. He also reduced the influence of
the White Squires over Standard's affairs.
However, investors became concerned in the spring that Standard was still
prone to accidents, when the bank became embroiled in an Bombay stock
exchange scandal involving the forgery of securities. Standard has been
forced to make a Pounds 100m provision to cover the risk of losses from its
exposure to these securities.
Mr Galpin said yesterday that he had been thinking about retiring for two
months. The management changes at Standard were approved by the board on
Tuesday. He said he had recommended that Mr Gillam should succeed him.
He described the Indian losses as 'very annoying' but said he was confident
that the bank was now robust.
Standard also disclosed that two of its executives, Mr David Moir and Mr
David Brougham, were also joining the board.

FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Lower interest costs help lift London
Electricity to Pounds 17m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER INTEREST costs helped London Electricity to increase interim pre-tax
profits from Pounds 14.5m to Pounds 17.3m, in spite of lower operating
profits due partly to reduced distribution charges.
The interim dividend was increased by 12 per cent from 5p to 5.6p, but the
company was more cautious than others have been in recent days about growth
prospects.
Mr John Wilson, chairman, said the policy was to achieve consistent growth
in dividends 'taking into account the expected medium-term trend in
earnings.'
In the six months to September 30, operating profits of Pounds 14.5m (Pounds
14.8m) were achieved on turnover of Pounds 584.3m (Pounds 568.5m). Total
units of electricity distributed fell by 1 per cent. However, with weather
factors stripped out, the company said underlying trends were for 0.7 per
cent growth.
Commercial growth was 1.3 per cent (lower than in the last few years). The
reduction was attributed to the effect of the recession, particularly on
small commercial customers.
The introduction of lower distribution tariffs in April, contributed to the
decline in distribution profits from Pounds 58m to Pounds 54m. The supply
business reduced losses to Pounds 35m (Pounds 38m).
Mr Wilson said a decision would be made by the end of the year about the
retailing business, reduced from 60 outlets two years ago to about 20. Some
analysts expect closure.
Total retail sales had risen as a result of increased selling space, but the
business was adversely affected by market conditions. The programme to
separate retailing from customer services, both financially and physically,
would be completed by the year-end.
Electrical contracting had already been restructured, and with a reduced
workforce of 100 (400), was breaking even.
A reduction in debtor days - a measure for outstanding accounts - from 38 to
29 contributed to a marked fall in borrowings and a reduction of Pounds 2.5m
in net interest paid to Pounds 3.1m.
COMMENT
The cautious policy on dividends is perhaps typical of a company that
critics says is too plodding to merit its medium rating among regional
electricity companies. London tends to brag its merits less than other
regional electricity companies and it is less adventurous. Its involvement
both in retailing and independent gas-fired generation, where the risks and
rewards are greater than in the core businesses, is below average.
Supporters say the company is more likely than others to end up on the right
side of the regulator in forthcoming pricing negotiations, especially after
its improvement in customer service, particularly disconnections, and its
separation of retailing from servicing. The latter will eliminate
suspicions, to which other RECs are vulnerable, of cross subsidies. Assuming
a 12 per cent dividend rise to 18.8p, the shares are on a prospective yield
of 5.9 per cent.

debenture placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEMPLE BAR Investment Trust, a UK general trust managed by Guinness Flight,
is raising Pounds 25m via a placing of debenture stock.
The trust previously had a 6 per cent convertible unsecured loan stock 2002
which was redeemed, at the holders' option, in August. The directors
'consider that the recent fall in the level of interest rates in the UK now
offers a favourable climate in which to restore the long-term gearing in the
company's capital structure.'
The stock, which will mature in 2017, will have a gross redemption yield of
9.8 per cent, based on an issue price of 99.746 and a coupon of 9 7/8 per
cent. SG Warburg Securities is acting as agent for the company in relation
to the issue.

FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Provisions put Porter Pounds 5m in loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROVISIONS amounting to Pounds 7.05m forced Porter Chadburn, the packaging
and consumer products group, into pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.26m in the six
months to October 2.
The disposal of Gola, the sports equipment concern, was the main source of
the charges which caused the turnround from profits of Pounds 2.87m last
time. However, the interim dividend is maintained at 0.85p.
The consumer products side, which includes the Head sports equipment brand,
Adam Leisure, and fishing tackle distribution, was hit by a lack of consumer
confidence and problems with creditworthiness in some smaller customers.
Operating profits in the division's continuing businesses declined to Pounds
719,000 (Pounds 2.35m) on increased sales of Pounds 31m (Pounds 27.5m).
Mr Raymond Dinkin, chairman, said there would be no further fall-out from
the Gola disposal.
Gola was sold to William Lamb (Holdings) in September, though Porter retains
the Gola name for three years, in which time it is paid royalties. Lamb can
buy the brand for Pounds 1.35m cash within the term and Porter can require
that Lamb buy it for Pounds 800,000 at the end of the term.
Sales in the packaging division grew to Pounds 23.9m (Pounds 15.2m) and
operating profits to Pounds 2.29m (Pounds 1.42m). Lancer Labels, which was
acquired for Pounds 14.9m in March, contributed Pounds 4.8m to sales and
Pounds 600,000 to profits.
Mr Dinkin said that the subsidiary, making 'long-run' labels for the food
and drinks industry, lifted sales by 20 per cent and profits by more.
Profits from specialist distribution fell to Pounds 379,000 (Pounds 576,000)
on sales of Pounds 8.13m (Pounds 8.67m).
Group operating profits fell to Pounds 2.18m (Pounds 3.86m). But, said Mr
Dinkin, the figure would have been Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 4.3m) after adjusting
for Gola's losses prior to disposal.
Losses per share were 5.52p (earnings 2.95p).

FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Reduced interest income leaves Cape 9%
lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUCED interest income depressed profits at Cape, the building products and
industrial services company, by 9 per cent to Pounds 6.52m for the first
half.
At the operating level, Cape returned virtually flat profits of Pounds 6.39m
(Pounds 6.37m). However, a Pounds 665,000 drop in interest gains to Pounds
131,000 left the pre-tax line Pounds 650,000 lower on sales 31 per cent
ahead to Pounds 128m.
Mr Keith Jackson, finance director, said profits had been bolstered by
strong growth in the industrial division, which offset a decline in building
services.
Industrial operating profits were 36 per cent ahead to Pounds 4.1m, enhanced
by the inclusion for a full six months of the Cleton Insulation business in
the Netherlands. Since being purchased for Pounds 4.4m in July last year it
had 'performed extremely well,' Mr Jackson said.
However, growth in the industrial services activities - which supply
insulation and scaffolding to the power and petrochemical industries - was
beginning to flatten out.
On the building and architectural products side, operating profits fell 24
per cent to Pounds 3.2m on turnover just 5 per cent down at Pounds 35.5m. Mr
Jackson said there was no sign of an improvement in this division,
particularly in the UK.
Cape continued to reduce its dependence on the recession-hit UK, with
overseas sales amounting to some 44 per cent of group turnover, against 32
per cent last time.
Since the previous year, two industrial services companies had been
purchased for a total of about Pounds 2m - one in the UK and the other in
Germany. This, along with increased capital expenditure for the year of
Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 7.5m), was partly behind the decline in cash balances
from Pounds 8.8m to Pounds 6.9m.
Mr Jackson said at least one further bolt-on acquisition was planned before
the end of the financial year.
The dividend was maintained at 3p, on earnings per share down from 9.3p to
8.2p.

FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Erskine House down 29% as UK machine sales
suffer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Erskine House, the office equipment services company,
tumbled 29 per cent to Pounds 4.7m following a severe decline in UK machine
sales.
Mr Brian McGillivray, chairman, said the group was 'searching very hard' for
signs of a pick-up in UK trading, but there had been none so far. New
machine sales had fallen by 24 per cent in the UK in the first half, with
margins under severe pressure.
Germany was also proving more difficult than last year, he said, although
the US continued to show improvement.
As a result of this, and exceptionally difficult trading in October and
November, Mr McGillivray said about Pounds 1m in annualised costs had since
been taken out of the services division and administration. The sales force
had already been cut by 50 per cent over the past 18 months.
During the six months to September 30, overall sales fell from Pounds 89.1m
to Pounds 87.3m.
Turnover in the UK declined by 11.4 per cent to Pounds 24.9m, with operating
profits down by 60 per cent to Pounds 1.12m.
In Germany, the operating profit slide from Pounds 745,000 to Pounds 214,000
had been disappointing, but were an improvement on the second half.
The good news from the US, with dollar profits 9 per cent ahead, was
virtually wiped out by currency translations. In sterling terms, US
operating profits were flat at Pounds 5.1m (Pounds 5.02m). Mr McGillivray
said the US was 'getting better, but not yet booming'.
He expected the losses on exchange rates in the first half to be offset in
the latter period by the devaluation of sterling.
The dividend was maintained at 3p, reflecting 'a degree of confidence that
we are capable of improving', said Mr McGillivray.
Earnings fell from 6.3p to 2.5p per share, hit by a Pounds 500,000 write-off
in advance corporation tax. Mr McGillivray said that put taxation on UK
profits at about 60 per cent.

FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Water rises to Pounds 72m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE WATER yester-day announced a 12 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 64.1m to Pounds 71.8m for the six months to September
30.
Profits were boosted by Pounds 4.4m from the sale of 50 per cent of
Yorkshire's engineering business to Babcock International in May. Yorkshire
and Babcock now operate the division, renamed Babcock Water Engineering
Limited (BWEL), as a joint venture.
Turnover increased 9.1 per cent to Pounds 239.5m. In Yorkshire's regulated
water and sewerage business turnover increased 7.3 per cent, mainly due to
average price rises of 7.1 per cent.
Yorkshire Water Enterprises, which includes the company's unregulated
businesses, reported turnover of Pounds 11.2m, compared with Pounds 6.5m in
the previous period. Excluding profits from the sale of BWEL, enterprise
profits were close to Pounds 1m.
Mr Malcolm Batty, group finance director, said 'tight control' of costs, and
improved efficiency, helped restrict the increase in operating costs to
Pounds 166.4m, a 6.8 per cent increase. Pay awards of 4 per cent were
awarded. The operating margin improved 1.5 percentage points to 30.5 per
cent.
In the regulated business, capital expenditure increased 8.7 per cent to
Pounds 138m and is expected to total Pounds 300m for the full year, an
increase of Pounds 10m. Infrastructure renewals increased 36 per cent to
Pounds 26m.
A cash inflow of Pounds 10m reduced net borrowings to Pounds 130m (Pounds
140m). Mr Batty said debt was likely to rise to about Pounds 200m by the
year end as Yorkshire's investment programme continued.
Earnings increased 11.3 per cent to 34.4p (30.9p). The interim dividend is
raised 8.5 per cent to 7.05p (6.5p).
The shares gained 1p to 502p.
COMMENT
As with the rest of the water sector this reporting season, Yorkshire's
results contained few surprises. Although recession played a small part in
reducing measured water volumes, the effect on turnover in the core business
was more than compensated by new commercial property connections during the
period. On the enterprise side, Yorkshire's environmental business and its
moves to transfer non-essential operations outside the core do look
promising. But profits will remain small for some time, even though second
half profits should be lifted by perhaps Pounds 1m of property profits. Full
year forecasts of Pounds 135m put the shares on eight times. That is
slightly ahead of the sector, but looks about right given Yorkshire's solid
reputation.

FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Life side helps M&amp;G edge ahead to Pounds
39.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG showing by its life insurance subsidiary helped M&amp;G, the fund
management group, record a marginal increase in pre-tax profits in the year
to September 30.
Profits for the year were Pounds 39.41m (Pounds 39.24m). But the annual
figures masked a 7 per cent fall in second half profits year-on-year.
M&amp;G said that the first half figures had benefited from the launch of two
investment trusts, Recovery and Income. The launches were net revenue
earners, although they did cause a 78 per cent increase in marketing and
commissions expenditure.
In the second half, the company shed 67 staff, including its former
marketing director, Mr Tim Miller, resulting in total costs of Pounds
600,000. Offices were closed in Cardiff, Exeter and Southampton as part of a
restructuring programme.
Insurance income rose from Pounds 8.16m to Pounds 10.19m, outweighing a fall
in earnings from institutional fund management (down from Pounds 2.15m to
Pounds 1.93m), and retail fund management (down from Pounds 22.44m to Pounds
21.06m).
Sir David Money-Coutts, chairman, said that unit trust sales fell from
Pounds 468m to Pounds 295m, while redemptions rose from Pounds 345m to
Pounds 404m.
Funds under management were Pounds 8.59bn at the end of September, down from
Pounds 9.01bn at the end of the 1990-91 financial year. However, these
figures reflect some double-counting because of unit holdings by life and
pension funds. The 'clean' figure for the end of September was Pounds
7.47bn.
Earnings per share came to 36.37p (36.1p). The final dividend was increased
2.3 per cent to 11p (10.75p), making a total for the year of 20p (19p).
COMMENT
The results of fund management groups are always geared to the health of the
stock market, but this may be even more the case with M&amp;G this year. Its
stock-picking investment style has been out of favour in the recession; an
economic recovery should bring its portfolios back into fashion. If that
happens, and performance improves, then M&amp;G can reverse last year's pattern
of net redemptions. If the stock market slips back, and private investors
switch from cash to bonds, other groups have better reputations in the fixed
interest field than M&amp;G. The departure of Tim Miller may also have made some
wonder whether all is well within the management team. Assuming a rise in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 44m, the shares, down 4p to 560p yesterday, are on
a prospective p/e of 14. Given the doubts, that rating looks high enough.

FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Branson halts share sale for Virgin
Atlantic expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ORLANDO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD BRANSON has put on ice plans to sell a 10 to 25 per cent stake in
Virgin Atlantic Airways. He says the future of his carrier and other smaller
independent airlines is threatened by European Commission proposals on
allocation of take-off and landing slots at congested EC airports.
Virgin announced earlier this year that it was seeking to raise about Pounds
50m by selling a minority stake in its airline operations to investors to
help fund expansion of routes and new aircraft.
But Mr Branson said in Orlando yesterday that those plans were now in
jeopardy because Virgin could not secure additional slots at London's
Heathrow airport to operate new international services. He also said EC
transport ministers were expected to approve next week new regulations on
slots that were likely to make it even harder for smaller airlines to gain
access at congested European airports.
'Without additional slots at Heathrow, the airline's development will come
to a full stop,' Mr Branson warned. Potential investors in the airline were
also holding back until Virgin's slot problems were clarified.
Virgin wants to expand flights from London to San Francisco, Johannesburg,
Washington, Singapore and Australia as well as starting a shuttle service
between London and Paris, called Le Virgin Shuttle, to compete with British
Airways and other large flag carriers.
In Florida yesterday, Mr Branson launched a new holiday airline called
Virgin Vintage Air Tours, operating old DC3 Dakotas between Orlando and Key
West. The venture is also considering flying from Key West to Havana, Los
Angeles to Palm Springs, and between Miami and Orlando.
Mr Branson said Virgin was considering acquiring or leasing up to 18
wide-bodied aircraft over the next six years to expand and renew its fleet.
Virgin currently operate eight older Boeing 747-200 airliners.
Mr Branson said he was looking at the new Boeing 777 powered by Rolls Royce
Trent engines, as well as Airbus A340 long-range airliners.
Virgin's expansion was expected to double the airline's workforce from 3,000
to 6,000 over the next four years.
Although the new EC proposals were designed to give smaller carriers more
opportunities to compete at crowded airports like Heathrow, Mr Branson said
the latest plans risked consolidating the dominance of big flag carriers at
these airports.
Mr Branson has written this week to Mr John MacGregor, UK transport
secretary, asking him to block the proposals, due to be considered by EC
transport ministers next Thursday as part of the liberalisation of European
air transport.
Virgin says the EC plans would legalise the controversial system of
'grandfather rights' whereby an airline has automatic rights to slots it has
historically held at an airport.
The EC originally proposed to confiscate some slots from bigger airlines to
enable new entrants to operate at congested airports.
Instead, the EC is planning to tighten so-called 'use it or lose it' rules.
'Big airlines will simply keep operating slots, unprofitably if necessary,
to keep their slot banks intact and smaller competitors out,' Mr Branson
said.
In his letter to Mr MacGregor, the Virgin chairman said the EC proposals
were 'perhaps the most anti-competitive piece of legislation ever suggested
for an industry still rife with anti-competitive practices'. He warned the
policy would result 'in permanently higher fares'.
With an annual turnover of about Pounds 350m Virgin is expected to be about
break-even this year. 'We might show a small profit or possibly a small
loss,' Mr Branson said.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Bass's profits rise of 16.5% to Pounds 501m falls short of
expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASS, the brewing, hotels and leisure group, fell short of market
expectations yesterday in spite of a 16.5 per cent increase in full-year
pre-tax profits to Pounds 501m.
Shares fell 15p to close at 585p as Mr Ian Prosser, chairman, said he
expected no improvement in tough trading conditions before late summer next
year.
'There are signs that the American economy may be moving in the right
direction but . . . we have seen false signals in this respect in the past
two years,' he said. 'In the UK, we do not see any such signs.'
Market sentiment was further depressed by evidence of damage inflicted by
the UK recession and the government-enforced disposal of pubs.
A property revaluation has led to a write-down of Pounds 496m, 13 per cent
of total property value and about half of the surplus recorded in the 1989
revaluation.
The sale of 1,213 pubs during the year contributed to a 24.5 per cent
decline in pub operating profits but Bass recouped the lost beer volumes
with gains in the free pub trade and take-home market.
Earnings per share for the year to September 30 grew 8.3 per cent to 39.6p;
a final dividend of 13.65p raises the total payment to 18.9p, an increase of
6.2 per cent.
The accounts include exceptional charges of Pounds 75m for rationalisation
and reorganisation costs in the brewing and pub divisions; and an
extraordinary credit of Pounds 91m mainly from surpluses on pub disposals.
Group operating profit declined 1.5 per cent to Pounds 612.1m (from Pounds
622.7m) on turnover reduced from Pounds 4.38bn to Pounds 4.31bn.
Profit contribution from brewing operations rose 13.5 per cent to Pounds
210m on turnover of Pounds 1.59bn, 3.2 per cent ahead.
Volume sales to the free pub trade grew 9.8 per cent; sales to the take-home
trade rose 5.2 per cent.
Overall, volumes declined 1.7 per cent against a market fall of 2.9 per cent
and market share increased marginally.
Pub retailing profits were Pounds 57m lower at Pounds 174m after the
disposal programme, which accounted for about Pounds 40m of the reduction.
Capital expenditure on refurbishment and information systems totalled Pounds
110m.
Holiday Inn hotels achieved a 12.4 per cent increase in operating profits to
Pounds 116m.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Institutions turn against Sugar's bid for Amstrad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO large institutional investors said yesterday that they will vote against
Mr Alan Sugar's controversial 30p-a-share buy-back bid for the 65 per cent
of Amstrad he does not already own.
Prudential said it would vote its 5m Amstrad shares, equivalent to a 0.9 per
cent stake, against the bid as did Postel, the UK's largest pension fund,
which holds 10.92m Amstrad shares, equivalent to a 1.88 per cent stake.
Although the stakes are small, the institutions' decision to oppose the bid
is a setback for Mr Sugar, Amstrad's chairman.
Opponents of Mr Sugar's Pounds 113m plan to take the consumer electronics
group private again need to muster a total of 94.4m shares, or 16.25 per
cent of Amstrad's paid up capital, to block the deal.
Although many institutional fund managers have said they are unhappy with
the terms of the offer, Prudential and Postel are the first to announce they
will try to block the bid. Their lead could result in other institutional
shareholders, who are thought to control a significant chunk of Amstrad's
equity, taking the same stand.
Mr Andrew Threadgold, Postel's chief executive, said yesterday that the
pension fund would be opposing the 30p-a-share bid because 'we are opposed
to management buy-outs of public companies by insiders'.
Postel gave other reasons. These include 'not being confident about our own
valuation', because of the lack of financial information and forecasts from
Amstrad, and: 'We are not convinced Mr Sugar is being altruistic.'
Mr Threadgold added that Postel had considered the possibility that it will
be left as a minority shareholder and 'may even end up with less than 30p',
but felt this was the correct position to take. If Mr Sugar's bid fails Mr
Threadgold said Postel will push strongly for the introduction of
non-executive directors on to Amstrad's board.
The action of the two institutions yesterday is also likely to strengthen
opposition among Amstrad's 31,000 individual shareholders, many of whom have
already expressed concern about the bid. One, Mr Edward Northcote who owns
1,000 Amstrad shares, will mount a legal challenge to the planned buy-out in
the High Court this morning.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Debts cast a shadow over the Aga Khan: Haig Simonian
analyses reasons for a rescue plan at Ciga, the luxury hotels group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Aga Khan, struggling to cut debts at his luxury hotel group, is also
running into a string of problems elsewhere in his business empire.
These setbacks have cast a shadow over his reputation for shrewd business
judgment.
The immediate difficulties are focused at Ciga, one of the world's leading
prestige hotels groups with 36 hotels in six countries. It is facing the
toughest week in its history.
In a matter of days, it should sign an agreement with an unspecified Italian
investor to sell a 'substantial' slice of the subsidiary owning its
properties, once valued at L2,500bn (Pounds 1.2bn).
Details have not yet been revealed. But the company is confident the deal
will cut debts, now almost L1,000bn including rolled-over interest and a
convertible bond issue, to between L350bn and L400bn.
That will reduce borrowings to below the level of sales, expected to be
around L460bn this year and L500bn in 1993. The breathing space should give
Ciga time to consider further steps to reduce borrowing.
Even assuming the deal goes through, Ciga's latest tribulations have
severely damaged its image and devastated its share price, which yesterday
fell 10 per cent to L1,035 - a far cry from the 1991-92 high of L3,413.
There are similar, though less acute, problems elsewhere in the business
empire of the Aga Khan, who is spiritual leader of 12m to 15m Ismaili
Moslems. Losses at Fimpar, the quoted holding company controlled by the Aga
Khan and floated in 1987, rose to L65bn last year from L15.3bn in 1990.
Meridiana, the Sardinia-based airline which he owns, managed to make a
modest L1.3bn profit in 1991 after breaking even the previous year. Aborted
plans to set up a rival airline to Iberia in Spain will lead to a loss this
year.
None the less, the problems at Ciga are the key to the group's weaknesses.
They reflect the enormous efforts the Aga Khan's managers have put into
expanding the hotel chain. Since its foundation by the aristocratic Volpi
family in Venice in 1906, Ciga has been a byword for luxury accommodation in
Italy, with a string of five-star 'Palaces', 'Grands' and 'Excelsiors' in
cities such as Rome, Milan, Venice and Florence.
The company, floated in 1922, came under the Aga Khan's wing in 1985, when
he bought the non-quoted financial holding company created by fund manager
Mr Oratzio Bagnasco to invest in service sector companies. Ciga was its
first - and last - big investment.
Ciga's latest problems arise from a mixture of buying expensive new hotels,
spending lavishly to modernise many of the remainder, shortly before demand
for five-star accommodation started to soften.
For the Aga Khan's critics, the problems at Ciga are the legacy of botched
decisions based on over-confidence. For the company, the difficulties
reflect unusually bad luck which have upset a rational, if ambitious, growth
plan.
The troubles began in late 1989, when Sige, the Milan-based merchant back
owned by the IMI financial services group, pulled out of a deal to lead a
rights issue for Fimpar, tha Aga Khan's quoted holding company, on the
grounds of deteriorating market conditions. Fimpar's capital increase would
have been the first step to a rights issue by Ciga, which would have been
wholly subscribed by the parent company. The deal, which would probably have
raised around L200bn, was designed to help finance the hotels group's
continuing expansion.
Since being taken over by the Aga Khan, Ciga had pursued a three-fold
strategy of internationalising its largely domestic chain, focusing on the
luxury end of the market and diversifying into property.
Internationalisation involved buying top-name hotels such as the Palace in
Madrid and part of the Imperial in Vienna, as well as others in Paris and
Athens, to reduce its dependence on Italy.
Concentration took place by selling smaller properties in provincial Italian
cities. At the same time, a huge investment programme, costing L450bn
between 1986 and 1991, swung into place to raise the standards of the
group's famous, but sometimes shabby, properties.
Much of the money was spent in Milan. Benefiting from a special zoning
amendment linked to the 1990 soccer world cup, which allowed hoteliers to
expand their buildings, the company overhauled and extended three of its
four properties. Costing around L120bn for the two hotels Ciga owned, rather
than just managed, the multi-year project dug into cash flow by cutting room
availability while fixed costs remained virtually unchanged. In all, the
Milanese works cost L25bn-L30bn in lost revenues.
Other surprises pushed Ciga further off course. Diversification, the third
leg of its strategy, went sour after permission to develop a huge tract of
land in Sardinia was not granted.
The failure to win approval was a double embarrassment. It scuppered hopes
to inject money into the group by bringing outside investors into the
scheme. In terms of image, it embarrassed both Ciga and the Aga Khan, the
driving force behind the development since 1962 of Sardinia's rocky
north-east coast into the 'Costa Smeralda' - one of Europe's most
prestigious and expensive holiday playgrounds.
Then came the Gulf war, leading to a drop in travel. Though the market has
recovered from the days of early 1991, Ciga remains hit by the economic
recession, making businessmen think twice before spending Pounds 200 or more
a night for a room. Though now modernised and better value for money than in
the past, Ciga's hotels are among the most expensive in the world.
To cap it all, Ciga's debts, partly in foreign currencies, have been swollen
in lira terms by the September devaluation of the Italian currency. The
company estimates the lira value of its borrowings has grown by L50bn as a
result. In the circumstances, the plan to cut borrowings comes not a moment
too soon, for Ciga and for the reputation of the Aga Khan's business empire.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Granada plans to cut 800 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRANADA, the leisure, television and computer services group, plans to cut
800 more jobs in the next year including around 200 at Granada Television.
The cuts come as the group yesterday announced a 129 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 130m for the year to the end of September.
The job cuts at Granada Television are expected to be announced next week.
Yesterday Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive, said Granada Television had
been 'undermanaged' in the past.
A further 600 jobs are to go at Granada Rental. The new job losses come on
top of an 8 per cent, or 1,800, drop in the number of employees since last
year.
Granada reported higher than expected profits and its shares closed up 25p
on the day at 334p. In the first full year under the management of Mr
Robinson every Granada division improved its position.
Rental increased operating profit by 9 per cent to Pounds 98m. Television
had a 50 per cent increase to Pounds 33m although there was a one-off Pounds
6m saving in exchequer levy. Leisure, mainly motorway services, had a 16 per
cent increase in operating profit to Pounds 27m. Computer services - Granada
is now the largest independent computer maintenance company in Europe -
moved from a Pounds 12m loss to a Pounds 9m profit.
Mr Bruce Jones of stockbrokers Smith New Court said: 'What Gerry Robinson
said he would do he has done.' Smith New Court is upgrading its forecast for
next year from Pounds 140m to Pounds 162m.
Mr Alex Bernstein, chairman, said the performance of British Sky
Broadcasting, in which Granada has a significant stake, was 'the icing on
the cake'. BSkyB would make an operating profit of Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m
this year and would make its first pre-tax profit in the year beginning June
1993.
Granada's fully diluted earnings per share was 19p, a rise of 92 per cent,
and the net dividend rose 10 per cent to 7.7p.
On September 18, Mr Robinson bought 299,172 Granada shares at 247p each
shortly before the company's year-end and shortly before it went into its
close period.
Yesterday's close price represents Pounds 259,280 profit or a 35 per cent
gain since the shares were bought.

FT  03 DEC 92 / GEC caution on dividend disappoints City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE General Electric Company disappointed City optimists with a cautious 5
per cent rise in its interim dividend yesterday, in spite of a near doubling
of its cash mountain to more than Pounds 1bn.
The company also announced that Sir David Scholey, chairman of Warburg, is
to join the board. Sir David had been widely tipped as the next governor of
the Bank of England. This would appear to be ruled out by the GEC
appointment, as the governor is not allowed to hold outside posts.
GEC hailed sterling's recent devaluation as of major importance to its
export business. It also said the translation of its overseas earnings at
sterling's lower rate would be worth Pounds 40m pre-tax over a 12-month
period.
The company, which has not always been a supporter of government policy,
also welcomed the reduction in interest rates and government plans for
private financing of public projects. These should provide impetus for
growth and create new opportunities, it said.
GEC's pre-tax profits rose 3 per cent to Pounds 356m, on sales 5 per cent
lower. Earnings per share were up 4 per cent. In divisional terms, the
strongest performance came in power systems, where profits were 18 per cent
ahead.
Net cash within GEC itself rose to Pounds 1.07bn from Pounds 602m, while its
share of cash held in joint ventures rose from Pounds 425m to Pounds 733m.
This was partly because recessionary conditions and lower sales had allowed
it to reduce working capital. However, the timing of tax and dividend
payments meant there might be a small outflow of cash in the second half.
GEC's UK business in power generating equipment would not be affected by the
debate over UK energy policy, as the company supplies equipment for power
stations of all types including nuclear. Demand for its products was
affected only by overall demand for electricity, it said.
The company said it felt more confident than in recent months about the
future of the European Fighter Aircraft, to which it is a leading supplier.
It also confirmed that it was interested in principle in combining parts of
the defence business of British Aerospace with its own, though there was no
suggestion that talks were taking place.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Shipyard closure costs 900 jobs: Cammell Laird decision
prompts call for audit of VSEL books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPPOSITION calls for a government audit of the books of VSEL, the privatised
nuclear submarine builder, greeted the company's decision yesterday to close
the Cammell Laird shipyard on Merseyside with the loss of 900 jobs.
Cammell Laird, which mainly builds diesel-electric submarines, will run out
of work next June.
VSEL, which bought the Birkenhead yard for Pounds 1 in 1986, has been trying
to sell it for two years, since the end of the cold war curtailed Britain's
submarine building programme.
Under the terms of the 1986 deal, VSEL - itself a management buyout from
Vickers, then part of British Shipbuilding - was supposed to pay the
government Pounds 40m for Cammell Laird if VSEL made Pounds 100m of profits
over a five-year period. VSEL obtained a stock exchange listing by
introduction shortly after Cammell Laird's purchase.
Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, who usually speaks for the
cross-party group of Wirral MPs, said last night: 'VSEL management has kept
under the Pounds 100m figure, but only because they provided Pounds 50m for
the closure of Cammell Laird in 1991 and have reserved other money for
development costs as they try to diversify out of warships at
Barrow-in-Furness.
'The books have got to be looked at closely to see if these provisions are
proper. In the meantime, we want Cammell Laird back in public ownership,
plus a payment of Pounds 20m from VSEL to finance its development. The deeds
of ownership should be put into trust while we look for entrepreneurs who
can develop the yard.'
VSEL builds Trident-carrying nuclear submarines at Barrow, but this work
will also run out in the mid-1990s. The company, which employed 14,500 at
Barrow in 1990, will have fewer than 5,000 jobs in two years.
Mr Noel Davies, VSEL chief executive, said the company had 'done its
damnedest' to save or sell Cammell Laird.
The sale had failed because EC civil shipbuilding subsidies were not
available for a warship yard; the recession had deterred buyers; and
'prevarication' over development of a new gas field in Liverpool Bay had
prevented development of Cammell Laird in offshore markets. Another reason
was failure to secure aid from the EC's intervention fund, which helps
shipbuilding areas. Amec, the construction, offshore and civil engineering
group, would have made a serious offer for the yard had the Liverpool Bay
project - now held up by a planning inquiry over the siting of a north Wales
gas terminal - gone ahead.
'It seems many people in the Wirral are more concerned about a pretty
skyline as they look across to north Wales than they are for the jobs of the
lads at Cammell Laird,' Mr Davies said.
VSEL would try to get the yard redesignated by planners to allow mixed
redevelopment for housing, offices, leisure, retail and industrial use, he
added.
This was dismissed by Mr Field as 'potty'. The GMB engineering union said
the aim should be to keep Cammell Laird as a shipyard.

FT  03 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's gilts auction was an inauspicious affair, with demand little
better than at the last auction in August. More seriously, the sale
attracted barely a modicum of overseas interest despite the normally popular
10-year maturity. Admittedly foreigners have been net sellers of gilts since
sterling came out of the ERM, so there was little chance of a stampede. Some
may also be reluctant to commit funds so close to the year end. The Bank of
England will doubtless hope to drum up more enthusiasm if it decides to
auction more of the same stock in the spring.
Something will have to give, though, if overseas investors are to provide
more than grudging support for the funding programme. Gilts yielding 1.3
percentage points more than German bunds were attractive enough while
sterling was inside the ERM. They look far less enticing now that Mr Major's
government is free to pursue growth ahead of lower inflation. Sterling's
devaluation since then leaves more room for currency gains, especially if
the dollar resumes its upward march against the D-Mark. On yesterday's
auction evidence, however, overseas investors are not convinced that
sterling has hit bottom.
Little wonder gilts do not have much credibility as a safe haven from
turbulence within the ERM. Thus the yield differential between gilts and
French bonds widened this week as the latter rallied in expectation that any
devaluation of the franc would be coupled with lower interest rates.
International investors prefer to take their chances with the Bundesbank
rather than place trust in Mr Major.

FT  03 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Bass
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bass may rightly pride itself on its decision to tackle the government
requirement to reduce its tied estate early and decisively. By selling pubs
before prices were too depressed, it realised healthy profits for its
shareholders. With a smaller estate, though, it has paid a heavy price in
the form of a 25 per cent slide in pub retailing profits for 1991-92. The
hangover, though less acute, will also continue in the current year.
True, there were other factors behind the retailing decline; internal
pricing arrangements mean the brewing side may have gained at the ex-pense
of its retailing division. The company is also stepping up its spending on
pub refurbishment, which had been neglected while the estate was being
shrunk. That should bring returns eventually, though it will be 1994 before
the normal maintenance cycle is back on track. The underlying message from
yesterday's results is that recovery, both from the recession and the beer
orders upheaval, will be slow in coming through.
Yesterday's 3 per cent share price drop looks a reasonable response,
especially given the company's determined caution on current trading as the
Christmas season looms. But it would not do to get carried away. Holiday Inn
will be helped by higher franchise rates and currency gains even though room
rates have yet to respond to the tentative US recovery. Bass also looks
particularly strong in brewing. With costs under control it is well-placed
to push for higher market share.

FT  03 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Granada
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Granada's problems have not proved as great as feared, its recovery has
also been swifter than expected. Since his arrival as chief executive just
over a year ago, Mr Gerry Robinson, dismissed as a mere caterer by
television professionals, has helped lift Granada's shares by more than 80
per cent, adding some Pounds 600m to its market value in the process.
Shedding 8 per cent of the company's workforce (with yet more to come) and
ruthlessly squeezing cash has worked financial wonders. So have ingenious
schemes to tickle growth from mature rental and television businesses - as
yesterday's 129 per cent profits improvement on near static sales amply
illustrates. A Pounds 21m turnround at the troubled computer services
business also helped.
But Granada is still struggling back to first base. Profits remain Pounds
34m adrift of what they were three years ago and with the benefits of the
bounce fading, the question looms of what rate of growth Granada can now
sustain. The market was impressed by the revitalised potential of the
computer business and Granada's ability to milk cash from motorway service
sites and TV rental shops, even in recession. Further out, Granada's BSkyB
stake adds extra spice and some acquisitive growth can be expected to kick
in. But moving from cutting to growing mode can prove difficult. A forward
rating of 15 allows for little pause for consolidation.

FT  03 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: GEC cashes in
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC's long-standing reputation as a dull performer has certainly not been
reflected in the share price over the past year. The company has made
strenuous efforts to offset the slowdown in business areas such as defence
with international joint ventures. Perhaps the most notable of these is the
collaboration with Alsthom, and power systems profits duly increased by 18
per cent in the first half. Still, the image of GEC as a hoarder may be
reinforced by the appointment of a senior merchant banker to the board and
the effective cash inflow of Pounds 405m in the past six months. The second
half will not see such a torrent, but next year the company is likely to
pull in at least another Pounds 200m in cash.
What happens to the money seems to fascinate observers rather more than it
does GEC. Investors may fret that while a cast-iron balance sheet can be a
support in troubled times, once recovery is on the way cash becomes a drag.
GEC has hinted that the relaxation of the government's rules about private
sector participation in infrastructure projects may offer opportunities.
Perhaps the company might provide lease finance to British Rail so that it
can afford to buy GEC-manufactured trains. But given sloth in Whitehall and
Lord Weinstock's well-known caution, it is hard to see this blossoming
quickly.
Supporters may argue that the company will benefit from devaluation, but GEC
will need to invest into the recovery if it is not to repeat its
underperformance of the 1980s. If opportunities are not available,
shareholders might prefer to keep some of the cash in their own deposit
accounts.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Bank customer complaints show marked increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER SHARP RISE in the number of complaints against banks by personal
customers was reported yesterday by Mr Laurence Shurman, the banking
ombudsman.
Complaints in the year to September rose by 60 per cent to 10,109.
Mr Shurman said the increase - the fifth consecutive yearly rise from the
1,682 made in the first year of the ombudsman scheme - reflected customer
difficulties in the recession and greater consumer consciousness.
The number of complaints accepted by Mr Shurman for full investigation under
his terms of reference rose 28 per cent to 956. Of the 772 investigations he
completed, some 36 per cent resulted in bank compensation.
The ombudsman scheme - in which 36 banks, including all high street clearing
banks, take part - is limited to personal customers. The ombudsman deals
only with claims of up to Pounds 100,000, and most awards were between
Pounds 100 and Pounds 10,000.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, should order a public inquiry into banks to examine 'excessive'
service charges and interest rates and the 'inadequate information'
available to customers.
The Consumers' Association said the rise in complaints was 'almost certainly
the tip of the iceberg'. Mr John Beishon, association director, said
consumers were 'fed up to the back teeth with the banks' incompetence'.
Mr Shurman said many customers had 'unreasonable expectations' of the
service they had a right to expect, but banks sometimes adopted an overly
legal approach to complaints instead of seeking fair solutions.
'Banks need to communicate better. One difficulty is the disappearance of
the old-style bank manager who everybody knows. Most customers do not know
their manager, or have never met him, and that can cause problems,' he said.
Of the new complaints received, the largest proportion (19.2 per cent)
concerned charges and interest payments, followed by those about lending
policy (14.2 per cent) and automatic teller machines (8.7 per cent).
Complaints about ATMs formed a far higher proportion (36.2 per cent) of the
complaints which fell within the ombudsman's remit and could not be settled
without a full investigation.
This was because customers felt they should not be liable for fraudulent
withdrawals from ATM. Under the code of banking practice introduced this
year, liability for a series of withdrawals is limited to Pounds 50.
'There has been a lot of talk about ghost withdrawals, but we have not found
any evidence. What we have found is a great deal of fraud, often by someone
known to the complainant - a friend, family member or workmate,' Mr Shurman
said.
He said the code of banking practice, adopted by the banks in March, had
improved relations with customers but might need to be amended. One area in
which this could be done was limiting cases in which the husband or wife of
a small business owner makes a personal guarantee for a sum of money only to
be held liable for a greater amount later.
Mr Shurman said the code might be amended to ensure that banks always
stipulated the maximum amount for which a spouse might be held liable. This
would prevent cases where, even following a divorce, a partner must
reimburse a bank.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Customs probe 'bent' banana trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY and DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Customs officers investigating an alleged Pounds 1.6m 'banana
laundering' fraud have 'detained' 53 tonnes of bananas shipped from the
Netherlands to Felixstowe. They have also removed documents from an
importing company in Hull.
Officers said the 'bent' bananas are believed to have been bought at low
Latin American prices, and that importers allegedly intended to relabel them
to be sold in Britain at prices which include European Community subsidies.
'We believe this is very similar to frauds which exploit the EC's Common
Agricultural Policy,' UK Customs and Excise said.
There have been mounting fears of 'banana running' into the UK as the
establishment of the single European market approaches on January 1.
This is because of a 15 per cent price difference between cheap 'dollar'
bananas from Latin America freely available in Germany, Belgium and Denmark,
and more expensive bananas which have protected access to markets including
France, the UK, Spain and Portugal.
The expensive bananas come from former French and British colonies or
overseas territories (mainly in the Caribbean), and from Madeira, the
Canaries and Cyprus.
Efforts to reform the EC banana import regime have been deadlocked for more
than a year. Germany is unwilling to pay more for bananas, while countries
such as France and the UK will not renege on Lome Convention commitments to
protect livelihoods in former colonies. This paralysis has left the door
open to 'banana running'.
Mr John Gummer, UK agriculture minister, warned yesterday that there could
be 'chaos' if EC member states did not know by January 1 how the regime was
going to be reformed. 'Although I agree we are going to have to put some
intermediate measures in place, it will be very much better if we can get
the broad shape of an agreement at the December meeting (of EC farm
ministers),' he said.
Investigation of the alleged Humberside fraud began a year ago. Customs said
there had been no arrests or charges and stressed the bananas had been
'detained' rather then 'seized'. The company being investigated had not been
'raided', although searches were carried out under warrant last Friday at
the Hull headquarters of the importer concerned, and at the home of the
company's managing director.
The bananas are understood to have come from Nicaragua, and to have been
hidden under 22 tonnes of bananas from the Caribbean island of Dominica, a
former British colony. The bananas concerned are understood to be ripening
in detention and may have to be destroyed.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Letter: Statistics not reliable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BOHDAN SKROBACH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The use of economic statistics from the former Soviet Union in the
article 'Managing divorce between Moscow and Kiev' (November 23) is not a
very reliable way to attempt to define future relationships of the new
states.
The Soviet Union was a command economy. None of the republics was a national
economy that controlled what it produced and where it was consumed.
Inter-republic trade was a result of central policy and not 'market'
conditions. When the Soviet Union became obsolete so did its economy. New
states, like Ukraine, will completely rebuild their economies. They
certainly will have little resemblance to their past.
It is therefore impossible (using Soviet data) to forecast how the economic
spheres of the states should or will develop, just as no one could have
foreseen the reconstructed postwar Japanese economy produce major links
beyond Asia.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Letter: Reform of EC farm subsidy system would lift
economies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PATRICK O'BRIEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The best way to revive the European economy, reduce inflation and help
the poor would be to change the Common Agricultural Policy from a price
support system to one based upon deficiency payments related to the
difference between world market prices and intervention prices. This was the
British system of agricultural subsidy before joining the Common Market.
The present CAP costs the average family Pounds 12 a week in artificial
prices plus taxes to subsidise exports of surpluses. Abolishing the CAP, so
reducing food prices, would be equivalent to a benefit of Pounds 12 a week
helping the poor and families most because they spend a greater proportion
of their income on food.
Farm support would be paid directly to farmers but limited to the level of
deliveries made by each farmer in previous years under the CAP so that any
extra production could only be sold at world price. Thus, farm outputs would
be related to the market price not the intervention price. There would be
savings in the cost of bureaucracy besides eliminating the storage and sale
of surpluses. The objections of other agricultural countries to European
farm subsidies would be removed because export subsidies would be ended.
Some might think it not unreasonable that each country should pay the
subsidy claimed by its farmers instead of Britain subsidising foreign
farmers as at present.
Are our politicians capable of seizing this chance which has only occurred
because of the recession and disarray of the CAP?

FT  03 DEC 92 / Letter: Self-regulation requires clear differentiation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHARLES ABRAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Recent articles and letters in the FT clearly indicate that a bandwagon
to end self-regulation of the securities industry is gathering speed. As a
lawyer, I would not get involved in the political debate. However, I would
note that the question of whether self-regulation should continue is
different from the question of who finances the regulatory system.
Similarly, even the regulators in a self-regulatory system can be given
powers to investigate and prosecute insider dealing and securities fraud.
If it is indeed proposed to have self-regulation for some sectors and
statutory regulation for others - as suggested by Mr Yassukovich, a former
regulator (Letters, November 10), and Lord Alexander - it is in my view
important to insure that what are called private clients are kept on the
self-regulation side of the line along with the wholesale markets (albeit
with more detailed rules), rather than regarded as part of the retail
sector.
Private clients are the typical client base of stockbrokers, merchant banks
and the very important UK and overseas private banking sector. Those
institutions are not the same as the high-street investment advisers and
insurance company tied agents, and their regulators and conduct of business
rules should similarly be different. Private clients are in particular high
net worth individuals. However, retail market clients are also individuals.
It is very difficult to differentiate between them and, in my view, the
dividing line should be drawn on the basis of the product concerned.
The distinction should be between securities, derivatives and in-house funds
on the one hand and what are referred to as packaged products, namely life
policies, authorised unit trusts and Securities and Investments
Board-approved mutual funds, on the other. Packaged products already have
their own regime; for example, and importantly, it is only packaged products
which are subject to the polarisation rules which distinguish so firmly
between tied agents and independent advisers. This differentiation has the
added advantage that it is merely separating out what is already an existing
self-contained regime.
Changes to self-regulatory organisation (SRO) rules to help prevent
Maxwell-type abuses can be required by the government even under the present
system; the rule books have to be written on the basis of statutory
guidelines and SROs must include rules that the SIB insists on. Under the
present system of self-regulation within a statutory framework these changes
can be brought in quickly. If the rules are wrong, there is no need to
substitute statutory regulation merely to get them right.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Economic Viewpoint: EC - time for normal budget principles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The economic generalist cannot hope to rival the knowledge of the
enthusiastic specialist. But occasionally studies made by analysts of a
relatively unbiased outlook come to his rescue. Thanks to a Chatham House
study by Sir Michael Franklin and an Institute for Fiscal Studies one by
Stephen Smith*, I am emboldened to enter the area of the EC budget, which
has emerged as one of the most contentious issues for the Edinburgh summit,
and express some ideas which are 'European' without being communautaire in
the Brussels dirigiste sense.
The EC budget is likely to amount to well over Ecu60bn in 1992. If you take
off a fifth to convert it into sterling and add a fifth to convert it into
dollars, you have a rough idea of its order of magnitude. It is limited to a
ceiling of 'only' 1.22 per cent of the combined gross national product of
the Community - a proportion of GNP representing 4p on the basic rate of UK
income tax.
The Common Agricultural Policy still accounts for the lion's share of
Community expenditure, although it is down from 80 per cent in the 1970s to
58 per cent. But Sir Michael fears that it may not fall much further for the
remainder of the 1990s, as the reduction of price supports envisaged by the
MacSharry plan will for a time be more than offset by an increase in direct
grants to farmers.
The next largest item, accounting for nearly 30 per cent of the budget, goes
to the Structural Funds, a combination of the Regional and Social Funds, the
mere names of which cause Labour economic spokesmen to salivate with
pleasure. The Regional Fund was originally conceived as a way of channelling
money to the UK via its depressed areas. But the net gains turned out to be
small and the Commission argued for greater discretion on the use of
resources. Today Ireland is plastered with notices saying: 'This project is
financed from EC funds.'
The traditional revenue source for the EC budget, customs duties and levies
on imports, now accounts for only a fifth of EC income. Some two-thirds of
total revenues now come from cash payments from governments. Member
countries are taxed partly by a so-called VAT levy. This is a misleading
name for a tax based on the proceeds of an imaginary VAT with a yield of 1.4
per cent on an agreed standardised basis. The deficiency is made up by
direct contributions related to GNP.
The UK rebate is 66 per cent of the difference between its share of
attributed Community expenditure and an adjusted version of its VAT
contribution. Other members contribute to the rebate in proportion to their
share of Community GNP, with an alleviation of a third for Germany.
Unfortunately, a British proposal in the early 1980s to seek a budgetary
safety net of general application was rejected.
The sources of present tensions emerge from the table and chart. Luxembourg,
which has the largest GNP per head by a suspiciously high margin, is a net
beneficiary. The UK, with a slightly below-average GNP, is a net contributor
even after the rebate. Spain has the biggest legitimate grievance. Its GNP
per head is put at 75 per cent of the EC average. But its net receipts
amount to less than 1 per cent of GNP, much less than that of the other poor
countries and not much more than that of Denmark, which according to the
official statistics, is the second-richest member after Luxembourg.
All the main Efta applicants for EC membership, such as Sweden, Switzerland
and Austria, are prosperous countries which should make modest net
contributions. Czechoslovakia and Hungary could be financed from the net
receipts of Efta applicants; and even Poland would not break the bank.
The Commission disputes the whole principle of net balance. It is said to be
impossible to put a cash value on countries' non-budgetary gains from EC
membership. A more convincing argument relates to the 'Rotterdam effect'.
The Dutch contribution, for instance, is inflated by customs levied on goods
shipped through Rotterdam even if they are destined for other members. Even
more to the point: CAP purchases to maintain prices in any one country
benefit all EC farmers.
The original Delors proposal was to increase the structural funds by about a
half in net terms between 1992 and 1997 and increase the direct 'GNP'
contribution. This would provide the resources for yet another instrument
known as the Cohesion Fund for environmental or 'trans-European' projects in
the poorest states.
The pre-Edinburgh discussions look for a redistribution of expenditure and
sources of revenue to rectify anomalies. The UK wants to maintain the
present 1.22 per cent of GNP budget ceiling for another three years and then
go up to 1.25 per cent in 1998-99. The Commission and the southern countries
are prepared to stretch the timetable to 1999, but still want to increase
the EC budget to 1.37 per cent.
This is hardly the issue to turn John Major into a national hero. Would it
not be better, as Franklin suggests, to have an explicit budgetary key in
which a corrective factor would be applied to overrule unadjusted budgetary
transfers when they produced absurd results. Mervyn King, the present
economic director of the Bank of England, showed in an earlier incarnation
that a modestly progressive system of EC net payments would make Spain by
far the largest gainer, without the Spanish government having to build a
single unwanted bridge or dam to extract the cash from Brussels.
A corrective override would have enormous advantages. The Commission would
no longer have, in Sir Michael's words, to 'propose programmes, sometimes of
doubtful efficacy, as the sole means of achieving transfers to poorer
countries'. Indeed a smaller budget could lead to larger redistribution -
especially if the concept of negative payments were allowed. The UK and
Spain would be treated under the same formula.
What are the obstacles to such a single payments key? Above all it is the
desire of the Commission and its sympathisers in member governments to
increase the EC budget for its own sake as a communautaire gesture. This is
paralleled by the so-called reflation initiative, in which all the emphasis
is placed on spending increases, national and Community, when a better
effect might be obtained by a temporary tax cut, and where the gains from
international co-ordination would be clearer.
A late-hour switch of UK attention from the size of the EC budget to an
ability-to-pay formula would be regarded as an anti-EC gesture. But good
ideas need not die and this one should be kept alive when it is discovered
that neither Maastricht nor Edinburgh has solved the main problems of the
Community.

While the acquisitive TT Group's boss, John Newman, takes umbrage at being
called a copy-cat, that is the way things would seem.
One after another, the members of the Hanson old-boys' club are taking to
the acquisition trail. Greg Hutchings' Tomkins is buying RHM, a couple of
old Hanson hands at Wassall are bidding for Evode, and now TT Group is
buying AB Electronic.
Newman, aged 47, was the first of Lord Hanson's acquisition chiefs to go off
on his own, and his public company remains the smallest and most lowly rated
of the three. He keeps in touch with Hutchings, but plays down any rivalry.
Meanwhile Bob Cowell, who master-minded Hanson acquisition strategy in
between Newman and Hutchings, assures me his Makinson Cowell business has no
plans to join the fray. But isn't it time that Lord Hanson himself showed
his buying mettle?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The backlash following neo-Nazi violence against foreigners in Germany has
now brought down one of the heads of the country's aerospace industry - and
all because he flew the wrong flag in his garden.
He is Karl Dersch, abrasive president of the industry's federation BDLI as
well as on the board of the Deutsche Aerospace subsidiary of mighty
Daimler-Benz, and one of Bonn's great defenders of the European fighter.
Amid rebounding repugnance for all tokens of nationalism, his Daimler bosses
were appalled by press reports that the flag flying in front of his house
was the Reichskriegsflagge, a pre-1918 standard bearing an imperial eagle
and the iron cross.
Hence Deutsche Aerospace's blunt announcement that he'd be resigning
because, according to the company's chief, Jurgen Schrempp, that was the
only way to save Daimler-Benz's interests from further damage.
Although the Reichs-kriegsflagge is now the emblem of skinhead gangs
terrorising refugees and asylum seekers, the ousting might seem a bit hard
on Dersch. In pre-skinhead days the flag was regarded as the one acceptable
symbol of German national pride, representing the 'unspoiled' imperial navy.
Even so, it is not the first corporate flap he has created. He was a prime
mover behind the 'Peenemunde affair' in August, when the BDLI chose to
celebrate the 50th anniversary of the flight of the first V2 rocket. He
dismissed subsequent British protests as 'hysterical', but was overruled by
higher authority as being insensitive.
Few tears are being shed over him at Daimler-Benz headquarters . . .except
the embarrassed variety.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Merchant bankers are always terribly discreet, so it's impossible to know
whether Warburg's Sir David Scholey really has ruled himself out of the race
for the governorship of the Bank of England by accepting a directorship of
GEC. But that is what many may suppose.
Given that a decision on the bank job is expected before the year-end, it
would have been easy to delay his membership of the GEC board for a few more
months. Perhaps he's playing hard to get, but Ladbroke's Paul Austin for one
thinks that Scholey is no longer a contender. He stopped taking bets on the
governorship stakes yesterday.
Before the GEC announcement, Ladbroke had Scholey as four to five odds-on
favourite, followed by Sir David Walker, Eddie George and Rodney Galpin.
News of Galpin's early retirement from the Standard Chartered chairmanship
is unlikely to increase his chances of being first at the Threadneedle St
post, and Walker still looks the clear favourite over home-stable candidate
Eddie George.
Even so there could be some surprises in the final furlong. A couple of
longshots which might be worth backing are Sir Christopher Hogg, boss of
Courtaulds and Reuters, and Sir Jeremy Morse, who steps down from the
chairmanship of Lloyds Bank in February.
The problem is that, like Scholey perhaps, they might well not want the job
in its present form.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It sounded odd a month ago when Germany's official welcome of Bill Clinton's
victory called him 'William'. But perhaps the German government knew
something nobody else knew then.
With the announcement of plans for January's presidential inauguration,
humble Bill has suddenly become not only William but also Jefferson, which
happens to be his middle name and quite a convenient one for any US
president.
In sketching out the four-day inaugural celebrations, Democrat chairman Ron
Brown talked of the national 'rite of passage'. In reality what Washington
is going to experience is a right to party.
It includes 10 inaugural balls (which at Dollars 125 a ticket are cheaper
than Reagan's and Bush's bashes), eight big public events including a
special party for the homeless with the admission fee being food and
clothing, and a 'gathering' for diplomats at Georgetown University,
Clinton's alma mater and also home to the US school of foreign service.
The total bill will also undercut the Reagan and Bush inaugurals at around
Dollars 20m - 90 per cent funded, like Norman Lamont's legal bills, by
private contributors with the rest coming from sales of officially
sanctioned souvenirs.
For the socially conscious, William Jefferson Clinton will wear black tie to
the balls, but jeans to his Arkansas party.

FT  03 DEC 92 / U-turn on the road to ruin: How Renault has transformed
itself after lengthy decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Renault executives head for Lanzarote to launch the Twingo, their
pioneering new minicar, they travel safe in the knowledge that the
once-ailing French car maker appears well on the way to a recovery.
Two of the group's most recently launched products, the Clio small car and
the R19 small family car, are both riding high in the closely guarded,
confidential quality data compiled by European car makers.
At the recent Paris motor show Renault was the star turn, as it unveiled the
stylish Twingo, designed to give the French car maker a more dashing,
youthful image in the increasingly crowded European market place.
Renault's share of the European new car market is rising after nearly a
decade of decline, and it is finally making headway outside southern Europe
in markets such as the UK. In Germany it is ahead of PSA Peugeot Citroen and
Fiat as the leading importer.
Its cost-base is one of the lowest in Europe, although the currency chaos of
recent weeks has somewhat reduced the advantage; its productivity has jumped
by 50 per cent between 1985 and 1991; and most improbably it emerged in the
first half of 1992 as Europe's second-most-profitable volume car maker.
Five years ago Renault was dismissed as the sick man of the west European
car industry. The odds on it surviving to the end of the century were not
good.
Until 1987 it had been chronically loss-making for six years, with the
deficit growing to FFr12.6bn (Pounds 1.53bn) in 1984 or 10.6 per cent of
turnover. It was heavily unionised, run as a state agency, and was buckling
under a huge debt burden. Its net indebtedness reached FFr61.9bn, equivalent
to 55.6 per cent of turnover in 1985.
Its recovery from the 1984 loss to a record net profit of FFr9.3bn in 1989
was extraordinary in scale, but its rivals also made good financial
progress. The west European car industry enjoyed successive years of record
new car sales throughout the second half of the 1980s.
What is special about Renault, however, is its financial performance in the
past two years, after it stumbled heavily in 1990 when sales in many of its
European markets started to weaken.
As some of its rivals have faltered - Ford of Europe has plunged into loss
and profits at Fiat's car operations have collapsed - Renault has increased
its pre-tax profits in the first nine months of this year to FFr7.5bn from
FFr2.07bn in the same period a year ago.
Its share of the west European car market has grown to 10.5 per cent in the
first nine months of this year from 9.8 per cent a year ago. Registrations
of Renault cars and light commercial vehicles rose by 4.5 per cent to 1.28m
in a west European market where demand fell by 1.5 per cent.
This performance has been achieved despite both the losses of Renault
Vehicules Industriels, its truck and bus subsidiary, and the burden exerted
by Volvo, its Swedish partner, with which it entered a far-reaching alliance
in 1990.
Volvo is making losses in both its car and commercial vehicle operations,
which cost Renault's results FFr478m in the first nine months of this year.
With substantial cross-shareholdings, Renault now holds a stake of 25 per
cent in Volvo Car, 45 per cent in Volvo Truck and 8.2 per cent in the Volvo
parent company.
Since the alliance was formed perceptions of the partners' relative
strengths have changed. 'We are more much more credible to Volvo
shareholders now,' says Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault chairman and chief
executive and a former high-flying mandarin in the French Finance Ministry.
'We were seen as a state-owned monster that could not be run as a company,
and that could not be run profitably. That prejudice has largely
disappeared.'
Mr Schweitzer took over at Renault in May following the retirement of Mr
Raymond Levy, the former oil and steel industry executive who played the
central role in shaping Renault after the mid-1980s.
The hand-over to Mr Schweitzer, formerly chief of staff to Mr Laurent Fabius
when the latter was successively budget minister, industry and research
minister and finally prime minister, was conducted in an orderly way, in
contrast to the traumatic circumstances of Mr Levy's arrival at Renault. He
arrived soon after the assassination of Mr Georges Besse, then head of the
company, by terrorists in 1986.
Renault has come a long way since those dark days, but the tasks facing Mr
Schweitzer are no less onerous as he seeks to ensure the company's survival
beyond the end of a decade. Europe has become the battle-ground of the world
auto industry, and the European car market is being exposed to the full
force of Japanese competition.
His priorities are:
to hasten the passage of Renault into the private sector, and to complete
the merger with Volvo,
to consolidate the quality revolution wrought by Mr Levy,
to encourage the flow of new products epitomised by the Clio and Twingo
ranges, to fulfil Mr Levy's mission to 'Europeanise' Renault by easing its
dependence on southern Europe and reaching a share of at least 5 per cent in
all European markets and,
to ensure that Renault can compete by the end of the 1990s at world levels
of efficiency and productivity in both its manufacturing and its new product
design and development operations.
Renault has already been changed into a joint stock company from its earlier
status as a regie, a state agency. Volvo has a 20 per cent stake, but 80 per
cent is still in the hands of the French state.
Complicated political manoeuvres lie ahead, but Mr Schweitzer makes no
secret of the fact that he is eager for the alliance with Volvo to be
developed into a complete merger. At the same time the group has been
stepping up its efforts to prepare international financial markets for its
eventual emergence from state control, even though the final form of its
privatisation is not clear.
The negotiations surrounding Renault's future appear to have been put on
hold until after the French elections in March next year, but Mr Schweitzer
is keen to keep up the speed of collaboration with Volvo, whatever pace is
set by his shareholders.
'If you stop moving, it is bad; you must keep up the momentum. The advantage
of a merger is simplicity and speed. Agreement between two companies does
not go as fast as managing a single group. I have a strong priority to
strengthen the links as fast as I can.'
As long as Renault and Volvo have different shareholders, there will remain
the problem of how savings and profits - or losses - are to be apportioned
between the two. Mr Schweitzer says, however, that 'it is clear there is no
way back. A single command structure would help make things go faster.'
He admits that collaboration is proving difficult in the two group's truck
operations, where they compete more directly, than in cars where Renault and
Volvo are more complementary.
Approaches to quality are being harmonised and single directors have been
appointed to head the two companies' purchasing and quality operations. Most
significant, Renault and Volvo have also appointed a single project director
to develop a car platform for a joint top-of-the-range car to emerge at the
end of the decade. This would replace the quite distinct Volvo 850 and
Renault Safrane executive cars launched over the past year.
Overall a common product plan has been finalised for the next 10 to 12 years
based on the principle of maintaining two distinct product lines and
separate identities for both brand names, but with common platforms and
components wherever possible.
While the development of the Franco-Swedish alliance is one key to Renault's
future, its progress will depend on maintaining the pace of the quality and
product revolution evident in its new car ranges. The Twingo will be
launched in continental Europe early next year and is seen by Mr Schweitzer
as evidence of Renault's determination to 'offer a product range that is
youthful, strong and innovative'.
Designed like a mini Renault Espace - the vehicle that has pioneered the
market for 'people carriers' in Europe - the Twingo is evidence of the
growing impact on Renault of Mr Patrick Le Quement, the group's director of
industrial design.
Mr Le Quement, who enjoys probably more freedom and influence than any other
designer at a European car maker, is the man brought in by Mr Levy in 1987,
from a career with Ford and briefly Volkswagen, to build for Renault a clear
and distinctive market image.
While Renault is sharpening its styling, the improvement in quality still
owes as much to rectification work (the correction of mistakes made during
assembly) as to improvements in the manufacturing process, says Professor
Daniel Jones, a proponent of 'lean production' and co-author of The Machine
That Changed The World, the land-mark examination of efficiency levels in
the motor industry, published in 1990 by the Massachusetts Insititute of
Technology.
'What Renault has done in changing its culture is still impressive,' says
Prof Jones. 'They were determined to improve the quality of the product as
perceived by the customer.' According to Prof Jones, Renault has staged a
'product-led revival based on quality', but this is still at the cost of too
much rectification work. 'They are making significant progress in their
factories, but they are not there yet.'
Renault is currently on the crest of a wave, but it faces a severe test in
the next two years with the European new car market set to decline sharply
in 1993.
Mr Schweitzer insists that he will maintain the current 'quality priority
with an absolute determination, because in the Europe of tomorrow the
manufacturers, which do not offer products on the highest quality level will
be eliminated . . . Any relaxation of our efforts, any complacency, would
condemn us over the long-term to oblivion.'

FT  03 DEC 92 / Leading Article: BT's charges
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE encouraging signs that BT, the UK's privatised telecommunications
company, is now responding intelligently to the challenge of greater
competition. The package of price changes announced yesterday suggests that
BT is developing a more market-oriented strategy, designed to build its
business in an industrial sector which is due for expansion, rather than
simply to exploit its near-monopoly position.
The package is largely aimed at persuading customers to make greater use of
their telephones, used for just four minutes a day in the UK compared with
six minutes in the US. Call charges are to be frozen or cut, with a modest
increase in line rentals to reflect the actual incidence of BT's costs.
There will be more generous discounts for big users, domestic and business,
with special deals for larger business users.
More interesting, BT is beginning to explore the scope for increasing
revenues through much larger price cuts. The Sunday special experiment,
which offers trunk calls at local rates between 3pm and midnight on Sundays,
has doubled call volumes. A similar exercise will cut call charges to Europe
in January. There are indications that BT is considering price cuts in the
future greater than those required by Oftel, the regulator.
All of this is designed to fend off increasing competition from Mercury, the
cable companies and other operators. Next year, it will be possible to
access BT's competitors without a special telephone, and eventually users
will have portable numbers they can use on any network. BT can no longer
expect to dominate the market by its control of most of the local network,
and yesterday's package reflects the realisation that the company must win
business in a more competitive environment.
This new approach is a reaction to the success of regulation in opening the
industry up to competition, through interconnection of networks and open
access. And the requirement on BT to separate the accounts of its various
businesses will make it easier for competitors to bid for parts of the
market. The threat to BT's core business has led to long-overdue management
changes and an extensive cost-cutting exercise which is now bearing fruit.
It is, however, too soon to pension off the regulator. A further tightening
of the price cap may be necessary when it is next reviewed - BT's
profitability is holding up well in the recession. A regulator is also
needed to protect BT's competitors from predatory pricing. And the interests
of special groups of users must be protected. (Oftel persuaded BT to
introduce a special tariff for low-use customers such as the elderly.) BT
will retain its dominant position in the industry for the foreseeable future
and only active and tough regulation can ensure that this position is not
abused.

JFK. LIFE AND DEATH OF AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT
Volume One: Reckless Youth
By Nigel Hamilton
Century, Pounds 20. 898 pages
Jack Kennedy would never have become president without his father, Joe.
The bootlegger, stock market swindler and ambassador to the Court of St
James under Franklin Roosevelt was relentless in his pursuit of power,
whether in bed or the boardroom. But aside from a brief flirtation with the
idea of running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1940, Joe
Kennedy steered clear of a career in national politics, preferring instead
to fulfil his own ambitions through his nine children.
Kennedy senior once remarked of his daughter Eunice that if she had 'been
born with balls she would have been a hell of a politician'. In the event,
it was Jack who made the grade, an outcome which was by no means a foregone
conclusion, as Nigel Hamilton suggests in the first volume of this
affectionate biography.
For much of his early life, Jack Kennedy was racked by back pain and
Addison's disease; his academic achievements were nothing out of the
ordinary; and he laboured long in the shadow of the family favourite and
eldest son, Joe Jr, who later disappeared on a suicidal bombing mission en
route to northern France, long after his normal tour of duty was over.
Hamilton's thesis is that Kennedy's youth provides most of the clues for
understanding the future president. Behind the playboy facade, a serious
person was struggling to emerge, according to this biographer, who produces
interesting examples of Kennedy's early work as a journalist and student.
But the impression remains of a certain recklessness, a desire to live
dangerously.
Sex is a leitmotiv in JFK's life, as this biography sets out in detail,
thanks to dozens of private letters obtained from Lem Billings, a boyhood
friend of the future president.
Jack Kennedy loved dangerous liaisons. In war-time Washington, he found Inga
Arvad, whom the FBI falsely suspected as a Nazi spy. Twenty-five years
later, J Edgar Hoover was preoccupied with Kennedy's friendship with Judith
Campbell, paramour of Sam Giancana, the Mafia boss.
All rollicking stuff, but Hamilton's preoccupation with JFK's health (75
references) and sexual encounters and attitudes (31 references) leaves him
prone to psycho-babble. At one point, he compares Jack's tyrannous father to
Joseph Stalin, asking improbably: 'Moreover, was there not a complete
black-out of news of his father's true behaviour, from assaulting woman
guests to lobotomising his daughter? Kennedy and Stalin even shared the same
name.'
Hamilton's focus on character has merit, if only because he brings out the
mixture of diffidence, charm and wit which made Jack such an irresistible
political commodity. He also traces Kennedy's progress to political
maturity, where, thankfully, the young student and journalist ditched his
father's isolationism and craven appeasement of Hitler.
The weakness in this approach is that he tends to skirt over more important
lessons about Kennedy and his extraordinary family. By far the most telling
is the power of money and privilege in America. Thanks to his father's
wealth, Jack Kennedy attended the finest universities (Princeton, Harvard
and Stanford); he had tea with Princess Elizabeth; he visited France,
Germany, Poland, and Russia on the eve of the second world war; and he
attended the Potsdam conference in 1945, coming into contact in a matter of
weeks with virtually all the players on the international stage including
Truman, Eisenhower, Molotov, Harriman, Gromyko, Eden, Churchill, Attlee and
Bevin. Not even 30 years of age, Jack had a singular opportunity for a man
obviously being groomed for the highest office.
To some extent, Jack Kennedy made his own luck. He became a war hero after
his PT-boat was rammed by a Japanese destroyer in the Pacific. Hamilton's
account of this episode is probably the fullest and most dramatic to date,
capturing the mixture of recklessness and personal courage which made him
front-page news.
Behind the glory, however, there were worrisome tendencies. Like his father,
young Kennedy suffered from an inclination to look for short-cuts. For
example, he was late in filing to run for the 11th congressional district in
Massachusetts, the race which launched his career in national politics. 'A
series of frantic phone calls was made,' writes Hamilton. 'In the end, money
and influence prevailed.'
At the end of this volume, Hamilton claims that Jack had reinvented the
Kennedys. He had 'escaped from his father's and his elder brother's
Boston-Irish bigotry and found a pluralist, idealistic and internationally
defined liberalism that would, one day, define a generation of Americans.'
But in the light of what we now know about the misjudgments and brinkmanship
of JFK's presidency, Hamilton, in his next volume, will have a hard job
revising contemporary judgment among American scholars that as a character
Kennedy was flawed, and as a president overrated.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Labour dithers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party is dithering about its relationship with the trade unions.
So long as it does so it will remain stuck in a swamp of mistrust. This was
recognised in the immediate aftermath of the party's fourth election defeat
in a row. At that time - barely seven months ago - the party's national
executive was committed to one-member-one vote (OMOV) for the selection or
deselection of candidates for parliamentary elections. Proposals to reform
the system for electing the leader and the deputy leader were in the air.
The union share of voting at the annual conference was to be reduced from 90
to 70 per cent. When he campaigned for the post of leader Mr John Smith
declared himself in favour of OMOV.
Since then Labour has divided itself into two camps. The modernisers
understand the argument for a complete severance of formal ties with the
unions. They are opposed by nature's conservatives, who appear to be in a
majority on the special committee set up to study Labour-union links. So
far, most of the union members of the committee have put their weight behind
a complicated scheme for 'registering' Labour supporters within trade union
ranks. These would then vote as individuals in local constituencies. It
seems like a technical device to avoid OMOV. Proposals under discussion do
further reduce the bloc vote at conference, but not, alas, to zero.
If this sounds like dither, Labour apologists reply that these are early
days. Mr Smith only became leader in July and he has yet to assert his
authority over the links committee. The government's current troubles have
demanded his full attention. He is moving steadily. He has, for example,
sagely chosen Sir Gordon Borrie to be chairman of the party's commission on
social justice. Sir Gordon, until last June director-general of the Office
of Fair Trading, will inquire into the tax and benefits system. This is an
opportunity to influence the direction and financing of social security
policies for the 21st century, as the Beveridge report has done for the
latter half of the 20th.
So long as Labour remains in thrall to the trade unions this will not
benefit the party. Sir Gordon may produce pearls of the utmost wisdom, but
it will not be a Labour government that selects among them for adornment of
a government's programme. Social justice may, for example, demand a more
targetted system of benefits. Voters will ask themselves 'which target - the
poor or the public-sector unions?' There has to be a break as decisive as
that between the AFL-CIO and the Democrats in the US. The TUC can always
send a cheque.
Labour fears that without trade unions to protect it, it might be hijacked
by middle-class radicals. There is only one way to avoid that while
maintaining a chance of winning general elections. It is to build a new
Labour party that merits the support of people acting as individuals, not as
the foot-soldiers of the unions.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Anti-dumping biter bit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE US government is using legitimate trade policy instruments and
exploiting them to harass foreign competitors and divert world trade flows,
unduly blaming imports for what are primarily domestic problems.' Thus did a
spokeswoman for the European Community react to the US Commerce Department's
tentative determination that steel imports from 12 countries, including six
EC members, are being unfairly subsidised.
But wait just a moment. Can this be the very EC that last month imposed
anti-dumping duties on imports of seamless steel tubes from eastern Europe?
Indeed, it can. Nor were those duties nugatory. In the case of Czechoslovak
steel, for example, the duty rate was 30.4 per cent.
If anything, the US action looks more defensible than the EC's. Subsidies do
distort a market economy, which is why action against 'state aids' has been
so important to the EC. The measurement of subsidies can always be
questioned. The US finding against British Steel, for example, is
surprising. But the principle of countervailing subsidies does look
reasonably sound.
This does not mean that the US is any less guilty of abusing actions against
'unfair imports' than the EC. Countervailing duties are merely another
string to its bow. The US steel industry has itself brought anti-dumping
cases against 19 countries, preliminary decisions on which are expected in
January 1993.
Both the EC and the US find anti-dumping a convenient route towards targeted
protection. The calculations of dumping or subsidisation are technical and
their details are secret. Best of all, it is difficult for anyone to defend
'unfair imports'. But such explanations for the popularity of actions
against allegedly unfair imports do not make them less worrying. On the
contrary, the combination of political acceptability with ease of
manipulation is their principal danger. There are three specific concerns.
First, it is too easy to use anti-dumping as a covert tool of industrial
policy. Many believe that this is precisely what the EC has done in the case
of its duties against imports of electronic goods from Japan and other east
Asian countries.
Second, most anti-dumping actions have a weak economic justification. The
economic case arises where dumping is predatory. Yet there have been many
cases where anti-dumping action has been used not to prevent predatory
pricing by foreigners, but to support cartel pricing by domestic firms.
Third, the measurement of dumping (and subsidisation) too often seems
entirely arbitrary.
The preliminary US decisions against steel imports from the EC have just one
advantage: they demonstrate that what is sauce for the EC goose is sauce for
the US gander. Anti-dumping and countervailing duties need to be subsumed
within a global approach to competition. If these US actions bring that idea
further up the agenda, they will not have been entirely damaging.

DEATH BECOMES HER (PG)
Robert Zemeckis
THIS IS MY LIFE (12)
Nora Ephron
SLACKER (15)
Richard Linklater
THOUSAND PIECES OF GOLD
Nancy Kelly
ELECTRIC MOON (15)
Pradip Krishen
In 1980, Robert Zemeckis made a remarkable little black comedy called Used
Cars, one of the most underrated films of recent years. Remarkable because
it exuded the sort of good natured bad taste so rarely seen on screen. Since
then, of course, Zemeckis has toed the line and raked in the loot, becoming
the highest grossing director of all time with films like his Back to the
Future trilogy.
With Death Becomes Her, Zemeckis makes a welcome return to his early low
standards. The film is an inspired exercise in bad taste that should appeal
to everyone who has ever paid good money to see a freak show or rubbernecked
at a traffic accident.
Death Becomes Her tells the story of an ageing movie star (Meryl Streep) who
makes a Faustian deal with a magician (Isabella Rossellini) to regain her
youth. The potion she drinks gives her eternal life, which comes in handy
when she is murdered by her husband (Bruce Willis) and his lover (Goldie
Hawn). She returns to haunt them, only to find that being a zombie has its
drawbacks, especially when one of your intended victims is one as well.
It is not the story that is notable here, but rather the striking special
effects Zemeckis uses to tell it. Streep's head is twisted backwards,
smashed between her shoulders and knocked off its perch altogether; Hawn's
midriff is ventilated by a shotgun blast. Both women then proceed to rot for
the rest of the picture, winding up looking like microwaved mannequins. If
the idea is to put people off the notion of eternal youth, it is singularly
effective.
If the above sounds like too much to stomach, it should be noted that it is
all done in a lighthearted, anarchic spirit. Zemeckis and his buddies at
Industrial Light &amp; Magic have made a cartoon using human bodies, capturing
the fluidly violent form of the genre as well as its affable nihilism. In
his last film, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Zemeckis perfected the art of
placing human and animated figures in the same scene. Now, with Death
Becomes Her, he has people behave as if they themselves were the cartoons.
The actors get into the spirit of all this quite admirably. Hawn lets
herself be ballooned up to a believable two hundred pounds, while Willis
plays a boozing nerd as if he was to that manner born. Most credit should go
to Streep, though, who suffers indignity right from the opening scene, when
she performs a truly awful musical dance routine, until the last, when she
is reduced to nothing more than a severed head.
But the film really belongs to Zemeckis, who seems to have realised that it
is easier being a bad boy once you've banked a half billion bucks. Having
become the biggest grossing director of all time, Zemeckis now seems
determined to be simply the grossest.
*****
The only thing gross about This is My Life is its rampant sentimentality. In
it, Julie Kavner plays a single mother who sells cosmetics at a New York
department store while thirsting for fame as a stand-up comic. She finally
gets her big break, only to find that success sours her relationship with
her two daughters, who would rather have mom a failure at home than famous
but absent.
Unfortunately, Nora Ephron, whose pen could drip acid when she wrote the
screenplays When Harry Met Sally and Heartburn, seems to prefer syrup now
that she is directing her own material. Every time her film teeters on the
brink of a real conflict, such as Kavner's use of her eldest daughter's teen
angst for material, Ephron retreats into a hollow, feel-good reconciliation,
usually accompanied by a cloying Carly Simon soundtrack. To make matters
worse, the film is woefully unfunny. If comedy is all about timing, then
Ephron's directorial watch needs winding.
The usually superb Kavner is disappointingly listless, while Dan Aykroyd and
Carrie Fischer as theatrical agents seem to be reading out the script for
the first time.
Slacker is the sort of film that achieves cult status by telling the
disaffected young that their rebellion is somehow different, somehow more
justified, than the uprisings of preceding generations. Set in and about the
dreary college town of Austin, Texas, Richard Linklater's drama-documentary
charts a day in the life of a group of jobless, aimless 20-year-olds as they
drift among the city's coffee houses, bedsits and bars.
Despite its problematical premise that 'withdrawing in disgust is not the
same as apathy,' the film has considerable charm and real style. Linklater
has a wonderful ear for the dialogue of the dispossessed - his wandering
characters are often captivating as they opine about Madonna, Elvis,
political assassinations and Chaos Theory. They keep you on the edge of your
seat by virtue of the fact you never know what they will say next. (You do
know what they will do, though - nothing). They all suffer from a sort of
spiritual Greenhouse Effect, in which insulating values and ideologies have
been baked away by an overheated, intellectually noxious culture. The only
character seen hard at work is a young man who has locked himself in a
roomful of televisions for four years, intent on watching everything.
Fans of Godard and Wayne's World will find much to treasure here, though
ageing hippies and other fogies may well feel like the character who, when
asked to come to a party, declines by explaining he has 'less important
things to do' than engage in 'premeditated fun.'
*****
Another independent effort from America is Nancy Kelly's Thousand Pieces of
Gold, which details the life of a young Chinese woman who is sold into
slavery by her father. She is transported to 1880s Oregon, where her
'master' tries to make her a whore. She rebels against her fate and soon
finds herself involved in a difficult relationship with a Civil War veteran.
The film is handsomely shot and features a spirited performance by Rosalind
Chao in the lead role. Despite the timely agenda of feminism and an ethnic
rethinking of America's western heritage, however, director Kelly's film
turns out to be a rather standard melodrama, complete with poker games in a
smoky saloon and bad guys with scruffy beards. The hero may be a heroine,
but she still rides off into the sunset, her best guy at her side.
*****
Electric Moon is another culture clash film that never works up enough steam
to make for a real collision. It is set in an Indian resort where Westerners
come to experience the real East, only to be duped by the owners, who
secretly use stuffed tigers and fake bird calls to convince their guests
that they are in some primitive paradise. Director Pradip Krishen's film is
an occasionally insightful glimpse into the way people cannot see forests
for trees, though its worthiness is undercut by an often tedious pace.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Arts: The Ghost Train - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Stay here? In Fal Vale Station? Stay here all night?' Saul Hodgkin, the
stationmaster, is portentously addressing six passengers who have been
stranded without a train till tomorrow morning. He proceeds to tell the tale
of the ghost train: 'Twenty year ago, this very night . . .' You laugh at
the melodramatic spookiness of it; but, of course, you want to know what
will happen. These two reactions were just what was intended in 1925, when
this play was new; and they must have been hard to bring off then. Harder
today, though, because Ghost Train is now also a period piece.
Heightening our interest are the facts that the playwright, Arnold Ridley,
later became known to every household as Private Godfrey in Dad's Army; and
that the play was turned into a film (Arthur Askey et al). In this revival,
Bill Oddie plays the stationmaster who must set the tone for what follows.
He draws out the ghoulishness of the big narration nicely enough. But for
comedy he is underpowered and disappointing. He throws away numerous
opportunities, and is altogether too subdued.
But the exquisite playing comes from his six passengers (one of whom is his
real-life daughter, Kate Hardie, playing a newly-married flapper). As a
determinedly independent wife marooned with a husband from whom she plans to
separate, Catherine Russell is interesting and silly at the same time -
first-rate. Avril Elgar, as an indignant spinster, and Aden Gillett, playing
a Bertie Wooster-type oaf (with hidden depths), are both astonishingly like
period cartoons comes to life. She seems to have been drawn by Osbert
Lancaster, he by Peter Arno. Richard Stirling and Owen Brenman, as the two
husbands, complete this excellent group.
Were everything on this level, this would not seem a wispy play. Roger
Butlin's set and Matt McKenzie's sound-effects are perfect. But the period
quaintness now stops us from being the least bit scared. And the director,
John Adams, seems to have rehearsed the first act best. Act Two sags. The
hardest role of all is that of the fey and neurotic Julia Price, who, around
midnight, invades the waiting-room, mysteriously drawn to the scene of the
haunting, resisting the advice of friends and family. It is she who should
draw the play to its climax of comic horror; and yet we should suspect her
too.
We certainly suspect Sara Mair-Thomas. For all the high accomplishment of
her playing, she lacks the lightness of touch that would make Julia
persuasive and/or amusing. She also plays the final turnabout too heavily.
(There are several revelations in Act Three. Hers is the only one that fails
to be hilarious.) And, as her loyal chum Sterling, Jonathan Philips overdoes
everything. These are not disgraceful performances - but, like Oddie's, they
are the reason this promising souffle does not rise.
At the Lyric, Hammersmith, until January 2.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Arts: Fidelio in concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Andrew Litton brought his Bournemouth Symphony and Chorus, and an
interesting septet of principals, to the Festival Hall for a concert
performance of Fidelio on Tuesday. After a couple of Beethoven-less operatic
seasons, any Fidelio is better than none; and the Bournemouth one was
considerably better than that.
Litton has a nice, unshowy grasp of the score: sound tempi, duly
accommodating of the voices, and excellent appreciation of Beethoven's long,
tension-building piano passages, which premature surges always diminish. The
orchestra played very well and the chorus were sturdy. Including the
'Leonora no. 3' overture in the place where Mahler intruded it, however -
between the spouses' private reunion and the public explosion of relief -
was surely a mistake.
That needs a theatrical justification, beyond the original plea for extra
scene-shifting time. Here it merely lengthened the performance of an opera
which is notably concise, and postponed the human finale for too long. In
any case, the homely, domestic aspect of Fidelio - its 'Singspiel' side -
faded with the placement of the singers behind the orchestra. Fine for
heroic voices (Leonora's and Florestan's); but deeply unhelpful for little
Marzelline and Jaquino, and even old Father Rocco. As the green young pair,
Linda Kitchen and the French-Canadian tenor Benoit Boutet were attractive
and gracefully musical, and Donald McIntyre's Rocco suggested gruff depths,
but from an awkward distance where the action wants to be cosy-cottagy.
Jane Eaglen's weighty Leonora covered the distance in heroic strides,
stately rather than tomboyish, but with imposing gravity. As Florestan, the
young American Heldentenor Edward Cook unleashed some ringing timbre and
much erratic feeling: plenty of promise, no cogent grasp yet of the size and
shape of his crucial 'Gott] welch' Dunkel hier]' scena. As hateful Don
Pizarro and beneficent Don Fernando, Alan Opie and Matthew Best were more
than competent, if slightly less well-focussed than we know they can manage.
All in all, though there were no revelations in this Fidelio, it gave honest
satisfaction.
Repeated in Colston Hall, Bristol, on December 3; sponsored by Harveys of
Bristol, and Beales

FT  03 DEC 92 / Arts: Bartoli and Vollestad - Wigmore Hall recitals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY and RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a Rossini mezzo, Miss Bartoli is more or less perfect. That was a good
enough reason for devoting her whole Wigmore Hall recital on Sunday to
Rossini. She had the enterprise and taste to stick to proper recital-songs,
too, until her dazzling 'Bel raggio lusinghier' (Semiramide) at the very
end. (Her second encore was operatic too, and delivered with no less
brilliant finesse: 'Tanti affetti', from La donna del lago.)
Though Rossini's songs with piano are without exception charming, a
programme given over to them may seem like a menu consisting entirely of
hors d'oeuvres. Usually his little three-part cantata, or monodrama, 'La
regata veneziana' - a regular favourite despite its tricky Venetian dialect
 -stands out just because of its length, amid all those pretty miniatures
which are over within two or three minutes. Here the Bartoli impersonation
of excitable Anzoleta, urging her gondolier on to victory, was sly and
delectable; but she found whole little worlds of feeling elsewhere, even in
the shortest songs.
The voice is lovely, softly burnished and phenomenally flexible (and
accurate). With Bartoli Rossini's endless fioriture, which require some
acrobatic effort from most modern singers and may easily sound like
period-routine, become expressive elaborations of the most natural kind,
easy and delicate. Were they not so exquisite, they would seem almost
artless. We got a virtuoso display of them in five different settings of the
same verse, 'Mi lagnero tacendo' - one of them in quintuple time] - each
with its own unique inflections, tender or wounded or nobly reproachful.
What crowns Miss Bartoli's art in Rossini, however, is her irrepressible
sense of humour. It glints mischievously through most of her singing: it is
funny for a voice to be going through all those intricate hoops, and she
shares the joke with us. Particularly infectious was her treatment of
Cerere's aria from an obscure cantata, which began with goddess-like frowns,
melted into beatific satisfaction and finally went into exultant whoops.
Almost a send-up; but faultlessly musical, and bewitching to hear.
For her first encore she switched to Mozart, the 'Voi che sapete' from
Figaro, offering it like the formal serenade which dramatically it is
(Cherubino's well-rehearsed song to the Countess) - quite steady,
beautifully liquid, without any effusive Viennese sentiment but subtly
shaded at the edges. Coming between her triumphant 'Bel raggio' and 'Tanti
affetti', it was doubly affecting.
*****
It was the encores on Tuesday that brought out the best in a young Norwegian
baritone at his Wigmore Hall recital. For those who have invested in the
music of the 'Tender is the North' festival, there is the dividend of
catching some of the most promising Scandinavian singers of the younger
generation.
Per Vollestad made his recital debut in 1986 and has won good opinions for
his song recordings since then. With music ranging from Grieg and Rangstrom
to standard Schubert and Schumann (the Op. 24 Liederkreis) this programme
was a decent showcase for his talents. Those include a friendly stage manner
and a fairly strong, dark-hued baritone, which is shy about its top - when
top notes beckoned, he offered a variety of ideas for how not to sing out.
There was nothing coy, however, about his delivery of Grieg's Op. 48.
Earlier indecisiveness was dispelled and these songs, set to German poetry
including Heine and Goethe, were sung in a way that showed they have a grip
on their texts, suggesting a more intellectual Grieg than we have met in the
series so far. Vollestad's Rangstrom songs worked well, too. 'Melodi' proved
a real charmer, for which the singer can take some credit.

Those who fancy Joanna Lumley in school uniform (calm down and form an
orderly queue between London and Edinburgh) will need to watch Absolutely
Fabulous, Jennifer Saunders' comedy series set in the fashion business. So
far it has been very funny (9.00 BBC2). That is followed by a Horizon
special which will presumably get the biggest audience ever for this science
series: 'The Truth About Sex'. Cameras followed researchers as they
interviewed some of the 20,000 subjects of the National Sex Survey.
Commissioned by the government, then dropped, this has been financed by the
Wellcome Trust. Spurred by what was expected to be a forest-fire epidemic of
AIDS, the survey set out to establish what proportion of the British
population is homosexual or bisexual, and how promiscuous people are,
especially those in the high-risk categories for Aids, homosexuals and drug
addicts. In the AIDS Update 92 on ITV (10.40) dealing with AIDS in Africa it
will be interesting to see whether the broadcasters have the courage to
investigate the social and sexual reasons for the difference in the
incidence of AIDS between countries.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Arts: My Father's Vertigo - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The trappings which surround Amanda Miller's My Father's Vertigo for London
Contemporary Dance Theatre - an incomprehensible title; a portentous
programme note about 'the need to dwell' - are tiresome. They reflect
something of the taste current in Frankfurt, where Miss Miller
(American-born) works with William Forsythe's company. And, as with
Forsythe's works, this obscurantism seems a ploy to disorientate the viewer.
Yet what we saw on Tuesday, when LCDT gave the piece its first London
showing, was choreography of real interest.
The score is an atmospheric string quartet by Fred Frith: music that
shimmers, is haunted by echoes and odd glissandi beneath its melodies. Miss
Miller's writing (for a cast of five men and six women: uniformly excellent)
stresses a sinuous, smoothly muscled language that can look at moments as if
action is slowed down, its fluidity almost oily, its pulse irregular as
movement slips forward and seems on the point of losing balance. As with
Forsythe's work, there is emotionally potent lighting which shifts our
perceptions about the dancers through arbitrary change. (There are also
hints of the greyness favoured in Frankfurt in the costuming of men in grey
tops, black trousers, women in grey frocks, black stockings).
The dance style is unified by its insistance on flowing activity, even if
its incidents do not at first seem to cohere. Yet as ideas are repeated,
transferred among the cast, the choreography tells of a concern with how
energy may move through a body, how muscular force is expended. The music's
second movement proposes contrasting quartets for men and women, each with
an observer watching from 'outside' the action as a dynamic and emotional
counter-weight. A later duet between Andrew Robinson and Tom Ward is a
fascinating conflict between opposing physiques. Towards the work's end, odd
activity - Kenneth Tharp indulging in mute and mimed conversation - seems
set to distort the mood. And with every switch of action, Miss Miller's
movement world remains intriguing.
Visually the piece is austere, very well lit. The spectral appearance of
what I take to be a head of a women by Titian on the grey gauze backdrop is
curious, but curiously effective. In matter of composition, My Father's
Vertigo offers a subtle sense of form and language. It is a bold addition to
the repertory, and, as I have mentioned, is danced with grand assurance by
its cast. This second LCDT programme also includes Mark Morris's Motorcade -
its dancing still not quite quick enough in musical response - and Rikud,
last's years brutish acquisition from Liat Dror and Nir Ben Gal, which I
prefer not to watch.
London Contemporary Dance Theatre is at Sadler's Wells Theatre with this
programme until December 5.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): High rollers and
basement bargains - A look at two motor manufacturers using a similar
approach to sell very different types of car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What can you buy for Pounds 87,549.25? When it comes to motor cars, that
will pick up the cheapest Bentley from Rolls-Royce, or just about 13 bottom
of the range models from Proton, the Malaysian manufacturer.
From the highly expensive to the unashamedly bargain-priced, both
manufacturers face a tricky marketing problem. How do they identify, target
and ultimately persuade their relatively small markets - less than 1 per
cent of the UK market in each case - to buy their vehicles during some of
the most adverse trading conditions for the motor industry of recent years?
The answer is that both Proton and Rolls-Royce have adopted an advertising
approach which, while different in style, tries to reassure rather than
cajole potential buyers, offering them security in the purchasing decision
rather than pushing hard-sell techniques.
The two manufacturers are very different. Proton, which only started
marketing its cars in the UK in 1989, is a Japanese-Malaysian hybrid aiming
itself solidly at the purchaser who wants a family-sized car at a small car
price.
Since producing its first car in 1904, Rolls-Royce has developed an image as
quintessentially the last word in expensive and exclusive British
craftsmanship, with more than 60 per cent of all the cars it has ever made
still roadworthy.
When it comes to marketing, Rolls-Royce has long maintained a brand image of
exclusiveness, but latterly that had taken on a feel of aloofness. The
company is sensitive to criticism that its product is perhaps out of tune
with austere times and that its recent image has become tainted with
somewhat vulgar 'new' rather than quality 'old' money.
But the impact of collapsed sales in 1991 - down to 1,722 units from 3,333
in 1990 - meant that the company needed to rethink both production and
marketing strategies.
It has brought costs into line with sales by shedding 35 per cent of its
workforce over the last two years. Michael Donovan, commercial managing
director, says its break-even point is now 'way south of 1,500 units a
year'. Donovan argues that as far as profitability goes, the company has
turned the corner.
But image is still a vital asset requiring careful nurture. In July
Rolls-Royce hired a new advertising agency, Edwards Martin Thornton, to
brush up its image through a press advertising campaign between
August-November. Bob Edwards, managing director of Edwards Martin Thornton,
says: 'There was a perception that their technical prowess was lacking. That
had little to do with Rolls-Royce, rather it was competing manufacturers who
began stressing technology, whereas Rolls-Royce had never actually made a
case for technology.'
Donovan says that almost 80 per cent of Rolls-Royce and Bentley owners say
they are going to buy another. But despite that loyalty, Rolls-Royce had
become vulnerable to a combination of developing technology, consumer mood
change and some clever advertising.
Edwards says that competitors, particularly in the US, attacked Rolls-Royce
at its weak spots: price and image. 'The price gap was perceived to be
widening. That was true to some extent but exaggerated,' he says.
'Cars like Lexus (from Toyota) were coming on to the market with an
on-the-road price in the US of about Dollars 40,000 (Pounds 26,300), with
features which were arguably comparable with Rolls-Royce. And the emotional
side of the Lexus campaign - the advertising headline in the US was 'Flaunt
your intelligence, not your wealth' - was perfectly capturing a new mood.
'Rolls-Royce does not sit comfortably in the new recessionary atmosphere,
particularly at the corporate level when you have to report losses to
shareholders.'
Edwards, rather rarely for an advertising executive, holds a fairly
commonsense view of the limits to advertising. 'We said (to Rolls-Royce):
'An advertising campaign can't change those sorts of values, but what you
can do is at least say something and have a point of view. If you remain
silent, then you are effectively saying all that is true. This is not a time
to be irresolute.' We told them not to apologise for what they are trying to
do.'
Next week Rolls-Royce will meet Edwards to assess the success of the press
campaign, which has cost around Pounds 350,000. Even if Rolls-Royce decides
to pause from advertising, other means of marketing will continue.
Donovan declines to discuss what his marketing budget is but points out that
advertising is not more than 10 per cent of total marketing spending.
'We use sporting events sponsorship and personalised advertising,' he says.
'We jointly run sponsored events at the Hong Kong jockey club, and sponsor
yachting and polo events in US and Japan. In September in the US we ran an
event at the normally closed Forbes estate, because the Forbes family are
owners of our products, at which we shared with them our customer base.
'It was a weekend event which gave people an opportunity to experience a
piece of North American success that they, even though they are wealthy and
successful themselves, may aspire to.'
Far from the Forbes estate end of personalised marketing lies Proton Cars
UK, the local agent for the Mitsubishi-engineered, Malaysian-styled range of
Protons. In the UK Proton has adopted a classic approach to press
advertising - lots of detailed copy which tries to answer every conceivable
question a customer might pose - in complete contrast to the cool confidence
of the Rolls-Royce campaign.
Proton's UK sales were 14,000 in 1991 and will reach about 15,000 this year.
David Brown, founder, chairman and chief executive of Proton Cars UK,
expects annual sales of 20,000 by 1995.
While there are no plans to sell the cars in North America, Brown will start
marketing (through a separate company) the Proton range in continental
Europe in 1994, with estimated sales of 25,000 in the first full year.
In the UK Proton still benefits from full exemption from import duties, an
advantage which runs until the end of 1993. At its plant outside Kuala
Lumpur Proton aims to be producing 150,000 units by 1995; the company has
acknowledged that its export drive is vital to its continued success, one
reason behind Proton UK's estimated Pounds 8m advertising spending in the
year to June 1992.
Although at almost opposite ends of the price range, there are common
elements in the marketing strategies of both Rolls-Royce and Proton.
Proton's marketing makes great play of offering a package of value-for-money
extras such as zero interest on financing, two years' free insurance cover
and a six-year mechanical warranty.
Brown says that in addition, 'a very aggressive dealer network, with dual
franchising arrangements with other dealers such as Ford, Volvo, Rover and
Saab giving the customer personal service and back-up' aims at reassuring
customers.
For both Proton and Rolls-Royce, future successful marketing thus appears to
lie not so much in revolutionary new advertising but in achieving harmony
between costs and sales, as well as ensuring that their respective messages
are correctly targeted.
For Donovan, 'it's not an elephant gun, it's a night-sight sniper approach
to identifying prospective owners and putting to them our proposition,
bringing them together to a point of marriage rather than a point of sale.'
Though Brown eschews that romantic metaphor, he also views marketing
techniques as being fundamentally about reassurance rather than persuasion,
showing 'a well-built, quality vehicle at a great price. A car which is not
pretending to be state-of-the-art, up-to-date, leading-edge technology but
aimed at the family man.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir David Scholey, chairman of S G Warburg, has underlined the close ties
between one of Britain's biggest industrial companies and its premier
merchant bank, by accepting a non-executive directorship of the General
Electric Company.
Sir David, 57, is one of two new faces in the GEC boardroom. Sir Christopher
Harding, 53, chairman of BET and a long-time director of Hanson, has also
joined the board. Meanwhile, Dr Tony O'Reilly, 56, the Irish-born
entrepreneur who heads the H J Heinz Company, has resigned after two years
as a GEC director.
The appointment of two powerful non-executive directors to the GEC board -
Sir David is a director of BT and Sir Christopher is on the boards of
English China Clays, Slough Estates and Newarthill - is likely to be
welcomed by the City. Although Lord Weinstock, the 68-year-old managing
director who has dominated GEC since the early 1960s, has given no
indication when he will step down, there has been concern about his
successor.
Non-executive directors were already in a majority on the GEC board, and the
two new figures will lay to rest any doubts that the rest of the GEC board
is strong enough to stand up to Lord Weinstock on the succession issue.
The links between Warburg and GEC go back a long way. Sir Ronald Grierson,
who was involved in the company's early development, was a Warburg director
for many years and only stepped down as GEC's vice chairman just over a year
ago. Lord Weinstock's son, Simon, worked at Warburg before joining GEC in
1983 and Warburg is a financial adviser to GEC.
*****
Lawrence Urquhart, 57, chief executive of Burmah Castrol, and Peter
Middleton, 51, chief executive of Lloyd's of London, have been appointed
non-executive directors of BAA. Meanwhile, Denis Cassidy, retires as a
non-executive director.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Lobbyists fight
smoke with fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest anti-smoking campaigns in the US are setting a new standard for
public health messages by using the imaginative treatments normally reserved
for food, drink and perfume.
'We finally decided to attack the tobacco industry, not by throwing boring
facts at the public, but by attacking them on their own battlefield -
image,' said Paul Keye, chairman of Livingston and Keye, the advertising
firm that put together a particularly successful campaign in California.
One problem with public health campaigns in the US is that they have lacked
the funds to hire top advertising talent. As a result, public health
messages were often seen as dull, 'preachy' slots which viewers soon forgot.
New laws in Minnesota and California, however, have added hefty taxes -
around 25 cents a pack - to cigarettes, to fund an anti-smoking campaign.
Massachusetts may soon follow suit.
The California effort began with a Dollars 199m (Pounds 131m) anti-smoking
budget in 1989 and 1990, Dollars 28m of which was spent on a media campaign.
That may not be much compared with the Dollars 300m the tobacco industry
spent on marketing in the state over the same period, but it allowed the
anti-tobacco lobby to tap top advertising firms for the first time.
Keye, who was chosen to head the campaign, admits there was a temptation to
stick to the old formula of dishing out the facts. 'We tested one commercial
in which we strung together images of famous movie stars smoking - like
Humphrey Bogart and Joan Crawford. Then, at the end of the commercial we
told the viewers: 'These movie stars all died of smoking'.'
It did not work. 'When we tested the ad, all the viewers, including the
non-smokers, seemed to walk out with the overwhelming urge for a cigarette.
That's when we realised that the image factor completely outweighed the
facts we were putting out.'
A new strategy was obviously needed. 'We decided that if image is what
matters, our main goal would be de-glamorisation,' said Keye.
Central to the new campaign was an all-out attack on the tobacco industry to
create a villain in the anti-smoking struggle. 'One problem in reaching
young people through health service messages is that they tend to rebel
against being told what to do,' said Jacquolyn Duerr, chief of the media
unit at the California Department of Health's tobacco control programme.
'The new message was: 'These terrible, greedy people in the tobacco industry
are trying to get you to buy cigarettes and make a profit at your expense.
Are you going to let them do it?''
The result was a series of messages, one of which featured tobacco industry
executives laughing in a smoke-filled room about how they were duping the
public. Other commercials concentrated on the harm of second-hand smoke; one
featured rap music and another an off-putting image of a woman smoking in
reverse - with all the smoke being pulled into her mouth.
The new approach yielded impressive results. Viewers' awareness of the
campaign reached 87 per cent at its peak in some population segments.
In two years smoking in California was reduced from 26 per cent of the adult
population to just 21 per cent.
Those involved in the campaign believe its success will encourage other
public health lobbies to adopt the same formula.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Steve Shirley, probably the computing services industry's best known female
entrepreneur, has found a new diversion as she continues gently to disengage
herself from FI Group, the privately-held software company she founded over
30 years ago.
She has been appointed a part-time board member of AEA Technology, the
services company which used to be the UK Atomic Energy Authority and which
this year made a profit for the first time in five years.
This marks Shirley's first directorship of a major company outside FI and
her extensive international business experience is expected to accelerate
the operation's transformation from government agency to commercial
organisation.
Yesterday she described the company as 'totally professional at every level,
but it does not yet have enough of a service culture. In the past, the
emphasis has been on cost containment; it has to be shifted to income
generation'.
She clearly relishes the challenge. 'There is gold dust in there' she
enthuses. Her experience of FI Group is also expected to help AEA develop a
more participative style of management.
Shirley has been president of the British Computer Society and is, this
year, Master of the Worshipful Company of Information Technologists, the
100th livery company to be formed in the City.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Emson, who has just been named as the new finance director of IMI, says
he feels like a sailor returning to the sea. 'It is very nice to be back in
engineering' says Emson, 49, who is remembered by the City for his part in
the vigorous but ultimately unsuccessful defence of Birmid Qualcast from the
hands of Blue Circle.
The Birmingham engineering group, which analysts regard as tightly managed
and well-positioned for economic recovery, has traditionally looked inside
to fill board positions, but this time there was no suitable internal
candidate to replace Gordon Taylor who is retiring, at the age of 60, after
5 years as finance director and 24 years at IMI.
Emson is remembered for preserving his cool during the Blue Circle bid -
which in 1988 was declared successful only for the result to be reversed
when the votes were recounted - answering the phone with the comment 'hello,
deputy escapologist speaking'. When Blue Circle ultimately achieved its
target the following year, in a deal analysts characterised as very
favourable for Birmid shareholders, Emson left to become finance director of
motor dealership Evans Halshaw. He now explains that move as being largely
determined by his wish to stay in the Midlands despite several approaches
from London-based public companies.
He says the style of management at IMI - 'conservative but granting a lot of
autonomy to the divisions and subsidiaries' - is very similar to the old
Birmid Qualcast culture, in which he spent 18 years, the latter 12 as
finance director.
Evans Halshaw is replacing Emson with Charles Cameron, 36, finance director
of the Midlands and the specialty vehicles divisions.

Geoffrey Vincent, finance director of BTR's important Australian operation,
has resigned little more than a year after he took up the post. He is being
replaced by Andrew Sellman who has been with the BTR Nylex group for more
than a decade.
The resignation of Vincent is part of a boardroom reshuffle at BTR Nylex
which is 62 per cent owned by BTR and ranks among Australia's top half dozen
companies. Kathleen O'Donovan, who took over as finance director of the UK
parent last year, is joining the Australian company's board and Peter
Robinson, chief executive of the packaging and building products group, has
been promoted to the new position of chief operating officer of BTR Nylex.
It was unclear why Vincent had resigned but London analysts did not think
that his departure indicated any change in the underlying performance of BTR
Nylex, which has defied the recession better than many local companies. It
currently contributes over a quarter of BTR profits.
One analyst said that appointing a chief operating officer at BTR Nylex
mirrored what BTR itself had already done. Although BTR prides itself on
having one of the flattest management structures of any large company, it
felt last year that the growth of its business made it necessary to have a
chief operating officer and it appointed Bob Faircloth to the position.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Accountancy Column: Two sides of a single coin should draw
together - Artificial distinctions between accountancy and auditing
watchdogs need demolishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ROQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FUNDAMENTAL change in the framework of accounting and auditing in the UK
is essential to restore public confidence in the accountancy profession.
There has undoubtedly been a crisis of confidence during the past two years.
The public and the media frequently equate corporate failure with audit
failure, and forget that it is by the very nature of business that some
companies succeed and others fail.
This is not to say that nothing should be done to improve the scope and
quality of audit or corporate reporting. I firmly believe that much can and
should be done. But without significant changes which recognise the
interdependence of accounting and auditing, it is unlikely that confidence
in the accountancy profession will be restored.
The issue that needs to be addressed is the largely artificial distinction
between the various standard-setting and regulatory activities for
accounting and auditing. The position has become increasingly
institutionalised and Byzantine.
The Financial Reporting Council controls the Accounting Standards Board
(ASB), the Financial Reporting Review Panel, and the Urgent Issues Task
Force. The Auditing Practices Board (APB) is separately controlled by the
Consultative Committee of Accounting Bodies (CCAB), the body jointly owned
by the leading professional accountancy bodies.
Audit regulation, disciplinary action and ethical guidance come directly
from the professional bodies. My firm has long argued for removing
regulation from the institutes.
The faults with the existing complex system are legion and include the
following:
Accounting and auditing standard-setters report to separate bodies.
The Auditing Practices Board is perceived to be run by accountants for
accountants. Even though it has an equal number of practising accountants
and lay members, it is funded by and reports to the CCAB.
There appear to be divergencies between the priorities of the accounting and
auditing standard setters. For example, the ASB appears aloof from the APB's
attempts to try to close the expectations gap - between what auditors do and
what the public believes they do.
The ASB is developing standards without obvious regard for their audit
implications.
The APB is raising disclosure issues which, under current arrangements,
appear more sensibly to lie with ASB.
My solution is to end this distinction and put all standard setting and
audit regulation under the Financial Reporting Council (FRC).
This would inspire more public confidence, since half the members of the top
body, the FRC, are lay people who are not accountants.
Second, responsibility for both auditing and accounting would force the FRC
to treat closing the expectations gap as the top priority for both
accounting and auditing standards.
Third, it would create an unambiguous link between auditing standards
setting and the process of monitoring and policing their application, a link
clearly already established between the ASB and the review panel by their
parent body.
Fourth, it should make things much easier for government, and reduce much of
the criticism which ministers are receiving over audit matters.
I also believe the new structure would help provide a better platform for
the changes that need to be made to improve confidence in corporate
governance.
The Cadbury Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance has
identified a host of areas where the proposed changes should impact on both
audit and financial reporting practice. Most of these have already been
split arbitrarily between the ASB and the APB, even though they have
implications for both.
As a result, the following problems are already emerging:
Going Concern. A draft Auditing Guideline has been issued on assessing the
future viability of companies. But it does not canvass the ways in which
corporate reporting could be improved to provide users with better
information with which to assess this going-concern basis.
Also proposals have been made by the APB that the 'subject to' qualified
audit reports should disappear and that auditors should assess the adequacy
of disclosures of matters affecting a company's ability to continue as a
going concern.
However, there are no parallel proposals from the ASB as to the extent and
nature of disclosure which the corporate sector should make in relation to
inherent uncertainties. As a result, a situation could emerge in which there
may be no objective criteria against which auditors can make the assessment
likely to be required by the APB.
Directors' Responsibilities. The Cadbury committee recommended a statement
of these responsibilities in the directors' report as a counterpart to a
statement by auditors about their reporting responsibilities. Currently,
this topic is the subject only of an APB exposure draft and again there
could be a lack of suggested guidance for the corporate sector on the form
which such a statement should take.
Financial Reports. The Cadbury committee also recognised the advantages to
users of reports and accounts of some explanation of the factors likely to
influence a company's future progress. Useful steps are being taken by the
ASB to develop an essentially forward-looking operational and financial
review, but much thought needs to be given to developing ideas on the extent
to which the auditor should review such information.
The ASB by itself does not have the remit to develop such ideas.
Consequently their development could end up being rushed at the time of
publication of an accounting standard, or it could lag behind. This latter
situation arose when the ASB issued Financial Reporting Standard 1 on cash
flow statements last year.
All of the above are merely symptomatic of the overwhelming need for the
co-ordination and monitoring of APB and ASB by a single body. No doubt there
is liaison already between the two bodies, but only when they are both under
the FRC umbrella will many key problems be addressed properly.
Consideration could then be given to the possibility of joint accounting and
audit exposure drafts and standards on expectations gap projects, as well as
many other topics where there is a need for a concerted effort.
Topics which spring to mind include related party transactions and pension
schemes. Such documents may individually be longer for all of us to read,
but they will ensure that thought is given simultaneously to accounting and
audit aspects.
That would make it much more likely that the current problems affecting the
profession and corporate governance in general will be properly resolved and
public confidence restored.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Technology: Haggling over road prices - How a controversial
scheme to charge drivers would ease traffic congestion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Time is running out for road users. With congestion becoming a worldwide
problem, drivers may have to get used to the idea of paying for their
journeys.
This is certainly true in Britain, where new solutions are being looked at
more closely than ever. While recession may have taken some of the heat out
of the traffic crisis, it will not be long before vehicle ownership and use
resume their rapid rise. In barely a decade, according to UK government
forecasts, traffic levels could be 50 per cent worse than they are already.
The question is: just how is this traffic growth to be accommodated? Many
large towns and cities already experience intolerable levels of congestion,
but few have room for more roads. Many trunk roads and motorways are also
packed, but even where environmental considerations allow for widening or
new construction, the government cannot afford the huge sums required.
In both cases, it seems, something will have to give: and in both cases, it
looks like being the road user. Indeed, if there were ever any doubts on the
issue, they were dispelled by two separate government announcements on the
sensitive issue of road charges.
One came from Norman Lamont, the Chancellor, in his Autumn Statement. If the
country was to get the transport infrastructure it needed, the private
sector would have to help provide it. The underlying message was that
private companies would be encouraged to build toll roads.
What may prove harder to swallow is the government's other announcement. At
a London traffic congestion conference last month, John MacGregor, the UK
Transport Secretary, fired what appeared to be the first shot in a campaign
to soften up attitudes in readiness for the introduction of electronic road
pricing in urban areas later this decade.
The big difference between this kind of road pricing and motorway tolls is
its motives. While the purpose of motorway tolls is to increase the supply
of road space by raising money for roadbuilding, the purpose of road pricing
is to reduce demand for road space by pricing people off the roads.
Understandably, the latter is likely to prove an extremely sensitive
political issue.
For that reason, the technology of urban road pricing will be crucial. Any
system will have to win public acceptability to stand a chance of winning
political approval. That means it will have to be seen as fair, easy to use,
difficult to outwit, and respectful of civil liberties.
Experience abroad is of little help. The only fully-fledged urban system in
the world today is in Singapore, where motorists have to buy a daily or
weekly permit to drive into the city centre in peak periods. Permits are
checked visually by police at the city's 29 entry points.
In theory, that system could be replaced by an electronic one using existing
tollgate technology. On the Dartford Crossing, east of London, for example,
vehicle owners can open an account with the operating company and have it
debited electronically each time they use the bridge. A matchbox-size device
in their windscreen is read by a roadside beacon and opens the tollgate
automatically if the owner's account is in credit.
But borders around cities, electronic or otherwise, suffer several
disadvantages. One is that they create undesirable cordon effects - for
example, encouraging people to dump their cars at the border or divert
around it on unsuitable roads. Worse, they are simply unfair, for they
impose the same charge on someone momentarily crossing the border as on
someone spending the whole day driving around the most congested areas of
the city centre.
A better system was that tested in Hong Kong in the early 1980s. Cars were
fitted with electronic number plates which were read by electronic loops in
the road surface, and motorists were presented with bills according to their
use of the roads. The experiment failed, however, because of people's
concern that the technology could be used to trace their movements.
Two systems under development in Britain today have sought to overcome this
objection by avoiding the need to record where vehicles have been. One,
congestion metering, is being developed for Cambridgeshire County Council by
the universities of Newcastle and Northumbria. The other, called Timezone,
is being developed by GEC-Marconi, the aerospace and electronics arm of
Britain's General Electric Company.
Congestion metering, devised as a means of countering acute congestion in
Cambridge, is aimed at discouraging people from using scarce road space at
the busiest times by charging drivers.
Vehicles would be fitted with meters that monitored their progress through
traffic. Any vehicle stopping four times or more within any half-kilometre
stretch, or taking more than three minutes to cover that distance, would
start clocking up units.
Drivers would pay for the units with pre-paid smartcards which would be
inserted into the meter and debited as the journey progressed. If the meter
ran out, a linked device would cut off the fuel supply - though an overdraft
of, say, 50 units would be allowed to give people time to buy new cards.
Normally dormant, the meters would come into operation when activated by
microwave signals from roadside beacons at entry points to the city. Similar
signals would switch the meters off at exit points.
People without meters would have to buy day passes at slightly more than the
average cost of a metered city centre journey. These would also respond to
roadside beacons. Any vehicle failing to respond would have its registration
plate automatically photographed by roadside cameras so drivers could be
traced and penalised.
Timezone, too, would require vehicles to be fitted with in-car meters
charged up with smartcards and brought into operation by radio waves. But in
this case, transmitters would be installed not just at the entry to the
city, but throughout the charging zone, with the meter responding to the
nearest transmitter.
A city like London would probably have several zones charging different
rates according to the degree of congestion. Charges could also vary
according to the time of day.
If a vehicle ran out of credits, the roadside transmitters would sense this
and automatically report the vehicle's registration number to the
authorities. But GEC-Marconi emphasises that registration numbers could not
be detected as long as meters remained charged.
People entering the charging zones without Timezone devices would have their
registration plates photographed with a view to penalisation. But visitors
buying temporary passes would have their registration numbers passed on to
the computer which would then ignore the photographic record.
What the government thinks of these competing systems will become clearer
when the Department of Transport publishes its report on the technological
options for road pricing early in 1993.
That will be just an interim report; the results of the government's full
investigation into road pricing are not due until 1994. Even so, the writing
seems to be on the wall for free motoring.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Technology: BMW's city hybrid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BMW has just unveiled a potential and partial solution to traffic
congestion, calling it 'a blend of the obvious and a little original
thought'.
The German car and motorcycle maker is putting forward its C1 prototype as a
possible way of taking advantage of the road space and journey time-saving
merits of the motorcycle, without the rider being excessively exposed to the
usual safety hazards.
BMW claims that the C1, which has an aluminium space frame with built-in
front and rear crumple zones, has the same protection in a head-on collision
as a small car. It is fitted with a car-type seat, safety belts and
roll-over hoop.
Despite suggesting that a helmet could be regarded as superfluous, even
Munich-based BMW acknowledges that the C1 is much like any other motorcycle
in the event of a side impact.
In practical terms, the wind protection and overhead structure, plus the
seating arrangement and 50 litres of luggage capacity, are claimed to
eliminate vulnerability to most weather conditions.
BMW acknowledges there is 'not much chance' of the C1 going into commercial
production, but this is not wholly ruled out: BMW's Z1 plastic-bodied sports
car began life as a similar off-beat concept but was eventually put into
limited production.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Technology: Streets full of chaos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN JABEZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More in-car information may cut stress by enabling drivers to avoid crowded
routes and car parks, but it could also boost chaos on the roads.
Worried that motorists could be swamped by data on anything from traffic
snarls to local places of interest, the UK's Department of Transport has
commissioned a code of practice on car telephones, in-vehicle computers and
sophisticated route guidance systems.
With so much data, drivers could face a battery of dials and displays
similar to a small aircraft cockpit. But unlike a pilot, they will have only
a split second to scan the screens and take in the data.
The DoT agrees that additional real-time information will benefit motorists
on increasingly busy roads, but it does not want them crashing into each
other as they follow detailed electronic maps.
Jane Robertson, senior project officer at ICE Ergonomics, Loughborough
University, which is doing the DoT research, says the code, available in
draft form early in the New Year, will look particularly at the new hardware
likely to distract a driver from more than the briefest glance. The team
will assess such factors as the size of display screens, the number of words
in a display, the duration of messages and the presentation of graphics.
It will also look at the positioning of the hardware in terms of field of
vision, as well as whether drivers need to stretch from their seat to reach
the controls or see the displays. Additionally, Robertson says the type of
materials and the use of different types of controls also need be addressed.
Without proper guidelines, she says manufacturers could produce hardware
with rough edges or inappropriate materials, resulting in drivers receiving
severe body damage if an accident occurs.
Peter Williams of the DoT's driver information unit says the code will be
voluntary but expects all manufacturers will be keen to follow it for their
own marketing.
He claims the DoT is the first national transport department in Europe to
conduct such research, although the the idea has been welcomed by other
transport offices.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Union drops anti-Japanese stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MSF, THE general technical union, has signed a single-union, no-strike deal
with the Japanese company Toray Textiles Europe. The union once denounced
Japanese company councils and no-strike agreements as 'alien practices'.
Toray Textiles will soon open its third British plant at a greenfield site
in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, employing about 400 people.
MSF, the 600,000-strong union representing mainly white-collar and
professional staff, beat the GMB general union and Knitwear Workers Union to
secure the deal. It is the first it has signed for blue-collar workers.
The agreement includes a classic Japanese-style no-strike deal under which
failure to agree on pay or conditions will lead to external conciliation. If
unresolved, the dispute leads to 'pendulum arbitration' at Acas, the
conciliation service. Pendulum arbitration means the proposal of one side
must be chosen, but no compromise can be accepted.
Mr Roger Lyons, MSF general secretary, distanced himself yesterday from
comments made by his predecessor, Mr Ken Gill, at last year's TUC Congress
attacking Japanese company councils. 'I'm not going to be held accountable
for statements made in a personal capacity by my predecessor,' he said.
He emphasised that 'things are moving on' in other areas of union policy,
rejecting claims that MSF, along with other unions, was behaving
hypocritically over no-strike deals. He stressed that, unlike many such
deals, Toray is allowing the participation of full-time union officials on
the company council and union involvement in training.
The EETPU - the electrical section of the AEEU craft union, which was
criticised by other unions when it pioneered deals like the Toray one in the
early 1980s - took satisfaction from yesterday's announcement.
Mr Paul Gallagher, the electricians' leader, said: 'I'm surprised but
delighted that MSF have stopped seeing inward investors as 'aliens', which
was their previous policy.'
The return to the TUC of the electricians' section of the AEEU craft union
will probably be eased by the likely withdrawal of the non-TUC journalists'
union, the Institute of Journalists, from the Federation of Professional
Associations, run by the electricians section of the AEEU. The TUC
journalists' union, the National Union of Journalists, has been leading the
fight to keep the electricians out of the TUC because of its link with the
IOJ.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Arms software for Iraq 'was approved'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICL, THE UK-based computer manufacturer in which Fujitsu of Japan has a
majority stake, confirmed this week that three government departments
approved a 1989 move to supply an advanced computerised defence system to
the Iraq Ministry of Defence prior to the invasion of Kuwait.
The attempted sale, details of which are published today in the trade
newspaper Computer Weekly, is further evidence of relaxed government
attitudes towards the sale of military equipment to Iraq during the late
1980s.
ICL said yesterday that the deal, involving the ICL-developed Air Staff
Management Aid (Asma) command-and-control system - used by the allies during
the Gulf war - fell through for 'ordinary business reasons' long before the
onset of hostilities.
ICL obtained export licences for the Asma software in 1989 after detailed
discussions with the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office and the
Department of Trade and Industry.

FT  03 DEC 92 / February hint for Sunday trade reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESEARCH into the likely impact of Sunday trading reform is to be completed
by the end of next month, indicating that the government may decide to press
ahead with the proposed bill as early as February.
The research will form the basis of a study on the financial impact of the
three reform proposals that the government plans to include in the bill.
The analysis will be set out in an explanatory paper that the government has
promised to publish before the proposed legislation has its second Commons
reading.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, told Tory MPs last week they would be
offered a free vote on the three options, which range from full deregulation
of Sunday trading in England and Wales to a tightening of existing laws.
According to a covering letter signed by Mr Peter Lloyd, Home Office
minister, which has been sent to retailers asked to provide information for
the survey, the analysis will be of 'the impact on costs and prices, and on
employment and trading patterns' of each option.
London Economics, the company commissioned to conduct the research, is
seeking information from every retailer with an annual turnover of more than
Pounds 12m and from more than 250 single-outlet shops.
The timing of the study suggests that its results will not be available in
time for a private member's bill proposed by Labour's Mr Ray Powell. This
advocates the tightening of existing, widely flouted laws and is due to be
debated by MPs early next year.
New legislation must await a decision by the European Court on whether the
present law is overridden by the free-trade articles of the Treaty of Rome.
Mr Clarke said last week that the ruling was unlikely to be available before
next month. He made clear that work on getting the bill ready would proceed
before the EC judgment.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Matrix precedents withheld from MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR NICHOLAS Lyell, the attorney-general, last night declined to disclose
the legal precedents he considered in preparing his advice for ministers to
sign public-interest immunity certificates in relation to the Matrix
Churchill case.
Replying to Mr Mike O'Brien, Labour MP for Warwickshire North, in a
parliamentary written answer, Sir Nicholas said he had already told the
House of his 'legal advice on public-interest immunity'.
The question of precedents prompted angry clashes between Mr Robin Cook,
shadow trade and industry secretary, and Downing Street about three weeks
ago, with the government citing judicial rulings from 1846.
Sir Nicholas informed the Commons last month that when publication of
official documents was against the public interest ministers had to ask the
courts for their publication to be prevented.
Meanwhile, Mr John Major, the prime minister, has disclosed further details
of the briefing material supplied to him in preparation for his meeting with
Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's foreign minister, in late September 1989 when he was
foreign secretary.
Responding to a question from Mr Tam Dalyell, the veteran Labour MP, he said
his brief 'referred to British media interest in Iraqi procurement
activities in the United Kingdom, naming Learfan and Matrix Churchill as
examples'.
The meeting coincided with a burst of media interest in Iraqi procurement
activities after the exposure of the unauthorised disbursement of Iraqi
export credits by an Italian bank.
In further replies to written questions yesterday, Mr Major declined to
consent to all government documents made available to the Scott inquiry
being passed on to comparable investigations launched by the US Congress,
and revealed that ministers had signed a total of 15 public-interest
immunity certificates since June.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, turned down a request
from Mr Dalyell to make available to MPs a letter 'dated 20 June 1990 from
his predecessor's principal private secretary to the private secretary to
the chairman of the Commissioners for HM Customs and Excise'.
The letter was 'one of the documents disclosed to the defence for use in
connection with the Matrix-Churchill trial,' Mr Heseltine said.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major tables new proposals to break
deadlock over Danish ratification of the Maastricht treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major tabled new proposals last night designed to break the deadlock
over Danish ratification of the Maastricht treaty at next week's European
Community summit, Philip Stephens writes.
But the outlook for the Edinburgh meeting was simultaneously clouded by an
admission from Downing Street that the prime minister has been unable so far
to agree a time for pre-summit talks with president Francois Mitterrand.
British officials sought to play down the significance of the apparent snub
by Paris, insisting official contacts had established much agreement on main
summit issues.
As Mr Major returned from a three-day tour of European capitals, Downing
Street said its latest proposals were designed to meet Denmark's demands for
a dilution of its treaty commitments on defence, citizenship, interior and
justice issues and monetary union.
But the presidency compromise - framed in terms of a legal declaration  -
would respect the determination of other governments against renegotiation
of the treaty.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs warned over BR privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S railway equipment manufacturing industry is 'staring annihilation
in the face' because of the government's plans for the privatisation of
British Rail, MPs on the cross-party transport committee were told
yesterday.
Mr David Gillan, director of the Railway Industry Association, said 30,000
jobs might go between the middle of next year and the end of 1995 as orders
for rail equipment tailed off.
'It's not scare-mongering. It's not being alarmist. It's fact,' he said.
Mr Robert Adley, the Conservative backbencher who chairs the transport
committee, wrote to Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday,
urging the government to rethink its privatisation plans 'before more harm
is done'.
There was more gloomy news concerning both jobs and BR's investment plans as
a result of British Coal's proposed closure of 31 pits. The Engineering
Employers' Federation estimated that 15,000 engineering jobs will be lost if
the mines close.
Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, later told the employment committee, which is
inquiring into the employment consequences of the pit closures, that
Trainload Freight (TLF), BR's bulk freight subsidiary, was a big contributor
to BR's cashflow, enabling the company to reinvest in other areas.
He hinted that the change in TLF as a result of the closures could mean fare
rises, saying that to continue to invest 'we would have to find other ways
of cutting costs or increasing prices'.
TLF would lose 1,150 jobs directly, he said, with further losses to come
from the 'downsizing' of the business and the need to cut overheads.
Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation,
told the MPs that even taking into account the benefit from a greater
emphasis on gas to those of the organisation's members producing gas turbine
equipment, about 15,000 jobs in the engineering industry would go, leaving
perhaps fewer than 7,000 jobs.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Mines closed prior to privatisation
should be offered to employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINES CLOSED by British Coal prior to its privatisation should be offered to
employees to allow them to mine them under licence, Mr Roy Lynk,
representing the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, told MPs yesterday,
Michael Smith writes.
Mr Lynk, who lost the election for the union presidency this week, told the
trade and industry select committee that the mines should be offered as
going concerns before any action to close them.
The UDM told the committee that the coal market at power stations could
stabilise at 70m tonnes next year and 60m if action were taken to boost
demand.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Treasury hint on insider law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY has indicated to City institutions that it will consider
changing its widely criticised proposals for tougher rules on insider
dealing when MPs debate the legislation next year.
The government will face pressure in the House of Lords today over proposals
in the Criminal Justice Bill that many in the City fear define insider
dealing too broadly, outlawing some legitimate practices in the financial
markets.
The government will try to block amendments tabled by Lord Mottistone - a
Tory peer advised by the Confederation of British Industry - which it
regards as unworkable. But Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the
Treasury, has indicated that he will consider seriously any proposals for
change when the bill moves to the Commons - probably in January.
Under Lord Mottistone's proposals, the Treasury would be forced to publish
precise guidelines on the offence of insider dealing and exempt anybody who
followed the guidelines.
The bill, intended to align UK law with the European Community's insider
dealing directive, defines an 'insider' as anyone who has inside information
as a result of their employment, profession or duties. It is expected to
become law in May.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont bristles over Number 11
party
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN Lamont, the Chancellor, was attacked by Labour yesterday for using
11 Downing Street, his official home, for a Conservative party fundraising
event.
But Mr Lamont retorted that the only costs met from public funds for the
Number 11 party hosted by his wife would have been for security expenses. On
a letter to Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, he added by hand:
'Do grow up.'
Mrs Beckett said the event appeared 'to blur the historic distinction
between matters which relate to the operation of government and matters
which are party political.'
Mr Lamont replied: 'I am surprised that senior opposition politicians can
find nothing better to do with their time than to peddle mischievous
insinuations which simply distract attention from the important issues of
the day.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRESH attempt to give small companies a statutory right to interest when
their customers fail to settle bills within 30 days was launched in the
Commons yesterday by Mr Michael Bates (C Langbaurgh).
He said it was estimated that small businesses - defined as those employing
fewer than 20 people - were currently owed some Pounds 145bn in unpaid
bills.
Mr Bates was given leave to introduce a private member's bill providing for
interest, similar to that normally awarded by the courts, to be paid when
contractual debts were not settled within the 30-day period.

HM CUSTOMS &amp; EXCISE is to issue guidelines on what constitutes 'unacceptable
tax avoidance', Sir Brian Unwin, chairman, told the public accounts

It has been delayed by the difficulty in distinguishing avoidance from

Customs defined mitigation as attempts to reduce the tax burden within the

THREE QUARTERS of the Civil Service is set to become 'next steps' agencies,
operating at arm's length from central government departments by mid 1995,
Alison Smith writes.
But the annual report on the agencies, published yesterday, makes clear that
the government expects there to be little scope for creating further
agencies beyond that.
The most substantial - and controversial - of the 29 new candidates already
identified for agency status is the prison service, which employs 38,000
staff.
The planned timescale is that all candidates for agency status, perhaps a
further 30 to 50 beyond those already identified, should have been agreed
for change by the end of next year, and have been set up within the
following 18 months.
Announcing the report, Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister,
said that half the Civil Service - about 300,000 people - were already
working in agencies.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Row over union links fades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POTENTIALLY explosive review of Labour's links with the unions has been
temporarily disarmed with an agreement that several options may be presented
to the national executive in January, it emerged yesterday.
The compromise is intended to take the heat out of a fierce debate that, to
the alarm of Labour's image makers, had spilled over into newspaper reports
of deep-rooted divisions in the working party.
A widely leaked 'outline final report' of the 13-member committee had
fuelled the controversy by appearing to back reforms that fall well short of
those sought by those demanding a substantial reduction in union influence.
Supporters of less radical changes have been angered by what they believe to
have been a deliberate attempt by the 'modernisers' to use leaks to mobilise
press opinion against the working party's proposals.
The controversy has concentrated most acutely on a plan to allow union
members who pay the political levy to apply for 'registered supporter'
status, giving them the right to vote on the selection or de-selection of
MPs and for the party leadership.
A majority group on the committee is understood to back the plan while a
minority favours a simple one-member-one-vote system that would let only
full party members participate in ballots.
The draft paper also recommended that a 'third force' of MPs and MEPs be
allowed to vote at party conferences in addition to unions and constituency
parties.
The debate has also threatened to force Mr John Smith, the party leader, to
side with one faction or the other.
At a meeting of the committee yesterday, however, both sides agreed to a
compromise plan to submit an inconclusive paper.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Treasury hints on insider dealing
law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY has indicated to City institutions that it will consider
changing its widely criticised proposals for tougher rules on insider
dealing when MPs debate the legislation next year.
The government will face pressure in the Lords today over proposals in the
Criminal Justice Bill that many in the City fear define insider dealing too
broadly, outlawing some legitimate practices in the financial markets.
The government will try to block amendments tabled by Lord Mottistone - a
Tory peer advised by the Confederation of British Industry - which it
regards as unworkable. But Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the
Treasury, has indicated that he will consider seriously any proposals for
change when the bill moves to the Commons - probably in January.
Under Lord Mottistone's proposals, the Treasury would be forced to publish
precise guidelines on the offence of insider dealing and exempt anybody who
follows the guidelines.
The Treasury has been consulting widely with financial institutions on its
proposals since they were published in October. The bill, intended to align
UK law with the European Community's insider dealing directive, defines an
'insider' as anyone who has inside information as a result of their
employment, profession or duties. It is expected to become law in May.
Critics believe the measures might catch share analysts who are
traditionally briefed by companies about results. Institutions that
underwrite share issues may also be trapped if they have advance knowledge
of the issue - as may directors of companies who build a stake in another
company in advance of launching a takeover bid.

THE LENGTH of speeches on aspects of the government's Maastricht treaty

As Mr Bill Cash, the Tory MP, stood by to resume his 2 1/2-hour contribution

the issue of long speeches - the first of 11 points of order which began the

In the event, however, the Stafford MP resumed his seat after a mere 14

THREE QUARTERS of the Civil Service is set to have become 'next steps'
agencies, operating at arm's length from central government departments by

But the annual report on the agencies, published yesterday, makes clear that
the government expects there to be little scope for creating further

The most substantial - and controversial - of the 29 new candidates already
identified for agency status is the prison service, which employs some
38,000 staff.
Agencies already include parts of government that vary from Companies House
to the forensic science service, but the next wave of new agencies will
broaden that range even further, to include, for example, royal parks and
the meat hygiene service.
The planned timescale is that all candidates for agency status, perhaps a
further 30 to 50 beyond those already identified, should have been agreed
for change by the end of next year, and have been set up within the
following 18 months.
Announcing the report, Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister,
said that half the Civil Service - about 300,000 people - were already
working in agencies, and that 'we are beginning to see real improvements in
efficiency, productivity and value for money.'
The document shows that about three in four of the performance targets, some
of which have become harder since last year, were met by the agencies in
1991-92. That average covers a wide variation in performance among the 76
individual agencies.
The acceptance by the government that there is a ceiling on which government
activities can be turned into agencies reflects a mood among those dealing
with the changes in Whitehall that ministers believe that future emphasis
should lie with market-testing and contracting out.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Political Notebook: Mr Major's double-edged sword
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major cannot yet be sure whether next week's Edinburgh summit will
turn out to be a triumph or a disaster. Those in Whitehall prepared to quote
odds on a successful outcome suggest that they stand at present at slightly
worse than 50-50.
That may be deliberately over-cautious. It is in Britain's interests to play
down expectations; its partners meanwhile are not ready to reveal their full
hands.
The prime minister's tour of European capitals is judged by his officials to
have been a 'moderate success'. But, as at Maastricht a year ago, the most
important bargains can be struck only by heads of government.
Mr Major's principal hope for success rests on an assumption that has
nothing to do with the detailed agenda: that his European colleagues will
conclude they cannot afford to fail. Ratification of Maastricht has acted a
lightning conductor for popular disenchantment with the Community. With the
economic outlook ever more depressing, a row at Edinburgh would reinforce
the perception of the treaty as an indulgent irrelevance.
There is a practical dimension to the warning. It is being applied by the
British presidency as a none-too-subtle form of blackmail. The financial
markets, the argument runs, remain nervous and volatile - witness the latest
bout of speculation against the French franc.
The speculators are unconvinced still that central banks can hold the line
within the European exchange rate mechanism. What chance would the ERM have
if European leaders were seen to be incapable of agreement on the
Community's future?
It is a powerful argument - one that Britain believes has particular
resonance in Paris, Madrid, Lisbon and Dublin.
It is also a two-edged sword. Mr Major more than any other leader at
Edinburgh needs a political success. If Europe is judged to have failed,
then Britain will bear much of the oppropbrium.
The list of issues that must be resolved is formidable. As of yesterday, the
presidency could cite a dozen items that one government or another insists
should be on the agenda. Alongside the core internal issues - future
financing, Denmark, enlargement, the single market, subsidiarity and the
economy - are a range of smaller but potentially obstructive items. Germany,
for example, wants more seats in the European parliament. It is also
determined that the heads of government address seriously the issue of
nuclear safety in the former Communist bloc. Macedonia is demanding
recognition by the Community. Greece is threatening a walk-out if it is
given. All the summit leaders recognise they must be seen to be responding
to the unfolding human tragedy in Bosnia.
A crowded and complex agenda has obvious drawbacks. Deadlock on one issue
could hold up agreement on everything else. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, for example,
has indicated that the price of a deal with Denmark is a future financing
accord with lots of what British officials refer to disparagingly as
Spaingeld for Madrid. The eventual outcome may well depend on how obstinate
Mr Gonzalez is prepared to be.
Those two issues - the budget and exemptions to allow a second Maastricht
referendum in Denmark - are judged by the presidency to be the key to
success. Without an agreement on both, Edinburgh will be judged a failure.
The links offer advantages as well as drawbacks. They provide the scope for
trade-offs: compromise on one issue can buy a government concessions on
another. It is a form of negotiation at which Mr Major, a master of detail,
excels.
There are more hopeful signs than the public rhetoric suggests. France has
indicated privately that if Mr Major does not indulge in self-congratulation
it will not provoke a row at Edinburgh on the EC-US farm trade deal.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has told the prime minister that he will do his best
to ensure the summit is a success. British officials are confident that
disagreement over the scale of any economic recovery package can be finessed
by skilful drafting.
The southern states have rejected out of hand as miserly the budget
compromise proferred by Mr Major. Germany and the Netherlands insist it is
too generous. The presidency sees scope for technical adjustments in the
resources formula that might yet bring the two sides closer together.
British officials hope also their compromise position on Denmark will meet
Copenhagen's concerns while respecting the determination of others not to
reopen the treaty. It suggests a range of instruments to give Denmark the
opt-outs it seeks.
It might all yet unravel. European leaders have been known before to prefer
stubbornness to self-interest. Mr Major, however, will devote every ounce of
his energy to ensuring that they do not make that mistake again. He has as
much to lose personally as does the Community collectively.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major tabled new proposals last night designed to break the deadlock
over Danish ratification of the Maastricht treaty at next week's European
Community summit.
But the outlook for the Edinburgh meeting was simultaneously clouded by an
admission from Downing Street that the prime minister has been unable so far
to agree a time for pre-summit talks with French President Francois
Mitterrand.
Relations between the two leaders have been frosty since Mr Mitterrand
criticised last month Britain's handling of its EC presidency.
British officials sought to play down the significance of the apparent snub
by Paris, insisting that official contacts between the two sides had
established a large measure of agreement over the most prominent summit
issues.
As Mr Major returned from a three-day tour of European capitals, Downing
Street said its latest proposals were designed to meet Denmark's demands for
a dilution of its treaty commitments on defence, citizenship, interior and
justice issues and monetary union.
But the presidency compromise - framed in terms of a legal declaration  -
would respect also the insistence of other European governments that there
should be no re-opening of the treaty.
Speaking on Mr Major's return from talks with Mr Poul Schluter in
Copenhagen, the Danish prime minister, British officials said that the
British presidency was hopeful rather than optimistic of an overall deal at
the summit.
They warned that the North-South division within the Community over future
financing remained as wide as ever, with Spain in particular threatening to
block progress on other issues if its demands for more 'cohesion' funds were
blocked.
Mr Major will resume his tour of capitals at the weekend.

ONE INDEPENDENT body should set standards for and regulate both accountants
and auditors, a leading accountant says today.
Mr John Roques, senior partner and chief executive of Touche Ross, says in
the FT's accountancy column that removing these powers from the accountants'
professional bodies is the only way to restore public confidence.
He says that the Financial Reporting Council, which controls the Accounting
Standards Board and the Financial Reporting Review Panel, should also
control audit regulation, the Auditing Practices Board and ethical
guidelines for the accountancy profession.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Jaguar will make 200 redundant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER 200 workers will lose their jobs at Jaguar, Ford's luxury car
subsidiary, by the spring.
Most of the redundancies are expected to be compulsory because of the heavy
job cuts that have already been announced.
This year Jaguar has shed about 1,200 jobs, on top of nearly 4,000 last
year. It expects to produce only about 23,000 cars this year - less than
half peak levels of the 1980s, and 4,000 below the level forecast earlier
this year.
After the proposed job cuts Jaguar will be employing fewer than 7,000 people
 -less than 60 per cent of the 1990 level.
The latest cuts will be at the company's Radford plant near Birmingham,
which makes engines and axles and employs 700 people.
The cuts are the consequence of Jaguar deciding to source more components
from outside suppliers.
The production of axles will also be moved to the main vehicle assembly
plant nearby at Browns Lane over the Christmas period, involving the
transfer of 100 jobs.
Next summer another 40 jobs will be lost at Radford when the 'dressing' of
engines - the fitting of the basic engines with fuel injection and other
systems - is transferred to Browns Lane.
With Jaguar's new AJ26 engine still under development - it is expected to be
produced at Ford's main engine plant at Bridgend, south Wales - the reduced
activities at Radford will leave about 45 acres of the site redundant. It
will be either redeveloped or sold off.
Jaguar said yesterday the latest measures would save the company about
Pounds 2.5m a year at a time when, in spite of its troubles, Jaguar was
maintaining an investment programme designed to create a new range of cars
from the mid 1990s onwards.
Jaguar made a pre-tax loss last year of Pounds 226m compared with a Pounds
66.2m loss in 1990.
It has, however, maintained investment at about 9 per cent of turnover, a
level the company says is the highest of any vehicle maker.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Accountants approve strict ethical rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANCY FIRMS will not be able to conduct specialist valuations for
their audit clients under strict ethical guidelines approved yesterday.
Firms will also be required to contact the existing auditor if they are
approached by a company to provide a second opinion on an accounting
standard, the council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England
and Wales said.
The two guidance notes, which come into force on February 1, were introduced
by the Chartered Accountants Joint Ethics Committee, representing the
English Institute and its equivalents in Scotland and Ireland.
Their ratification follows several months of consultation. Only one of the
leading six accounting firms - believed to be Coopers &amp; Lybrand - opposed
the specialist valuations guideline.
The note aims to remove any apparent threat to objectivity of the audit by
preventing auditors providing actuarial valuations, or valuations of other
assets such as intellectual property, brands, other intangible assets,
property and unquoted investments.
The note on second opinions or 'opinion shopping' is designed to prevent
companies hunting for support from the profession when their auditor refuses
to approve a particular accounting treatment.
It ensures that the second firm approached possesses the full information
available to the company's auditor before it passes judgment.
The council also yesterday voted to approve additional openness in its
disciplinary hearings. It ratified suggestions for greater disclosure of
judgments, but has stalled proposals that would lead to open hearings on
matters of public interest.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Cadbury may add to audit fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCRUTINY of companies' compliance with the Cadbury code of corporate
governance may add at least 10 per cent to audit fees, a leading accountant
said yesterday.
Meanwhile, the Department of Trade and Industry confirmed that it will be
considering the changes in the law recommended by the Cadbury committee.
The details came as executives and professionals digested the final
recommendations of the committee on the financial aspects of corporate
governance, chaired by Sir Adrian Cadbury, which were published on Tuesday.
The Cadbury committee said that all quoted companies will be required as
part of the Stock Exchange's listing requirements to make a statement in
their annual reports from next June that they comply with the code, or state
where they differ from it. The committee also recommended that auditors
should also be required to ensure that a company's statement is accurate.
Mr Roger Davis, head of audit at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm,
said the additional audit fee for conducting this service might be 10 per
cent to 15 per cent, although he emphasised that this had to contrasted with
the sharp reductions in audit fees over the past few years.
The Cadbury committee focused on issues of best practice, but also
recommended three changes in the law: that audit and non-audit fees paid by
a company to its auditor should be clearly disclosed in the accounts; that
statutory protection to report fraud should be provided to auditors of all
companies; and that directors' contracts should be limited to three years
without shareholder approval.
Mr Nigel Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs, said: 'The fundamental
issue is raising professional business standards rather than regulation.'
But he added he would now 'carefully consider the recommendations addressed
to government'.
The DTI said that greater disclosure of auditors' fee could be introduced
through a statutory instrument. The other two changes would require primary
legislation, which would be considered as part of the comprehensive review
of the 1985 Companies Act it announced last month.
The auditing profession had made strong representations to the Cadbury
committee, arguing that it would not be feasible to scrutinise the code to
ensure that companies were complying.
Mr Bill Morrison, chairman of the Auditing Practices Board, which will
produce guidelines on auditing the code, said yesterday that it would be
feasible to audit the more limited, quantifiable aspects of the code
highlighted in the final version of the report.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Rise in reserves surprises City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK'S official gold and foreign currency reserves rose an underlying
Dollars 86m last month. The figures, released by the Treasury yesterday,
surprised City economists, who had forecast another fall.
In September and October the reserves fell quite sharply, reflecting heavy
spending by the Bank of England on September 16 in a vain attempt to prop up
the pound.
The official reserve figures are not necessarily a good guide to official
intervention on the foreign exchanges. The Bank is able to shroud
intervention levels by borrowing on the foreign exchange forward market.
Those loans can be rolled over indefin-itely.
The Bank also made borrowings from other European central banks before Black
Wednesday, which do not have to be paid back until the middle of December.
Mr John Shepperd, economist at SG Warburgs Securities, said: 'The rise of
Dollars 86m tells us nothing about what has been going on in terms of
intervention. To look to the official reserves for guidance is a lost
cause.'
The underlying change excludes a number of factors, such as Ecu Treasury
bill proceeds. The Treasury figures showed that the overall level of the
reserves fell by Dollars 51m, bringing the total to Dollars 42.09bn at the
end of November, compared with Dollars 42.14bn at the end of October.
Analysts believe that the full amount spent by the Bank in mid September may
not be known until the middle of next year.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Industry rejects pay norm proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry has rejected suggestions that the
private sector should be liable to the 1.5 per cent pay norm the government
wants to impose on the public sector.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, said public-sector pay rose
20 per cent in the past two years while that of the private sector increased
only 14 per cent.
'It would not be reasonable to expect the private sector slavishly to follow
the public-sector model in the next year,' he said.
Mr Davies distanced himself from suggestions by some ministers that
public-sector pay restraint might act as an example for the private sector.
He warned, however, that the competitive advantage handed to UK exporting
companies by the devaluation of sterling would be squandered unless unit
labour costs continued to be reduced.
Mr Davies told East Midlands business leaders in Nottingham yesterday that
pay rates should be determined by the profitability and productivity of
individual companies. A 1.5 per cent rise for the one in seven manufacturing
companies already in a pay freeze would therefore be inappropriate, he said.
Mr Davies said the engineering industry's total pay bill last year increased
by 1 per cent, although average earnings rose by 6 per cent with a 5 per
cent fall in employment.
'To return to a system of pay norms in the private sector would be a
severely retrograde step,' Mr Davies said.

BRITAIN is still midway in the OECD league table of strikes, the latest

From 1987 to 1991 the number of days lost through strikes in the UK was 70
per cent lower than in the previous five years. That was substantially
better that the OECD average of a 30 per cent reduction.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Scrapping Thorp plant 'may cost Pounds 3bn'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANCELLATION of British Nuclear Fuel's plans for reprocessing nuclear waste
may cost Britain up to Pounds 3bn, the director in charge of the project
said yesterday.
Mr David Bonser, director of BNF's Thorp plant at Sellafield, said Britain
would lose Pounds 900m in future earnings from overseas, and the state-owned
company or government might have to pay back 'a good whack' of the Pounds
2bn foreign customers paid in advance if the Pounds 2.8bn plant was
abandoned.
'There's no question that millions of pounds would be due under contracts
with customers,' Mr Bonser said - and possibly all of it, depending on the
outcome of legal action. BNF said that if Thorp did not go ahead Sellafield
would shut after 10 years when present contracts ended.
Mr Bonser said Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution had told BNF that
there were no 'safety, technical, or waste management reasons' why the plant
should not start operation.
The Thorp plant, which has taken 10 years to build, was due to start
processing spent nuclear fuel from nuclear reactors in the UK and overseas
within two weeks.
The start of operations has been on hold since a delay in authorising new
levels of radioactive emissions by the inspectorate. BNF fears the
inspectorate's two-month public consultation period, ending mid January,
might be followed by a public inquiry lasting months. That might jeopardise
the future of the plant. Mr Bonser said Touche Ross, the consultancy firm,
had calculated that if Thorp were abandoned Britain would lose Pounds 900m
in future earnings from overseas customers, after taking into account
Thorp's running costs.
Britain might have to compensate foreign customers for the change of plans,
and would be obliged to send back the 2,500 tonnes of foreign radioactive
fuel
Cancelling such an expensive high-technology project has so far appeared
politically unthinkable.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Reform of credit-card law urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
URGENT REFORM of the law covering credit cards is needed to clear up
uncertainties about the protection offered to consumers who use credit cards
to buy goods or services that turn out to be defective, the Law Society,
which represents solicitors, said yesterday.
A cardholder who buys a ticket from an airline that collapses before the
ticket has been used can recover the cost of the ticket from the card issuer
under the terms of the 1974 Consumer Credit Act.
For goods or services costing between Pounds 100 and Pounds 30,000 the act
gives cardholders the same legal rights for breach of contract or
misrepresentation against the issuer of the card as the seller.
The society says in many situations it is now uncertain whether the
protection exists. The most common is where there is no direct link in the
form of a contract between the card issuer and the seller.
That occurs because most retailers now have a single payment-handling
agreement with one card issuer, which handles all card payments to the
retailer for all other card issuers.
Where another card issuer's card is used there are four parties to the
transaction: the card issuer; the retailer; the issuer handling payments;
and the cardholder.
The 1974 act was designed to cover only three party transactions -
debtor/creditor/supplier agreements. It is not clear whether it applies to
transactions involving four parties. Card issuers say it does not.
Another area of uncertainty relates to use of credit cards abroad. The
society says no one knows whether protection is limited to transactions in
the UK. It says consumers can find the protection they thought they had does
not exist. That leads to resentment and distress and costly disputes with
card issuers.
The society says reform is urgently needed to ensure the law provides the
protection it was designed to give.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Lego plans to open attraction on Windsor Safari Park
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGO, THE Danish toys group, plans to open a DKr600m (Pounds 63.4m) family
amusement attraction on the site of the Windsor Safari Park, which closed in
October, Hilary Barnes and Michael Skapinker write.
The 24.7-acre park, which will open in 1996, will be modelled on Lego's
successful Legoland amusement park in Jutland (above). The Windsor park will
be the first Lego amusement park outside Denmark, but Lego plans other parks
in Europe and the US. Themes International, the private leisure concern that
owned Windsor Safari Park, went into receivership in January. Several
leisure groups, including First Leisure, the discotheque, ten-pin bowling
and tourist attractions group, are thought to have been interested in the
park.
Lego expects the Windsor park to attract about 1.2m visitors a year,
requiring the employment of 500 to 600 people during the April to October
season. The Danish Legoland park is the most visited tourist attraction in
Denmark outside Copenhagen, attracting about 1.2m people a year. It is built
up around model villages and models of well known monuments built in Lego
bricks.
The Windsor park will not be a straight copy of Legoland. The company said:
'There will be a degree of adjustment to its British surroundings and
further development of the Lego philosophy in relation to high-quality
family experience, with a focus on imagination, creativity, safety and
educational values.'
Lego, a family-owned company, is one of the world's leading toymakers with a
published turnover of about DKr4.4bn last year, but its world-wide turnover,
which is not published, is significantly higher.

FT  03 DEC 92 / No appeal for tax rebellion in Epsom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STORIES of council tax chaos and imminent rebellion in the Home Counties are
wildly exaggerated, if yesterday's placid atmosphere in Epsom Town Hall is
any indication.
With council tax bandings just released, few residents who dropped in to
find out their band were either clamouring to appeal or furious at their
likely average bill of Pounds 620, which is less than the average houshold
is paying in poll tax.
'If you think about it, councils need the same amount of money as before, so
we won't escape it', was a typical response, voiced by Mr Charles Jarman,
who paid Pounds 95,000 for a house now worth Pounds 88,000. Like most
others, he does not intend to appeal, although his house has been put in
Band E, which starts at Pounds 88,000.
The borough's treasurer, Mr Trevor Willington, is relaxed about the public
response.
He said: 'There will obviously be appeals, but people can't appeal until
next April, after they get their bills, and when they realise that the gap
between the central bands is not much over Pounds 100, I doubt we'll have
too much fuss.'
The Borough of Epsom and Ewell is a fair barometer of the south-east,
outside London. Its northern parts - including Worcester Park, where Mr John
Major grew up - are outer suburbia, mostly band D (Pounds 68,000-Pounds
88,000) territory. Move south towards the green belt and band E and F
properties abound. Few households are at the extremes - the borough has just
57 properties in band A and 120 in band H.
Most residents calling at the town hall seemed happy with the council tax
and their banding. Even the disgruntled ones were unsure whether to appeal.
Mr Patrick Webb, a sales director with a Pounds 60,000 flat, said: 'It's a
Catch-22 situation. If you try to get your property into a lower band, it
may backfire when you try to sell it.'
One council officer said she would 'certainly' appeal against her own band F
(Pounds 120,000 to Pounds 160,000) valuation for a house bought for Pounds
115,000 in November 1987, but said: 'I am very surprised one cannot appeal
until April '93. I guess the thought is that a lot of people will have
cooled off before then.'
Mr Willington said he was 'struck that most people are finding themselves on
the band they expected'. The council was not using council tax to boost
spending but was anxious to move down to the government's assessment of what
it should be spending. It was planning to reduce its budget from Pounds 6m
to Pounds 5.6m.
A pensioner caught the Epsom mood: 'The poll tax was shocking. Now they have
swung the other way, but you will never find a truly fair system.'

FT  03 DEC 92 / London launches tourist campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 2.2M PUBLICITY campaign to attract high-spending visitors to London
was launched yesterday by 40 private and public-sector organisations, with
the backing of film and sports personalities including Elizabeth Taylor,
Sophia Loren, Roger Moore and Steffi Graf.
The campaign, aimed at visitors from the US and UK, is supported by British
Airways, American Express, the Forte hotel group, Harrods, Marks and
Spencer, the British Tourist Authority and several London museums and other
attractions.
Based on the slogan 'It's not only Londoners who love London', the campaign
will rely on newspaper and magazine advertising, direct mail and Prodigy - a
shopping service linking 1.8m personal computer users in the US.
The film and sports personalities have agreed to appear in the
advertisements and publicity material.
The London Tourist Board, one of the campaign organisers, said tourists
comprised 25 per cent of London Underground passengers, 40 per cent of West
End theatre audiences and 25 per cent of taxi passengers. They accounted for
17 per cent of Oxford Street spending.
More than 7 per cent of London's working population is employed in tourism,
which last year earned Pounds 4.4bn.
The Pounds 2.2m will be spent over six months. The campaign will then be
extended for an additional 2 1/2 years.

FT  03 DEC 92 / 'Usury' is denied by NatWest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD ALEXANDER of Weedon, chairman of National Westminster Bank, told MPs
yesterday that the bank charged 36.6 per cent interest on unauthorised
overdrafts to small businesses, but rejected an accusation that this
amounted to 'usury'.
The charge was levelled by Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat Treasury
spokesman, at a hostile session with the cross-party Commons Treasury and
Civil Service committee.
Lord Alexander said: 'The rates reflect the lack of desirability where the
customer borrows unilaterally. They are a deterrent. There is no other
industry where the customer can help themselves.'
He told the committee that the charges were widely publicised by businesses,
and that unauthorised borrowing had reduced by 30 per cent since they were
introduced in June last year.
In answer to Mr Beith's remark that customers were charged arrangement fees
when they exceeded their overdraft and negotiated to reduce it, Lord
Alexander said: 'We have to have regard to the costs.' He emphasised that
the bank needed to consider the risks when lending to businesses during
recession.
He also said that there was a 'strong case' for charging customers based on
their demands for individual services, and said the bank was keeping its
policies on the subject under review.
In a lengthy submission to the committee NatWest said that many of the
allegations of banks' treatment of small businesses were 'unsubstantiated
and misplaced' and damaging to relationships with these companies.
NatWest said it lent Pounds 11bn to 1m small-business accounts, representing
28 per cent of the sector in the UK.
One quarter of its small-business accounts were continuously overdrawn and a
quarter fluctuated between debit and credit, with the rest always in credit.
It said customers with base-rate-linked borrowings received corresponding
reductions in interest charges 'immediately and in full', while those with
fixed rates were set against a longer view of what base rates would be.
It said account charges had increased at or below the rate of inflation and
lending-related charges were increased to reflect higher costs of monitoring
customers' accounts.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Commissions for brokers falling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE amount of commissions paid to UK stockbrokers is continuing to fall,
even though the commission rates they charge have stabilised in recent
years, according to research published by the London Stock Exchange
yesterday.
The exchange's latest annual survey of the costs of share trading in the UK
shows that far more trades are being carried out net (free of commission).
Also, many involve part of the commission being refunded to the investor -
known as 'soft commission' arrangements.
Nearly a third of all trades by value do not involve the payment of any
commissions at all, the exchange's research shows.
That is up from around a quarter in 1991. Soft commissions, meanwhile,
account for 12 per cent to 13 per cent of stock exchange turnover, according
to industry estimates quoted in the research.
Institutional investors are negotiating more actively to make sure they get
keener prices when trading - eating into the profits of market-makers.
About 55 per cent of trades worth more than Pounds 100,000 are conducted
inside the 'touch', or quoted price, pointing to negotiation over the price.
For overseas equity trades, 60 per cent more are done inside the touch.
The average commission rate paid by institutions, meanwhile, was 0.24 per
cent, down marginally from the 0.26 per cent in 1991 but close to the
average level of around 0.25 per cent paid since 1988.
The research, to be published next week in the exchange's quarterly review,
shows that overseas investors and individuals have become less active
traders since the end of 1980s.
Overseas investors now account for 11 per cent of UK equity turnover, half
what it was two years ago, while individual investors' share of trading has
fallen from a high of 27 per cent in the 1980s to 14 per cent.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Arrest of Nissan UK defendant sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WARRANT for the arrest of Mr Tore Arne Thorsen, a defendant in the
forthcoming Nissan UK tax fraud trial, was issued yesterday. He is refusing
to return to the UK from Norway to face prosecution.
Mr Thorsen, the managing director of the Norwegian shipping agency Scansiris
AS, is due to stand trial in March next year, charged with helping prepare
false invoices which understated the profits of Nissan UK by Pounds 100m.
Mr Thorsen wrote to the trial judge last week announcing his refusal to
appear in court for his trial.
His move means that only Mr Michael Hunt, former assistant managing director
of Nissan UK, and Mr Frank Shannon, a former finance director of the
company, are now likely to face trial next March. Both deny charges of
corporation tax fraud.
A warrant has also been issued for the arrest of Mr Octav Botnar, the former
chairman of Nissan UK. He is now in Switzerland and is refusing to return to
the UK. The Inland Revenue is unable to extradite him back to the UK.
The Inland Revenue said after yesterday's hearing that it was considering
the possibilities of bringing extradition proceedings against Mr Thorsen.
However, extradition from Norway for alleged tax offences present big
difficulties for UK prosecutors.
In his letter to Mr Justice Gatehouse, Mr Thorsen wrote that having seen the
prosecution's case: 'I have decided not to partake in this case any more'.
He claimed the prosecution brought by the Inland Revenue was 'disturbingly
fragmented, lacking in substance, tilted and myopic'.
Mr Thorsen has dropped his British lawyers and is refusing to discuss his
case with any representative of the UK legal system.
Mr Peter Rook QC, for the Inland Revenue, told the judge yesterday that Mr
Thorsen had been warned of yesterday's hearing and the consequences of his
non-attendance.

DAILY Mirror journalists are to hold talks with Mr David Banks, their new
editor, shortly on a range of issues, including the sacking of 100 casuals.
The agreement to negotiate follows a consultative ballot, in which 101 Daily
Mirror journalists voted in favour of industrial action. Although there was
a clear majority in favour of action, 69 voted against.
A further ballot needs to be held before industrial action is taken. If the
National Union of Journalists calls for industrial action it appears it will
be for a work to contract instead of a strike.
NUJ representatives will meet Mr Banks to negotiate three issues:
The reinstatement of casuals who were summarily dismissed.
The terms of new a contract drawn up for those who work on the Sunday Mirror
and The People.
People being moved to different departments without consultation.
Mr Trevor Davis, an NUJ official at the Daily Mirror, said last night: 'We
hope that something positive will come out of these negotiations.'
Apart from re-hiring the sacked casuals, Daily Mirror journalists are
concerned about new personal contracts for the Sunday editions.
Mr Paul Vickers, assistant managing director and company secretary of TV-am,
will become company secretary and group legal director of Mirror Group
Newspapers.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Kandinsky sketch realises Pounds 5.5m: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KANDINSKY'S 'Sketch I for Composition VII', one of the most important works
by the artist to appear on the market for 30 years, sold on target for
Pounds 5.5m at Sotheby's in London on Tuesday evening.
'Sketch I' is the most resolved of six oil studies for the artist's
innovative abstract 'Composition VII', now in the Tretyakov Gallery in
Moscow. This turbulent composition of volatile forms and searing reds and
sour yellows was executed nine months before the outbreak of the First World
War. The sketch was given by Kandinsky to the artist Paul Klee and consigned
to auction by his grandson.
Other works by the artist also fared well. 'Arrow Toward the Circle' went to
a Swiss buyer for Pounds 506,000 and an early, untitled watercolour exceeded
its upper estimate by selling for Pounds 290,000.
This is now a predominantly private market, and Sotheby's was encouraged by
the active bidding on many of the lots. The sale totalled almost Pounds
12.5m, with 81.8 per cent sold, by value. Yesterday's part II sale made
Pounds 1.9m, with 38.9 per cent by value bought in.
At Christie's yesterday Mr David Tunick, a New York dealer, paid Pounds
660,000 for a series of 100 etchings and aquatints by Picasso dating
1930-37, known as 'La Suite Vollard'. The last Vollard suite of Picasso
prints to appear at auction, at Sotheby's in New York in 1982, realised a
quarter of the price.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Shipyard closure to cost 900 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VSEL gave up its attempts to sell the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead
yesterday and announced that the yard would close in July, with the loss of
900 jobs.
VSEL bought Cammell Laird for Pounds 1 in 1986 in a management buy-out from
British Shipbuilders. Its Birkenhead yard has largely concentrated on
building diesel-electric submarines, while its yard at Barrow-in-Furness,
Cumbria, has concentrated on nuclear submarines. The work at both yards has
fallen off since the end of the cold war, and work on the last Upholder
class submarine at the Merseyside yard will be completed in June.
Cammell Laird has been an essential part of Merseyside's economy for more
than 100 years and had one of the area's few large concentrations of skilled
labour. Two years ago it employed 2,000 people.
The best hope for the yard's survival had been that Amec, the construction
and civil engineering group, would buy it to help exploit the natural gas
discovered in Liverpool Bay by Hamilton Oil, the US group.
That depended on Hamilton's getting approval to build a gas terminal at
Point of Air on the Welsh side of the Dee estuary. Gas would have been piped
from the terminal to fire a new power station at Connah's Quay, just over
the Welsh border from Chester. The planning application for the terminal was
referred to a public inquiry last March after protests by environmental
groups.
Mr Noel Davies, chief executive of VSEL, said yesterday: 'Prevarication over
the Liverpool Bay project has been one of three reasons we have been forced
to announce closure. It seems many people in the Wirral are more concerned
about a pretty skyline as they look across to north Wales than they are for
the jobs of the lads at Cammell Laird.'
Another reason was failure to secure help from the EC's intervention fund,
which helps shipbuilding areas.
Mr Davies said the third reason was that the recession meant VSEL had been
unable to sell the yard, which it believed could have been broken up for a
variety of engineering uses. He said he hoped the site could be converted to
mixed use, including residential and industrial developments.
Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, said that was 'absolutely potty'.
He is arranging meetings between union leaders and the cross-party group of
all Wirral MPs next week, and hopes for meetings with Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, and with Mr John Major, the prime minister.
He said the aim would be to put Cammell Laird's ownership into trust while
further efforts were made to attract investment.
His suggestion that the trustee might be the Merseyside Development
Corporation, a government agency, was rejected by the GMB general union.

'SERIOUSLY now. Let's start governing the country,' was the caption under a
cartoon of Brazil's President Itamar Franco addressing his cabinet on the
front page of a Brazilian newspaper this week.
Ignoring the country's desperate need for direction, Mr Franco has opted to
put governing on hold until the Senate judgment on suspended President
Fernando Collor on December 18, expected to confirm his impeachment.
Tuesday night's decision to call off negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund over a new accord was the strongest evidence of the confusion
within the two-month-old administration, which has paralysed the country.
The querulous Mr Franco has cancelled a planned address to the nation,
delayed a new wage policy and dithered over privatisation. Last week he
cancelled a privatisation by fax and issued a decree putting himself in
control of all prices in order to be able to readjust tariffs below
inflation - in direct contradiction of IMF recommendations.
His rejection of the orthodox economic programme elaborated by Mr Gustavo
Krause and Mr Paulo Haddad, the economy and planning ministers, because it
was 'too Collorite' almost caused the two men to quit last weekend.
Not only has Brazil failed to meet the targets of the Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds
1.4bn) accord signed in January, there seems little prospect of improvement.
Inflation has been more than 22 per cent a month for the last year, the
fiscal deficit is estimated at 7 per cent of GDP, domestic debt is at its
highest since 1989, and tax receipts are down 25 per cent. GDP per capita
has fallen 10 per cent since 1990.
Financial institutions are in chaos. The Federal Savings Bank has a Dollars
21bn hole. Petrobras, the state oil monopoly, is raising costly short-term
money to cover Dollars 5bn owed by the government and other state companies.
Mr Murilo Portugal, the Treasury secretary, says the government's cash
situation is critical.
The lack of policy definition has destroyed hope of a rapid economic
turnaround. Consultants are revising forecasts downwards weekly and the
government research institute IPEA has changed its projections from a 2.5
per cent growth in GDP to a 1.5 per cent fall, despite an expected trade
surplus of Dollars 15.5bn.
This is the backdrop to the economics team's reluctance to re-open talks
with the IMF. The official reason for the delay was the congressional
impasse over a Dollars 12bn fiscal reform project crucial to balance next
year's budget. The project is unlikely to pass this year.
Congress has already slipped back into its old combination of inactivity and
pandering to vested interests, slapping 72,000 amendments onto next year's
budget. Bills on intellectual property, patents, and private concession of
public services are all stalled, while a much-needed port deregulation has
retreated.
This year had been seen as crucial for stabilisation because the next two
years will be taken up with a referendum on the political system, a
constitutional revision and elections for congressmen, senators, governors
and president.
The hope is that after the definitive judgment on Mr Collor, Mr Franco will
begin tackling the array of economic problems. But Mr Luiz Padovani of
Trevisan consultants, says: 'This may be wishful thinking. The great fear is
that after December 18 we will see Itamar's real nationalist face.'

Mr Luis Pinerua Ordaz, minister of the interior, said the government hoped
to restore the rights to freedom from arbitrary arrest and the inviolability
of the home before state and local elections on December 6.
President Carlos Andres Perez, the target of two coup attempts this year,

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE's 11 leading telecommunications equipment suppliers have warned the
Brussels Commission that they will be at a disadvantage against North
American and Japanese competition when the single market opens next month,
unless the EC acts.
The European Information Technology Round Table, chaired by Alcatel Alsthom
of France, has asked Brussels to negotiate fair access to non-European
markets before January 1, when an EC directive to create free competition in
public procurement for telecommunications equipment comes into force.
'Why should we open European markets to competition from outside Europe
without getting anything in return?' said Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of
Alcatel Alsthom.
The directive obliges public purchasing authorities to buy from the cheapest
source, almost irrespective of origin. They may discriminate in favour of
European suppliers only if the European tender is less than 3 per cent above
the cheapest foreign offer.
Member states had asked the Commission to negotiate the same freedoms for EC
suppliers in non-European markets, under the principle of reciprocity. Yet
the round table - which includes Siemens and Daimler-Benz of Germany,
Philips of the Netherlands, and Olivetti of Italy - complains that Brussels
has failed to obtain such a deal. It says the directive should be delayed
until Brussels does so, or only apply to foreign suppliers from countries
with reciprocity agreements with the EC.
Telecommunication operators in the key non-European markets own or control
their principal suppliers, while vertical integration of this kind barely
exists in Europe.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Patents pirates 'still dodging the rules': US complaints
over enforcement of anti-counterfeiting measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR years after the US Congress passed tough legislation aimed at foreign
piracy and counterfeiting, American companies complain that they are still
losing billions of dollars because of inadequate protection of intellectual
property rights by other governments.
'The improvements have been marginal,' says Mr Johannes von Schilcher,
executive director of the International Anticounterfeiting Coalition (IACC).
'The US trade representative moves in and gets a wonderful agreement on
paper, which everyone signs. They promise the world, but whatever they
promise, they put into place for about six months and then everyone forgets
about it.'
The coalition represents more than 100 of the largest US exporters,
including American Brands, Time-Warner, IBM, the Motion Picture Association
of America, Monsanto and Walt Disney. The companies are urging the US
government to provide more manpower to monitor international agreements and
fight the increasingly sophisticated pirates of everything from bogus birth
control pills and Levi Strauss blue jeans to counterfeit brake linings and
machine parts.
Mr von Schilcher says the US has made 'significant progress' through the use
of the 'Special 301' section of the 1988 trade law in getting countries to
sign agreements. 'But the US needs to hold their feet to the fire' to ensure
enforcement of those pacts.
Special 301 directs the US trade representative to 'name names' of those
countries failing to protect intellectual property rights. After
negotiations, sanctions can be imposed, but it has only once come to that.
Last year when India refused to protect pharmaceutical and chemical patents,
Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative slashed Dollars 60m worth of
Indian products from the US duty-free preference scheme for poor countries.
This, she said, was 'meant to be a rifle shot absolutely focused' on the
beneficiaries of patent theft.
Mostly countries have succumbed to US pressure once they are named.
Indonesia never made it on to the list but cut a deal with Hollywood film
makers to avoid the disgrace. The other Asian tigers have fallen into line,
one by one.
China - in 1991 named the worst offender for protecting neither product nor
process patents, copyrights, trademarks or trade secrets - gave in last
January. It promised to improve protection of computer software, sound
recordings, pharmaceuticals and agri-chemicals, to join the Berne Copyright
Convention and the Geneva Phonogram Convention, and to grant copyright
protection for 50 years.
While companies have been impressed by these successes, they say there has
been little follow-up. Mr von Schilcher cites South Korea, which in 1989 was
removed from the list of worst offenders after agreeing to amend its laws to
give broader protection to intellectual property rights and to step up
enforcement.
In the first year after the agreement, US Customs seizures of counterfeit
merchandise from Korea dropped dramatically, but in 1992, they began to
rise, approaching the levels of 1989. 'Merchandise seized by Customs is the
tip of the iceberg since Customs only examines a small portion of the
merchandise entering the US,' Mr von Schilcher said.
Eight trade associations represented by the International Intellectual
Property Alliance (IIPA) are so frustrated by Taiwan's failure to cope with
copyright pirates, that it has vowed to oppose its membership in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
In particular the IIPA complains that Taiwan encouraged the financing and
construction of seven compact disc manufacturing plants, which allegedly use
their excess capacity to manufacture pirate CDs for export. The pirated
products have appeared in the Middle East, Africa and Europe 'distorting the
legitimate market in these regions'.
The IIPA is also calling for government action in Latin America, where
pirates are cutting into the profits from US films, music, audio recordings,
computer software and books.
A US trade official said the administration had been working hard to improve
enforcement of promised laws but 'all these things work in fits and starts'.
Governments tried to put local pirates out of business but the pirates were
well organised and often dangerous.
Although multinational rules on intellectual property rights might be agreed
in the Uruguay Round, the fight against pirates is likely to get tougher,
the official said. 'The more technology changes, the easier it becomes to
steal the stuff.'

FT  03 DEC 92 / World Trade News: New start on international steel talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS on a multilateral steel accord, broken off in acrimony last
March, will resume on December 9-10 in Geneva, according to Mr Michael
Moskow, the deputy US trade representative.
The aim of the talks, involving 30 steel-producing countries, is to reach
agreement on ending all steel production subsidies and dumping in foreign
markets.
Speaking at a forum in Washington yesterday, Mr Moskow said the US wanted to
break the cycle in which its own industry filed dumping and subsidy cases
and foreign producers, under the pressure of high import duties, then agreed
to market sharing arrangements.
'We need something that eliminates the cause of the problems,' he said. The
ultimate intent would be to create a free market in steel.
US and EC officials - along with representatives from Japan, South Korea,
Australia, Sweden and Brazil - met quietly in October in Paris during a
meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. They
agreed to push for a resumption of the talks, which broke up when the US and
the European Community could not agree what subsidies ought to be exempted
from domestic trade law actions.
Next week's meeting is intended to be a stock-taking session, according to a
US trade official. The US was looking for suggestions on
'confidence-building measures', he said.
He added that the US hoped to keep the negotiations separate from the 74
dumping and subsidy cases now moving through the Commerce Department and the
International Trade Commission. The EC has objected vehemently to initial
Commerce Department findings announced on Monday which could result in steep
dumping duties on flat-rolled steel from Italy, Spain, France, Britain and
eight other states.
The official said that 'there would be no explicit linkage between the talks
and the cases'. The latter would not even be discussed in a multilateral
framework.
He said, however, that he expected countries to seek negotiated political
settlements next year; August was the deadline because that was when the
trade cases would be completed. Final duties, once imposed, were likely to
be permanent, he said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE growth of world merchandise trade has slackened in the second half of
1992 after rising by an annual 5 per cent in the first half, according to
preliminary estimates by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
Giving the figures yesterday to Gatt's annual meeting in Geneva, Mr Lars
Anell, the meeting's chairman, said the 'somewhat downbeat assessment' for
the past few months reflected weak demand in western Europe and Japan.
Mr Anell, formerly Sweden's ambassador to Gatt and now the country's
representative in Brussels, said a successful conclusion to the Uruguay
Round would provide a much-needed boost to the world economy.
International trade has been in the doldrums since the boom year of 1988.
Last year growth in volume terms, at 3 per cent, was the smallest since 1983
and Gatt predicted last March that growth this year would not exceed 4 per
cent.
Interest in regional trading arrangements was high, Mr Anell said, with 16
accords notified to Gatt in 1992 against just one in 1991.
The EC should stop looking for foreign scapegoats and accept responsibility
for the reduction in farm export subsidies which is the key to a much-needed
Gatt deal, James Dobbins, US ambassador to the EC, said yesterday, Lionel
Barber writes from Brussels.
He said it was a myth to suggest the US-EC compromise on farm subsidies
imposed greater sacrifices on the Community. He also rejected complaints
that Europe was altering its agricultural policies under US pressure, saying
change was driven first by the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP) agreed last May.
Mr Dobbins said: 'European leaders have an obligation to explain these
realities to their voters. European leaders have an obligation to accept
responsibility for the policies they have set, and the bargains they have
struck.'
At a conference on business opinion in the EC organised by United Parcels
Service, Mr Dobbins said US cuts in subsidised exports would be comparable
with 'where not greater' than those of the EC.
The US-EC deal calls for a 21 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised
exports. This figures derives from the end of the 1986-90 base period, when
US subsidy programmes grew faster than the EC's.
'This means that US subsidies will now have to be cut back more sharply than
the Community's,' said the US ambassador.
Measured against the volume of subsidised exports offered for sale this
autumn until October 1993, the US will have to cut its subsidised exports of
wheat by 54 per cent, barley by 78 per cent, rice by 95 per cent, vegetable
oils by 84 per cent and poultry meat by 52 per cent, according to Mr
Dobbins.
By comparison, based on European Farmers' Union projections, the EC should
have to cut back 39 per cent in wheat, 9 per cent in barley, 49 per cent in
rice, and 39 per cent in poultry meat.

FT  03 DEC 92 / No satisfaction for Little Rockologists: The
transition-watchers forced to speculate on White House appointments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALREADY President-elect Bill Clinton has kept a promise. Soon after winning
the election a month ago he said he would not announce any appointments to
his government before December, and he has not.
But December has now dawned and speculation over who gets what is starting
to mount.
It remains mostly speculation, because this is proving a phenomenally
discreet transition operation, intent on avoiding, at all costs, some of the
public tensions that have afflicted earlier interregna.
Clusters of advisers have set up shop in Washington to investigate various
aspects of policy, but the decision-making circle on appointments is in
Little Rock and is tight - with Mr Clinton himself, his wife Hillary, Vernon
Jordan and Warren Christopher, the twin transition directors, forming its
core.
All visitors to the Arkansas capital have been carefully noted by a press
corps looking for any straw in the wind. Newspapers, magazines and news
letters print lists of virtually everybody who has been mentioned anywhere
for anything. And there has already been a certain amount of semi-public
competition for specific positions.
The Wall Street Journal, for example, this week reported on a bitter
subcutaneous battle, especially rife in the semi-conductor industry, over
the respective merits of two leading candidates for the job of trade
representative - Ms Paula Stern and Mr Alan Wolff.
Both are acknowledged trade experts but Ms Stern, it has been noted with
many nudges and winks, has tended more to represent foreign interests and Mr
Wolff domestic concerns in their private consulting practices.
In a somewhat different vein, the New Republic magazine began what it called
'a series of brief assessments of people we believe Clinton should not
appoint to his administration' with a hatchet job on Congressman Lee
Hamilton of Indiana, a possible secretary of state.
Mr Hamilton, the magazine said in an article that was the pure grinding of
the Washington insider wheel, was afflicted with 'innate caution' (he
believed Lt Col Oliver North was telling the truth) and 'a status quoism not
unlike George Bush's'.
There is also a fair amount of political game-playing afoot, as in this
week's hot rumour that Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, chairman of the
senate finance committee, will become treasury secretary. This seems to fly
in the face of previous wisdom, which had it that Mr Bentsen and Mr Clinton
 -both, by Democratic standards, fiscal conservatives - might prefer Mr
Bentsen not to leave the committee chairmanship, where the next in line is
the less predictable, but always provocative, Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan of New York.
But the Texas newspapers have been awash with stories of a Bentsen move.
Behind some of them may be seen the discreet hand of Mr Henry Cisneros, the
former mayor of San Antonio, himself a candidate for the Clinton cabinet
(transportation is most often mentioned) but possibly more interested in Mr
Bentsen's Senate seat if it is vacated early.
The dilemma for all prospective candidates is the extent to which they can
be seen to be pushing for a particular position. As one former member of the
Clinton campaign who has done some transition work put it, 'not campaigning
for the job means you won't get it', and, 'like a first at Oxford or
Cambridge, you've got to do a bit of work but not be seen to do too much'.
A fairly typical public performance this week was that of Mr John Young,
former chairman of Hewlett Packard and on many lists as a possible secretary
of commerce. He drew a decent crowd to a Washington breakfast but ducked all
questions about the future, preferring the safer option of talking only
about the need for greater US competitiveness.
Even political figures more accustomed to the limelight than Mr Young have
been hiding behind bushels. Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, for
instance, is now quoted at much shorter odds for the State Department than
for the Treasury, in which he was once thought to have interest. There have
been reports that he was sounded out by Little Rock before the Thanksgiving
holiday last week about the foreign policy position but he has been far too
discreet to comment at all, perhaps because he, too, was an Oxford man.
The disposition of Mr Christopher, deputy to Mr Cyrus Vance in President
Jimmy Carter's State Department, still seems to be central to Mr Clinton's
planning. There remains an unsubstantiated assumption that he will get one
of three critical jobs - secretary of state, attorney general or White House
chief of staff. Once he is placed, or not, other appointments may follow
more easily.
Mr Tim Wirth, the outgoing senator from Colorado who was among those known
to have conferred in person with Mr Clinton last week, is another given a
serious shot at one of three cabinet positions - energy, interior, or the
Environmental Protection Agency. Mr Bruce Babbitt, the engaging former
governor of Arizona and occasional intimate of the president-elect, is also
frequently mentioned as a candidate for one of these slots.
Washington is likely to see Mr Clinton again next week and he might come
with a few envelopes in his pocket. It is, after all, that time of year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US business economists have warned President-elect Bill Clinton that his
planned economic stimulus may achieve little, George Graham writes from
Washington.
A survey by the National Association of Business Economists, published
yesterday, showed a median expectation that the economic programme outlined
by Mr Clinton during his election campaign would result in just 0.2
percentage points of growth more than expected from a second Bush term.
The economists said the investment tax credit and infrastructure spending
outlined by Mr Clinton would have only a small effect on the US economy, but
that did not mean he should aim for a bigger fiscal stimulus.
'Our advice right now is to be cautious. Clinton needs to maintain the
confidence of business and the markets,' said Mr Joseph Duncan, the
association's president.
The NABE survey shows a median forecast of 2.6 per cent growth in gross
domestic product next year, with unemployment projected to fall to 7.2 per
cent. Inflation is expected to remain low at around 3.4 per cent next year.
Strong economic data in recent weeks have led more economists to urge Mr
Clinton to think again about the need for an immediate fiscal boost as soon
as he takes office next month.

US PERSONAL computer software companies have launched a world-wide effort to
crack down on software pirates operating electronic bulletin board systems
which they allege are illegally distributing copies of their software
programs.
Police in Berlin recently raided the premises of 13 bulletin board
operations after an investigation by the Business Software Alliance, a group
representing US software companies.
According to BSA, Berlin police seized about 25 computers containing illegal
copies of software programs.
Electronic bulletin boards (BBs) consist of a computer that can be accessed
by other personal computers via telephone lines. PC users can dial these
services and obtain copies of programs or send messages. For the most part
this is a legitimate cottage industry run by computer enthusiasts. Some,
however, offer cheap copies of popular software programs.
'Distributors of illegal software are now operating aggressively throughout
the world, selling pirated copies of software to unsuspecting consumers,'
said Mr Robert Holleyman, BSA president. Software piracy cost the industry
an estimated Dollars 10bn to Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.8bn) in lost sales last
year, according to BSA.
BBs distribution is one of several methods of 'cross-border' piracy which
have become a primary focus of anti-piracy efforts by the software industry
group.
Others are the illegal copying of software within multi-national companies
and the establishment of software distributors formed specifically to move
counterfeit products from country to country.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE wants the EC to conclude a renegotiated oilseeds accord with the US,
leaving other elements of the controversial transatlantic farm deal to be
resolved later in negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt).
'We should settle the oilseeds dispute first,' Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson,
France's farm minister, said yester-day.
France could accept the restriction in the US-EC agreement limiting
Community cultivation of oilseeds to 5.128m hectares, but the ceiling on the
amount of oilseeds which could be grown, on land set aside from food
production, for industrial uses like bio-energy, would have to be raised or
removed.
The French tactic seems aimed at raising again the option of separating the
oilseeds dispute from the wider Gatt farm row by arguing that the issue is
not totally part of the Gatt negotiations. Two Gatt panels have demanded the
EC change its oilseeds regime.
Speaking to foreign journalists in Paris, Mr Soisson suggested that France
might try to rally other EC governments - notably that of Germany, which is
a big oilseeds producer - for a direct approach to Washington for a rejigged
oilseeds deal. But French Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy was said yesterday
to favour working through the European Commission according to established

Gatt will be one of the more delicate issues at today's Franco-German summit
in Bonn. Mr Soisson acknowledged Germany faced a dilemma between 'not
wanting to separate itself politically from France, and not wanting to
separate itself economically from the US'.
An Elysee spokesman suggested that President Francois Mitterrand would not
want to push Chancellor Helmut Kohl too hard on the Gatt issue.

SIX United Nations peacekeepers were being held hostage by Khmer Rouge
guerrillas in Cambodia last night after more than 24 hours in captivity, the
UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) announced.
A further six UN staff were injured by landmine explosions yesterday and Lt
Col Thierry Monet, the French chief of Untac's military operations, was hurt
when his helicopter was hit by gunfire. He was on his way to assist in
negotiations over the six captives.
The incidents were a further indication of increasing tension in Cambodia.
Untac is registering voters for elections in next May without having
succeeded in disarming the four main factions as originally planned.
The Khmer Rouge is refusing to abide by a peace plan it signed 13 months ago
in Paris and some of its guerrillas have been telling Cambodian villagers
not to take part in the election. At the same time government forces and
Khmer Rouge units are preparing to do battle as usual now that the rains
have ended.
The six men held by the Khmer Rouge were unarmed military and naval
observers. They include three Britons, Lt Scott Verney of the Royal Navy and
army officers Lt Col Mark Walton and Capt Richard Williams. A New Zealander,
a Petty Officer Oxenham, and two unidentified Filipinos are also being held.
In London the Foreign Office condemned the attempt to undermine Untac's work
in Cambodia and called for the immediate release of the six. Mr Douglas
Hurd, the foreign secretary, contacted Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary general. India, the current president of the UN Security Council,
was expected to see the Cambodian representative at the UN.
A UN official said last night that efforts to secure release of the six had
met a 'non-co-operative' response. 'We don't understand why they are being
held and we aren't getting any sensible answers to that.'
But he said the UN had been in radio contact with the captives who had said
they were being well treated.
Carrying only walkie-talkies, the observers were investigating troop
movements of Khmer Rouge and government forces from an inflatable boat on a
river near Kompong Thom when they were apprehended at a Khmer Rouge
checkpoint.
Untac said it appeared the guerrilla commander suspected the observers of
spying for the government. Untac officials said it appeared the six men did
not have an interpreter with them.
Untac announced that it had asked a Khmer Rouge representative in Phnom Penh
to accompany a UN team to the area to secure the release of the captives,
but the Khmer Rouge had not been co-operative.
'We are at this stage gravely concerned,' said Mr Eric Falt, Untac
spokesman. 'We have been unable to secure a NADK (Khmer Rouge) liaison
officer to accompany us. This is very unfortunate and surprising.'
Britain said last night that the Untac chief liaison officer was on the way
to the area to try to negotiate their release.
It is the first time that any of the 16,000 UN military personnel in
Cambodia have been held captive for any length of time. Khmer Rouge leaders
have refused Untac forces access to the territory under their control, but
in a highly mobile guerrilla war it is hard to pinpoint boundaries.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Japanese budget becalmed in parliament
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese supplementary budget needed to implement most of the Y10,700bn
(Pounds 57bn) emergency public spending package announced in August is
becalmed in the upper house of parliament. It passed the lower house only
after four weeks of tortuous debate.
The budget itself has been hardly discussed. Most argument has centred on
which politicians, aides and businessmen should be questioned in parliament
over their involvement in the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin financial scandal.
The budget committee of the lower house passed the budget after the ruling
Liberal Democratic party acceded to opposition demands that a top aide to Mr
Shin Kanemaru, the party's fallen kingmaker, should testify over the
scandal.
Mr Kanemaru resigned from the parliament after being fined Y200,000 for
accepting an illegal Y500m donation from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, the trucking
company. Mr Kanemaru said that his top aide, Mr Masahisa Haibara,
distributed the money to about 60 LDP politicians.
The LDP has also indicated that it will call Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former
prime minister, and Mr Kiyoshi Sagawa, the trucking company's former
president, to give evidence to the upper house. Mr Takeshita has already
given evidence to the lower house. However, the opposition is pressing for
other figures in the scandal, including Mr Kanemaru, to give evidence.
The delay makes it increasingly unlikely that the budget will be passed by
both houses by December 8, when the current extraordinary session of
parliament is due to end. It is likely the session will be extended by
several days to allow further testimony on the scandal to be heard.
Meanwhile, the severity of the downturn which prompted the supplementary
budget was reflected in figures yesterday which showed that the value of
consumer electronics production in September was 20 per cent down on the
same month last year.
The decline in industrial electronics products output, however, has slowed,
with production value down 10 per cent in September from the same month last
year.
The value of camcorder production - about 4.4 per cent of consumer
electronics output - was 29 per cent down in the first nine months of the
year compared to the same period last year, according to the figures
published by the Electronics Industry Association.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Algeria joins Egypt in war on militants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ALGERIAN government is broadening the scope of its battle against
Islamic militants by co-operating with the Egyptian authorities.
The moves come after 10 years of estrangement between the two countries
following Egypt's signing of the Camp David peace agreement and their
diverging positions following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
The Algerian government of Mr Belaid Abdessalam has declared 'all-out war'
on the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) which was banned last February after
the cancellation of the second round of elections which the FIS was poised
to win.
The Interior Ministry introduced an indefinite curfew from Saturday with
pedestrians and vehicles banned from streets between 10.30pm and 5am in
seven northern and central areas of the country, including the capital.
Mr Sasi Lamuri, Algeria's minister of religious affairs, visited Cairo last
month. Mr Mohammed Ali Maghub, his Egyptian counterpart, said both countries
were trying to stop the 'export of the Iranian Islamic revolution'.
Two weeks ago Algeria expelled seven Iranian diplomats, having withdrawn its
ambassador from Tehran last winter following an Iranian press campaign
against Algeria. Meanwhile, the Egyptian and Algerian secret services are
known to be working together on ways to control Islamic militancy.
For the Egyptian government the fight against Islamic radicals has taken on
a new dimension since Islamic groups began making sporadic attacks on
tourists in upper Egypt. A British tourist was killed and many German
visitors were injured last month.
After Mr Abdessalam's declaration of 'war' last week, the Algerian
authorities banned FIS-backed trade unions such as the Islamic Workers Union
(SIT) and thousands of private associations which, by late last year, had
virtually become a parallel administration in many Algerian towns.
Around 10,000 or so such associations sprang up in Algeria after riots in
October 1988 broke the Nation Liberation Front's reign as the single ruling
party. Most associations are believed to have been controlled by the FIS.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Putting troops into Somalia is the easy bit: Without cash
and commitment to a lasting settlement, the experiment is doomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TROOPS from the US preparing to intervene in Somalia will encounter an
unusual foe: fiercely individualistic Somali bandits and desert warriors
hardened by the rigours of their nomadic lifestyle.
President George Bush's decision to offer up to 20,000 US soldiers to the
United Nations to revive a defeated international aid effort to save
hundreds of thousands of Somalis dying from war-induced starvation will run
into special difficulties.
Somalia is no Vietnam or Iraq. There is no mass modern army in Somalia and
the motivation of the Somali fighters is virtually non-existent. Instead US
troops will have to confront undisciplined and poorly armed rag-tag gunmen -
often drugged on the narcotic stimulant qat - who kill and maim their own
people without remorse or purpose.
Groups of teenagers thrive on the anarchy they have created. The greatest
fear for the safety of US soldiers will be isolated ambushes and blasts of
stray gunfire from speeding customised 'Mad Max' trucks.
Furthermore the US force will have to confront a war-shattered country with
poor dirt roads and no electricity, water system or social infrastructure
where temperatures soar to more than 100 degrees of dry heat. Huge parts of
the arid heartland are inaccessible and sparsely populated, yet it is
exactly in these southern areas - from Kismayo to Bardere and across to
Baidoa - where people are dying most.
Few believe the Somali nation will rise up against external intervention.
The ruthless warlords who control the divided country have at best a few
thousand dissolute gunmen under their command and do not have popular
support. But the chances of opposition by Somalis to the US intervention
could be lessened if the Americans work closely with the UN and with Somali
politicians and businessmen and use the radio to explain their purpose to
the Somali people.
Many Somalis will be enthusiastic about an intervention with the limited
goals of feeding the starving, ridding the country of the ruthless and
bloody rule of the warlords and leaving behind a legacy of law and order and
a new political arrangement. But months of aggressive propaganda by the
warlords against 'western imperialism' have created suspicions among
Somalia's illiterate nomads that the west is trying to colonise the country,
perhaps to steal fictional oil reserves.
These fears will be exploited by the warlords but they can be allayed if the
US and UN puts in place a credible Somali consultative assembly or forum of
the nation's more respected citizens, many of whom are in exile.
However, there is concern among those involved with Somalia that
Washington's hasty plans are at best half-baked and at worse could backfire
with terrible consequences. Statements by the White House that the 20,000
troops promised for the mission could be in and out of Somalia by January 20
next year, the date of the Bush-Clinton handover, have alarmed aid workers
and UN officials in Somalia.
Observers concede that with the success of the US aid operation in northern
Iraq, the American force could move vast quantities of food and medicine and
temporarily end starvation within weeks. But they point out that in Iraq
President Saddam Hussein was fearful of antagonising the US into further
military involvement and in effect decided to allow the US operation to
proceed. He ordered his disciplined troops not to oppose the operation.
In Somalia there is no similar fear of provoking the US and no chain of
command and control between the warlords and the gunmen. As soon as the US
troops pulled out of Somalia, the country could slide back into anarchy, and
mass starvation would quickly return.
Experienced aid workers say the only possible long-term solution is to
launch a massive humanitarian operation in tandem with efforts to broker a
political settlement capable of bequeathing the country a climate of peace
and law and order. They point out that it is the civil war and insecurity
which has caused the deaths from starvation and frustrated relief efforts,
and not a natural disaster such as drought. Without resolving the conflict
it will be impossible to eliminate starvation.
Leaving behind a stable environment will require a working consultative
assembly which cannot be blackmailed by the warlords. A well-paid and
trained Somali police force will have to be established quickly and put
under the authority of an interim administration. Once the police are in
place and the cycle of criminality broken, foreign troops can retreat to a
minimum role and the UN can sponsor a national conference in a climate of
peace to prepare the way for elections.
But any Somali administration put in power by the UN will have to be heavily
funded to start the long process of reconstruction ensuring that resources
are distributed equitably to all Somali clans.
As the US and UN prepare to undertake a massive experiment in Somalia, which
may set precedents for intervention in other countries such as Yugoslavia
and Cambodia, the real question which remains unanswered is whether they are
prepared to make the necessary long-term financial commitment needed to make
it work.
Without that commitment the experiment is doomed to failure.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Beijing leaders 'don't want to deal with Patten'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINESE leaders do not want to deal any more with Mr Chris Patten, Hong
Kong's governor, because they do not trust him, one of China's top advisers
in Hong Kong said yesterday.
But Mr T S Lo, who was a member of the colony's Legislative and Executive
Councils in the early 1980s and is one of Beijing's 44 advisers in the
colony, sought to allay concern that China would move to set up a separate
institution to vet agreements the Hong Kong government made with business.
On Monday China said that any agreement the Hong Kong government entered
into would be invalid if not first approved by Beijing. This promoted
widespread concern that China was attempting to bring the process of
government in the colony to a standstill.
Yesterday the Hong Kong stock market continued its slide, with the Hang Seng
index down 90.06 points to 5,411.65. It has lost 9.6 per cent so far this
week.
'When they talk about the Chinese side's agreement they are talking about
the system that has been set up already - the Sino-British Joint Liaison
Group and anything created under those auspices,' Mr Lo said. 'I can't
visualise a de facto shadow committee which adjudicates on the validity of
contracts entered into between 1984 and 1997.'
On his visit to Beijing Mr Lo met Li Peng, China's prime minister, and Lu
Ping, head of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the Chinese cabinet.
His comments were seen as authoritative, but it is unlikely that China will
agree to any big contracts until Mr Patten withdraws his proposals for more
democracy.
Mr Lo indicated that China would not back down on its opposition to the
governor's proposals. He said China feels that the Basic Law - the Beijing
drafted constitution for Hong Kong which comes into effect when the colony
reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 - provides for a lot of democracy.
He said that Chinese officials feel that all Mr Patten is doing is breaching
deals already reached between Britain and China. 'Because of that they feel
that they don't want to deal with him any more.'
Yesterday Mr Patten repeated in an interview with the BBC that the fate of
his blueprint for constitutional reform would be decided by the Legislative
Council. He said that while he could not introduce more democracy than the
community wanted, he 'could not go less far than the community wants me to
go.'
'At the end of the day, these matters will be decided in Hong Kong by the
Legislative Council. . .I can't go beyond what the Legislative Council wants
to do.'

<TEXT>
KUWAIT's parliament is to appoint a nine-member committee to investigate
management of the Gulf state's overseas investments and the affairs of the
London-based Kuwait Investment Office (KIO).
The investigation, the second into its foreign investments, is a measure of
the concern over suspected improprieties in the management of Kuwait's
previously abundant foreign holdings.
Meanwhile, the KIO's public relations advisers in Spain yesterday added to
the confusion surrounding the Office's intentions there by announcing that
trial lawyers had been appointed to study and execute ways to prosecute the
former management of Grupo Torras, the KIO's Spanish holding company.
Some argue that it is still far from clear that the KIO's legal advisers
have been able to identify charges that could be made with any likelihood of
success in Spanish courts.
The value of Kuwait's foreign investments, which stood at around Dollars
100bn before the Gulf war, is now believed to have shrunk to nearer Dollars
30bn after a sell-off to pay for the costs of the Gulf war.
Mr Nasser Abdulla al-Rhodan, the finance minister, told parliament on
Tuesday that Kuwait would have to continue liquidating its foreign
investments to finance the government's budget deficit.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PORTUGAL has accused Indonesia of using torture to force Mr Xanana Gusmao,
the captured East Timor resistance leader, to renounce his cause on
television.
In his statement Mr Gusmao called on fellow Fretilin guerrillas to surrender
and abandon the struggle for independence in the former Portuguese colony.
Portuguese President Mario Soares said Mr Gusmao had been tortured and
threatened. He had had no lawyer and no opportunity to defend himself.
Mr Gusmao was shown on Indonesian and Portuguese television in a film shot
by the Indonesian military being interviewed by Mr Abilio Osorio Soares, the
pro-Indonesian governor of East Timor.
Reversing all his previous beliefs, Mr Gusmao, who has led the struggle
against Indonesian rule from mountain strongholds for the past 16 years,
said he acknowledged East Timor's integration into Indonesia as 'progress'.
Mr Gusmao appeared tired in the film.
The Indonesian government has accused Mr Gusmao of organising a
pro-independence march in November last year in which more than 50
demonstrators were shot dead by troops.
Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, said it appeared
Mr Gusmao's statement was forced from him.
Indonesian officials have said Mr Gusmao will be treated according to the
law and have assured foreign diplomats that he would not be maltreated.
Poor relations between Jakarta and Lisbon have led to Portugal blocking a
trade agreement between the European Community and the six-nation
Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) in protest at alleged human
rights abuses in East Timor.
Diplomats say the sharp exchanges over Mr Gusmao's treatment may jeopardise
discussions between Indonesia and Portugal under the auspices of the UN
scheduled for later this month.
Indonesian troops occupied East Timor in 1975 when the Portuguese colonial
rulers withdrew.

A FORMER leading Indian civil servant and his two sons were yesterday
charged with accepting illegal payments of 'tens of millions of rupees' from
foreign companies.
Mr V Krishnamurthy, a former top figure in state-owned industry, was accused
of accepting secret commission payments from unnamed overseas companies
while chairman of two state companies - Maruti Udyog, a car manufacturer,
and the Steel Authority of India.
The Criminal Board of Investigation claimed to have found evidence in
support of its allegations during an investigation of Mr Krishnamurthy's
role in the Rs35bn (Pounds 820m) Bombay securities market scandal.
Yesterday it raided homes and offices belonging to Mr Krishnamurthy and his
family. The move shows the board's determination to press home its
investigations of the affair even against highly placed figures like Mr
Krishnamurthy. Mr Krishnamurthy has extensive political ties, and this
raised fears in Delhi last night that the political impact of the scandal
could widen.
A board of investigation official said the commissions were paid by
multinational companies in connection with transactions carried out with
government enterprises controlled by Mr Krishnamurthy in his capacity as a
public servant. Mr Krishnamurthy's sons, Mr Chandra Krishnamurthy and Mr
Jaykar Krishnamurthy, as well as Mr Binoy Jacob, an associate, were also
charged.
The board said 'tens of millions of rupees' in commission payments were
deposited into foreign accounts of Apten Marketing of Delhi and Link
Universe, a Hong Kong-registered company, both owned and controlled by Mr
Krishnamurthy's sons and Mr Jacob. The companies alleged to have made the
payments were not named.
Mr Krishnamurthy has previously been charged with illegally accepting Rs2.3m
from Mr Harshad Mehta, a stockbroker at the centre of the securities market
scandal, in return for political favours.
Meanwhile the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, has separately
refused permission for the local chief executive of Bank of America, the US
bank which is involved in the securities market scandal, to extend his
posting in India.
Under Indian regulations, the central bank must approve the appointment of
all top executives at both Indian and foreign banks. Mr Vikram Talwar, head
of Bank of America's operations in India, had applied for an extension well
before his three-year permit expired on Monday.
Bank of America said the refusal to renew his permit was unconnected with
the scandal. The Reserve Bank said the decision was taken 'in the normal
course' of events. But bankers in Bombay said the decision seemed to be
linked to the strong criticism of foreign banks involved in the scandal.

be.' He declined to give details of negotiations which took place yesterday
between Untac and the guerrillas.
Britain said last night that the Untac chief liaison officer was on the way

It is the first time that any of the 16,000 UN military personnel in
Cambodia have been held captive for any length of time. Khmer Rouge leaders
have refused Untac forces access to the territory under their control, but
in a highly mobile guerrilla war it is almost impossible to say where one
faction's territory ends and another's begins.
Two of the men injured in landmine blasts were Tunisian policemen whose
vehicle ran over an anti-tank mine on a road near Siem Reap yesterday
morning. Three Indonesian policemen and a Nepali were injured two hours
later when their vehicle detonated another anti-tank mine in the same place.
Untac personnel were then ordered to stay off the road until it had been
cleared.
One of the Tunisians has already had a leg amputated, and it is feared that
one of the Indonesians will also lose a leg.

Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi (above) was yesterday criticised by South African
President F W de Klerk for his plan to create a multi-racial autonomous
state in Natal province, Patti Waldmeir writes from Johannesburg. Mr de
Klerk said the plan would exacerbate township violence and impede the
resumption of multi-party democracy talks.
On Tuesday Chief Buthelezi, leader of the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party,
said he would hold a referendum to test popular support for merging the Zulu
homeland he heads with white-run Natal province. His insistence that he
would go ahead with the plan even without multi-party approval was seen as a
veiled threat to declare unilateral independence from Pretoria unless Natal
is granted autonomy within a federal South Africa.

reforms to the Congress of People's Deputies. Russia would continue to
export weapons, he said, but he promised to avoid conflict zones. 'We are
not going to stoke conflicts by supplying arms to hot spots, but there are
no reasons to abandon this important market,' he said.
The acting premier, who is fighting for his political life against
increasingly powerful opposition to his policies, told the country's full
parliament that Russia had a choice between radical reforms and joining the
ranks of third world dictatorships. He dismissed claims by Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov, the parliament's chairman, that he was depriving the country of
kinder Scandinavian market economics in favour of a harsh US model.
'A criminal slowing of restructuring an economy (dominated by the defence
industry) will drag us further into underdevelopment. . . If we work really
well and privatise half the economy, free the country from the reign of
bureaucracy, then we will be able to discuss what kind of society we want,'
he said.
While admitting to a series of mistakes by his economic reform team over the
past year, he said there was little room for manoeuvre on basic issues such
as financial stabilisation to fend off hyperinflation, and an industrial
policy which made selective use of scarce resources.
But he also promised practical steps which the country needed to better
implement reforms. From January 1, Russia would operate proper borders with
neighbouring republics so it could get a better grip on hard currency
revenues lost through illegal exports of oil and other resources.
He claimed Russia would also enforce a new regime preventing other republics
which used 'the Russian rouble' to interfere with monetary policy.
Whether he continues as prime minister, which he sees as essential for
pursuing 'responsible reform', is yet unclear. His speech drew polite
applause, but appears to have swayed few of the deputies intent on his
removal.
'It was beautiful but my pockets are still empty,' said Mr Yuri Gekht,
leader of a conservative industrialist faction.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY'S government yesterday pushed through parliament a 1993 budget
designed to contain the spiralling deficit and return the country to the
good graces of the International Monetary Fund.
The conservative coalition agreed an unpopular increase in value-added tax
to help keep next year's budget deficit down to Ft185bn (Pounds 1.48bn),
equivalent to 5.9 per cent of forecast GDP, the level which the IMF had
indicated it would accept.
The passage of the budget should allow a resumption of the IMF's SDR1.14bn
(Pounds 1.037bn) three-year programme of credits for Hungary.
Hungary was suspended earlier this year because of budget overruns
tarnishing its claims to be eastern Europe's star economic performer.
The main change in taxation was the imposition of 6 per cent VAT on staple
foods and most other zero-rated products against impassioned protests during
which dozens of people started hunger strikes.
Mr Mihaly Kupa, the finance minister, justified his budget, which has come
under attack from all sides, as a balance of thrift against the public's
'ability to tolerate'. Another senior official described the budget as the
toughest imaginable in the political circumstances.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Most French and British couples prove faithful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH and French sex habits differ little and few men and women are
unfaithful to their partners, according to two studies published today.
Both Britain and France are populated mainly by faithful heterosexual
couples, according to the first large surveys of sexual behaviour in the two
countries.
According to interviews with random selections of 20,000 people in each
country, only about 6 per cent of women and 13 per cent of men have had more
than one sexual partner within the past year. And just 4 per cent of
Frenchmen and 6 per cent of men in the UK say they have ever had any kind of
homosexual experience.
The spread of Aids during the 1980s prompted both studies. Health
authorities felt handicapped in planning strategies to prevent HIV infection
by their ignorance about people's sexual behaviour.
The French survey, conducted by the Agence Nationale de Researches sur le
Sida, was funded by the government. But Mrs Thatcher, then prime minister,
refused to let the Department of Health support the UK study which she saw
as an invasion of privacy; the Wellcome Trust, the largest medical charity,
provided the Pounds 750,000 required.
The preliminary results, published in the journal Nature, are unlikely to
shock Lady Thatcher but the researchers say they will help those fighting
Aids and other sexually transmitted diseases. Yesterday the scientists said
the apparent absence of widespread promiscuity seemed reassuring.
Although one British man in 16 reported having had some kind of sexual
experience with another man, only one in 28 had ever had a 'homosexual
partner' and one in 74 had a partner within the past five years. But in
London one man in 20 had a homosexual partner in the last five years.
One interesting finding is that people in the highest social classes
(managerial and professional) are twice as likely as manual workers to have
had two or more sexual partners within the past year. The researchers
believe this is because higher incomes and greater mobility give many more
opportunities for sexual encounters.
The French survey showed an encouraging increase in the use of condoms by
those most at risk from HIV infection.
Although any survey of intimate personal information is liable to be
distorted by the participants lying, the researchers said both studies
contained internal and external consistency checks which gave them
confidence in the findings. The fact that men claimed more heterosexual
partners than there were women acknowledging partnership may be due partly
to male boastfulness and female reticence, but it can also be explained by
the existence of prostitutes.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Poland to reduce its steel capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND'S steel-making capacity is to be cut over the next 10 years in a
modernisation programme worth Dollars 4.5bn approved by the government this
week.
The programme foresees the closure of two mills and reduced capacity at four
more of the country's 26 steel plants. This should bring output down to some
11.7m tonnes of steel in the year 2002 compared with 15m at present.
In 1980, 19.5m tonnes of steel was produced and 13.6m tonnes in 1990. Output
this year is expected to reach 9m tonnes.
Under the new programme the sector's 124,000 workforce will be reduced to
44,000 over the same 10-year period.
The government is looking to the World Bank to provide about Dollars 300m of
financing for the plan which foresees the spending of Dollars 1.8bn on new
capital investment. Another Dollars 1.8bn is to be spent on refurbishing
existing plant.
The Sedzimir mill in Krakow and that at Katowice, the two largest in the
country, are to be merged.
Three continuous steel casting lines, due to come on stream between 1993 and
1995, are to be installed at the new company.
The plan sees Polish steel exports reaching 2m tonnes by the end of the
century compared to sales abroad of 3.2m tonnes in 1991.
Barriers to sales of steel to the European Community are to be removed by
1998 under Poland's association agreement with Brussels.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Swiss prove they are not beyond passion: Outbursts of
emotion mark a referendum on closer ties with Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER

<DATELINE>
   THE SWISS are known for many things
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
reliability, tolerance, self-discipline - but not for outbursts of emotion.
Thus, when one Swiss farmer calls a federal cabinet minister a traitor, and
another tells a francophone Swiss minister that he has no right to speak
publicly in German Switzerland unless he uses a Swiss German dialect, it is
apparent that something unusual is happening.
What it is is a political campaign for a national referendum this Sunday on
whether Switzerland should join the European Economic Area (EEA), an
expanded free trade zone uniting the seven countries of the European Free
Trade Association (Efta), including Switzerland, and the European Community
(EC).
The Swiss themselves are surprised at how passionate the debate has become.
'It is the first time I have ever been interested in politics,' says Ms
Monika Ziegler, a Zurich hairdresser who keeps a briefing paper at her side
to answer customers' questions on the subject.
Opponents claim ominously that the EEA is the first step down the slippery
slope to membership in a centralised EC and the loss of cherished Swiss
independence, neutrality and prosperity. Advocates believe just as
passionately that it offers the best chance to avoid a stifling isolation
that would gradually sap the vigour of the country's economy and peoples.
Coming at a time when the country's economy has faltered badly, the issue
has sent normally self-assured Swiss citizens into turmoil about which way
to vote. Opinion polls show sentiment evenly split overall, but with a large
proportion of voters, about 20 per cent, still undecided.
Tension is added by the requirements for not only a national majority in the
referendum but also a majority in at least 12 of the 23 cantons for the
treaty to be ratified.
Another worrisome feature is the unusually sharp difference in sentiment
between the German-speaking majority, which tends to be uneasy about closer
ties with the EC, and the French-speaking minority, which favours them.
Government leaders admit that in the event of a rejection of the treaty the
country's delicately balanced political system would be thrown into crisis.
For those outside the country with interests in Switzerland, the importance
of the vote should not be exaggerated. Existing free trade and several other
treaties between the country and the EC will carry on even in the event of
rejection. The near-term impact on the economy will be marginal. The big
Swiss banks and multinational companies will be unaffected either way as
they already have established bases in EC countries.
And a political crisis would undoubtedly be defused in due course. The
spectre of a break-up of the confederation and the creation of a separate
French-speaking state is a non-starter, given the economic weakness of the
six francophone-dominated cantons.
But for the moment, the country is in an uncharacteristically feverish
state. Mr Jean-Paul Delamuraz, the minister who was criticised for not
speaking Swiss German in Schaffhausen three weeks ago, laments: 'Reason and
truth do not seem to have a place in this debate any more.'
Although the campaign had been in the offing for months, it got seriously
under way only about four weeks ago. The government was quietly confident of
victory, having assembled an extraordinary alliance of the leadership of
nearly every important branch of society - banks, industry, trade unions,
even farmers.
But in the initial weeks of the campaign, the opponents made all the
running, conjuring up visions of floods of immigrants and domination by the
insensitive Brussels bureaucracy. Two weeks ago, a poll showed a clear
plurality of voters against the EEA and the anti forces gaining ground.
Alarmed, the pro camp rolled out its big guns. Brown Boveri, the engineering
group, wrote to its suppliers warning of loss of business if the treaty was
rejected. Roche and Sulzer, two other big companies, said they would cancel
investment projects in Switzerland.
In one of the most moving appeals, Mr Walter Frehner, chief executive of
Swiss Bank Corporation, said in Zurich last week: 'I am against the offshore
mentality being promoted by the EEA opponents. I want to leave my children a
Switzerland whose strength is not just its neighbours' weaknesses, a
Switzerland which does not consist only of hotels, banks and holding
companies.'
By the end of last week, polls indicated that, while the number of undecided
voters was still high, there had been a decisive swing, with 46 per cent in
favour and 38 per cent against.
If the treaty is accepted, the turning point will probably be seen as the
night when two cabinet ministers faced a hostile public in a nationally
televised debate at Schwyz, the central Swiss town where the confederation
was formed in 1292. After the ministers spoke in the hall holding the sacred
federal archives, a farmer stood up and called them traitors. The outraged
ministers dropped all pretence of civility and responded so vigorously that,
by all accounts, they won sympathy throughout German Switzerland.
For the Swiss, the most controversial element of the EEA treaty is the
obligation to take on the EC's so-called four freedoms - of movement of
capital, people, goods and services. Anti-EEA campaigners have been able to
appeal to the deep seated fear in most Swiss of foreigners over-running the
country, some taking jobs away from locals by accepting lower wages, others
buying up every available Alp. In fact, in the past couple of years, as a
result of recession, there has been a net outward flow of people to EEA
countries, and this is likely to persist.
EEA advocates say that the real beneficiaries of freedom of movement will be
the Swiss who will be able to study and work freely in other EC countries.
Research-oriented Swiss companies fear they will not be able to attract
talented scientists if the treaty is rejected.
Another troublesome element of the treaty for the Swiss is the supremacy of
EC law in all of the areas covered. Opponents have emphasised how the Swiss
will no longer be able to have the final say through plebiscites on every
important issue.
Advocates counter that the EEA is nowhere near as intrusive as EC membership
would be. The EEA has no impact on heavily subsidised Swiss agriculture,
except insofar as it should bring about a reduction in the cost of imported
machinery and other farm inputs. And it does not threaten Switzerland's
monetary independence or bank secrecy. Nor does it cover defence, and so
does not undermine Swiss neutrality.
As Sunday approaches, the tide seems to be firmly in the direction of
approval of the treaty. But swinging a majority of cantons into the 'yes'
camp still looks difficult because of the large number of small cantons in
the German-speaking part of the country. Also, the external environment is
not exactly helpful. Seldom have European institutions looked so
unattractive.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Five EC states fall behind on single market laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and four other countries appear to be falling behind their EC
partners in the race to put EC legislation on the single market into force.
Mr Martin Bangemann, EC internal market commissioner, has written to
Britain, Spain, Luxembourg, Belgium and Italy urging them to accelerate the
progress of single market legislation through national parliaments as the
January 1 deadline for opening borders to goods gets closer. According to
Commission officials, Spain and Britain - which lays particular stress on
the proper implementation of EC laws - have not replied to Mr Bangemann's
letters. However, a senior UK official said that London had not even
received the Commission warning. EC directives cannot take effect until they
are transferred into national law, and the Commission is worried that if it
does not put pressure on laggard countries now, the single market will be
badly flawed when it opens for business on January 1. Brussels is
particularly worried about the failure of some countries to implement
important legislation harmonising the system for collecting value added tax
and excise duty - the basis for lifting internal border controls on goods.
Commission officials say directives which would open up the EC financial
services market have also been poorly transposed.
The same officials indicated yesterday that Brussels might take emergency
legal action against the worst offenders in January, although they stressed
that this would be a political decision. They also pointed out that
individual citizens could sue member states for failure to implement EC
laws, while other member states could refuse products and services coming
from member states which did not conform with Community legislation.
Britain, which holds the Community presidency, was until recently among the
most efficient transposers of EC law. According to October figures, however,
Britain has only converted 72.8 per cent of the relevant directives into
national law. That puts the UK eighth out of the 12 and compares with the
Community average of 79 per cent. 'It's not as good as we would like,'
admitted a British official, but said efforts were being made to increase
the score by the end of the year.
Denmark, which has transferred 94.7 per cent of the EC legislation into law,
heads the table of member states, followed by France, Greece, and Germany.
Brussels yesterday decided to back suggestions that the transparency and
implementation of EC rules should be improved, partnership with member
states to enforce rules should be encouraged, and national courts' duty to
enforce EC law should be strengthened. The original proposals were included
in the Sutherland report on implementing the single market, which was
published in October.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Ministers to discuss violations by Serbia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUGHER action against Serbia, possibly including military action, will be
discussed by foreign ministers from 30 countries at a conference in Geneva
on December 16, convened to discuss the rapidly deteriorating situation in
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The conference, to be co-chaired by Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, the
European Community and United Nations mediators for a peace settlement in
the former Yugoslavia, is due to decide on a joint international response to
the growing violations by Serbia of ceasefire agreements, human rights and
the UN's 'no-fly' zone.
Faced with growing evidence of the death and suffering wreaked on the Moslem
population by the Bosnian Serbs' policy of 'ethnic cleansing', both western
and Islamic countries have been persuaded that diplomatic action and
economic sanctions may not be enough to bring about a Serbian change of
heart.
At a meeting of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) in Jeddah
yesterday Moslem countries appeared ready to make a formal appeal to the UN
for international military intervention.
The consultative assembly of the nine-nation Western European Union defence
organisation, meeting in Paris, has also recommended that member countries
should study the possibility of military intervention to stabilise the area
and end ethnic cleansing.
However, there is no evidence that the western powers, particularly the EC,
are on the point of agreeing to military action that goes beyond the
protection of humanitarian aid convoys, presently undertaken under the
umbrella of the UN.
Among the leading western powers, only the US, which unlike Britain and
France does not have any troops on the ground in Bosnia or other areas of
the former Yugoslavia, has indicated that it would be ready to support
military steps to enforce the UN ban on military flights over Bosnia. But
British officials stressed in London yesterday that full-scale military
intervention was only one of a range of options. The one-day conference was
originally proposed by France as a full-scale emergency ministerial meeting
outside the Geneva-based UN-EC peace talks on the former Yugoslavia.
But that idea was dropped after Britain, current chairman of the EC and host
of last August's London conference on Yugoslavia, insisted that it should be
in the form of an expanded steering committee of that conference.
None of the parties to the Yugoslav conflict have been asked to attend, as
they were to the London conference, in the hope that their absence will
facilitate agreement on effective international action.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Greek prime minister, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, sacked his entire
cabinet yesterday, promising a new one within 24 hours, Reuter reports from
Athens.
He said he wanted a free hand to reshape the conservative government after
months of internal feuding over his handling of the economy and foreign
policy.
According to his spokesman, Mr Mitsotakis, 74, 'asked for the resignations
of the cabinet members. He will go ahead with a reshuffle. Tomorrow at noon
he will swear in the new ministers'.
The prime minister, with a one-seat majority in the 300-seat parliament,
tried to whip dissenting deputies from his New Democracy party into line
during a stormy meeting on Tuesday. But he faced renewed accusations after
the session of being out of touch with ordinary people in pushing through a
harsh austerity and economic reform programme aimed at trimming Greece's
Dollars 75bn national debt.
Political commentators said all cabinet seats were open and there was no
early betting on new names to take up the key ministries of defence,
national economy and foreign affairs.
If Mr Mitsotakis replaced Mr Mihalis Papaconstantinou as foreign minister
and Mr Stephanos Manos at economy, it would mark a sea-change in government
direction.
Mr Manos, a no-nonsense technocrat, has made no concessions to powerful
special interest groups while driving through the austerity programme. Last
month he earned the government its first praise from the European Community
for its economic policies, especially his unpopular decision to force
through privatisation and to raise taxes to meet 1992 budget revenue
targets.
Mr Papaconstantinou, a veteran politician, has been overseeing a campaign to
block international, especially EC, recognition of the former Yugoslav
republic of Macedonia. One of the Balkans' most obscure but potentially
explosive disputes, the recognition issue has stirred deep nationalist
feelings in Greece. Failure to hold the line at the Edinburgh summit next
week could lead to the fall of Mitsotakis. The former Yugoslav republic is
accused of having territorial ambitions against Greece's Macedonia province.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Germany's citizenship challenge: The hurdles placed in the
way of those seeking naturalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OBTAINING German citizenship is largely a question of German blood, said Mr
Michael Schlikker a 31-year-old legal expert at the Federal Office for
Problems of Foreigners.
Leafing through a heavy tome, he finds article 5.7 of the 1913 Reichs- und
Staatsangehorigkeitsgesetz, or Imperial and State Citizenship Law
'Through birth, one can acquire citizenship if the legitimate child has a
German parent; and if an illegitimate child has a German mother ..'
This short article means that the 6.2m foreigners in Germany have little
chance of obtaining German citizenship.
Yet as the government and the opposition Social Democratic Party prepare to
resume talks on amending the country's liberal asylum laws to curb the
influx of foreigners, there is a growing consensus that what Germany really
needs is an immigration law.
Many legal experts believe that without such a law, there is little chance
of integrating foreigners into German society, and the possibility of social
unrest could increase.
Under current regulations, there are some opportunities to obtain German
citizenship. For instance, if a Russian marries an ethnic German, and both
decide to live in Germany, the ethnic German, or Aussiedler has by law the
automatic right to German citizenship, and the Russian can be naturalised
almost immediately.
However, if a Russian (or any other nationality) marries a German in
Germany, remains married for two years, and lives without interruption for
five years in the country, only then can he or she apply for citizenship.
There is still no guarantee that the application will be successful. To
obtain citizenship, the spouse must have no criminal record, a job, a fixed
abode, fluency in German, and a knowledge of German culture.
A foreigner who is not married to a German, must meet these conditions as
well. In addition, he or she must have lived in Germany for 10 years before
lodging an application. After a further five years, when the heavy weight of
German bureaucracy will have run its full course, the foreigner will be
naturalised. But in common with all applications, original citizenship must
be renounced because Germany does not allow dual citizenship.
In recent years, some concessions have been made toward integrating the
children of the Gastarbeiter - those invited to Germany in the early 1960s
to make up the labour shortfall.
However, children born in Germany of non-German parents can only apply for
citizenship between the ages of 16 and 23, again under certain conditions.
These include residence in Germany for at least eight years, the renouncing
of previous citizenship, and six years at a German school.
Ms Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, head of the foreigners office, says many
Turkish teenagers want citizenship but their parents prefer them to retain
Turkish citizenship.
'Its disgraceful that we make it so difficult for them to become German
citizens. They will always regard themselves as foreigners,' she added.
Refugees who have recognised refugee status in Germany, which means that
they can live and work in the country, are confronted with a maze of
obstacles before they can gain citizenship.
'The refugee has no legal entitlement to citizenship,' said Mr Walter Brill,
a legal officer at the Bonn-based United Nations High Commission for
Refugees. 'It is discretionary. There is never really a situation where the
applicant has fulfilled all the conditions for citizenship because it is not
stated in the law,' he added.
Moreover, even if the refugee's application is treated favourably, there is
another hurdle: original citizenship must be renounced. This is often
difficult because the applicant must seek permission from those same
authorities which forced the applicant to flee in the first place.
Mr Brill agrees that it is time for Germany to introduce an immigration law
which would give foreigners easier access to citizenship and political
rights. 'The climate is finally changing,' he said. But Mr Schlikker still
wonders if the right wing of the German establishment is prepared to dilute
German blood as the price for an ethnically heterogeneous society.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Brussels agrees strategy to help revive growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission wants EC leaders to earmark nearly Ecu7.7bn (Pounds
6.2bn) as the kernel of a co-ordinated strategy, to be discussed at next
week's Edinburgh summit, to get Europe's economies moving again.
The strategy, approved by the Commission yesterday suggests the money would
consist mostly of soft and temporary loans for infrastructure investment
programmes, and the redirection of part of EC spending on research and
training.
Mr Henning Christophersen, economy commissioner, said yesterday the
Community needed 'a good psychological signal from the European Council (in
Edinburgh) which would give us something on which we could build a growth
initiative'.
The plan is consistent with earlier ideas for the EC to provide 'seed-money'
to revive economic growth, but falls far short of widespread reports that
Brussels was preparing an Ecu50bn-Ecu60bn reflation package.
The document it approved yesterday calls for:
A new European Investment Fund able to lend Ecu2bn over four years for
infrastructure and small to medium-size enterprises. The European Investment
Bank would pay in 40 per cent of the Ecu400m capital, with the rest split
between the EC budget and unspecified private financial institutions. The
hope is that this could 'support' investments of up to Ecu10bn.
An Ecu5bn loan facility to support trans-European networks, normally
transport, including those from western to eastern Europe where there is
clear 'mutual interest'. These loans, raised on international capital
markets, would be for 'a limited time'. There would be 10-15 per cent loan
subsidies to participating east European nations, which the Commission
suggests the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
might help finance.
New facilities for immediate retraining (at a cost of Ecu200m in 1993) for
workers made redundant, 'so as to avoid a loss of skills and motivation'.
Redirection of Ecu400m in R&amp;D spending to improve industrial
competitiveness, in areas like computer-aided design and manufacturing,
advanced telematics, and laser processing.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Kohl rejects idea of 'Europe a la carte'

MR Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, yesterday urged member states
of the European Community not to rush into economic and monetary union (Emu)
too hastily, simply to preserve their national pride.
Clearly implying that a two-speed Europe was better than an unstable union,
he rejected any suggestion that political pressure could be used to
undermine the strict requirements of the Maastricht treaty on European
union.
And Mr Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor, warned that Europe could not
indefinitely move at the pace of its slowest member states.
He was speaking as the German Bundestag voted overwhelmingly in favour of
the ratification of the treaty, after a debate which was marked far more by
doubts and misgivings than by outright enthusiasm. The vote was by 543 votes
to 17, with eight abstentions.
Chancellor Kohl spoke against any attempt - particularly from Britain - to
try to enlarge the EC into a 'glorified free trade area'. He also rejected
the concept - with both Britain and Denmark under suspicion - of turning the
EC into 'Europe a la carte', by allowing member states to pick or choose the
bits they wanted to belong to.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, expressed his fears about the
increased powers of the German federal Lander in future EC negotiations, as
enshrined in new amendments to the German constitution. Foreign policy must
remain the prerequisite of central government, he said.
Mr Waigel, who comes from the fiercely independent state of Bavaria,
disagreed, saying the strengthening of federal controls over the central
government was all to the good.
And then speaker after speaker worried about the lack of democratic controls
over the integrated European institutions, because of the failure to give
enough powers to the European parliament.
The message was clear: the vast majority of the German political
establishment remains wedded to the concept of European integration, above
all to lay to rest any revived fears of German nationalism and hegemony. Yet
doubts about the details, not least about the democratic control of European
institutions, and about the future stability of a single European currency,
have not been laid to rest. The result is that the Bundestag is insisting on
a decision before embarking on the last stage of Emu, to determine if the
convergence criteria have been observed by all EC states planning to join.
It is also writing in to the German constitution that no further steps to
European union are possible without adequate democratic controls.

THE guardians of the D-Mark have forsaken their traditional low-key
communications techniques. The masters of the Delphic mumble have taken
instead to shouting their message from the rooftops.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, and his partners on the bank's
council have found new confidence. In a series of speeches they have spelt
out with uncommon and increasing clarity the failings of German financial
and economic policies, and at the same time exposed the potholes in the road
to European monetary union.
The Bundesbank has taken advantage of the confusion and uncertainty
paralysing European Community politics and disrupting money markets. After
absorbing intense and fierce criticism of its policies for almost two years,
it feels the time has come to do more than repeatedly defend its rigid
stance and has sprung on to the offensive.
Irritated by impertinent foreign demands for interest rate cuts, the bank
has started shooting back at the politicians making them. It has also
successfully off-loaded the responsibility for its rigid monetary stance on
to Bonn.
Mr Schlesinger's campaigning reached a new high on Tuesday when he announced
that mechanisms designed to keep the European monetary system stable did not
work. The obligation on central banks to intervene in support of weaker
currencies within the exchange rate mechanism was little more than an
invitation for speculators, he said.
The bank is estimated to have lost more than DM1bn (Pounds 400m) during
recent fruitless battles to defend sterling and the lira, and was
intervening again yesterday as the French franc came under strain.
President Schlesinger underlined his concerns by repeating a blast from a
speech made 10 days earlier. Then he proclaimed that the economic
convergence criteria governing the transition to a common currency were
neither clear nor tough enough. Without changes, monetary union could be
infected with the deadly inflation virus from the outset. While still
insisting that there is no need for fundamental reforms, the bank has
succinctly imparted how little it thinks of politicians' attempts at
monetary engineering.
Although Bonn appeared to have accepted that priority should be given to
cutting subsidies rather than shuffling the numbers, Mr Schlesinger is still
waiting for signs of the drastic economies urged by Chancellor Kohl's own
independent advisers.
Apart from higher short-term borrowing, anathema to the bank, the government
had not yet found a way to share out the costs of unification, he said. If a
solution was not found the issue would be resolved through higher taxes or
higher inflation. 'We can take it for granted that no-one wants the latter.'
In this week's speech he also opened up with unaccustomed vigour on
politicians who had the nerve to exert 'moral pressure' on the Bundesbank to
cut interest rates while it was still battling to win the war against German
inflation. He made plain that if politicians wanted to help stabilise
markets and reduce money market speculators' room for manoeuvre, they would
be better advised to stop regarding exchange rates as tokens of political
prestige and give their central banks independence. The sort of pressure
exerted on the Bundesbank of late actually increased doubts about Emu,
claimed the man who has raised more than his share of grave concerns.
But he left his audience with no doubts about his stance on interest rates.
It would be a mistake, even taking into account the 'short-term problems' of
partner countries, for the Bundesbank to try to iron out domestic economic
difficulties with a lax monetary policy. That would be a disservice to
European monetary integration, he declared. With that, he dropped the
community's most gnawed-at bone of contention in Chancellor Kohl's backyard,
and stalked off back to Frankfurt.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Bundesbank intervention fails to lift French franc
</HEADLINE>

INTERVENTION by the Bundes-bank yesterday failed to give more than a modest
lift to the French franc, in a development which held out the possibility of
further strains in the embattled European exchange rate mechanism.
The action by the German central bank in buying francs for D-Marks was
triggered by further shifts of US and European investors funds into the
D-Mark, as a result of widespread perception that German interest rates are
likely to stay high for some time.
The latest signs of tension in the ERM, which threaten a further round of
realignments to follow the three which have taken place since September, are
due to be discussed today by French and German political leaders in a
two-day meeting in Bonn ahead of next week's European Community summit in
Edinburgh.
Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, and Mr Francois Mitterrand, the
French president, are to confer with their foreign and finance ministers
about broad foreign policy issues, including the outcome of the Gatt trade
negotiations.
As the franc fell in early trading yesterday to a 10-week low against the
D-Mark, a senior French finance ministry official formally denied market
rumours that the Bundesbank was putting pressure on France to raise interest
rates to defend the franc, or that French and German authorities had
discussed moving the franc into a narrower ERM band.
In recent days, there has been intense market speculation that the two
countries might be preparing a plan to 'harden' the ERM by some unspecified
initiative to damp the recent selling pressure on some of the weak
currencies.
Yesterday's intervention by the Bundesbank - which took place in at least
two separate rounds in the morning and afternoon - propped the franc from
its low point of FFr3.4150 to the D-Mark. The support was reciprocated by
action from the Bank of France purchasing its own currency for D-Marks, in a
repeat of its intervention on Tuesday.
But the combined operations of the two central banks succeeded in lifting
the franc only as far as a closing level in London of FFr3.411 to the
D-Mark, barely changed from the previous close of FFr3.412 and within two
centimes of its FFr3.43 ERM floor.
As a wave of concern about the ERM's future swept Europe, there were other
currency-related events yesterday:
Mr Piero Barucci, the Italian treasury minister, told the Rome parliament
that the ERM would need a major revision if the D-Mark continued to dominate
the other seven currencies. The central banks of the Netherlands, Belgium
and Denmark bought the Danish krone on currency markets in exchange for
guilders and Belgian francs to prevent the weakest ERM member from falling
through its ERM limits. At the close of European trading, the krone was
quoted at around DKr3.88 to the D-Mark, just above its floor of DKr3.90.
The Belgian central bank, custodian of a strong EC currency, said it spent
BFr70bn (Pounds 1.4bn) from its reserves in the week to November 30
supporting weak currencies.
In an effort to reduce the strains, Mr Henning Christophersen, the EC
economy commissioner, ruled out further realignments and said selling of the
krone, the French franc and the Irish punt was 'irrational'.
In a more hopeful sign for the punt, which has been under pressure recently,
the Irish currency strengthened against other major currencies, in spite of
yesterday's move by the Irish central bank to cut its overnight interest
rate from 100 per cent to 30 per cent.
The upheaval in the currency markets is certain to be high on the agenda at
the Bonn summit, which lasts until tomorrow. France and Germany will seek to
co-ordinate their strategy for the forthcoming EC summit, with both deeply
committed to ensuring the Community-wide ratification of the Maastricht
treaty.
They want to find a solution which can accommodate Denmark's objections to
the treaty, without having to renegotiate it. Yet their talks are likely to
be overshadowed by the battle over the French franc, and by their differing
views over the Gatt negotiations.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Gilts auction disappoints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST auction of UK government bonds since sterling's departure from the
European exchange rate mechanism in September proved a disappointment
yesterday as foreign investors stayed away from the gilts market, leaving
domestic buyers to pick up the stock.
The Bank of England, which had put Pounds 2.5bn of gilts on offer, received
bids totalling only Pounds 3.15bn, which was seen by the market as a very
low cover ratio.
'The auction has confirmed the general view that UK interest rates are
unlikely to come down substantially in the short term,' said Mr John
Kendall, economist at Baring Sterling Bonds.
The gilt issue on offer, 8 per cent Treasury stock due 2003, had been
expected to appeal to overseas investors. The issue is expected to take over
as the new 10-year benchmark, which is used as a reference for the rest of
the market because of its size and liquidity.
Overseas investors normally like bonds with a 10-year or shorter maturity,
but since sterling left the ERM, foreign investors have been particularly
wary of the UK government bond market. European investors are exposed to a
greater exchange rate risk, and the recent sharp cuts in the base rate have
rekindled fears that inflation may start to rise again.
Adding to the gilt market's worries is the government's heavy borrowing
requirement. The government has forecast a public sector borrowing
requirement of about Pounds 44bn for 1993-94, which means that the Bank of
England will have to issue about Pounds 50bn-Pounds 55bn in gilts - roughly
Pounds 1bn a week - once the repayment of maturing issues is taken into
account.
The auction cover - which represents the ratio of bids to the amount on
offer - was considered low at only 1.26 times, and indicates the low level
of interest in the auction. At the last auction, at the end of August, the
cover was also low at 1.24 times, due to pressure on sterling on the foreign
exchanges.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Competition cuts phone charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY TELEPHONE bills will be reduced from January after British
Telecommunications and Mercury Communications yesterday announced a series
of price changes.
Further cuts in phone bills are in prospect later next year as a result of
vigorous competition between the two telecommunication companies.
In a break with its traditional pricing policy, BT said it might reduce its
prices by more than required by Oftel, the industry regulator, in order to
persuade customers to make more calls.
The change in BT's pricing policy has been prompted by a combination of
increased competition, tighter regulation and the arrival of executives who
have experience of market driven industries. Prominent among these is Mr
Michael Hepher, group managing director, who was chairman of Lloyds Abbey
Life until last year.
BT yesterday announced a freeze on call charges, bigger discounts on its
standard rates for customers who make many calls and improved terms on its
optional pricing packages. Calls to the US and Canada will be cut by between
3 and 10 per cent. But BT said line rental charges would be increased by 5.9
per cent.
As a result of the changes, businesses will see their phone bills fall by
between 0.6 per cent and 4.1 per cent, depending on their size, BT said. But
the average residential customer's bill will rise by 2.4 per cent.
Mercury pre-empted BT's price changes by announcing improvements to its own
optional pricing packages, which it said would give customers extra savings
of 5 per cent.
Optional pricing packages are a new feature in the UK telecommunications
market which allow customers to pay cheaper call rates in exchange for
higher standing charges.
Mr Hepher said BT had more price cuts 'up our sleeve' which it did not want
to reveal for competitive reasons. According to preliminary calculations by
Oftel, BT must cut its prices on average by a further 2 per cent before the
end of next July to comply with regulations. This would reduce phone bills
by another Pounds 150m.
But Mr Hepher said BT might go further than required if it found that
customers were responding to lower call charges by increasing the use of
their phones. 'There is no doubt that prices for telephony are coming down
and the more people use the phone, the more they will come down' said Mr
Hepher.
He added that BT would be testing various measures to stimulate phone usage,
such as cheaper European calls throughout January and discounts for
customers with a second telephone at home.
Since last month it has introduced cheap calls on Sunday afternoons, which
has led to a doubling of call volumes.
The moves were generally welcomed by telephone user and consumer groups,
although some expressed concern about the increase in line rental charges
which will disproportionately fall on poorer residential customers.
BT's share price fell 4p to 414p. Cable and Wireless, which owns Mercury,
suffered a 16p fall to 643p, although much of this was accounted for by the
uncertainty in Hong Kong.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Bristol &amp; West to price mortgages by family status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRISTOL &amp; WEST plans to become the first building society to price new
mortgages according to the borrower's age and family status.
The move is likely to lead to higher charges for young, unmarried couples
without children.
From the middle of next year the society will assess the credit risk of new
borrowers on the basis of factors such as age, marital status and number of
children. The switch could lead to a difference of up to 4 percentage points
in the interest rates the society charges to different borrowers.
Bristol &amp; West, the tenth largest building society by asset size, said
unmarried couples and young adults living together as friends had proved to
be poor credit risks in terms of mortgage arrears and repossessions.
'It is an economic policy, although it sounds moralistic,' Mr Tony
FitzSimons, chief executive, said yesterday. 'You have to consider people's
lifestyles because regretably those who are not bonded by marriage have a
higher propensity to break up, and not pay the mortgage.'
Mr FitzSimons said the society had found that unmarried couples were 50 per
cent more likely to fall into arrears than married couples. Couples who took
out mortgages before having children were more likely to default once they
had started a family because their bills increased.
Although the society had found that young adults sharing mortgages but not a
sexual relationship were poor risks, it would not ask questions about sexual
habits. 'It might be financially desirable, but it is a step too far,' Mr
FitzSimons said.
Mortgage rates are likely to reduce as borrowers get older and demonstrate a
repayment record. However, Mr FitzSimons said changes such as married
couples getting divorced would not lead to higher charges unless repayments
suffered.
He said Bristol &amp; West's existing borrowers would not be affected, but the
society intended to reduce interest rates for existing borrowers who had
held policies for more than five years and had not fallen into arrears. The
society, which has a Pounds 5.7bn mortgage book, has suffered because of the
depressed housing market in the south. Its bad debt charge for the first six
months of this year was Pounds 29.7m compared with Pounds 7.2m for the first
half of 1991.
Most building societies have become more cautious about lending to
first-time buyers who want to borrow 95 per cent of the purchase price. Some
are now charging less to those who borrow smaller proportions of a
property's value.
The Building Societies Association said yesterday that societies were
gradually varying charges according to types and sizes of loans. However,
none had yet started to charge differently according to customer profiles.
Bristol &amp; West is still working on details of its policy, based on research
concerning defaulting among borrowers who took mortgages in the 1980s. It
believes one problem is that young borrowers are less embarrassed about
repossession.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR PROMINENT politicians in Reggio Calabria were arrested early yesterday,
together with seven members of the Mafia, on charges of involvement in the
murder three years ago of Mr Lodovico Ligato, former head of Italy's state
railways.
Magistrates alleged they had all conspired to murder Mr Ligato because they
feared he might compete for public works contracts in southern Italy along
with rival clans of the local Mafia, the 'nandrangheta.
Mr Ligato, an ambitious local Christian Democrat, had been forced to resign
from heading the railways after a contract scandal in 1988.
Yesterday's arrests raised the possibility of further evidence of the links
between politicians and organised crime in southern Italy. These have been
long suspected but only in the past two months has concrete evidence begun
to emerge.
Three of those arrested yesterday are Christian Democrats and one is a
Socialist. All four politicians are already under investigation for alleged
corruption involving public works contracts in the city, as are eight other
leading members of the council.
The city of Reggio Calabria is due to hold municipal elections on December
13, following the arrest of the entire 23-strong council on corruption
charges in September. Magistrates have also intimated that some members of
the former council were linked to the Mafia.
The Christian Democrats arrested were Mr Pietro Battaglia, a former deputy
and twice mayor of the city, Mr Franco Quattrone, a former deputy and junior
minister, and Mr Giuseppe Nicolo, the party's regional secretary. Mr
Giovanni Palomara, the Socialist, was also a former mayor of Reggio.
Yesterday, there were calls in Reggio for the postponement of the municipal
elections.
Mr Ligato is alleged to have made an alliance with a rival Mafia group which
had hoped to remove a sizeable share of the region's public works contracts,
threatening to upset the current structure of contacts between the
'nandrangheta and local politicians.
He was killed outside his house after he had been entertaining some guests.
He was gunned down by two people on a motorcycle.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Danish workers count cost of No vote
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK'S No to the Maastricht treaty has cost the country 100,000 jobs,
according to Mr Thor Petersen, economy minister. He said the vote against
the treaty in the referendum in June had contributed to currency unrest,
high interest rates and uncertainty about Denmark's future relationship with
the European Community.
Mr Petersen was commenting on a business confidence survey showing that 42
per cent of senior managers in large Danish companies expect to cut their
workforce this winter.
Recent unemployment figures indicate the minister's estimate of job losses
may be exaggerated. Seasonally adjusted unemployment rose from 310,000 in
May, the month before the referendum, to 315,000 in September, the most
recent month for which the figure is available.
Although Danish industrialists accept that the No vote has dampened business
confidence, Mr Jorgen Hansen, director of the Federation of Danish
Industries, describes the position in less drastic terms than Mr Petersen.
'There is a widespread wait-and-see attitude,' he says.
Mr Birger Riisager, chief executive of FLS Industries, the world leader in
supplying machinery and know-how for the cement-making industry, says his
company is being cautious about making new commitments until next spring,
when another referendum is expected to take place. 'If Denmark then decides
to leave the Community, a new situation will arise. FLS will have to put its
effort into other countries,' he says.
Mr Hugo Schroeder, chief executive of Scandinavian Holding, which includes
Skandinavisk Tobak, the tobacco goods group, and a large office furniture
group, says that the Maastricht vote in June had not affected the group's
investment decisions so far. But if Denmark voted No again, the group would
have to consider whether to make more of its investments outside Denmark.
If Denmark again says No, the government has admitted it would have to
withdraw from the Community. 'We should then presumably have the same status
as the European Economic Area countries, which means that we would be part
of the internal market, but we would have no influence when the internal
market's rules are made, a very unsatisfactory situation,' says Mr Hansen.
If Denmark withdraws from the Community and loses access to EC markets for
its agricultural products, serious consequences will arise for agriculture
and related food processing industries.
A recent study by the Agricultural Council, grouping the farmers' unions and
other farmers' organisations, said that without the Common Agricultural
Policy, agricultural exports could fall by up to DKr33bn (Dollars 3.5bn),
about 14 per cent of total merchandise exports. Up to 100,000 jobs - about 4
per cent of the country's total labour force - could be lost on farms, and
in abattoirs, dairies and agricultural supply industries.
'The whole rural economy is in trouble because of the current uncertainty,'
says Mr HOA Kjeldsen, president of the Agricultural Council, 'not just the
farms, but the suppliers, the retailers, everyone'.
At MD Foods, Denmark's largest dairy business and one of the largest in
Europe, the prospect of Danish withdrawal from the EC is regarded as a
catastrophe of such dimensions that it just cannot happen, says Mr Peter
Kjelstrup, communications manager.
'It would mean the slaughter of half the Danish dairy herd and a halving of
MD Foods,' he says.
For the moment, the uncertain situation means that MD Foods' investment
spending would be slightly lower this year than last and a programme for
acquisition of dairies abroad is being postponed.

SANCTIONS are sounding the death knell of the Serbian economy, ruined by
more than a year of war and the collapse of trade with the former Yugoslav
republics.
Tighter sanctions, especially the oil embargo, are likely to bite with even
greater severity following the United Nations Security Council vote on
November 16 to tighten up on transshipments through Yugoslavia, now
comprising Serbia and Montenegro.
Mr Tomislav Popovic, a Belgrade economist, believes that within three months
Serbia will have grave problems providing its people with energy and food.
He expects that the gross social product (a measurement roughly 10 per cent
less than western gross domestic product calculations) will fall to Dollars
1.7bn in the last quarter of this year, a drop of Dollars 5bn on the same
period three years ago.
Only a quarter of the 2.4m labour force is working and producing
effectively, says Mr Popovic. Unable to keep industry going, state
enterprises have sent about 800,000 workers on 'forced holidays'. Prices
rose by 50 per cent in October, and industrial production fell about 25 per
cent from the same period last year.
The Yugoslav dinar, was devalued from 200 to the dollar to 750 last month.
But on the flourishing black market, hard currency is being sold well above
the new official rate.
Says one western diplomat: 'For the time being it is a cash economy, but if
inflation continues to rise, the dinar will not be worth using.' Given the
near collapse of the banking system, 40 per cent of all transactions are in
cash, compared with 5-8 per cent in an average western economy. Credit cards
are no longer accepted.
Diplomats say even the astronomical inflation rate no longer fully reflects
the catastrophic economic situation. A price freeze covers 42 per cent of
all goods. 'Further, the basket of goods has changed,' says a western
diplomat. 'People don't buy meat, many have stopped buying clothes and they
can't buy newspapers.'
Two private banks, which have close ties to the government, are helping to
keep the social peace by offering high interest rates on dinar deposits. The
banks, Dafiment and Jugoskandic, offer rates of up to 95 per cent per month,
nearly double the official inflation rate. Each night thousands of Belgrade
inhabitants queue up to collect their interest, which enables many to make
ends meet.
The tightened trade embargo may hurt Dafiment and Jugoskandic which
diplomats believe have made enormous profits from sanctions busting. In
spite of the oil embargo, the bank owners have opened up private petrol
stations, licensed by the Serbian authorities.
Sanctions-busting has also encouraged a growing segment of society to turn
to crime, and the black market offers a wide range of wares from petrol to
Kalashnikov rifles. Thanks to sanctions violations about 5-10 per cent of
the population are getting rich by current Yugoslav standards, says Mr
Dobrijvoje Radovanovic, director of the Institute of Criminology.
But Mr Popovic estimates that half Serbia's 9.8m inhabitants are below the
poverty line, earning less than Dollars 370 a year. The huge influx of
refugees from Bosnia and Croatia has also taxed an already overburdened
system.
As the situation deteriorates, the government has introduced further
austerity measures, putting the economy on a virtual war footing.

<TEXT>
THREE of the biggest commercial banks in the US are discussing the
possibility of setting up a joint cheque processing venture.
The move would be aimed at reducing back-office and other administrative and
operational costs at Chemical Banking, Bank of America and NationsBank.
There could also be broader cost savings since these banks are also large
processors of cheques for other banks.
Although none of the banks wished to comment on the talks, first disclosed
in the American Banker, a trade publication, executives with knowledge of
the three-way talks said yesterday that technology for a unified
cheque-processing network might come from International Business Machines.
Bankers said the computer company has also been involved in some of the
exploratory talks.
The idea is to create a joint cheque clearing utility, which might include
more than just the three banks already in talks. Analysts have calculated
that such an entity could reduce processing costs by up to 50 per cent at
some banks.

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (17): Second time lucky -
Profile: Poole Potteries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAUNDERSON-MEYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS second time lucky for Mr Peter Mills when his buy-in/buy-out (bimbo)
of Poole Potteries in Dorset, succeeded in October this year.
The Pounds 3.7m deal (including investment capital) which installed Mr Mills
as the new managing director of the 119-year-old firm, was the realisation
of a thwarted ambition.
He was the predator when two years previously he tried to buy the company
from Pilkington Tile, a subsidiary of BTR, for Dartington Crystal, the
tableware and giftware company of which he was then sales and marketing
director.
In 1990 Dartington had been looking for an acquisition that would give it a
retailing arm for the sale of seconds to tourists. The bid failed, because
Dartington couldn't raise the then well-over Pounds 4m wanted for Poole.
Rockware Group - the glass and packaging company which owns Dartington -
made the mistake of turning to BTR for help in a cash-and-notes deal, and
was itself promptly swallowed by BTR.
The equity funds were raised through Murray Johnstone, County NatWest
Ventures, and debt from Lloyds bank locally. They were advised by west
country investment bank, Rowan Dartington. It helped that the price had
dropped to Pounds 3.7m. (A large part of the price was for the site which
had lost value in a depressed property market).
Murray Johnstone took a major share of the equity, but the deal took the
form of a ratcheted arrangement whereby the management share of equity
increases if the venture performs well. The debt-to-equity ratio was around
a modest 2:1, with only Pounds 1m of senior debt put in on day one.
The buy-out team consisted of Mr Peter Mills, who left Dartington in 1990
and Mr Peter Henness, also formerly of Dartington Crystal. They became
managing director and finance director respectively. The rest of the team
consisted of Mr Peter Davis, who became operations director and Mr David
Walton and Mr Tony Holdsworth - both of Poole Pottery - who became
production and sales directors respectively. Mr Roland Denning, Sock Shop
chairman, became non-executive chairman.
The negotiations over the bimbo took a protracted nine months. 'It was an
anxious time. As to be expected from a Scottish finance house, they went
over every aspect of the business with a fine tooth comb,' says Mr Mills.
'But they were extremely supportive once they had decided to go ahead.
'For example, they put up more money in equity than originally intended, so
that the pottery is very well structured financially.'
Poole is one of Britain's best-known pottery firms. It was set up in 1873
and, in its premises at The Quay on the seafront at Poole, it is an
important tourist attraction, drawing 750,000 people a year. The pottery's
hand-made tableware of the 1920s and 1930s, with their striking floral and
geometric Art Deco patterns, have become collector's items, selling at sale
houses for as much as Pounds 500 an item.
However, in the past decade the pottery had begun to show the result of
neglect in the design department and a general lack of investment.
'It seemed an ideal candidate for a buy-out. There were obvious similarities
with Dartington's, where I was then working as sales and marketing director.
'Also, the pottery had been suffering from neglect - its potential
unexploited, especially in the tourism side of the business,' says Mr Mills.
The new team plans to re-organise the tourist aspect at The Quay and to
re-introduce the once-popular tours of the workplace.
'The root of the problem appeared to be that Poole Pottery was not part of
BTR's core investment strategy. It was acquired almost inadvertently by BTR,
whose target was Pilkington Tiles; the pottery was just part of the
Pilkington parcel,' says Mr Mills.
In the three or four years before the bimbo, Poole Pottery made little or no
profit. 'Performance was flat and the real results easily get lost in a big
group's figures,' says Mr Mills. The new team hopes to build on Poole's
brand name - it consistently comes in the top three in public recognition
surveys of the pottery field.
Mr Mills plans to increase manufacturing capability and improve the
marketing sides. 'The UK trade side is solid and just needs to be developed
further. Exports, which make up 40 per cent of trade sales, also have
massive potential which has never been exploited. It just needs effort.'
The staff response to the bimbo has been positive and already more flexible
working hours have been introduced. This may be partly due to the fact that,
although there is the possibility of some rationalisation, Poole Pottery
plans to increase its workforce by 30 per cent over the next four years.
Staff reaction to a return to private ownership has been favourable,
according to Mr Mills. Of the 190 people employed, at least 50 have been
with the company for more than 20 years,' he says.
Mr Mills claims that this buy-out is to be no quick in-and-out operation.
'We hope to see Poole Pottery in the long run as the core to a group of
brand names in the same fields, so once we have the company growing again,
we'll quite possibly be looking for acquisitions.'

FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (18): Discussions focus on
price - Profile: The Gaymer Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATING a sale price with a vendor who is potentially your biggest
customer is no easy task. It is no surprise, therefore, that Candover
Investments' buy-out of Vine Products and Whiteways, Showerings and
Warninks, the UK wines, spirits and soft drinks suppliers, from Allied-Lyons
required lengthy discussions.
'It meant making sure you could see their point of view and where possible,
within reason, trying to accommodate it. And hopefully they were doing the
same for us,' says Mr Stephen Curran of Candover Investments, which backed
the management team led by Mr John Wilkinson.
Negotiations opened in July 1991 but the deal was not signed until February
1992. Mr Curran says: 'We were in a series of protracted negotiations.
'Price was the main sticking point, but our investigations took time too.'
VPW, Showerings and Warninks businesses produce and market a wide range of
alcoholic drinks, including Gaymer's Olde English, Copperhead and Babycham.
The new company will be named The Gaymer Group Europe and Mr Mike Dowdall,
previously a main board director of Unilever, has been appointed chairman.
VPW and Showerings are based mainly near Bristol and also at Shepton Mallet,
Somerset. Warninks' main facility is in Holland. The combined companies have
1,300 employees.
In the 12 months to February 1991, combined turnover of the three companies
was Pounds 178m with profit before interest and tax of Pounds 23m. The
picture for this year is confused by a change of year end. Mr Curran
believes profits will be lower but that the new company is doing at least a
well as was predicted when the deal was struck.
It was Allied-Lyons who took its time at first. It had to evaluate all
offers and only settled on the managers at the beginning of December.
Candover believes this is because their offer was for both companies.
Candover was attracted to the buy-out because of the strength of the
management team: 'They appeared competent, hardworking, skilled and
sensitive. They worked together, knew their business and they were clearly
keen to do the buy-out,' says Mr Curran.
He says the team's energetic enthusiasm for the deal showed they recognised
that a buy-out demands a great deal of time as well as an opportunity.
Negotiations - suspended during the Christmas period - initially centred on
price: 'Allied-Lyons wanted between Pounds 150m and Pounds 160m but we
settled on Pounds 140m in the end,' says Mr Curran. Allied-Lyons received
Pounds 115m in cash and Pounds 25m in vendor loans.
Equity for the buy-out is being provided by institutions investing through
the Candover 1989 Fund, and CINVen, Legal &amp; General Ventures and Advent
International.
Bank term debt of Pounds 33m and working capital facilities of up to Pounds
35m are being arranged through Barclays Bank and National Westminster Bank
and co-lead underwritten by Barclays, NatWest and Bank of Scotland.
Mezzanine finance of Pounds 15m is being provided by Mithras Investment
Trust and Legal &amp; General Ventures.
These borrowings are necessary since the company tends to produce stock in
the summer which is mainly sold over the Christmas and New Year period.
Once the price was agreed Candover had to conduct a thorough investigation
of the company.
'We had to make sure the sales organisations would blend well together, find
out whether there were any potential economies of scale in manufacture and
ensure that the arrangements with the vendor who is our best customer were
satisfactory to both parties,' Mr Curran says.
'Overall the investigations revealed that the company had been doing well,
but recently not quite so well. We had to satisfy ourselves that dip in
profits was a temporary one.'
Candover also had to satisfy its own board of directors that it was worth
investing in some of the lesser known brands such as Camelot (a form of
perry), Festival Vat (a cider) and Zapple (a speciality drink). The Gaymer
Group Europe's branded portfolio is targeted at the C1, C2 and D
socio-economic groups.
Mr Wilkinson, managing director of the new company, admits some of the
brands have not had top priority in recent years: 'We have launched the
Gaymer Group Europe this year in a major marketing initiative. We are
confident that the planned investment in the brands, plant and people will
create a highly competitive, independent European drinks group.'

VALEO, the French car components group in which Mr Carlo De Benedetti is the
main shareholder through his Cerus holding company, is planning to buy out
the minority shareholders in its listed Italian subsidiary.
Shares in Valeo SpA were suspended in Milan and Turin yesterday pending
details of the offer from the French parent. Under the terms of the
transaction, which has still to be approved by Consob, Italy's stock market
and companies watchdog, Valeo will buy out the 43.6 per cent of Valeo SpA it
does not already own via a share swap and a balancing cash adjustment.
Details will not be released until Consob gives its approval. Somes brokers
criticised it because minority shareholders were not being offered a cash
alternative.
Valeo, which made net profits of FFr545m (Dollars 100m) on sales of
FFr19.87bn last year, said eliminating the minorities in its Italian
operation would boost net consolidated profits by between FFr1 and FFr2 a
share.
The group has sharply raised earnings this year in spite of weak demand.

FT  02 DEC 92 / US-led force set to intervene in Somalia: UN approval near
as Marines are despatched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations Security Council last night reached broad agreement on
authorising a US-led force for Somalia, while an advance party of Marines
was already heading to the starving country.
The general accord emerged from private consultations between diplomats from
the Security Council's 15 member nations.
The council is expected to vote tomorrow or Friday to despatch the force to
Somalia to make sure food gets through to the starving rather than to
looters and local warlords.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, earlier indicated he
preferred a force under more direct UN control.
But Sir David Hannay, Britain's delegate, said there was 'a large degree of
support' for a multi-national force for which the country providing the
largest contingent would also provide the commander.
The Chinese delegate indicated he might abstain because Beijing preferred an
enlargement of the exisiting UN peacekeeping force in Somalia.
The advance party of 1,800 US Marines sailing to Somalia could be in
position off Mogadishu today, ready to land once the UN gives the go-ahead.
US military officials said the Marines could be used to secure airport
facilities, assisting Pakistani troops of the UN peace force already there,
and paving the way for a force of perhaps 15,000-20,000 US troops.
It is not clear how many countries might be willing to contribute
contingents to the proposed US-led force.
The prospect of using US troops in Somalia is causing considerable
trepidation in Washington, where the successful conclusion of Operation
Desert Storm last year has not wholly erased the memory of Vietnam as a
traumatic warning against military involvement in faraway countries.
Somalia does not, by any account, meet the criteria formulated by Mr Caspar
Weinberger, defence secretary under President Ronald Reagan, to guide
decisions on when to commit US forces: intervention may have the support of
the American people, but there is no substantial US national security
interest, nor is it clear what would constitute victory.
White House officials have stressed the limited goal of establishing the
conditions for food aid to start flowing again. They have played down
earlier suggestions that one of the aims would be to re-establish some kind
of Somali government in place of the warring guerrilla factions that have
made it difficult to mount any effective famine relief operation.
Military commanders appear much less worried about the prospect of
intervention in relatively flat and barren Somalia than they are about the
conflict in mountainous Bosnia, where they say outside military intervention
would stand little chance of success.
While recognising that the various Somali guerrilla bands could make life
uncomfortable, Pentagon officials believe that superior training, armaments
and air power would permit a US force to establish control quickly.
US officials said Washington told Mr Boutros Ghali last week it expected US
forces to be in Somalia for two to four months.
After that, conventional UN peacekeeping troops would be able to keep order,
possibly demobilise all Somali factions and smooth the way for a functioning
government in place of the virtual anarchy now prevailing.

BRAZIL has called off crucial talks with the International Monetary Fund
because of 'uncertainties over economic policy'.
The planning and economy ministers and central bank governor had been due to
leave for Washington on Saturday to try to revive an IMF accord signed in
January which collapsed because of Brazil's failure to meet targets.
However, their trip was cancelled after a Brazil congressional commission
delayed its decision on a Dollars 12bn fiscal reform programme essential for
balancing next year's government budget.
The cancellation is the strongest sign yet of the disarray within the
government of President Itamar Franco who took office two months ago as a
result of the impeachment of President Fernando Collor.
Failure to secure an IMF accord could jeopardise Brazil's accord with
creditors over restructuring of its Dollars 44bn commercial debt.

TRADE negotiators in Geneva yesterday resolved to press ahead rapidly with
country-by-country negotiations on cutting tariffs and other barriers to
trade in goods, which form a crucial part of the Uruguay Round of global
trade talks, writes Frances Williams in Geneva.
Other countries urged the US and EC to present details of their farm trade
accord reached a fortnight ago. This is expected to provide the springboard
for the resumed negotiations. According to US officials, the text of the
agreement is awaiting approval by Brussels.
Mr Warren Lavorel, US chief negotiator, said Washington hoped to present a
revised detailed tariff offer before the end of the year. The Round aims to
cut tariffs on average by at least one-third, but the US and EC say they
want to go well beyond that.

<TEXT>
Police sealed off a large part of London's West End early today after
finding a van containing a substantial amount of explosive near Tottenham
Court Road. The discovery followed warnings - purportedly from the IRA -
suggesting four bombs had been placed in the area. Earlier, 27 people were
injured when two IRA bombs exploded in central Belfast.

FT  02 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Upgrades boost for BTR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL con-glomerate BTR moved sharply forward to rate as the day's
best performing FT-SE 100 stock after several brokers upgraded profit
expectations following visits to the company.
The shares jumped 18 1/2 to 517 1/2 p, in brisk trade of 10m after BZW and
James Capel increased current year profits estimates by Pounds 20m to Pounds
1.02bn and by Pounds 15m to Pounds 985m respectively. Mr Mark Cusack at BZW
said of his new forecast, 'efficiency improvements are coming through and
the Hawker Siddeley acquisition is performing ahead of expectations,' while
James Capel reiterated its positive view on 'very early news of signs of a
recovery in the US and Australia'. Further upgradings are expected over the
next few days.
Hong Kong shocks
The fall of 5 per cent in the Hong Kong stock market, as relations between
the British administration and the Chinese government deteriorated, prompted
heavy falls in UK stocks with interests there, notably HSBC, Standard
Chartered and Cable &amp; Wireless.
The most active was HSBC where turnover totalled 12m. Shares in the banking
group tumbled to 493p before picking up to end a net 16 off at 502p. HSBC
shares have been one of the UK market's best performers since the merger
with Midland Bank was effected earlier this year.
Standard Chartered fell 8 to 543p, albeit in much quieter trading, which saw
fewer than 1m shares change hands, with the stock sustained by expectations
that the company will be elevated to the Footsie-100 status for the new
year. Telecoms group Cable &amp; Wireless, which derives well over half of its
income from its stake in Hong Kong Telecom, dropped to 654p before
stabilising to close 6 off at 659p. Turnover was an unremarkable 1.7m
shares.
Asda query
Predictions of an end to Asda's bull run proved correct and the shares fell
back in another day's heavy trading after several brokers turned seller of
the stock. Market attention is now firmly focused on the group's results on
December 18 with talk of a fund-raising excercise doing the rounds. Asda is
said to be in need of a cash injection to boost its capital expenditure
programme which badly lags its rivals. Up to Pounds 100m might need to be
raised, given Asda's debt position. However, a rights issue is not thought
to be a favoured route coming so quickly after last year's and straining
shareholder loyalty. Suggestions in the market say a bond issue might be
preferable. Asda shares retreated 5 1/2 to 52 1/2 p in turnover of 37m, once
again the top traded stock of the day.
Calor move
A couple of exceptionally heavy individual trades in Calor Group shares led
dealers to suspect that SHV, the privately-owned Dutch investment group, had
moved back into the market to increase its stake to just below 50 per cent.
SHV currently has 47.26 per cent of Calor and is allowed to increase its
holding by 2 per cent in the year to next November. SHV's last increase was
announced on November 10. Calor shares held at 224p on turnover of 2.9m.
The oil majors showed signs of struggling as crude oil prices continued to
lose ground, dropping around 40 cents a barrel. BP, helped by a positive
response to the presentation to Scottish institutions, moved up 3 1/2 to
237p. News of the exploration success off the coast of Burma drove Premier
Consolidated up 1 1/4 to 17 3/4 p on heavy turnover of 9.8m shares.
The placing by Warburg Securities of 9.92m Sedgwick shares at a discount of
only 2p to the ruling market price saw Sedgwick close only a penny easier at
144p.
There was little fallout from the demise of Rosehaugh, the market preferring
instead to focus on results from the UK's second biggest property group,
MEPC. Although the figures were in line with expectations, the dire
conditions in the commercial property market meant continuing worries over
the safety of next year's dividend. Net asset values fell from 608p to 465p
and while most analysts are forecasting between 410p and 420p for next year,
at least one leading broker was on 385p and predicting a big dividend cut.
In the meantime, MEPC's hefty discount to the market and high yield meant it
recovered from its initial fall and closed at 337p, off 2.
The launch in the US of Reuters' News2000 system, which enhances Reuters'
news and financial services, was greeted with enthusiasm by the stock market
where Reuters shares jumped 18 to a record 1354p.
The utilities sectors suffered badly during the early part of the session as
institutions continued to switch from the waters and electricity stocks into
the cyclicals. The sectors were additionally unsettled by the Ofwat report
on water standards and delivery costs plus slight disappointment with
results from Norweb, the first of the electricity companies to report
interim figures.
Both sectors rallied strongly, however, closing well above the day's lowest
levels.
Fears for the current year dividend hit Trafalgar House as it reported a
Pounds 30.3m loss and slashed last year's dividend from 18.4p to 6p. The
shares fell 6 to 89p.
Among transport stocks, sellers of Tiphook following last week's strong
performance caused the shares to give up 4 to 275p, in light trading. The
company said yesterday that it had replaced County NatWest and Warburg as
joint brokers with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
The expected disposal at APV duly arrived when the company announced the
sale of its ventilation and warm-air hand-dryer business Vent-Axia Group to
Smiths Industries for Pounds 55.8m. Analysts said the move was positive for
both groups and the shares of the former gained 4 1/2 to 107 1/2 p, while
the latter jumped 9 to 335p.
Trading in Rolls-Royce was boosted by a buy recommendation from County
NatWest and turnover rose to 7.8m as the shares firmed a penny to 101p. The
broker said: 'Rolls-Royce offers investors an outstanding opportunity for
long term capital growth.'
Euro Disney continued to crumble as its two principal bears, Goldman Sachs
and Paribas, succeeded in producing even gloomier forecasts. Mr Nigel Reed
at Paribas increased his projected loss for the French theme park by 5 times
to over FFr1bn for the year ended September 1993. Goldman is on FFr750m. The
shares fell 43 to 725p.
Confident expectations ahead of Granada's results today helped the shares
add 6 to 309p. Analysts forecasts of around Pounds 115m are thought likely
to prove around Pounds 7-8m short. Queens Moat continued to attract
attention with 11m shares traded, 3m of which comprised a bed and breakfast
(tax-related) deal. The good two-way business left the shares steady at 45
1/2 p, talk of a deal with other hotel groups refusing to die away.
A stock overhang - said to be around 1.5m shares - continued to hold back
Kwik Save. The shares fell 3 1/2 to 727 1/2 p.
There was general disappointment in the market with interim profits from
Racal Electronics. The latter's shares, which hit an all-time high last
week, dropped 17, or 11 per cent, to 157p, after the figures were released.
Specialists said that although the results were at the very top end of
market estimates, some of the super optimists were slightly disappointed and
that a very substantial bull position in the stock had been unwound
yesterday. Full-year estimates were being reined in from around the Pounds
55m-mark to the Pounds 52m level.
ACT, the computer group, slipped 2 to 141p, following the placing of a block
of 6.5m shares at 137p late on Monday. The placing was executed in a matter
of minutes by Credit Lyonnais Laing, the stockbroker. ACT is using the cash
to help fund its purchase of NMW Computers and repay the latter's bank debt.

FT  02 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SQUEEZE helped the near month contract in Footsie futures close above the
2,800 level for the first time this year, in a session which saw an
improvement in turnover, writes Joel Kibazo.
Trading in the December contract on the FT-SE began tentatively at 2,782,
some 15 points below Monday's close but quickly improved and was soon
hovering around the 2,800 level after buying from independent traders.
Profit-taking saw it return to 2,782 and it traded in the narrow range up to
2,790 until lunchtime.
A sizeable order from a large securities house took other dealers by
surprise and December jumped forward to the day's high of 2,812. The rest of
the afternoon's trading was dominated by Wall Street, the contract losing
momentum when New York eased and then following it upwards.
December closed at 2,807, up 10 on its previous close and around 9 points
above its fair value premium to cash of about 4. Turnover improved on recent
levels and reached 9,195 contracts. A healthy premium was maintained
throughout the session.
In traded options, the volume in FT-SE 100 options improved on recent levels
reaching 11,359 lots. However, the overall total at 26,838 contracts was
poor. Rolls-Royce was the most actively dealt stock option with a total of
1,389 trades, and was followed by Hanson at 1,138 lots.

FT  02 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities recover to reach new high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S BULLS refused to be discouraged by the setback in the Hong Kong
stock market overnight and, spurred on by strong buying of stock index
futures, drove the FT-SE Index by 13 points yesterday to a new closing high
which was within 8 points of the 2,800 mark. Favourable statistics on the US
economy provided stimulus near the close of trading but the London market
had already turned round convincingly from early losses which had failed to
bring out any institutional sellers.
Although neither the US dollar nor Wall Street stood out yesterday - the Dow
Average was a shade off at the London close - news of a 0.4 per cent gain in
US economic indicators in October and a Purchasing Managers Index at 55 per
cent in November was well-received in the UK market. Improved economic data
from the US over the past week has strengthened hopes for a general revival
in global economies and boosted confidence in the London equity market.
Early trading saw equities give ground smartly with sentiment unsettled by
the 5 per cent fall in Hong Kong after China challenged the agreements with
Britain. HSBC, the London quoted HongKong Bank, fell sharply and the Footsie
was quickly 10.6 down, with the rest of the market cautious on the continued
pressures in the currency markets.
But trading volume was low and traders stressed that there was little
selling pressure. The market quietly rallied until mid-session when a strong
buyer drove the December Footsie contract ahead. The stock market quickened
its pace as it moved above overnight levels and the December contract broke
through the 2,800 mark at its official close.
The stock market peaked just short of 2,800, the day's best reading on the
Footsie of 2,794.3 showing a gain of more than 15 points. With Wall Street
refusing to give a confident lead, the London market closed off the top at a
new closing high of 2,792.0 for a gain on the day of 13.2.
The mood of optimism was unshaken by some disappointing corporate results
and by reverberations from the final collapse this week of Rosehaugh, one of
the leading City of London property development groups of the 1980s.
Equity market volume remained good, with 631.1m shares traded, against
635.7m on Monday when retail business of Pounds 1.1bn maintained the
extended run of good customer turnover in UK equities.
The stock market has now gained nearly 100 Footsie points since the middle
of November; in fact, only a week ago the Footsie slipped back to 2,709.
Investors have taken an increasingly optimistic view of the outlook or
equities as the GATT dispute has calmed down and US statistics on durable
goods orders, GDP, and now leading economic indicators have apparently
turned more positive.
However, some traders warned yesterday that share prices had been squeezed
higher by the absence of sellers in a market suddenly filled with would-be
buyers. Uncertainties still remain regarding the near-term outlook for
interest rates, both in the UK and elsewhere in Europe.
Several strategists yesterday suggested selling into the current rally in UK
share prices but it was clear that their advice was not heeded to any great
extent by the managers of the big investment funds.

FT  02 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Currency speculation colours
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATION about currencies and interest rates continued to influence
continental trading yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was barely changed, having largely ignored comments by Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, that there was no room to ease
monetary policy in the near future. However, the market remains hopeful that
interest rates will be reduced early in 1993. The DAX index closed up 0.55
at 1,544.89 as turnover fell to DM4.5bn from DM4.9bn.
Veba improved DM5.30 to DM354.50 after the group said that it expected its
dividend to remain steady at DM12 and that it planned to continue to reduce
its workforce.
An official report which increased its forecast for new car registrations
for 1992 had little impact on car stocks. Volkswagen, down DM4.50 at
DM263.00, was still feeling the effects of a weekend magazine report which
suggested that the group would make a DM1bn loss in 1992, dealers said.
Preussag was DM4.50 lower at DM347.50 ahead of today's results for 1991/92
which are expected to show an improvement over the 1990/91 period.
PARIS rose further as the franc's weakness, in spite of intervention by the
central bank, fanned speculation of a devaluation in the currency or even
its withdrawal from the ERM. The CAC-40 index ended 20.92 higher at
1,792.29. Trading was indifferent until just before the last hour of trading
when a series of block trades in CAC-40 stocks were put through the market,
lifting turnover to a hefty FFr3.2bn from barely FFr1bn at midday.
Euro Disney bucked the firmer trend, losing FFr3.30 or 5.3 per cent to
FFr59.40 in heavy volume of 1.3m shares following Goldman Sachs's decision
on Monday to treble its estimated pre-tax loss for fiscal 1993. Yesterday an
analyst at a French broker nearly quintupled his net loss forecast for the
1992/93 year to over FFr1bn from the FFr210m he had published only three
weeks earlier.
MILAN ended mixed as selling of industrial blue chips eroded a firmer
opening. The Comit index rose 3.43 to 441.77 in turnover estimated at close
to Monday's L141.7bn.
Fondiaria, the insurer, and its parent company, Gaic, remained targets for
speculators on continued rumours about the future of the insurer. Fondiaria
rose as high as L30,950 before ending L350 lower at L29,600, while shares in
Gaic were suspended to the end of the session when they were fixed L52
higher at L1,402.
AMSTERDAM saw some renewed buying of chemical stocks while Ahold remained
positive following Monday's third quarter results. The CBS Tendency index
gained 0.6 to 104.3.
The market was disappointed by the details of the planned merger between
KNP, Buhrmann-Tetterode and VRG-Groep announced on Monday, with the shares
in the three companies rising only 50 cents, 30 cents and 60 cents
respectively to Fl 29.40, Fl 29.50 and Fl 23.80.
Chemicals improved on bargain-hunting with DSM up Fl 4.20 at DM78.80 and
Akzo Fl 1.70 higher at Fl 134.40. Pirelli Tyre Holding was suspended at Fl
13.70 before announcing that it was cancelling plans for a one-for-one
rights issue and that its second-half loss would be bigger than its previous
forecast.
ZURICH fell back on disappointing economic news and the SMI index finished
down 2.0 at 1,929.2. Chemicals remained active as Ciba-Geigy fell further
following a downgrade. Its bearers lost SFr4 to SFr605.
Financial stocks were firm with UBS bearers adding SFr5 to SFr813 and
Winterthur registered shares putting on SFr20 to SFr2,460.
OSLO jumped 2.3 per cent in active trading as the economic outlook appeared
to improve. The all-share index added 8.36 to 367.30 in turnover worth
NKr426m, with sharpest gains coming in industrial and shipping stocks.
STOCKHOLM weakened on profit-taking following its recent strong run. The
Affarsvarlden index slipped 5.3 to 896.1 as turnover dropped to SKr793m from
Monday's SKr922m.
Volvo B shares weakened SKr17 to SKr340 on news of sharply lower November
new car registrations.
MADRID continued to fall with the general index closing down 1.85 at 212.01
in low turnover of some Pta8.4bn.
VIENNA's ATX index ended 2.38 lower at 760.1. OMV lost Sch8 to Sch626 while
Austrian Airlines fell Sch10 to Sch1,600.
ISTANBUL rallied on bargain-hunting and the 75-share index finished 96.99
ahead at 3,883.23 in turnover estimated at TL199.5bn.

THE Nikkei average fell by 2.1 per cent yesterday as investment trust funds
took profits after the recent rally in share prices, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index fell 370.61 to 17,313.04 after a high of 17,704.01 in
the morning and a low of 17,307.72 just before the close. While prices moved
narrowly in early trading, afternoon selling by dealers and investment
trusts outpaced buying by public funds.
Volume rose marginally to 260m shares from 238m. Declines led advances by
637 to 359 with 133 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks dropped 19.27 to 1,304.08 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose
0.54 to 1,054.21.
Traders said that after the 10.5 per cent rise in the Nikkei average over
the past eight trading days, a decline had been expected, but that overall
sentiment remained positive. 'People were starting to become scared of a
possible crash, and we needed a breather,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko
Securities. Other traders said some investment trusts placed sell orders to
raise cash for redemptions and cancellations.
High-technology issues, which had risen recently on hopes of a US economic
recovery, were hit by profit-taking. NEC fell Y20 to Y675 and Fujitsu lost
Y17 to Y550. Car stocks were also weaker with Nissan Motor down Y13 to Y557
and Toyota Motor retreating Y10 to Y1,410.
The weakness in Nippon Credit Bank, which lost Y140 to Y4,800, dragged down
other banking stocks. Reports, later denied by Nippon Credit Bank, that the
bank had sold off land taken as collateral for troubled loans to a property
agency, prompted selling by discouraged investors. The Industrial Bank of
Japan fell Y50 to Y2,450 and Mitsubishi Bank lost Y60 to Y2,220.
Dealers took profits on speculative theme stocks. Mitsui Mining and
Smelting, the most active issue of the day, fell Y10 to Y498. Aids-related
issues were also weak with Okamoto down Y10 to Y1,100 and Meiji Milk
Products down Y4 to Y940.
Nippon Housing Loan was one of the few bright spots of the day, rising Y13
to Y288 on short-covering.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 187.98 to 18,773.07 in volume of 41.7m
shares. The OSE said trading volume for November surged 36.5 per cent to
429.9m shares as an increasing number of life assurers and banks realised
profits on holdings.
Roundup
HONG KONG suffered its biggest one-day fall since August 1991 as
Sino-British tension continued to unnerve investors. The region's other
markets were also negative.
HONG KONG lost another 5 per cent in volatile trading on reports that China
would repudiate contracts signed by the present authorities after 1997. The
Hang Seng index, which fell to an intraday low of 5,400, closed down 308.92
at 5,501.71 in moderate turnover of some HKDollars 3.85bn.
Financial stocks were among the day's biggest losers with HSBC Holdings down
HK3.50 at HKDollars 54.50 and Hang Seng Bank HKDollars 2.50 lower at
HKDollars 50.00.
SEOUL was disappointed that the central bank failed to cut interest rates
and the composite index declined 3.43 to 659.93 in turnover of Won545.8bn.
Kepco, the electricity generator, lost Won700 to Won21,700.
TAIWAN retreated in thin trading as the weighted index lost 28.25 to
3,646.76 in turnover of TDollars 6.34bn. The financial sector, which has
been relatively strong recently, lost nearly 1 per cent.
AUSTRALIA lost ground in late trading as the local currency weakened against
the US dollar. The All Ordinaries index slipped 3.8 to 1,444.3 having been
briefly revived by the publication of better-than-expected economic data.
Turnover rose to ADollars 237.7m from ADollars 188.2m.
NEW ZEALAND fell back as the market consolidated its recent strong gains.
The NZSE-40 Index lost 8 to 1,539.34 in turnover of NZDollars 50m.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times industrial index eased 5.0 to 1,464.07 although
gains were seen among several banking and industrial blue chips. In KUALA
LUMPUR the composite index was also lower, down 4.66 to 637.23.
MANILA rose on bargain-hunting following Monday's holiday and the composite
index finished 2.90 higher at 1,266.48 in turnover of 168.6m pesos.
BANGKOK traded lower with the SET index losing 3.88 to 861.33 in thin
turnover of Bt4bn.

PRICES on the Caracas Stock Exchange recovered slightly yesterday after a
fall of over 6 per cent on Monday, the first trading day since Friday's
failed coup against the government of President Carlos Andres Perez, writes
Joseph Mann in Caracas.
Monday's decline continued the slump in Venezuelan shares since a failed
military uprising on February 4. The Caracas Stock Exchange index closed at
19,125.61 on Monday, down 35 per cent from the start of the year and 44 per
cent below the 1992 high reached on February 3.
In the currency market, strong support by the central bank limited the
decline in the bolivar. The currency closed at 78.60 bolivars to the dollar
on Monday, down from 78.35 on Thursday, which represents a fall of more than
27 per cent this year.

FT  02 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Caribbean cross-border activity loses
its appeal - Economic worries are to blame
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic difficulties in Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago have
dampened cross-border trading on the Caribbean's stock exchange after its
promising start last year.
Between May 1991, when cross-border trading began, and December of that
year, Jamaican investors were the most adventurous in taking risks on other
markets, by spending Dollars 5.4m on Trinidadian stocks and Dollars 1,600 on
Barbadian shares.
But Trinidadians spent only Dollars 2,000 on Jamaican stocks while buying
Dollars 4m worth in Barbados. For their part, Barbadians favoured Trinidad,
buying Dollars 5m worth of shares but steering clear of Jamaica.
Regional business leaders and stockbrokers were encouraged by this start.
This, they argued, was a new venture for the Caribbean and could, if
successful, strengthen the equity base of many companies which have been
overly dependent on loans for their operations and expansion plans.
Since the start of this year, however, hopes for a continued expansion of
cross-border trading have been dashed by a drop in confidence in the
national markets, brought on by economic difficulties. Between January and
September, Jamaican investors spent Dollars 466,000 on Trinidadian shares
while Trinidadians and Barbadians bought nothing.
'We started last year with a bang, with Jamaicans buying in Trinidadian
companies,' says Mr Anthony Taitt, deputy general manager of the Trinidad
and Tobago Stock Exchange. 'Since December, however, the market in Jamaica
has dried up and Jamaicans have been trying to sell off what they have
bought in Trinidad.'
Activity on the Caribbean exchange has been hit by economic changes in
Jamaica, where the government's deregulation of the foreign exchange market
14 months ago and the floating of the currency led to a steep depreciation
and contributed to inflation of 82 per cent in 1991.
Interest in Barbados has been dampened by problems which have beset what was
one of the more stable economies in the region. Stagnation, brought on by
poor performance of tourism and sugar, the pillars of the economy, deterred
prospective investors who were further worried by rumours of an impending
currency devaluation.
Trinidad and Tobago's oil-dependent economy had contracted for seven
consecutive years until it recorded marginal growth last year. But the
central bank has reported that this recovery has not been sustained.
'I am not disappointed in the level of activity in cross-border trading so
far as I did not anticipate any great volumes when we started,' says Mr Wain
Iton, the manager of the Jamaica Stock Exchange. 'The important thing is
that the mechanism for trading is in place and when the economic conditions
are right, they will be fully used.'
Cross-border trading is part of a wider effort by the members of the
Caribbean Economic Community (Caricom) to integrate their economies and
prepare the ground for a planned common market and monetary union. The next
step is the creation of a Caribbean exchange linking the shares in the three
countries through an immediate electronic transfer of all transactions. The
exchange would be capitalised at about Dollars 1.8bn, with 99 listed
companies.
There is some hope that an economic recovery will breathe new life into
cross-border trading. The Jamaican dollar has stabilised since May and the
country's inflation is expected to fall to 20 per cent this year.
Officials also hope that the creation of new stock exchanges in Caricom will
attract interest. Guyana is creating an exchange which Mr Asgar Ally, the
country's finance minister, says will be similar to that in Jamaica and
Trinidad and Tobago, and which will assist in the privatisation of state
enterprises. Mr Ally says trading on the Guyana exchange will begin by the
middle of next year, and will immediately be part of the Caribbean
cross-border activity.

FT  02 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rally starts to run out

<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER registering strong gains in the four previous days, the rally in US
share prices showed signs of running out of steam yesterday, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 10.80 at 3,295.36,
having spent all but a few minutes of the day in negative territory. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished down 0.62 at 430.73, while
the Amex composite ended 2.14 lower at 392.97 and the Nasdaq composite up
1.22 at 653.95, another record close.
Turnover on the NYSE remained heavy at 259m shares, while rises and declines
were neck and neck at 912 and 914, respectively. A combination of weakness
on overseas markets and profit-taking in the wake of recent gains prompted
the early selling.
Positive economic news at home, however, helped prices stage a modest rally
later, although it proved short-lived and selling again took hold in
mid-afternoon. A 0.4 per cent rise in the October index of leading economic
indicators, and the National Association of Purchasing Management's November
index, which climbed from 50.6 in October to 55.0, was the latest more proof
that the economy is recovering.
Among individual stocks, Digital Equipment, which enjoyed big gains during
Monday's sector-wide rally, dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 32 7/8 in
turnover of 2.3m shares amid rumours of a development problem with the
company's Alpha technology which is at the heart of a future product
strategy. Digital denied that it was experiencing any such problems with
Alpha.
Unisys climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 9 3/4 in turnover of 3.1m shares
after broking house Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross upgraded the stock from a 'hold'
to a 'buy'. Profit-taking left IBM Dollars  1/2 lower at Dollars 67 3/4 ,
and Hewlett-Packard down Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 64 1/8 .
Chemical stocks were in demand, with Du Pont rising Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars
49 1/4 , Dow Chemical putting on Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 54 7/8 . Monsanto,
which rose early on, ended unchanged at Dollars 56 1/8 .
LSI Logic rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 10 in busy trading after the company
cancelled the three-day shutdown that it had planned for later this month
and said it expected to achieve 'solid profitability' in the fourth quarter.
Baker Hughes dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 18 3/8 in turnover of 2.1m
shares after warning that first-quarter net income would come in below
market forecasts of 19 cents a share. The group did say, however, that
profits in the remaining three quarters would be better than in the same
period of 1992.
Canada
TORONTO stocks finished lower after a heavy trading session with most
indices losing ground.
The TSE 300 slipped 9.2 to 3273.7 on 36m shares valued at CDollars 352.9m.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark gains at expense of Dollars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMENTS from the Bundesbank, stressing its commitment to current German
interest rates, put pressure on several European currencies. They also
overshadowed positive economic data in the US which might have been expected
to boost the dollar, writes Peter John.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the German central bank had said in
an interview reported yesterday that there was no room for any easing of
monetary policy in the near term.
Asked whether the German bank was coming under pressure to change its
policy, Mr Schlesinger was quoted as saying: 'As the position now stands,
with such strong monetary growth and price increases, we cannot at present
act on such wishes.'
However, he added; 'We do not have to maintain a certain interest rate level
ad infinitum. If we see that our tasks have been eased by economic
developments, then we can take this into account.'
The currency to suffer most was the French franc which has been languishing
near the bottom of the exchange rate mechanism and has become the focus of
devaluation worries.
The Bank of France bought francs in an apparent effort to hold the franc
above FFr3.41 against the mark several currency dealers said. One said the
central bank had bought FFr30m (Pounds 3.64m) from him at FFr3.4095.
Another trader commented; 'There was fairly heavy and fairly continuous
buying by the French central bank although it was nothing like the
intervention we saw in September.'
He added that as the whole credibility of the ERM comes under scrutiny weak
points are being tested across the whole range. Because Belgium and the
Netherlands are so closely linked to the D-Mark, France is the key indicator
and many are beginning to feel that if it drops through the ERM floor the
mechanism could crumble.
Dealers said the French central bank dipped in to the market throughout the
late morning and early afternoon, but it had not been clear it was trying to
influence prices until its purchases in the afternoon. The franc fell to
DM3.412 from DM3.396.
The US currency also suffered despite better than hoped for figures from the
National Association of Purchasing Managers, construction spending and the
October leading economic indicators.
The dollar closed at DM1.580 in London against DM1.594 previously and
continued weak after the European markets closed. However, it was firmer
against the Yen at Y124.5 against Y124.4.
There was consistent buying of the D-Mark which was generally firmer against
most currencies.
In fact, the only currency to hold out was sterling which surprised the
market by its resilience and lifted to DM2.427 against DM2.412.
Dealers said there was a strong rumour that a big institutional fund had
been a heavy buyer of sterling.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Sterling futures volatile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY market operations took comfort from a stronger pound and the fading of
end-of-month pressures yesterday. Meanwhile, the Bank of England stayed out
of the markets for the first time in more than two and a half years, writes
Peter John.
Most of the day's activity was seen in short sterling where the March
contract opened 8 points off and moved sharply down to 93.19 at one stage,
reflecting an increasingly pessimistic attitude towards the hope of further
interest rate cuts.
The gloom was largely prompted by early comments from the Bundesbank
president Mr Helmut Schlesinger who reaffirmed the German central bank's
commitment to current interest rates.
Nevertheless, the March contract recovered later to close well up at around
93.40 with more than 33,000 lots traded and continued firm in after-hours
dealing.
The December contract which is being influenced by technical factors ahead
of its expiry in two weeks time opened lower but recovered well during the
day to close around 92.75.
Dealers said French franc futures were also traded down heavily at the
opening to reach 90.80 at their low before rallying to close at 91.26.
They added that volatility was increasing in the markets as a number of
people were starting to close down their positions towards the end of the
year.
Short-term interest rates were easier, partly as a result of the Bank of
England staying away.
In addition, Japanese banks, which have been taking funds heavily ahead of
the year end, stood back after having rolled over many of their positions at
the end of November.
Meanwhile, following the record level of central bank help on Monday when
nearly Pounds 4bn was provided the bank announced no shortage yesterday for
the first time since April 3 1990.
The absence of the shortage was explained by an unexpectedly high level of
exchequer transactions, which came in at Pounds 365m. Also the bankers'
balances, the money which the clearing banks have to hold to cover their
deposit liabilities, were Pounds 230m above target.
These positions were offset by treasury bills, maturing assistance and bills
for repurchase.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia misses US grain loan
repayment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS THAT Russia has again been suspended from a US grain credit guarantee
programme because it had missed a payment deadline depressed grain prices
slightly in Chicago yesterday morning, although traders did not yet believe
that Russia's credit problems would reduce US grain exports.
'We see this as an ongoing saga. The USDA (US Department of Agriculture) is
painting this as an operational problem that is based on Russia's lack of
hard currency and the unfavourable dollar/rouble exchange rate,' said Mr
Daniel Basse, grain analyst for Chicago-based AgResources. 'It's a pothole
for the market.'
For the second time in as many weeks, a US bank notified the USDA that
Russia was behind on payment of US-backed agricultural loans. A missed
payment automatically suspends Russia from the programme. The cash-poor
country is dependent on credit guarantees for further grain purchases from
the US. Russian officials in Moscow said yesterday payments would be made as
quickly as possible, but did not suggest a payment date.
The Dollars 4.5m payment from Russia was due on Monday. Last week, Russia
was late on Dollars 10.9m in payment to four different banks. It was
suspended from the USDA programme for one and a half days, until payment was
forwarded.
The problem is expected to intensify as payments in the three-year
commercial loan programme fall due almost daily. Russia's has borrowed about
Dollars 4.9bn in guaranteed loans since the programme started in January,
1991.
Russia has already used most of its available loan guarantees. From this
year's allocation the country has just Dollars 81m in credits for wheat and
Dollars 30m for pork remaining. A second tranche of Dollars 275m in credit
guarantees is expected to be allocated on January 1.
Some lower-profile countries in the USDA food credit programme routinely
miss payments and undergo temporary suspensions. Traders believe Russia's
struggling economy may put that country on the same footing.
Chicago wheat futures prices were hardest hit by the news, with wheat for
December delivery closing down 4 1/2 cents at Dollars 3.75 1/4 a bushel.
December maize futures closed 1 3/4 cents lower at Dollars 2.10 3/4 a bushel
and January soyabeans closed down 4 cents at Dollars 5.59.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Siberia's forgotten copper mine
 -The battle to develop the giant Udokan deposit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TUCKED AWAY in a remote Siberian mountain chain, at the end of rugged
snow-covered track, is one of the world's biggest and until now most
neglected, copper mines. Almost half a century since it was discovered, the
Udokan deposit in Russia's eastern Chita region has become the subject of a
fierce battle over who will exploit it.
An international tender that closes in just two weeks is set to attract bids
from major mining companies, including Britain's RTZ, BHP of Australia,
Canada's Placer Dome, US companies Phelps Dodge and Cyprus Mining and
Japan's Marubeni Corporation and Mitsubishi.
It is not just 20m tonnes of copper that are at stake in the Dollars 1bn
project, which will only start production towards the end of the century.
Udokan has become a crucible for a debate over how the government should
reconcile its quest for foreign investment with its newly-advertised desire
to help Russian industry switch to a market system and civilian products
after decades of catering primarily to the military.
Having turned to Russian enterprise managers for political support at the
Congress of People's Deputies (the full parliament), which opened yesterday,
the government will be under pressure to promote their interests when it
takes the final decision over the Udokan contract.
This will mean either giving the contract to a Russian bidder, or securing
as much sub-contracting work as possible for Russian enterprises. Apparently
keeping its options open, an industrial consortium grouping state-owned
enterprises such as heavy engineering giant Uralmash, has teamed up with the
only Russian competitor in the tender. But its members have also made
presentations to foreign companies registered as tender participants by the
tender committee.
Involving as much Russian technology and manpower as possible is just one of
several criteria set by the tender committee for companies to consider as
they put together proposals that are formally for a feasibility study but
involve spelling out basic plans for developing the mine.
This will include proposals for the construction of a copper mill near the
mine to turn ore into concentrate, for a power station to provide the
project with electricity and heating, and amenities for at least 2,000 mine
workers.
Participants must also undertake to observe the strictest standards of
environmental protection and contribute to the welfare of local inhabitants,
including a minority nomad people which fears its reindeer-breeding and
hunting will be harmed by the mining development.
Mr Alexander Rubtsov, a consultant to the regional government in Chita as
well as a member of President Boris Yeltsin's industrial advisory committee,
maintains that 'the contract won't be given to Russian companies just
because they are Russian'.
But he says the Udokan Mining Company, presented as the only 'Russian'
competitor in the race even though it is half-owned by two little-known
western companies, SFW and Somerset Holdings, has the necessary finance and
know-how to qualify it for the project. By way of argument, he points to the
fact that it is being advised by Fluor Daniel, a San Francisco-based company
with years of experience putting together international mining projects. (In
a possible conflict of interest, the Chita regional government was until
recently one of the 'Russian' shareholders).
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank hired to help the Russian government
attract foreign capital, has worked hard to make the tender correspond to
international standards in the belief that the project will be most
efficiently handled by a foreign company. Participants of this view argue
anyway that any foreign company will have to use Russian labour and some
Russian suppliers.
Whichever view prevails, both will involve combining Russian labour and
suppliers with foreign expertise and capital: the differences relate to
whether foreigners or Russians will control the project, and whether
economic efficiency will be the main criterion for determining the winner.
For local officials and inhabitants of Chita's northernmost Kalarsky
district, which is home to the mine, the project is a chance to attract
wealth and jobs to an area bursting with minerals ranging from strategic
metals to coal. Far from the politics of Moscow, the local administration
also believes the district's needs will best by met by a foreign company
with the latest mining technology and lots of dollars to spend on improving
local living conditions.
'We want the most advanced technology with the least damage to the
environment. We don't want our district to be turned into a test-site for
Russian industry,' says Ms Alla Scherbak, the official responsible for the
district's economic affairs.
Mr Yevgeny Ivashchenko, head of the district administration, is also
confident that foreign companies will secure building work for thousands of
workers who helped him build the BAM railway link in his previous job as
construction engineer.
The Baikal-Amursky railway itself also hopes for a new lease of life. It is
still operating at just 50 per cent capacity because the old Soviet state
ran out of funds to develop the Udokan-style mining projects it was designed
to serve.
For the Russian government, the Udokan project has so far been free of the
fierce wrangling between local and central government (over which foreign
company should win), which made a shambles of an earlier tender for oil and
gas off Sakhalin island. It remains to be seen whether it will be able to
keep the tender free of infighting of a different kind, and reconcile
conflicting national interests.

Base metals prices were mostly lower at the end of another active London
Metal Exchange session with selling pressure generally winning the day.
COPPER prices were lower following the failure of an upside move on Monday
and were also pressured by pricing sales in the morning that contributed to
a slide below Dollars 2,200 a tonne for three months metal. The three months
price closed at Pounds 1,445.50 a tonne, down Pounds 27 on the day. Trade
selling pushed three months ZINC down Dollars 38 to Dollars 1,098.50 a tonne
at the close and further losses were sustained in afterhours trading. Nickel
was also weak following news of a big rise in LME stocks. But the ALUMINIUM
market was resilient, despite a very large rise in LME stocks, as heavy
trade buying and short-covering rallied the market from support around
Dollars 1,210 a tonne for three months metal. The price closed at Dollars
1,219.75 a tonne, down just Dollars 1.75 on the day. At the London Futures
and Options Exchange COCOA prices finished with trimmed gains as sterling's
late rise against the dollar helped to check an earlier advance.

THE UK has tried to break the deadlock over reform of the European

involve a radical departure from Britain's long-standing support for banana
quotas.
The move will dismay Caribbean exporters, who have lobbied the UK hard to
protect the current quota system that protects their fragile and
banana-dependent economies. But a tariff-based import regime would remove
the prospect of the EC coming into direct conflict with the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which under the Uruguay Round of world trade
reforms is calling for tariffs to replace quotas in all farm trade.
An unofficial UK document described as a 'non-paper' and entitled
'Reflections on Alternative Ways Forward', leaked to the Financial Times,
invites views on two options:
A flat-rate tariff on 'dollar bananas' imported from cheaper, high-volume
exporters from Latin America;
A two-tier tariff system, with a lower tariff (10-14 per cent has been
talked of) on dollar bananas up to a certain quota level and a higher tariff
(perhaps 70 per cent) above that quota level.
The 'non-paper' emphasises that 'any final arrangements would have to be
capable of meeting the Community's Lome obligations, and its equivalent
obligations to its own producers, while taking account of the position in
relations to Gatt.'
The EC is hopelessly divided on the issue of banana trade reform. Change has
been forced by creation of the single market from January 1 next year. After
this date, the cheaper dollar bananas at present imported by Germany,
Denmark and the Benelux countries cannot legally be barred from any other
European market. This threatens the collapse of quota regimes agreed under
the Lome Convention, which give former British and French colonies, and
territories like the Canary Islands, privileged access to the EC market.
Community officials are now certain that no agreement is possible by January
1. There is no sign so far that the British 'non-paper' can break the
blocking minorities on either side of the debate - Germany, the Benelux and
Denmark firmly against a quota system, and France, Spain, Portugal firmly
against tariffs.
Plans are now being made for interim arrangements to come into force in
January to police the EC market, preventing a flood of dollar bananas into
France, the UK, Spain and Portugal until agreement on reform is found. One
observer said the interim danger was less from big dollar banana exporters
like Dole or Chiquita of the US, than from small truckers who might try to
reap a windfall gain from price differences across the community of up to 25
per cent between dollar bananas and those from the Caribbean.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee pact deadline extended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEADLINE for negotiations on a new coffee pact was extended by three
months from December 31 as talks in London drew to an inconclusive close
yesterday.
However, prices on the world markets were rising yesterday, mainly because
other factors had emerged to push the International Coffee Organisation
negotiations to the sidelines.
The rise in New York began on Monday as traders returned from an extended
Thanksgiving Holiday. The March arabica contract rose through resistance
levels to close 2.65 cents ahead at 73 cents a lb on Monday, and continued
upwards yesterday, trading at 75.55 cents near the close. In London the
January robusta contract rose close to the Dollars 1,000-a-tonne level.
Ms Judy Ganes, analyst with Merrill Lynch, said that two weeks ago if
traders had returned from holiday to read reports of an impasse at the ICO
the price would have turned down. The extension to the deadline had bought
more time, but in addition the mood of the market had changed, she
suggested.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London brokers, said the main
reason behind the rise was technical tightness, with traders surprised at
the slowness of Brazilian marketing. The 1992-93 crop had been forecast to
be between 18m and 22m bags, and had come in at 19m bags. 'People who had
been cynical about the forecasts suddenly realised they were genuine,' said
Mr Eagles.
In addition the Colombians had delayed January export registrations and
Central American crops were running late.
European roasters were thought to be short of coffee, and while stocks are
high, they were in strong hands, said Mr Eagles.
Certified stocks of coffee for delivery on to the New York market also fell
for the first time for months this week, although by only 8,321 bags to
5.318m bags.
The ICO last night agreed to meet again at the end of January. One London
trader described the past 10 days of talks as 'mildly positive as they were
not negative'.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: French bonds rally as speculation
increases over devaluation of franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH government bonds rallied up to half a point on hopes of lower
interest rates, as the performance of the French franc in the foreign
exchange markets continued to come under close scrutiny.
Dealers said that as the French franc came under pressure against the D-Mark
 -moving from DM3.40 to approach DM3.41 - there was increased speculation
that the French currency might be devalued or even pulled out of the
European exchange rate mechanism, paving the way for the Bank of France to
cut domestic interest rates.
The December bond future contract ended at 110.16, up 0.50, while in the
cash market the yield on the bond due 2003 ended at 8.26 per cent, against
its previous close of 8.33 per cent.
THE Bundesbank again stressed its commitment to keeping domestic interest
rates high in order to conquer inflation, putting a dampener on several of
the European government bond markets at the opening yesterday.
The German government bond market fell in the morning following the
publication of a newspaper interview with Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, who said there was no room for monetary policy easing
in the near-term.
The March Euromark futures contract fell sharply from 92.11 to 91.92 as
hopes of lower interest rates were dashed.
However, after a weak start to the day, German government bonds picked up
and prices closed either slightly firmer or little changed. The Liffe bund
futures contract, which closed Monday at 91.04, fell to a low of 90.93 and
then traded up to 91.05 by late afternoon.
Treuhand, the German privatisation agency, issued DM4.0bn of 10-year bonds
with a coupon of 7 3/8 per cent and at an initial price of 100.50. The bond
was priced to yield 7.30 per cent at issue. Additional portions of the bond
will be sold via the traditional bond consortium, the results of which are
due today
Dealers said the issue was not well received. While the issue is deliverable
into the DTB bund futures contract, it will not be deliverable into the
Liffe bund contract until the June 1993 delivery month.
US Treasury prices were mixed across the maturity range yesterday in the
wake of more bullish economic news.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 100,
yielding 7.561 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  1/16
at 99 19/32 , yielding 4.824 per cent.
Although the day's economic news was predominantly positive, which is
usually bad news for bonds, the market managed to post solid gains at the
long end. This was primarily because investors do not fear a revival of
inflation, and because they had already discounted the day's statistics,
which included the October index of leading economic indicators, which rose
0.4 per cent, and the November National Association of Purchasing
Management's index, which climbed from 50.6 in October to 55.0 last month.
Later in the day, shorter-dated paper was sold off following comments from
Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, about the possibility of
lowering the Fed's target range for M2 - the broadest measure of money
supply. Although such a move would be made on purely technical grounds,
dealers said it would bring current M2 growth clearly into the target range,
thus giving the Fed a reason not to cut interest rates again.
UK government bonds rose about  3/8 of a point ahead of today's Pounds 2.5bn
gilt auction, making up some of the ground lost on Monday. Dealers noted a
squeeze on gilt prices ahead of the auction of the 8 per cent gilt due 2003.
JAPANESE government bonds closed higher. The Nikkei stock average ended down
370.61 points at 17,313.04, leading to hopes that the Bank of Japan will
ease monetary policy.

FT  02 DEC 92 / International Bonds: Domestic and foreign enthusiasm greets
UK's Dollars 3bn Euro-issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government accelerated the pricing on its Dollars 3bn 10-year
Eurobond after what joint bookrunners Credit Suisse First Boston and S. G.
Warburg Securities described as a textbook distribution.
Demand was reported to be evenly spread across the far east, middle east,
continental Europe and the UK, where there was slightly higher than expected
interest from domestic institutions. Some of the UK investors are thought to
have switched out of US Treasuries to buy the bonds.
The issue, the biggest international dollar bond yet, was priced yesterday,
a day ahead of schedule, to yield 22 basis points over US Treasuries.
This is at the bottom end of the indicated range, and is said to represent
the tightest pricing yet for a sovereign 10-year borrowing, other than on
tax-related deals. The coupon was set at 7 1/4 per cent.
The government was widely commended for the size and the pricing of the
issue, which neatly rounds off the Ecu10bn foreign currency borrowing
programme announced on September 3.
Earlier market chatter, which some bankers dismissed contemptuously, had
suggested the amount might be as much as Dollars 4bn to Dollars 5bn, with
pricing in the 18 to 20 basis points range.
There was never any contemplation of an increase, said the bookrunners,
despite the warm reception. There will be no further borrowing under the
programme unless an unmissable opportunity presents itself to refinance the
Ecu5bn revolving credit facility.
The only reported signs of disappointment came from houses who said their
tickets were too small and from New York investors disappointed that the
borrower did not opt for the global issue structure.
Traders reported that good two-way activity in early trading after the issue
broke syndicate confirmed its popularity and liquidity.
'We're naturally very pleased with the outcome and feel that these fine
terms reflect very well on the credit standing of the UK govern-ment,' said
Mr Ian Plenderleith, associate director of the Bank of England responsible
for market operations.
Other deals in an exceptionally busy day were overshadowed by the UK's
borrowing. The volume of equity warrant bonds from Japanese issuers caused
some concern among lead managers. They noted, however, that the issues were
helped by being relatively small and, in the case of three out of four of
the dollar issues, being guaranteed by banks. The guarantees helped cut the
coupons slightly on these deals from otherwise prevailing levels.
KfW International's Pounds 150m 5 1/2 -year bond was described as a touch
demanding in comparison with existing paper. KfW is understood to have
swapped the proceeds of the BZW-led transaction into floating rate dollars
at between 20 to 25 basis points under the London interbank offered rate.
The rash of collared floater issues continued with a Dollars 150m 10-year
deal for Eurofima, the Basel-based rolling stock company, through Goldman
Sachs. The issue's slightly long payment date is thought to be its one
drawback, although Goldman Sachs reported it had been well received,
particularly in Switzerland.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew reopened the collared FRN it launched earlier for
Electricite de France, in response to existing demand. The amount was
increased to Dollars 150m from the original Dollars 100m.
Belgacom, the 100 per cent Belgian state-owned telephone monopoly, has
become the first Belgian corporate borrower to be awarded a long-term
triple-A rating for its debt, albeit only for debt denominated in Belgian
francs.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, assigned the rating to a
BFr15bn, eight-year 8.2 per cent bond which was launched yesterday through
Generale de Banque and Banque Paribas.
This marks the utility's first public borrowing in its new name and without
an explicit state guarantee, although S&amp;P notes that the government will
have 'economic and political incentives to assure timely support'.
Belgacom was previously called Regie des Telephones et Telegraphes. Partly
thanks to the size of the borrowing, the largest ever public issue in
Belgium, international investors might be approached, particularly those in
the Netherlands and Luxembourg.
