FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Pegasus shares fall 42p as chief executive
leaves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Pegasus tumbled 42p to 86p yesterday following news that Mr
Jonathan Hubbard-Ford, chief executive, was leaving and that the USM-quoted
designer of accounting software and supplier of forms would incur trading
losses in the five months to December 31, its new year-end.
This would result in 'a small loss from normal trading activities' in the
current 17-month period.
However, the company added that at the pre-tax level it would be in the
black, thanks to the sale in September of 25 per cent of Stockforms to
Deluxe Corporation of Minnesota for Pounds 1.7m cash.
This would appear in the year-end results as a Pounds 1.25m exceptional
gain, it said.
In the 12 months to July 31 pre-tax profits declined to Pounds 655,000
(Pounds 1.67m).
Mr Derek Moon, non-executive chairman, said that Pegasus had been forced to
reappraise its short-term strategies and, in the company's words, 'the board
is taking steps to reduce costs and defer expenditure in line with
anticipated launch dates of new products', or 'it is readjusting marketing
initiatives started by the chief executive' in Mr Moon's.
He said this had thrown up 'a disagreement over policy' between Mr
Hubbard-Ford, chief executive only since April, and the rest of the board.
Mr Hubbard-Ford will remain as a director for the time being, and until a
new chief executive can be found, the remaining executives and the senior
managers will run the company.
Cash balances at November 30 amounted to Pounds 2.5m. At July 31 they were
Pounds 2.62m (Pounds 3.27m).

FT  26 NOV 92 / Chairman of fund manager Henderson Administration quits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR David Backhouse, chairman of fund managers Henderson Administration,
resigned suddenly yesterday, saying that regulators have questioned his
activities as managing director of a small bank which went into
administration two years ago.
'The reasons for my resignation are unconnected with Henderson,' Mr
Backhouse said. 'I was managing director of Authority Bank between August
1986 and April 1990. Regulatory bodies have recently expressed concern with
my own role during this period,' he said in a statement issued through a
firm of solicitors. While Mr Backhouse did not specify which regulators were
involved, it is believed to be the Bank of England which had regulatory
authority for the bank.
Mr Backhouse, who comes from a well-connected City family, also resigned as
a director of Witan Investment Company. He said that while he intended to
'respond fully' to regulators' concerns, it would not be in Henderson's best
interests to remain its chairman while he did so.
Mr Benjamin Wrey, Henderson's deputy chairman who is to replace Mr
Backhouse, said that the firm immediately notified Imro, the self-regulatory
body for the fund management industry, of his actions.
The move, he said, came at a regularly scheduled board meeting yesterday
morning and directors had no inkling of the affair until shortly before
then.
Authority Bank went into administration on December 11 1990 with assets of
more than Pounds 40m. Its creditors were said to be mostly Latin American
depositors, although payments have been made to UK depositors by the Bank of
England-run Deposit Protection Board.
The bank was a subsidiary of Authority Investments, a quoted company also in
administration. Henderson had been a big investor in Authority Investments.
Henderson, which has recently announced plans to acquire investment trust
company Touche Remnant from Societe Generale, said that the resignation will
have no effect on the merger. Mr Paul Manduca, chairman of Touche Remnant,
said: 'Our negotiations with Henderson are proceeding well and I don't see
David's unfortunate departure has any bearing on the process.'

FT  26 NOV 92 / A testing time for gilts / A look at prospects for the UK
government bond market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next year is likely to be an uncertain one for the UK government bond
market. After the strong rally in gilt prices over the past two years, the
outlook has deteriorated for several reasons: the scope for further interest
rate cuts is limited; the gilt market will be flooded with new supply; and
many investors, who are nervous about the prospects for sterling and the UK
economy, believe they can obtain higher returns - with less risk -
elsewhere.
Institutional investors have reaped considerable profits from the gilt
market over the past two years. Bond markets tend to perform well in a
recession, boosted by falling interest rates: with the steady fall in the
base rate from 15 per cent in 1989-90 to its current level of 7 per cent,
gilts have performed well.
However, the scope for further cuts in the base rate appears limited to one
or two percentage points in the near term. 'The feeling in the market is
'we've had everything we can get, let's get out',' says one gilt-edged
marketmaker.
With the fall in bank and building society deposit rates, some private
individuals are eager to lock into gilts to achieve a higher return, and
gilt-edged marketmakers have reported strong demand from the retail sector
in recent weeks.
But Mr Richard Royds, managing director of the unit trust arm of Mercury
Asset Management, the fund management group, points out that many retail
investors are keener to invest in global bond funds than in plain gilt unit
trusts. 'Private investors think there is not as much to go for in gilts as
in international bonds: given that German interest rates will have to come
down soon, there is much more to go for with the international story.'
Of greater concern to investors is the heavy funding burden facing the gilt
market. The government is forecasting a Public Sector Borrowing Requirement
(PSBR) for 1993-94 of 7 per cent of GDP - or an estimated Pounds 44bn.
Taking into account the repayment of maturing debt, the Bank of England will
have to issue about Pounds 50bn to Pounds 55bn of gilt-edged stock in the
next financial year, or roughly Pounds 1bn of gilts a week. 'The numbers
just look daunting,' says Mr John Shepperd, UK economist at SG Warburg
Securities.
'There's supply as far as the eye can see . . . it's going to be an uphill
climb to issue that amount,' says Mr Roger Gray, head of fixed income and
currency at Rothschild Asset Management.
Admittedly, the forecast PSBR for 1992-93 is large too - Mr Norman Lamont,
chancellor of the exchequer, predicted Pounds 37bn in his Autumn Statement -
and the gilt market has digested the heavy issuance of new stock so far
relatively easily. But that was against a rather different backdrop:
investors were willing to buy stock while the prospects for lower interest
rates and lower inflation were good, and while sterling was a member of the
exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
Next year's funding will be more difficult to achieve. 'The market is not
going to be aided by hopes of lower inflation and lower interest rates this
time,' says one gilt-edged marketmaker.
Sterling's membership of the ERM of the European Monetary System since
October 1990 proved a strong lure to investors during 1991 and early 1992.
Foreigners - particularly Europeans - felt more comfortable with sterling in
the ERM as it reduced the exchange rate risk on their gilt investments. More
importantly, membership of the ERM was seen as exerting a much-needed
economic discipline, forcing the government to keep inflation under control
and allowing it to cut interest rates from their peak levels in 1989-1990.
But sterling's ignominious departure from the ERM in September means
overseas investors are less likely to invest in gilts because of the
exchange rate risk. Foreigners were net sellers of gilts in August and
September to the tune of Pounds 1.9bn, mainly because of sterling's
battering in the foreign exchange markets. Many are still wary of the gilt
market for currency reasons.
Mr Herve Langlet, international bond portfolio manager at Indosuez Gartmore
Gestions which manages funds on behalf of European and Japanese investors,
says: 'The recent floating of sterling makes (foreign) investors very
uneasy: a drop in the pound can obliterate any gain in the bond investment,
and if there is a further cut in UK interest rates it could lead to a
further weakening in the currency.'
Added to which, both domestic and overseas investors are starting to worry
about the outlook for inflation following sterling's exit from the ERM and
the swift base rate cuts which followed its departure.
'We see inflation pulling up at the end of 1993, and gilts will worry about
it beforehand,' says Mr Chris Dillow, UK economist at Nomura International.
Given the combination of worries about sterling, inflation and the heavy
funding pressures, fund managers point out that yields on gilts relative to
other European bond markets will have to increase in order to attract
institutional money and fund the government's borrowing requirement.
Fund managers point out that they can achieve more attractive returns from
the French government bond market, where the economic outlook in terms of
growth and inflation is rosier than for the UK.
If the Bundesbank were to lower interest rates that would certainly provide
some relief for the gilt market. It would help sterling to stabilise against
the D-Mark and would precipitate a round of rate cuts in continental Europe,
resulting in lower yields in the European bond markets relative to gilt
yields.
But failing a cut in German rates, gilt yields will probably have to rise to
attract institutional investors.
'At the moment I can see no way the gilt market can achieve the necessary
level of funding,' says the fixed income manager for one of the leading fund
management groups. 'The government deficit will be financed but the question
is: at what price will the money flow into the government's coffers? Yields
will simply have to rise in order to increase the attractiveness of gilts.'
Mr Gray of Rothschild agrees: 'There is a huge volume of gilts in the
pipeline. If it is to find its way into institutional portfolios, yields
will have to be sufficient to tempt the portfolio managers to hold stock.'

FT  26 NOV 92 / Reluctant MPs vote to tighten their own belts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HUMAN TRAGEDY of the recession is finally being grasped at Westminster.
Faced with a government proposal to freeze their salaries for a year, MPs
cast aside such esoteric matters as the Maastricht treaty to debate
something about which they are genuinely both knowledgeable and passionate -
their own remuneration.
The controversy is not new. According to House of Commons' records, the
question has been a live issue since 1322 when knights received an
attendance allowance of four shillings a day.
Scaled up to take into account compounded inflation, that may well be a more
generous sum than today's base Pounds 30,854 salary, although no one was so
ungracious as to make the point.
Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, led off the debate by arguing
that, as cabinet ministers had forgone their pay rise, MPs should do the
same.
This, he explained, was a goodwill gesture to the several million low-paid
public sector workers who this month heard they must endure a 1.5 per cent
ceiling on their wage rises.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, his opposite number from the Labour benches, described
the policy as a smokescreen intended to 'create an illusion of fairness'.
Top salaries for such people as judges would not be affected, she pointed
out. As Labour opposed the pay ceiling for setting an unacceptable
precedent, she argued, logic suggested it should oppose a freeze for MPs.
Such logic does not extend to Labour's front bench, who for public relations
purposes chose to abstain.
In an unseemly interlude, Mrs Beckett's flow was interrupted by Dame Elaine
Kellett-Bowman, a feisty Tory backbencher, with an ungallant reference to
Mrs Beckett's employment of her husband as a government-paid personal
assistant. Her opponent returned the compliment with a reference to Mr
Kellett-Bowman's comfortable seat on the Euro-gravy train as an MEP.
Less charitably still, Labour MPs began dredging the members' interests
directory to expose the greed of their opponents. Several, however, made the
mistake of listing membership of a Lloyd's syndicate as a benefit.
After itemising an armful of his own directorships, Mr Patrick Nicholls
replied for the Tories that Labour MPs felt strongly on the issue because
they were unemployable outside the House.
He added the observation that an MP's pay now amounted to 87 per cent of
that of the deputy chef of the members' dining room - without, however,
passing judgment on which job was more socially useful.
In the event, MPs bit back their resentment, swallowed the humbug that had
suffused the House all day, and voted by 321 votes to 103 to tighten their
belts.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Kohl hits out at far-right threat: Chancellor defends
contribution by foreigners in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR HELMUT KOHL, the German chancellor, yesterday strongly defended the 6m
foreigners living in the country, and said that rightwing extremists were
threatening democracy.
His warning came as the head of Germany's internal security service called
for an immediate ban on extreme rightwing organisations and the confiscation
of their property.
Mr Kohl was speaking in the parliament three days after neo-Nazis killed a
Turkish mother and her two daughters at Molln, near Hamburg. He said:
'Whoever falls in with this (wave of) xenophobia should consider that
without these foreigners, the affluence of this country would not have been
possible at all.'
He added that foreigners living in Germany had originally been invited by
the government to help rebuild the economy destroyed after the defeat of
Nazi Germany. 'They had contributed 9 per cent, or more than DM230bn (Pounds
95bn) to the gross national product of the reunified country in 1991,' he
said.
'We must not forget that we asked many of them to come here . . . and it's
also true that many of these foreigners are still in (menial) jobs that we
Germans did not want to take.'
However, in an attempt to avoid alienating the right wing, Mr Kohl said
leftwing extremists were also undermining the country's democracy. Interior
ministry officials have repeatedly said radical rightwingers were
responsible for most of the violence and attacks against foreigners.
In a violent incident yesterday, a gang of neo-Nazi youths attacked
prefabricated homes for foreign asylum-seekers in the south-western town of
Weisenheim am Sand, smashing the windows but causing no injuries.
In the city of Kiel, a 16-year-old was charged with arson and attempted
murder for allegedly throwing two Molotov cocktails at a house where
foreigners were thought to live.
Mr Eckart Werthebach, president of the federal office for the protection of
the constitution, warned of the danger that skinhead gangs might become a
'military arm' of neo-Nazi organisations if they were not outlawed.
Neo-Nazi groups had only a few hundred members, he said, whereas there were
an estimated 4,200 members of skinhead gangs.
He said the largest number of extreme rightwingers were the 40,000-odd
members of the Deutsche Volksunion (DVU) and National Democratic Party
(NPD), without mentioning the Republicans, who claim some 23,000 members.
In Berlin, Mr Yilmaz Karahasan, a leading member of the city's large Turkish
community, pleaded with his countrymen not to seek any revenge. Mr
Karahasan, a member of the giant IG Metall engineering union, said resorting
to violence would play into the hands of neo-Nazis.
An opinion poll showed 83 per cent of Germans were afraid of rightwing
terrorism.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Government to test Pounds 1.5bn of services against market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CENTRAL government activities ranging from running the national lottery to
providing the Department of the Environment with economists could be
contracted out to the private sector under plans announced yesterday by Mr
William Waldegrave, the public service minister.
This marks a fundamental shift in Whitehall's approach to the range and
scale of activities considered for contracting out.
Publishing a white paper on the Citizen's Charter initiative, Mr Waldegrave
said some Pounds 1.5bn of services - about 10 per cent of central government
running costs - would be tested against the market in the coming year.
Previous market-testing moves have resulted in an average 25 per cent
saving.
Catering, information technology and internal audit could also be contracted
out.
Mr Waldegrave emphasised the importance he attached to carrying out opinion
polls to discover people's views on public services. From early next year,
polls are expected every six months.
Another novel element in the white paper is the establishment of a
'complaints task force'. It will advise on improving public access to
complaints procedures, and consider how methods of redress might be
simplified. In effect, it replaces earlier plans for panels of lay
adjudicators to offer arbitration services.
Mr Waldegrave said about 90 per cent of the targets set in the original July
1991 charter had been met or were 'in train'. The most prominent failures to
meet standards came from British Rail.
While Mr Waldegrave promised further charters, including ones covering
patients' dealings with their doctors, and for further and higher education,
he made it clear the emphasis would shift towards upgrading standards.
The much-delayed Courts Charter, guaranteeing national standards of service
and facilities for court users such as jurors or victims in England and
Wales, finally appeared yesterday.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow public services minister, said the basic idea of
the Citizen's Charter was good, but she was sharply critical of the 'farce
and hype' surrounding the white paper.
The Consumers' Association noted signs of improvements for consumers since
the original charter was launched, but standards had to be 'set and judged
by citizen-consumers themselves, not the government and service providers'.

Yesterday, the former workmates were searching for a future, leafing through
the 'companies open to CVs' file at British Coal Enterprise's Job Shop in
Dawdon, near Seaham, Co Durham.
They are family men in their mid-30s who have worked since leaving school
for British Coal in the Durham coalfield. Both say they wanted to stay in
the industry all their working lives.
Their pit, Easington, is one of 21 given at least a temporary reprieve by
the government's promise of an independent review following the October 13
closure announcement.
Yet Mr Lawson and Mr Owens are among 4,600 miners who, according to British
Coal, have volunteered for redundancy since October 13 and left the
industry, reducing its workforce to 46,400.
'I always said I'd be the last to leave,' says Mr Owens. So why did he
volunteer now? 'It's just the fact I know it's definitely going to close.'
Mr Lawson says: 'There's this air of depression going through the colliery;
the men know it's going to happen.'
Mr Owens decided it was best not to delay job-hunting. Hoping for work
offshore, he has already spent Pounds 500 of his Pounds 27,000 redundancy
money on an offshore survival course.
Mr Lawson was worried the redundancy payment, normally calculated on the
previous 13 weeks' earnings, might be lower if he stayed. Constant rumours
of the pit's imminent demise and low morale sapped his confidence in its
future. One Friday last month he asked about redundancy and was told the pit
wanted to lose 15 fitters; six had so far gone.
He telephoned his wife, and then, on the spur of the moment, volunteered. He
left with a Pounds 25,000 payment. Now, 'mortgaged up to the hilt', with a
wife, two small daughters, and another baby on the way, he is thinking of
retraining as a teacher or selling insurance.
Since two pits closed in East Durham since mid-1991, the Dawdon Job Shop had
helped 1,200 ex-miners before the latest closures. Half are thought to have
found permanent jobs.
Scanning the boards yesterday, Mr Lawson and Mr Owens were optimistic, even
though Mr Lawson said Job Shop counsellors had told them they would need
interview skills 'for the rest of your life'.
Meanwhile, miners still at work set a new productivity record - an average
6.72 tonnes of coal per man per shift last week, 16 per cent higher than the
level a year ago.
Productivity in the Selby Group of eight pits in Yorkshire was a national
record of 12.25 tonnes a manshift and night workers at Prince of Wales
colliery in Yorkshire set a European record by cutting 5,647 cubic yards of
coal in a shift. The pit, which employs 700 miners, is due to be mothballed
by March under British Coal's original closure plans.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo must hope yesterday's patent award in favour of SmithKline Beecham
does not start a run of bad luck. The market was understandably unsettled by
a defeat for Zofran, one of the new drugs supposed to offset the US patent
risk to Zantac, its blockbusting anti-ulcer compound. In itself, though,
yesterday's decision looks little more than an embarrassment for Glaxo. It
may end up paying a handsome royalty to SmithKline on sales of Zofran to
cancer patients in Europe. But that would hardly blow a hole in profits.
Meanwhile there is nothing to prevent Zofran growing market share. Whether
Glaxo can ever replace Zantac, though, remains an open question.

FT  26 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: North West Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court did its best to spoil a respectable set of interim
figures from North West Water. By judging the UK guilty of poor water
quality, the court highlighted the vast capital spending which could be
required to bring standards up to scratch. Since North West is responsible
for a region still drinking water from lead pipes, it is more exposed than
most. If the industry is allowed to make a healthy rate of return on
investment, of course, higher standards could be good for shareholders. But
that is taking a lot on trust. North West is still waiting to hear what rate
of return the regulator will allow on Pounds 430m unexpected environmental
spending over the next two years.
North West may be wise to look for profits elsewhere. Ventures in process
engineering and water supply overseas could help sustain dividend growth if
the regulator gets tough. But diversification - like capital spending - is a
double-edged sword. Profits from outside the regulated water business are
less reliable. Like other ambitious water companies, North West will have to
prove it can manage diversification effectively.

FT  26 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Tomkins
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market still seems lukewarm about the wisdom of Tomkins' bid for Ranks
Hovis McDougall, notwithstanding Mr Gregory Hutchings' strenuous efforts to
persuade. As Monday's deadline for the rights issue looms, a price of 213p
tells Tomkins' shareholders to take up their rights, albeit by a fairly
narrow margin. But RHM holders would still be better off accepting the 260p
cash alternative rather than the paper offer, which is worth some 8p per
share less. That does not suggest that RHM will do a great deal for Tomkins
even if the outcome of the bid is now pretty much a foregone conclusion.
The risk in the short run is that Tomkins may have to resort to
uncharacteristically large fair-value provisions and cash outlays to set RHM
to rights. True, ample benefit could flow from that restructuring for a year
or two. But then Tomkins could find itself dependent for a large proportion
of its earnings on a business with low inherent growth. It would need more
large acquisitions to keep up earnings momentum.
At a rating discount of more than 10 per cent to the market, Tomkins' shares
look cheap. There should be some catching up to do once the rights issue and
RHM have been absorbed. Yet Tomkins may not easily regain that substantial
premium which makes the acquisition trail inviting.

FT  26 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Tate &amp; Lyle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors who piled into Tate late last year, on the back of its
much-vaunted value-added promise, are now discovering that the company is a
good old commodity business after all. Just when a 14-year unbroken profits
record was beginning to suggest otherwise, along come terrible weather and
US overcapacity in high-fructose corn syrup to ram home the point.
Sensitivity to the external environment explains why Tate's rating as
measured by its forward earnings multiple is below the market average. What
size of discount is appropriate depends on the strength of this year's
bounce back. The positive impact of a weaker pound could well be substantial
 -as much as Pounds 30m according to one outside estimate. Dwarfing
everything else in importance, though, is the extent of the turnround at
Staley. Tate is clearly chipper about the prospects, having appointed a new
man to do the job. But the shares are unlikely to advance much further until
there is evidence that prices are not suffering in the battle to recapture
market share. Depending on the outcome, profits in 1992-93 could be anywhere
between Pounds 220m and Pounds 240m.
For all the short-term uncertainties Tate's earnings per share record from
1988 to 1992 will probably be better than the likes of Cadbury and Unilever.
There may be nothing wrong with commodity businesses, especially if they
have quasi-monopolistic positions and are good at exploiting them.

FT  26 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: The Kwik step
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The alarming aspect of Kwik Save's results is the way the percentage
increases get smaller as you move down the profit and loss account. Sales
may be up by a third, but the rise in operating profit is 14.8 per cent and
earnings per share have only grown by 8.9 per cent. While a change in sales
mix and capital investment may be partly responsible, the figures bear the
scars of aggressive competition.
Kwik Save's strategy is to eat into the soft middle ground of food retailing
occupied by Gateway, Asda, and the Co-op, while also pricing keenly to hold
off Aldi and Netto. Unfortunately for shareholders, that raises questions.
Kwik Save has a strong balance sheet and its management is clearly superior
to most others in its sights. But earnings growth may slow if other chains
fighting for survival compete fiercely on price. If the recession ever ends,
Kwik Save may also be squeezed by consumers aspiring to superstore status.
The privately owned foreign discounters might also choose to run losses to
establish a presence in the UK market. Barriers to entry in this area are
low.
It would be wrong to get too gloomy, however. The threat is largely
discounted in Kwik Save's price and the company's advantages mean it will be
a survivor. Much of that strength derives from the efforts of the Keswick
clan, who acquired board representation and an influential stake when Kwik
Save had lost its way. That point will not be lost on shareholders in
Trafalgar House.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Back to the drawing-board: Financial self-regulation in the
UK is facing mounting calls for reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eleven years ago, the City was thrown into protracted wrangling by the
government's appointment of Professor Jim Gower to recommend how the UK
financial services industry should be regulated. His report, and the
rancorous debate that followed, led to the Financial Services Act of 1986
and the painful transformation of the investment industry's regulatory
structure.
After that gruelling experience, the last thing you might expect is that
City grandees would be calling for another wholesale redesign of the
regulatory system. Yet that is exactly what an increasing number of
influential figures say they want.
More surprising still, some want to undo the City's main achievement last
time round - keeping the government at arm's length through a system best
described as self-regulation within a statutory framework.
Listen to Mr Mick Newmarch, chairman of Britain's largest life insurer,
Prudential Corporation: 'The Financial Services Act is an unsatisfactory
basis for the adequate protection of savers.'
He went on to attack the principle of self-regulation: 'The government
should now acknowledge,' he said, 'that the experiment has failed and begin
to organise investor protection on a fully statutory basis under direct
government control.'
Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank and perhaps the City's
most experienced lawyer, also wants to sweep away the present collection of
self-regulatory agencies. A powerful single regulatory body 'seems
ultimately to be inevitable', he said. 'To end the fatigue of regulatory
change, perhaps the time has come when we should take this step with one
bound.'
The regulators themselves have joined the chorus. 'Self-regulation is
drinking in the last-chance saloon,' said Mr Christopher Sharples, chief
executive of the Securities and Futures Association, the self-regulatory
body for wholesale financial service firms.
And Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, the
central self-regulatory body, is likely to urge big changes in the system
when he completes his current review of the way it works, commissioned by
the Treasury in July.
Dissatisfaction with the present system stems from the way in which it tries
 -and too often fails - to tackle three separate issues. The regulatory
structure is supposed to root out fraud; to ensure consumer protection and
fair dealing for the millions of retail customers of financial services
businesses; and to supervise a range of complex wholesale financial markets.
On all three counts, it is failing:
Fraud. The most spectacular recent failure was the ease with which the late
Robert Maxwell, using a regulated fund management company which he
controlled, was able to walk off with more than Pounds 400m of money from
pension schemes, threatening the security in old age of more than 20,000
former employees. The Maxwell case revealed poor performance by Imro, the
self-regulatory body that watches over fund managers. More important, it
highlighted the fact that the reforms of the mid-1980s had left a big gap:
they did not provide a strong legal structure for pension funds, something
the Gower report had called for.
The Maxwell case aside, there have been serious criticisms of the way
investigations that may culminate in allegations of fraud are handled. For a
suspected fraud involving trading in the shares of a quoted company, for
example, investigators from the Stock Exchange, the Securities and Futures
Association, the Securities and Investments Board, the City police fraud
squad and the Serious Fraud Office may all be involved, with final decisions
on prosecution taken by the head of the SFO and the director of public
prosecutions.
The result - as in the Blue Arrow case - is long drawn-out investigations, a
huge number of charges, and cases that drag on for years. The current system
of prosecuting suspected wrongdoers, said Lord Alexander, is 'slow,
expensive and unpredictable . . . It is unfair both to the public and the
accused.'
Consumer protection. From the outset this has proved contentious. Prof Gower
was determined to bring the marketing of retail investment products, such as
insurance, into the supervisory net. Initially, the government planned a
self-regulatory body called the Marketing of Investments Board to handle
this, but - after worries it would lead to fragmented supervision - it was
eventually merged into SIB.
The debate about standards of consumer protection continues: the Office of
Fair Trading, the competition watchdog, has repeatedly asked SIB to revise
its disclosure rules for commission payments on life assurance policies, and
may yet urge the chancellor to reject them.
And, while the rules applying to all businesses under the Financial Services
Act are broadly equivalent, different SROs enforce them with varying degrees
of vigour. For instance, Lautro, which supervises the life insurers, has
insisted that its members make refunds to people who have been sold
inappropriate personal pensions. Fimbra, the self-regulatory body for
independent financial advisers, and SIB have told the firms they directly
regulate to adopt new guidelines for the sale of personal pensions, but have
not asked them to make refunds for policies mis-sold in the past.
The crisis of the regulatory system has not come to a head over consumer
groups' complaints, but over the need to salvage Fimbra. It has been unable
to raise enough money from members to regulate its patch effectively or to
make its full share of contributions to the Investors Compensation Scheme.
SIB's solution, a merger of Fimbra with other self-regulatory bodies to form
a new Personal Investments Authority (PIA), has proved extremely unpopular
with big banks and insurance companies, and has led to the current calls for
change.
Wholesale markets. Here, the record of the reforms has been best. The
government decided that stronger supervision of wholesale markets was
necessary to cope with the influx of international firms into London's
securities markets as a result of Big Bang, the wave of deregulation going
on at the same time as the debate over regulatory reform. Initially, the new
regulators' approach - very detailed rulebooks and a strong emphasis on
legalism - was resented by the City, because of its costs and complexity.
After a change to simpler rulebooks was introduced by Sir David Walker, the
second chairman of SIB, some of these complaints have lessened. But there is
still a feeling that the system is unnecessarily complex, with too many
bodies sharing responsibility, and too few really first-rate people taking
part in self-regulation.
These are the arguments mustered by those who push for sweeping regulatory
reforms. There is also a healthy amount of commercial self-interest,
however, in the call for change. The row over the PIA, which has brought the
debate over the future of regulation out into the open, is a good example.
There has been intense wrangling over the size of the PIA's board and just
who should sit on it. Set at 30 members, it is designed so that neither life
insurers, IFAs or public interest members have a majority.
But that balancing act, as unwieldy as it is, has still not guaranteed the
success of the new body. The life insurers, who have subsidised both the
operating costs and ICS contributions of Fimbra members, have said they will
not join unless 95 per cent of all the firms in retail financial services
join as well.
And that means the banks and building societies who are encroaching on life
insurers' territory with increasing confidence and efficiency. The banks,
for their part, have chosen to be regulated by SIB directly, and see no
reason why they should join. 'Why should we bail out the independent
financial advisers who are selling the products of the life insurers?' asked
one banker involved in the discussions.
Even if the PIA gets off the ground, it may not serve the interests of the
investing public. Last week, Ms Julia Leisching, chief policy and
administration officer at Lautro, announced she would not serve the new PIA
because too little thought was being given to improving consumer protection.
Investor protection was the theme stressed in the second reading of the
Financial Services Bill by an obscure Conservative backbencher, Mr Anthony
Nelson. 'Supervisory boards and self-regulating organisations historically
have been and remain too practitioner-oriented and cosy,' he said. 'The
principal function of both the designated agency (SIB) and the SROs should
not be to provide an easy working machine which is not subjected to
criticism. Their principal objective is to protect investors. Their face
must always be pointed towards the investor, and they must apply that
criterion to every decision.'
Mr Nelson, by a happy chance, is now in a position to do something about
putting his strongly expressed views into practice. He is the minister at
the Treasury responsible for the supervision of the financial system.
He will soon be weighing up Mr Large's review and deciding whether to try to
put the whole system back into the melting pot. The issues he will have to
face are these.
First, is the current system working well, apart from the problem of
supervising independent financial advisers? If that is the only substantial
problem, then steps may have to be taken to force a solution, perhaps by
withdrawing the right of a financial services firm to choose its own
regulator and obliging the banks and insurers to join the PIA.
If he decides there is a more widespread problem with the system, he will
have to consider how to resolve it. The more sweeping proposals - Mr
Newmarch's wish for direct regulation of the insurance industry by the
government, for example, or Lord Alexander's call for a single regulator
with powers to levy heavy civil penalties on miscreant firms and
individuals, in parallel with any criminal proceedings - will certainly
require more legislation.
Such a revised act would need to fit with the recently agreed EC Investment
Services Directive. It would require a new institutional structure, with
fresh efforts to balance the participation of practitioners with the
day-to-day efforts of full-time regulators.
Mr Nelson and his advisers may well blanch at the thought. But they may have
little choice but to contemplate it. With such heavyweight figures in the
City coming out so publicly in favour of change, the present system may be
dangerously close to the limits of its credibility.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Saving the ozone layer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL conventions on the environment are too prone to
self-congratulation. However, after this week's United Nations conference in
Copenhagen on the ozone layer of the atmosphere, congratulation is deserved.
The 1987 Montreal Protocol phasing out production of chemicals that damage
the ozone layer was tightened for the second time. It stands as one of the
world's most successful responses to an environmental threat.
The thinning of the protective ozone layer, which shields both people and
crops from the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation, was detected only in
1985. But reaction has been faster than that to other perceived threats,
partly because scientists were confident about the part played by man-made
chemicals, and partly because chemical companies moved quickly to develop
substitutes.
The main achievement in Copenhagen was to bring forward the phasing out of
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) - the most damaging chemicals, used in air
conditioning and refrigeration - by four years, to 1996 in industrialised
countries and 2006 in developing countries. The conference was right too in
taking a first step towards regulating methyl bromide - a substance used to
preserve fruit and grain, whose ozone-depleting potential was only
recognised six months ago.
These measures fall short of those demanded by some countries, including the
UK and the US, but they still come at considerable cost. The US has put the
cost to itself of complying with the original protocol at Dollars 35bn over
the next century, and that of the acceleration agreed this week at an
additional Dollars 2bn. On its estimate that the new deadlines will prevent
10,000 US cancer deaths, this represents Dollars 200,000 for each life
saved.
Nevertheless, the signatories should now take other steps. In particular
they need to look at the administration of the international fund set up in
1990 to help developing countries adapt. Parties to the protocol have
pledged Dollars 240m to cover the costs for 1991 to 1993, and in Copenhagen
they committed Dollars 500m more for 1994 to 1996. The need is clear: UN
figures say that although developing countries consume some 20 times fewer
CFCs than industrialised countries overall, their consumption rose by 50 per
cent between 1986 and 1990, while that of industrial countries fell by 30
per cent.
In spite of this, the fund - administered by the World Bank and the UN's
environment and development programmes - disbursed only Dollars 70m in 1991
and 1992, on studies and administration. No ozone-saving projects have
started. The fund's pace needs to be stepped up, as promised, by the time
the parties meet again next year. Signatories also need to improve
scientific research and communicate its results to the public more
effectively. The ozone hole has captured the public imagination, but ozone
depletion is not as predictable a phenomenon as is sometimes portrayed.
The Copenhagen conference demonstrates that rapid global agreement on
pressing environmental problems can be achieved. That should encourage the
international community as it moves on to larger, more complex and more
politically difficult challenges like global warming.

THE LOUIS VUITTON AND MOET-HENNESSY AFFAIR By Hugh Sebag-Montefiore Chapmans
Pounds 9.99
There are few things that the French consider to be as important as lunch.
The staff of Christian Dior ought therefore to have guessed that something
was awry when Bernard Arnault, their new boss, brushed aside a lunch
invitation from one of them with a dismissive: 'What have we got to talk
about?'
Spurning lunch was only the start. In the seven years since he took over
Christian Dior, the French fashion house, Arnault has presided over a string
of hirings and firings. Marc Bohan learned about his 'resignation' as chief
designer in a trade paper. He had worked at Christian Dior for almost three
decades only to be 'thrown out as brutally as . . . an incompetent valet',
or so he said at the time.
Arnault haunts every page of Hugh Sebag-Montefiore's Kings On The Catwalk.
The subject of the book is the fight for control of the Louis Vuitton
Moet-Hennessy (LVMH) luxury goods group in the late 1980s. Its sub-plot is
the apparently relentless rise of Arnault, the provincial property developer
who, at 42, is now one of the most powerful players in the international
luxury goods industry.
The cast list appears in the opening chapter when the leading actors
assemble in their front-row seats at the Paris haute couture collections in
July 1990.
There is Arnault himself, 'a handsome, youthful man with black hair tinged
with grey and a pensive, owl-like face'. Then there is Henry Racamier, the
steel magnate who married an heiress to the Louis Vuitton luggage fortune,
'a tall, erect man whose craggy, angular face, square jaw and greased-back
hair give him the appearance of a rakish businessman from the 1930s'.
Finally there is Alain Chevalier, with 'his deep tan, his bald head and his
immaculate, dark blue suit . . . his long, thin artistic fingers and his
slightly dreamy expression'.
The plot is as follows. Racamier masterminds a merger between the Vuitton
businesses and the Moet-Hennessy drinks empire run by Chevalier. They fight
for power. Racamier ropes in Arnault, who has made his name in French
finance by buying up businesses, including Christian Dior, hoping he will be
an ally.
That proved a big mistake. Far from being an ally, Arnault, aided and
abetted by his banker, Antoine Bernheim of Lazard Freres, seizes control of
LVMH in a series of share raids, boardroom battles and legal attacks.
Chevalier resigns. Racamier battles on until April 26 1990, when he loses
the final legal fight to Arnault and his wife, Odile, is led sobbing from
the offices of the company her great-grandfather had founded.
Kings On The Catwalk is strong on anecdotes. There is a wry account of
Chevalier, the professional manager and arch-delegator, throwing up his
hands in astonishment as the fastidious Racamier pores over the finer
details of their merged company's new letter headings and office decor.
Arnault's adventures and misadventures are faithfully recorded, culminating
in an account of the LVMH shareholders' meeting where he sat impassively
while his fellow directors reeled off their grievances against him.
The book is also good at describing the details of the LVMH contest - from
the wheeling and dealing of the bankers, to the public relations advisers
pouring scorn on the opposition and the wooing of the founding families by
the competing camps. Finally, the book offers an exhaustive account of who
bought which blocks of shares when, and why.
The book's weakness is that it fails to analyse the long-term consequences
of the LVMH conflict, either for French business or for the international
luxury goods industry.
The LVMH affair formed part of a general process of consolidation in the
luxury goods sector during the 1980s. This has raised the financial stakes
in the industry by heralding a new era of expensive advertising campaigns,
spiralling fees for super-models and ambitious product development
programmes. As a result the Arnault companies and their competitors are now
trapped in a vicious cycle of escalating overheads in an increasingly
competitive sector.
Nor does Sebag-Montefiore consider the implications of the LVMH battle for
the French business establishment. The fight for LVMH was, after all, only
one of a series of corporate skirmishes in which US-style takeover tactics
triumphed over the nepotistic traditions of France's family-controlled
companies.
Kings On The Catwalk does not stint on reiterating the criticism of Arnault,
but it also points out that all he has really done is to apply the modern
management methods common in most other sectors to the cloistered world of
French luxury goods. What it does not say is whether Arnault will be
vindicated and whether bad blood in the LVMH boardroom, or the firings at
Christian Dior, will turn out to have been worthwhile.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Market-testing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S announcement that more than 44,000 jobs in the UK civil service
are to be put out to tender is good news for companies that are well-placed
to bid for the contracts. In a recession where spotting green shoots
requires keen eyesight, the prospect of almost Pounds 1.5bn of new business
in the next 10 months is welcome. But it is also good news for the taxpayer,
who can expect significant savings in public expenditure - and better
quality public services to boot.
Contracting out local government services such as street cleaning and refuse
collection is now well established and widely accepted as a discipline for
ensuring value for money. In most cases, the contract is awarded to the
council workforce - only one in five contracts ends up in the hands of
private contractors. But even where the work stays in-house, the threat of
losing it is persuasive in improving the efficiency and quality of services.
Such benefits will now be enjoyed in central government, so far largely
immune to competition from the private sector. The government believes that
the discipline of the market will save 25 per cent of the cost of the
services involved. This is almost certainly over-optimistic - in local
government, savings rarely exceed 20 per cent. But market-testing will exert
downward pressure on costs, most welcome as public expenditure continues to
climb.
Bringing market pressures to bear on central government is about much more
than shaving costs, however. The extension of contracting out widely
throughout government services is a significant element in the prime
minister's drive to improve their quality through the Citizen's Charter. It
is part of the move away from providing central government services through
a homogenous civil service, a large bureaucratic machine designed to
administer rather than manage, where policymaking skills are more important
than management ability.
Instead, the emphasis is increasingly on government by contract: public
services will be provided by specialist organisations, to clearly defined
standards which are set out in contractual agreements. Those organisations
may be companies in the private sector, executive agencies, management
buy-outs or the current staff reorganised on more business-like lines. But
the separation of purchaser and provider through the medium of a contract
for services allows a much stronger focus on the quality of service, as the
experience of the health service shows.
Drawing up the list of targets - and persuading departments to be creative
in adding activities to it - is only half the battle, however. Managing the
process of market-testing requires skills with which the civil service has
not always shown itself well-equipped. It will work well only if
specifications for contracts are comprehensive and the assessment of bids
competent. Choosing the lowest bid is often not the wisest course,
especially if the emphasis is as much on quality as cost. While the
market-testing programme offers a good start towards government by contract,
it will need careful nurturing if it is to yield the potential benefits.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Nigeria's crisis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT IBRAHIM Babangida has decided to ignore the well-known advice to
anyone who finds himself in a hole: stop digging. Instead he chooses to
pursue a flawed transition to civilian rule, while neglecting the economic
reform programme he himself launched in 1986.
President Babangida's decision last week to delay the handover to a civilian
government by eight months is understandable, given the vote-rigging that
marred the presidential primaries. But the problems at the heart of
Nigeria's search for democracy are not that readily resolved; and in the
meantime the country's debt crisis deepens. If delaying the handover also
means ducking tough economic decisions, Nigeria's prospects are bleak
indeed.
The president set himself a Herculean task when he launched Nigeria's
transition to civilian rule in 1986, given the country's tumultuous
post-independence record. He made it no easier, however, by imposing his
version of democracy, banning former politicians and office-holders from
taking part in the transition, and proscribing the 13 new parties that
emerged. In their stead he presented Nigerians with two parties, created by
civil servants, their manifestos written by bureaucrats. Last week President
Babangida continued to dictate his terms, banning the 23 presidential
contestants from the new search for his successor.
On the political front, the die may be cast. At best, Nigerians can hope for
the installation next August of a weak administration. The new government's
chances of survival will be poor; they will be even bleaker if President
Babangida fails to act on the economy.
The structural adjustment programme he launched in 1986 has buckled as
corruption increased, election spending soared, and Nigeria's share of the
costs of West African military intervention in Liberia rose. An IMF
agreement lapsed last April, and service payments on Nigeria's Dollars 30bn
external debt are unmanageable. Without urgent rescheduling, the economic
crisis will deepen.
President Babangida's opportunity to act comes on January 1, when he
presents the 1993 budget. He must redouble efforts to put the reform
programme back on track, spurred on by the IMF and Nigeria's creditors. Both
sides should resist the temptation to delay action and pass responsibility
on to the president's successors. Seizing the opportunity has its own
perils; failure to do so would court disaster.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Arts: A scandalous 'Lucia' at the Met - New York opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is almost as if Pope Leo the Great had gone out with open arms to welcome
the Huns into the city. James Levine, custodian of the Metropolitan Opera's
comforting-splendiferous style of production, was apparently responsible for
inviting a new staging of Donizetti's Walter Scott opera from (perhaps he
had in mind current feminist critiques of the doomed nightingale heroines of
19th century lyric tragedy) Francesca Zambello.
It was, in its way, an astute move. Ms Zambello is not easy to categorise as
a stage artist: she can be curious and inventive; she can also lay on, as
she demonstrated in the Earl's Court Tosca of last year, the grand show.
This Lucia di Lammermoor is again a grand show, with its set (by John
Conklin) of huge falling rectangles of gothic masonry and grey graves. But
Ms Zambello must have realised she was there to create a scandal, and this
is what she does - though it is a scandal that is forced and desultory,
perhaps because of the pressure.
It is a scandal that discloses itself only gradually. Apart from the ruined
churchyard setting, and the fact that the chorus has been banished to the
pit (where it remains throughout) while the huntsmen of Lammermoor are
whiskery mutes forming geometrical patterns of grey plaid, the first act is
pretty straightforward. Things start to get bizarre in the middle of the
next act, when Arturo, the chosen bridegroom, arrives rising on a lift,
vested in the puffed-up cream and gilt of the Ingres portrait of Napoleon in
coronation robes. He is, Ms Zambello explains, 'the very emblem of the
corrupting, wealthy lord', though the effect is rather to elicit sympathy
for a creature so obviously being emblazoned with an image he cannot
support. Then comes bathos. 'Where is Lucia?' he asks, and the titters from
the audience provide the answer that she is lying on the ground ten yards
from him, in a dress of sapphire strident against the general gloom.
Ms Zambello's bold rethinking, let us say, of entrances and exits continues
in the next act, where Lucia enters a deserted stage for her mad scene.
There are no onlookers to be shocked, and thereby to shock the audience into
a state of shock. Nor is there anything very shocking to be seen: no gore,
just a lady in a white shift who looks angelical and expressively neutral.
When she does eventually daub herself with a little crimson paint, from out
of one of the tombs, one wonders why.
This icy interpretation, if that is what it is, at least accords with June
Anderson's vocal performance. She can cut any kind of figure above the stave
with perfect accuracy; she can decorate, as she does in the first act, with
exciting virtuosity; she can produce long single notes like diamonds; she
can float at the top of the sextet with strainless grace. The absence of
anything physiological in her singing is astonishing, and on those terms her
performance is a triumph.
Richard Leech as Edgardo is a different sort of character: ardent and
engaging, maintaining a consistent strength of enthusiasm, and yet eager too
for beauty of sound and line. Paul Groves provides a marvellously
sophisticated and beautiful performance as Arturo, putting the production to
shame for foisting such an absurd visual persona upon him. Juan Pons is
gravely noble and musical as Enrico: there are no villains in this view.
The orchestra takes every opportunity for breadth and richness of tone, with
the horns and solo cello deserving as much credit as the harp of balladry
and the will-o'-the-wisp flute of the mad scene, and yet Marcello Panni, the
conductor, will keep urging them to thrust.

BLADE RUNNER: THE DIRECTOR'S CUT (15) Ridley Scott
TETSUO II: BODYHAMMER Shinya Tsukamoto
OF MICE AND MEN (PG) Lewis Milestone
THE WATERDANCE (15) Neal Jimenez
RAPID FIRE (18) Dwight H. Little
Hisses humanoid Rutger Hauer to Harrison Ford: 'If you're not alive, you
can't play]', explaining why he has spared his life. Shortly before this he
has dislocated two of Mr Ford's fingers, thrown him across several rooms and
then - just as a show of strength - butted his own head through a solid
wall.
We are in LA's famous Bradbury Building, circa 2020 AD, and the plot is
coming to the boil. Correction: the plot has already come to the boil,
scalding all bystanders, and the screen is now thick with steam and
precipitation. That the future world depicted in Ridley Scott's ten-year-old
Blade Runner is unlike any other in film history we already knew. Rain
drizzles; mist drifts; a benighted pall hangs over the streets. And four
escaped androids from a distant space colony are making life hell for bounty
hunter Rick Deckard (Ford).
If you're not alive, you can't play. But you have to be alive to odd things
in this movie. One of them is not the plot. Scripted by Hampton Fancher and
David Peoples from Philip K. Dick's quirky sci-fi novel Do Androids Dream Of
Electric Sheep - the screenplay is de-sheeped and largely de-quirked - it is
the old tale of the semi-retired gunman called out for one more mission.
(For Western baddies read robot humanoids). He falls in love with one female
'replicant' (Sean Young), perforates three others and has a climactic
bash-out with the last.
No, the plot is futurist cowboys. If you want to play the Blade Runner game,
you must be alive to the film's all-transcending images and rhythms.
Restoring his movie according to his original vision, Scott has junked the
studio-foisted voice-over that made Ford sound like a cybernetics-age Sam
Spade. And he has also clipped off the 'happy' ending. This had car-borne
hero and heroine snaking into the countryside on an elopement idyll that
seemed to come from another film. Indeed it did come from another film: the
sequence consisted of out-takes from Kubrick's The Shining.
Now we have the harsh, distilled, majestic masterwork. Before 'inner city
decay' became a cant-phrase, Scott and designer Lawrence G. Paull invented
this dazzling nightmare of rotting, marauder-haunted streets: a place where
aerial cop cars float overhead, polluted rain cascades down and pyramidal
skyscrapers reach for a non-existent light. It is Fritz Lang's Metropolis
made for the age of colour, hi-fi sound and urban paranoia.
In the opening long shot of the city, chimneys belch fire like disconsolate
dragons. In later low-angle vistas we squint up through the architectural
chaos (Hispanic, Egyptian, Hi-Tech) to watch the lighted blimp loudhailing
the joys of off-world life and the towering neon sign with a Japanese face
smiling inanely into the void.
London, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles: give these cities
30 years to self-combust and Blade Runner could be the cinema's most
prophetic blueprint of urban degeneration. Its images are no less
tenebrously majestic when it steps indoors. The giant Theban terrace of the
penthouse-dwelling robotics tycoon, lit by amber sunset and guarded by an
amber-eyed owl. Deckard's flat, a rancid lemon daylight squeezing into the
low-ceilinged interior built as if from Mayan playblocks. Or the toymaker's
workshop in the Bradbury Building where the androids hide out. Here walking
homunculi bash into doorframes, 'living' dolls nod away in dazed serenity
and the replicants find camouflage in a world of chalk-faced almost-humans.
Hard to review Blade Runner except as a shopping list of irresistible
aesthetic bargains. The dramatic core that might homogenise them is not
quite there. Only in the final minutes, as replicant Hauer gives up his
fight in a dying epiphany of tender humanity, does the script soar and
Scott's direction go with it. Suddenly we are looking at something more than
inspired trappings: we are gazing into the souls trapped inside them.
Anyone doubting Blade Runner's influence on post-Blade Runner cinema should
check out Shinya Tsukamoto's Tetsuo II: Bodyhammer. This unstoppably
delinquent Japanese film is all about human beings who turn into guns, nay
into entire walking armouries. From forearms transformed into gnarled
machine-guns, or chests bristling with bazookas, they pump bullets into
likewise metamorphic enemies.
But what captivates is the setting. It is the dank, dark, rain-gleamed
metropolis of Ridley Scott's film, animated by such Scott specials as
whirring ventilation propellers and hissing steam-jets. Modern Gothic at its
most delirious, housing an Oriental thriller at its most demented.
What a pastoral contrast to wander into Of Mice And Men. Here the sun
shines, the stream burbles, the corn is green. And if man is vile, it is not
through deliberate evil: only because large physique and small intelligence
make an unhappy combination. John Steinbeck's Lenny, for whom gestures of
love turn into tragic death-hugs, is here played by John Malkovich. A
lisping, pixillated giant with batting eyes and cupid's-bow mouth, he would
be slightly camp if not more-than-slightly unnerving. The actor draws us
into Lenny's baby intelligence - watch his mind tick s-l-o-w-l-y as he
repeats the last words of every interlocutor's sentence - and then makes us
emotionally complicit in his deeds.
Malkovich is splendid. The rest of the film, alas, consists of actors
reciting lines against scenery. Gary Sinise of Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre
co-stars as George and also directs, turning Steinbeck's story into a bland,
up-market Classic Illustrated. The movie misses all the gnarled humanity
that director Lewis Milestone brought to the 1939 film and that Burgess
Meredith, that sulphur-powered gnome, brought to George. Ray Walston, Casey
Sziemasko, Sherilyn Fenn and a rabbit comprise the new film's supporting
cast. They all evaporate before Malkovich, and before the audience's
awareness of what might have been.
A bad film about the maimed or disabled has an unfair advantage. It knows we
cannot slam the door in its face quite so readily as we would on a bad film
about, say, murder, car chases or sicko cops. The Waterdance is written and
co-directed (with Michael Steinberg) by Neal Jimenez, who scripted that
teasing fable of small-town guilt and gossip River's Edge. A real-life
paraplegic, he has poured his own experiences into this story of life in a
rehabilitation centre where a spine-injured novelist (Eric Stoltz) meets up
with a crippled biker (William Forsythe) and a chattering black con-man
(Wesley Snipes).
But oh dear. Sometimes when you pour your experiences into something, they
spill over and require much mopping up by non-responsible parties: in this
case the audience. The Waterdance, apart from being about 'the unceasing
tenacity of the human spirit' (to quote the press notes), is about the
difficulty of reconciling realism with Hollywood inspirationalism. Feints
are made at frankness, especially about the sexual plight of the crippled.
But long before curtain-time the film has withdrawn into a narcotic
buddyism, where the brute facts of paralysis are anaesthetised by funny
subplot capers in wheelchairs or hi-jacked hospital vans.
Rapid Fire at least has the courage of its conventions. Roll up - or
possibly roll over - for 95 minutes of foot-kicking, fist-flying frolics
with Brandon Lee, son of Bruce. The direction (Dwight H. Little) is basic,
the plot more so. But on this showing Lee is the new Nijinsky of the
bare-knuckle B-movie.

The Essential History Of Europe began last week with an amusing attempt by
Dario Fo to say what it means to be an Italian. Today journalist Julia
Sevillano traverses Spain to show how different her country is from its
well-worn image (8.00 BBC2).
BBC1's natural history series Living Dangerously is concerned with 'The

product from cultivated crop - which serves to raise the question of how
mankind uses or misuses natural resources (8.00 BBC1).
In the opening episode of Sitting Pretty (8.30 BBC1) John Sullivan seemed to
have written his rich former working class heroine into something of a
corner by depriving her of all her money in the last few minutes. Either
this will turn out to be untrue, or we are to have a nouveau riche heroine

So far Absolutely Fabulous has been making me laugh much more. Jennifer

FT  26 NOV 92 / Arts: Mark Morris's 'Motorcade' - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first thing that has to be said is that London Contemporary Dance
Theatre is an ensemble of dancers at the peak of their stunningly good form.
At the opening of the company's autumn season at Sadler's Wells on Tuesday
night, movement had a lightning-flash energy, and a hard-driven rhythmic
pulse.
For this reason alone, Arnie Zane's pointless Freedom of Information was
exciting to watch as the evening began. The dance is incoherent, a cascade
of cheap-jack incidents that whip the performers' bodies in every direction,
but there must be laurels for Peter Dunleavy, Isobel Mortimer, Andrew
Robinson, Isabel Tamen, Sheron Wray, and especially to Kenneth Tharp as the
whizz-kid of the karate chop, for the sophistication of their performances,
witty, bright-cut, hair-trigger fast.
A similar verve - LCDT's artists seem able to rip into a dance phrase,
explore its possibilities, and come out on the other side with gleaming ease
 -marked the first London showing of Christopher Bruce's Rooster. This uses
eight songs by the Rolling Stones for a romp which examines the social and
sexual attitudes of the young to whom such stuff is food and drink. (There
were quite a few of them in the audience, yipping with delight at what they
saw and heard). The opening Little Red Rooster shows four men strutting in
barnyard display; later numbers reveal how well Bruce writes for men - from
the flashy, knowing show-piece for David Hughes (excellently done), to a
more urgently emotional number for Darshan Singh Bhuller, through which he
curved and spun in a vivid combination of power and suppleness. The four
women are less well served, though Sheron Wray, heroine of the evening in
three works, has a mercurial speed and whirlwind temperament that give
savour to everything she dances.
The major choreographic matter came with Mark Morris's Motorcade, made for
the White Oaks project two years ago, and his first piece to be staged by a
British troupe. The text is Saint-Saens trumpet septet. It is clearly a
score in which Morris finds much to delight him: its exemplary craft, its
melodic freshness, its clarity of form, even a certain Ecole Pompier
academism. Such felicities have led Morris to what was known in the earliest
days of American modern dance as 'music realisation'. Not, though, for
Morris any step-for-note trippings. Rather does he find curves of movement,
swathes of energy, entrances and poses, balances and counter-weights of
activity, which spring out of the music's development, match its devices and
decisions, illuminate them.
I thought it beguilingly made, modest, elegant in means as Saint-Saens' own
procedures. I also thought it could be better danced. To make such
choreography live, performance must be as acute and musically witty as
Morris's own conceits. LCDT's cast were not uniformly alert, nor as 'inside'
the music and dance as Morris's own artists always appear to be. The
costuming is depressing: pastel vests and leotards that end fatally at the
knee, with dainty shoes: the dancers look like discomforted elves - and some
of them rather bulgy elves at that. But it is a notable addition to the
repertory, and worth polishing.
London Contemporary Dance Theatre continues at Sadler's Wells until December
5: varied repertory.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Arts: Huddersfield looks to Europe - Andrew Clements finds
the potentially most fascinating pieces to be thoroughly dispensable
festival chic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's leading new-music festival, its only annual new-music festival,
has a lively, cosmopolitan look for 1992. In previous years the Huddersfield
Festival of Contemporary Music has alighted upon a small group of composers
to be surveyed and explored, with other unrelated events clustered around
the thematic centres. This time the net appears to have been cast wider: the
celebrations are less intensive but there are more of them, mixing the
familiar mainstream with the less well known - a visit from Berio to conduct
his own music, tributes to Xenakis at 70 and to the late John Cage,
alongside introductions to the music of the Italian Franco Donatoni, the
Swiss Klaus Huber and the French Gerard Grisey, and updates on the progress
of David Bedford and Mark-Anthony Turnage.
There genuinely is something for everyone during the 11 packed days, and the
happy mix of audiences - London new-music groupies with students from the
newly chartered Huddersfield University as well as local concert-goers -
testifies to its broad appeal. This year too the festival has a glossier,
more costly look, for fortified by funds from the European Arts Festival,
the director Richard Steinitz has been able to import three ambitious
evenings straight from the Continental festival circuit that would normally
lie well outside his orbit. Next weekend will bring the British premiere of
Georges Aperghis' music-theatre extravaganza H, while the festival has
already experienced Grisey's Le Noir et l'etoile and the Xenakis-inspired
Tale of a Faust.
Both events, in prospect the most fascinating items in the Huddersfield
schedule, proved substantial disappointments. Grisey is an interesting
figure whose music remains relatively unexplored here; Xenakis's potential
as a dramatic composer has never seemed fulfilled. But it would be hard to
decide which of the shows to which their names were attached here was the
more flimsy and shallow; both were expensive festival chic of a thoroughly
dispensable kind.
Grisey's piece at least had the merits of consistency and purpose. Performed
by Les Percussions de Strasbourg before a capacity audience in the
Huddersfield Sports Centre, Le Noir et l'etoile uses the sounds of two deep
space pulsars as detected and transformed by radio telescopes as the
numinous basis for a hour-long discourse. One of these stellar sounds
arrived by high-definition BT cable direct from Jodrell Bank, the other, a
Southern Hemisphere source, had been preserved on tape. The percussionists
used headphones, presumably to align themselves with these heavenly
clicktracks and from time to time 'windows' opened in the textures, allowing
the listeners a sample of this arcane source.
Yet the musical function of these pulses, other than as evocative sound
objects, was never made clear and the pseudo-theatrical trappings - artily
positioned canvas drapes, light show, smoke machines - added little to what
was a routine display of Strasbourg virtuosity, with calls and responses
across the arena, complex rhythmic assemblages and massive explosions.
Grisey is a better, more thoughtful composer than he allows himself to be in
this work.
In Tale of a Faust, Xenakis's direct involvement was hard to establish. He
certainly supplied the music, recycled from a clutch of existing pieces
including the choral Nuits and Serment, the percussion Rebonds, and the
baritone and percussion Kassandra. But other hands (Didier Betourne and Zoe
Fachan) appear to have fashioned them, piecemeal, into this specious
scenario which portrays Faust as a solo percussionist, Mephistopholes as
baritone and Marguerite as a trapeze artist. The chorus wanders around
looking by turns mildly interested and thoroughly bored.
It is a totally pretentious and musically cosmetic piece of opportunism,
relying on spectacular coups, especially some heart-stopping trapeze work
from Veronique Betourne, and torrential percussion playing (from Roland
Auzet) to make its effect. The relationship between Xenakis's music and what
unfolded on the stage of Huddersfield Town Hall seemed pretty tenuous; it
was not one of the festival's more successful forays into the dimly defined
world of contemporary music theatre.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Accountancy Column: Profession has a new and sympathetic
friend - The corporate affairs minister is happy for accountants to handle
accountancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNINSPIRING exterior of the Department of Trade and Industry offices in
Victoria Street, London, may not much resemble the marbled facades of
Britain's accountancy firms, but the differences rapidly start to fade
inside.
By the time visitors reach the tenth floor, home of the minister for
corporate affairs, the decor is beginning to resemble that in the offices of
many accountancy firms' senior partners.
Discussion with the new minister rapidly dispenses with any remaining gap.
The bright red bow-tie and the frequent grins may distinguish him from Mr
John Redwood, his predecessor. But in Mr Neil Hamilton the accountancy
profession has found a new and sympathetic friend.
A little more than seven months into his new job, Mr Hamilton is finding his
feet with the issues vexing the accountancy profession, and little, he seems
to believe, is in demand of much reform.
The MP for Tatton, Cheshire, has survived a job as a government whip and
after nine years in parliament has reached a significant ministerial
position at a time of great change.
Until now Hamilton has been perhaps best known for allegations against him
and Mr Gerald Howarth for their alleged right-wing extremism in the infamous
1984 BBC Panorama TV programme 'Maggie's Militant Tendency'. The BBC settled
out of court, and the two men were awarded damages of Pounds 20,000 each
plus costs.
His ideological reputation is certainly dry to the point of being Saharan.
He apparently remains an unreconstructed 1980s Conservative, a defender of
Mrs Margaret Thatcher to the last in the leadership challenge, and a
resolute anti-Maastricht campaigner.
He has already given indications of his reluctance to see greater government
involvement. Over the summer, for example, he rejected calls by Names on the
Lloyd's insurance market for external regulation. Now he is at work on an
anti-bureaucracy drive throughout Whitehall departments. His other
responsibilities include insolvency, deregulation, competition policy and
company law.
Hamilton evidently has many calls on his time beyond accountancy, and is
unlikely to devote too much time to the subject during his period in office.
But he is at last beginning to make public his views.
He chose a speech in London last week to the Henley College of Management to
make some of his first remarks on accountancy, tucked away behind calls for
new legislation to update the 1985 Companies Act. He expanded his thoughts
in an interview with the Financial Times.
He strongly defends the work of the Accounting Standards Board, the Auditing
Practices Board and the Financial Reporting Council. He cites the
representation of users of accounts on the bodies, and the need for gradual
progress to allow time for debate to settle the complex issues they involve.
'I personally think the progress being made is impressive,' he says. 'The
calibre of the individuals concerned is very high.'
On the subject of the system of self-regulation of accountants by their own
professional bodies, he sees little reason for change and dismisses the
tension some have claimed between the institutes acting as both trade
associations for their members and regulators in the public interest.
'There is no evidence to show there is any conflict between (the two
roles),' he says. 'There is a possibility of conflict. But the great merit
of self-regulation is that it uses experts. If someone can come forward and
produce an example of how a judgement has been perverted I'm prepared to
consider whether it is inadequate.'
'There are some voluble, colourful critics,' he says in a reference to Mr
Austin Mitchell, the Labour MP for Great Grimsby. 'But most of the causes
for complaint refer to the past rather than the present or the immediate
future.'
On the proposals for abolition of the mandatory audit requirement for small
companies, Hamilton offers greater prospects for change. 'We are consulting
(on the subject) for the third time in six years,' he says. 'We keep it
constantly under review. As deregulation minister, I am very keen that we
should get rid of requirements which serve little purpose.'
'We have to weigh the protection for shareholders and creditors against the
costs of audit,' he says. 'For those companies with very small turnover,
paying very large amounts serves very little purpose. The money would be far
better spent on getting decent financial advice.'
He stresses that abolition is not entirely within the remit of the DTI. It
would have an impact on other departments such as the Inland Revenue. But he
says: 'I have to say we've heard all the arguments. Personally I am very
keen. As the principal deregulatory department we are keen to ensure that
costs are proportional to the benefits. For the smallest companies we do
have some scope for some liberalisation. I hope we can move pretty quickly.'
He appears highly sympathetic to accountants' concerns over the escalating
costs of legal liability. He sees no need for any legislation to overturn
the Caparo judgement in the House of Lords, which limited auditors' duty of
care to the company and the shareholders collectively.
He says he has received no pressing case for its reform, and points to the
fact that there are no such recommendations in the interim Cadbury report on
the financial aspects of corporate governance.
'Caparo seemed reasonable to me,' he says. 'If auditors' liability is
extended indefinitely, and they can insure only at prohibitive cost or not
at all, the knock-on effects are very serious. It could threaten the
viability of the auditing system.'
He says it is too early yet to assess the lessons of Maxwell but cites, as
proof of action when necessary, the DTI's recent endorsement of the Bingham
report's conclusions on BCCI that auditors should be required to report
fraud to regulators.
'I hate to think that because of one Robert Maxwell all other company
directors are going to have to assume disproportionate responsibilities,' he
says. 'We have to think how much of an inhibition on the wealth creating
process is a system of regulation which imposes relatively high costs for
relatively small benefits.'
He could have said that - and probably did - when he first came to the
Commons in 1983. Accountants worried about radical reforms facing their
profession will certainly not find them coming from the current DTI.' I hate
to think that because of Robert Maxwell other company directors are going to
have disproportionate responsibilities'

FT  26 NOV 92 / Market-Testing in Whitehall: Cold draught of competition in
Whitehall corridors - The implications for lawyers and accountants of the
government's proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANTS and lawyers are geared up to compete for substantial contracts
as a result of the government's market-testing proposals.
The large accountancy firms have already been active in advising the public
sector on the scope for contracting out services. Now they are poised both
to advise and to take on the services themselves.
A number of firms have cut their teeth on advisory work for local government
and non-governmental organisations. They have also been active in the
growing private-sector market, offering accounting and tax compliance
functions previously run internally.
Many central government market-testing opportunities will be in similar
areas, covering internal audits, payroll, accounting and pensions
administration.
Most of the work to date has been strategic. Mr Malcolm Coster, head of
consulting at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said his firm had won a contract from one
department worth nearly Pounds 1m to advise on quality assurance and the
supervision of its market-testing programmes.
The contracts themselves present more of a difficulty for the firms. Mr
Clive Williams, head of consulting at Ernst &amp; Young, rules out what he calls
the high-volume, low-value-added services many of the contracts would
involve. He said: 'Our strategy is to concentrate on advisory,
high-value-added work.'
Others are less adamant. Mr Brian Pomeroy, head of consulting at Touche
Ross, says his firm is already involved in financial management projects and
is looking at other areas. Mr Richard Gledhill of Price Waterhouse also does
not rule out competing for some market-tested functions.
Andersen Consulting has been particularly involved in running computer
systems contracted out from organisations such as the Stock Exchange, as
well as from companies such as BP.
The question is how far accountancy firms will be able to manage a highly
diverse workforce conducting relatively low-margin long-term work, in
contrast to their traditional higher-margin work by a relatively homogeneous
professional staff.
Lawyers in private practice have called the government's plans for
market-testing legal services unduly cautious.
Market-testing of legal services has been confined to conveyancing services
in the Department of the Environment, all legal services at the Department
of Social Security and services worth Pounds 30m, involving 1,400 mainly
administrative staff, at the Lord Chancellor's Department.
As part of a review of enforcement agents, the government is also planning
to contract out the work of county court bailiffs.
The government had been expected to go much further. The Health and Safety
Executive's routine health and safety prosecution work, the pollution
inspectorate's prosecution work and the Employment Department's local advice
work in the regions were all expected to be candidates for early market
testing.
City lawyers said yesterday the government's caution might stem from lack of
interest by the private sector in competing for government work.
One lawyer said that with such high overheads it was 'virtually impossible'
for central London law firms to make government legal work pay.
The white paper also confirms the government's intention to press ahead with
compulsory competitive tendering for local-authority white-collar services,
including 33 per cent of legal services.
Mr Paul Thomas, of the Law Society's local-government group, said
local-government lawyers had expected the extension of compulsory
competitive tendering to legal services.
Local-government lawyers were specialists in this area and were confident of
winning most of the available work.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Market-Testing in Whitehall: Courts Charter attacked for not
improving access to law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE much-delayed Courts Charter, published yesterday as part of the prime
minister's Citizen's Charter programme, was dismissed by lawyers and
consumer groups as a cosmetic exercise irrelevant to the real issue of
access to justice.
The charter, designed to guarantee national standards of service for court
users in England and Wales, was attacked by the Consumers' Association for
its failure to offer compensation to victims of administrative error by
court staff.
The Lord Chancellor's Department already pays compensation to people who
have suffered financial loss because of negligence by court staff. Last year
the department paid out almost Pounds 600,000, but the charter makes no
mention of entitlement to compensation.
Launching the charter, Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, said there was no
mention of compensation because when something went wrong it was more
important to put it right.
The Law Society said that while the commitment to clearer information for
court users and better procedures for handling witnesses and victims were
welcome, the charter was 'very disappointing'.
The society said it was sceptical about its benefits and surprised to find
no commitment to flexible court opening hours, the improving of case
listings, better accommodation for the disabled and the establishing of
court-based advice services for housing and debt.
Mr Paul Boateng, Labour's legal affairs spokesman, said the charter sought
'to hide an increasingly run-down and under-resourced justice system behind
a glossy veneer that bears no relation to the reality'.
The charter did nothing to address the central issue of equality under and
equal access to the law, he added.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Market-Testing in Whitehall: Council reforms ahead of
Whitehall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPARED with local government, Whitehall is still in the
competitive-tendering stone age. For the past five years, the government's
compulsory competitive tendering (CCT) legislation has obliged local
authorities to put their main blue-collar services out to tender and many
have tendered white-collar services too.
Few authorities have taken contracting out as far as Berkshire county
council. Externalisation, in the Berkshire jargon, is its way of life.
Contracts of an annual value of more than Pounds 35m have been awarded to
outside contractors in the past five years.
Mr Tony Allen, the council's chief executive, said: 'It started in 1988 with
my ambition to get a grip on the management of the place rather than to
market-test services for the sake of it. But the whole process changed
direction once the government set its CCT timetable and obliged us to get on
with it anyway.'
Frontline as well as support services have been put out to tender - well
beyond the requirements of the legislation. Grounds maintenance, computer
support, supplies, cleaning, school meals, vehicle maintenance,
architectural design, quantity surveying, school music tuition, staff
training, highway maintenance and emergency services and forestry are all
out to the private sector. The county is contracting out highways and
planning and making a start on financial services.
The process has been controversial. Most of it took place under a Tory
administration and when the Conservatives lost their majority in a
by-election earlier this year, a halt was called to the contracting-out of
frontline services such as libraries and homes for the elderly.
Mr Allen respects the politicians' preferences but has no doubt that for
support services, at least, the benefits of tendering are undeniable. 'That
is even true of services which we run efficiently,' he said. 'Our own
local-government market is a shrinking one. Therefore if you have got a good
business, it will do better in an external market.'
When the internal team won the county's school meals contract, the county
sought to sharpen up the management and sold it to the BET group. Most local
authorities consider it a victory if the internal team wins a contract. Not
Berkshire.
In more than 90 per cent of cases, private contractors have employed the
former council staff when taking on a contract, almost invariably on similar
conditions of service.
'For that reason the process has not been acrimonious,' Mr Allen said. 'I
have been surprised at how quickly attitudes have changed: we've never
dubbed the process privatisation. It's externalisation - about changing the
management, not the service or necessarily the staff.'
The county's policy with each service to be tendered has been to separate
the staff concerned with strategy and to put the rest in a 'trading agency'
pending 'externalisation'. All services in trading agencies - which include
finance functions - will be subject to market testing.
Mr Allen said there were no differences of principle with contracting-out in
central government. 'And they have just as great a need to create more space
for strategic planning - the greatest benefit of externalisation. For too
long we have all been dominated by production planning problems.'

FT  26 NOV 92 / Market-Testing in Whitehall: Government seeks to clarify
rights of employees in transfers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government acted yesterday to remove uncertainty about whether
regulations concerning the rights of employees when a business is
transferred still apply if public services are contracted out.
Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, used the launch of the
Citizen's Charter white paper to dismiss the discussion about the
application of the regulations as 'a complete red herring', and argued that
savings from contracting out to the private sector would still be achieved.
The uncertainty appeared to threaten the programme of market-testing
Whitehall services and the contracting out of local-government services.
The confusion stemmed from the EC Acquired Rights directive, intended to
secure the pay and conditions of workers who change employers in, for
example, acquisitions and mergers. Unions and some lawyers argued that the
directive applied when work was contracted out.
A recent ruling in the European Court of Justice indicated that UK
regulations putting the directive into practice were wrong to restrict
protection to workers in 'commercial ventures'. The threat of infringement
proceedings by the Commission prompted the Employment Department to amend UK
legislation to make clear that they applied to non-commercial undertakings.
The government's efficiency unit last week wrote to departments and
agencies, denying reports that the Foreign Office had suspended its
market-testing programme. The letter said the regulations had always covered
the public sector and that organisations tendering for public-sector work
had to take account of their possible effects.
Mr Waldegrave said the regulations applied only when an undertaking was
transferred. Whether they applied when delivery of a government service was
awarded to a private-sector tender or when a local-authority service was
contracted out would depend on the facts of the case.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Market-Testing in Whitehall: 44,000 civil servants must
compete to keep jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROGRAMME of market-testing announced yesterday by Mr William
Waldegrave, the public service minister, represents an enormous increase in
the scale of contracting out of central government functions.
The market-testing, the first step in the process that leads to contracting
out, means that in the next 10 months, more than 44,000 civil servants - one
in 12 - will have to compete against outside contractors to keep their jobs.
The value of the activities to be contracted out will rise 50-fold, from
Pounds 25m this year to almost Pounds 1.5bn next.
There will also be a change in the type of work that is put out to tender.
At the start of the 1980s, government support services such as cleaning,
security and reprographics were contracted out to the private sector. As in
much of UK industry, these were seen as non-core functions, better left to
specialist contractors.
Now a much wider range of activities is to be put out to tender, reaching
deep into the heart of government.
The largest category of business to be market-tested in yesterday's
announcement is information technology and computer services. Throughout the
Civil Service, the provision of IT services and the running of computers -
including those holding sensitive tax and benefit information - will
increasingly be carried out by private companies.
Other activities long regarded as core government functions are also
included:
The Treasury's economic model.
The management of the police national computer at Hendon.
Typing and secretarial services in the Inland Revenue.
Ship radio licensing currently done by the Radiocommunications Agency.
Naval surveillance operations by Customs and Excise and the Agriculture
Ministry's fishery protection department.
Engineering and maintenance services for the armed forces.
The survey and certification of ships in British waters.
Many departments will be market-testing payroll, building and estate
management, training and internal audit. Entire executive agencies such as
Companies House and DVOIT (the Transport Department's information technology
agency) will be in the market.
In most cases, staff will be encouraged to bid for the business with help
from management consultants to ensure their bids are competitive. In some,
managers may be able to mount management buyouts, particularly where entire
agencies are to be market-tested.
The government expects as much as Pounds 350m to be saved from the
programme. Yesterday's white paper says: 'In previous years, savings . . .
have typically been about 25 per cent of the original cost, even where the
activity has remained in-house.'
Where the internal team wins the bid, a formal contract will be signed,
specifying the standard of work and means of redress if these are not met.
Mr Waldegrave expects that the result will be not only cheaper services but
also better-quality work.
That optimism has certainly been justified by this year's contracting out of
typing and secretarial services at the new Inland Revenue head office
building in Nottingham.
The winning bid, from Blue Arrow, was reported to have undercut the
Revenue's bid by 25 per cent while offering longer hours of service, higher
accuracy levels and faster turnround targets.
In the past year, every department and agency has had to draw up plans to
extend market-testing to new areas of operation. In most cases it has been
done with consultants who have tried to analyse activities to see what can
be contracted out and to establish that there will be more than one company
interested in bidding for the work.
The programme has been masterminded by the government's efficiency unit,
headed by Sir Peter Levene, the former head of defence procurement at the
Ministry of Defence, who is now deputy chairman and managing director of
Wasserstein Perella, the US investment banking concern.
Departments have already started the process of drawing up tenders and
attracting bidders. The defence ministry last week attracted more than 600
companies to a conference in Birmingham designed to provide information on
what would be market-tested and how to frame a bid.
There is an incentive for contracts to be put out before next July, when the
EC directive on public procurement of services will require all but the
smallest contracts to be advertised throughout the EC. The government has
said that it wishes to be able to take final decisions on awarding contracts
by the end of September next year with contracts starting in 1994.
By then, more market-testing is likely to be under way. Some departments,
such as Trade and Industry and the Welsh Office, are already putting out to
tender more than 10 per cent of their work. Others, such as the Employment
Department, are contracting out less than 5 per cent.
The laggards can expect the spotlight to turn on them next time round, with
hard questions from the government's efficiency unit about why they have yet
to market-test activities that other departments have put out to tender.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Market-Testing in Whitehall: Computing services groups win
bonanza
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE UK-based computing services industry, the market testing programme
announced yesterday is a bonanza beyond their dreams.
It may eventually result in total fees of more than Pounds 750m flowing to
private-sector companies. Last year, total revenues of the 200-plus members
of the Computing Services Association (CSA), the trade body, amounted to
Pounds 4bn.
Market-testing will fundamentally redraw the profile of the industry and
relationships between established suppliers and government will change.
Internal operations that hold on to their department's business may emerge
as computing services companies in their own right.
Only a handful of companies operating in the UK are big enough and have the
capability to profit substantially from the windfall. The majority of them
are foreign-owned.
The Inland Revenue, for example, is seeking a single strategic supplier to
manage its Pounds 250m-a-year information technology budget.
The contract is expected to be in place by the end of 1993 and the value in
the first year is thought to be about Pounds 50m.
The Revenue is speaking initially only to companies with more than 20,000
staff worldwide. Only a large manufacturer could be expected to meet the
Revenue's conditions.
The contenders include International Business Machines and Digital Equipment
of the US, and ICL, now owned by Fujitsu of Japan.
Mr David Teague, ICL managing director for government business, said he
would be disappointed if his company did not win a share of the contracts on
offer at the Inland Revenue, Department of Trade and Industry, Home Office
and Customs and Excise.
Even large companies might find difficulties in meeting the contract
specifications, which imply moving computer staff from government to the
private sector; IBM is losing 40,000 staff worldwide and may not relish
adding several thousand Revenue personnel.
The large computing services companies - Andersen Consulting, Cap Sogeti
Gemini (in the guise of its UK subsidiary, Hoskyns), Computer Services
Corporation, Computer Management Group and Logica and Sema Group could
expect a share of the spoils. Intensive discussions are taking place to
establish consortia to bid for the larger contracts.
The larger concerns welcome the market-testing initiative, which will
increase market volume at a slack time for computing services, but there are
concerns based on a belief that the government has not fully thought through
the implications of outsourcing such sensitive services.
They question whether market testing is a fashion that will have to be
reversed in a few years as the close relationship between policy and data
processing becomes apparent.
One supplier said: 'At present, if ministers ask for information, civil
servants jump. It is not going to be like that again. Once data processing
skills are lost, they will be hard to replace.'
They are also anxious that the reputation of the industry might be damaged
if companies desperate for a share of government business quote
unrealistically low prices. Departments will have legal remedies against
unsatisfactory service, but may have a poor appreciation of the complexity
of moving from one supplier to another.
Questions have also been raised about what redress a government would have
if an internal department won a contract on a low bid and was unable to
fulfil its obligations.
Mr Colin Rowland, a director at Logica and chairman of the CSA, said
market-testing would lead to increased efficiency in government computing.
But some contracts were likely to be so big that only one or two companies
could hope to win them; that in itself would be anti-competitive.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Japanese workers lead on productivity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH FACTORIES lack skilled supervisors and are characterised by
in-fighting among shop-floor workers to curry favour with management, a
study from the institute says.
In a comparison of workforce characteristics at 10 UK plants run by Japanese
companies, the study says British workers are well behind their Japanese
counterparts in terms of productivity, solving problems, taking breaks from
work and identifying with the company line.
UK shop-floor employees score higher than their Japanese counterparts in
gaining qualifications, but that is mainly because these can act as
passports to better jobs with other companies.
More encouraging for the UK is that some aspects of the Japanese work ethos
seem to be taking root in the 10 Japanese 'transplants'.
The study does not identify the companies concerned but says they are mainly
in electronics and car manufacturing.
The study says that in the transplants 'the rate of knowledge acquisition by
UK workers was broadly comparable with that in Japan'. It adds that while
British employees have also taken on some of the competitive characteristics
of their Japanese counterparts, in terms of wanting to outperform rival
companies.
Skilled factory supervisors - the all-rounders of the production line who
link between management and machine operators - are, however, 'almost
impossible to find' in the UK. The study defines a good supervisor as
someone familiar with technology, machines and production practices who is
skilled in human relations and good at creating a team spirit.
The study says a typical UK manufacturing employee who hits on new insights
into production processes tends to keep such facts to him-self.
That is done 'so as to boost his personal standing with the company relative
to his fellows'.
Workers in the Japanese transplants have improved in that area, being keener
to share ideas after having learnt something about the value Japanese
companies give to teamwork.
In seven of the 10 plants, productivity was lower than the equivalent
factories run by the same companies in Japan.
UK workers beat their Japanese equivalents in terms of productivity in only
one case.
British shop-floor employees scored poorly in their ability to repair faults
on the production line or use their initiative to maintain plant to stop it
breaking down. They tended to seek excuses to take a rest from work, such as
during a breakdown or a component shortage.
The study emerged from detailed questioning of Japanese and British managers
in the plants about how equivalent sets of workers com-pared in Japan or the
UK.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Recovery 'unlikely until 1994'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECOVERY from the recession is unlikely until 1994, an assessment of
economic prospects published today by PA Cambridge Economic Consultants
suggests, Peter Marsh writes.
House prices will continue to fall next year while the boost to exports
arising from the pound's devaluation will come through only slowly, PA says
in a report produced with Cambridge University's Department of Land Economy.
The large volume of debts built up by consumers and companies since the late
1980s will constrain any recovery while unemployment will continue to rise
next year, sapping overall confidence.
There will be little extra boost to demand from public spending, because the
poor state of government finances will mean the Treasury wants to hold back
state spending as much as possible.

IN SPITE OF of a pick-up in the third quarter, construction orders continue
to run below the corresponding levels for last year according to figures
published yesterday by the environment department, Andrew Taylor writes.
Total orders received by contractors in Britain during the three months to
the end of September were 17 per cent higher than during the preceding three
months but 1 per cent lower than during the third quarter last year.
The figures are based on the value of orders at constant (1985) prices
adjusted to exclude normal seasonal variations.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Target for inflation 'in jeopardy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S target of keeping underlying inflation below 4 per cent
'may be exceeded' next year as a result of sterling's devaluation and the
recent loosening in monetary policy, the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research says in its latest quarterly review, published yesterday.
The institute is fairly confident about a recovery, projecting economic
growth next year of 2 per cent after a contraction of 0.7 per cent this
year.
But it says unemployment is likely to continue rising - to peak above 3m in
the second half of next year - with the south-east continuing to suffer
large job losses.
An early downturn in unemployment - which the institute expects to stay
above 2.5m until the end of the decade - is likely only in the north of
England and Wales.
Pay pressures can be expected to re-emerge as demand rises next year. That
will be because of the 'deeply entrenched' inflationary psychology in the
UK, the institute explains. That will give an impetus to inflationary
pressures, which are generally subdued at present.
The institute believes the gross domestic product deflator - often regarded
as the best way of measuring underlying inflation - might rise by about 4.75
per cent in 1993 and more than 5 per cent in 1994, with the prices of
imported goods and services increasing by more than 9 per cent next year.
That might place at risk the government's desire to see underlying inflation
 -as measured by the year-on-year increase in the retail prices index less
mortgage payments - kept between 1 per cent and 4 per cent.
While the cuts in bank base rates from 10 per cent to 7 per cent since
September will help consumer and business demand, confidence is likely to
gain strength only slowly, partly because of the continued difficulties in
servicing high debts.
The institute expects unemployment in the south-east to continue to climb in
the next year, to reach nearly 1m by the end of 1993. Total UK unemployment
is 2.87m. Like the south-east, the south-west and East Anglia are likely to
suffer rising unemployment for most of next year, because of the
concentration of service industry and the effects of high debts and large
falls in house prices. Northern regions have been spared the worst effects
of the recession, with more moderate falls in house prices.
Because of the higher concentration of manufacturing industry in those
areas, they should benefit from the increased competitiveness of British
goods overseas, arising from the 13 per cent devaluation of sterling after
its exit from the European exchange rate mechanism on September 16.
By the end of next year, the proportion of the workforce registered as
jobless in the three 'super-regions' of Britain - the north, central regions
and the south-east - will have converged to within about half a percentage
point of each other at between 10 per cent and 11 per cent.
That would contrast with the position six years ago, when the three regions
had widely differing rates of unemployment - 14 per cent, 11 per cent and 8
per cent respectively. High long-term unemployment should be regarded as a
national issue 'with deep-seated roots', the institute says.
Sterling's forced exit from the European exchange rate mechanism will,
according to the institute, consign Britain to the 'outer circle' of Europe
economic affairs for some time.
Before the UK makes any attempt to join the inner core, based on France and
Germany, public support for the concept of economic and monetary union
should be tested with a referendum.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Patten defends school 'leagues'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WAR of words over the government's league tables of school performance
intensified yesterday, with Labour dubbing them a 'comedy of errors'. But Mr
John Patten, the education secretary, admitted only a handful of mistakes
and pledged to publish more comparative information on schools over the next
year.
Appearing before the Commons education committee, Mr Patten made no apology
for publishing last week's league tables. He said that of 83 complaints
investigated, only five were errors made by the Department for Education or
the data collection firms employed by it.
Most of the rest, he claimed, were the result of inaccurate or invalid
information provided by the schools themselves.
Mr Patten told MPs the government would shortly publish comparative local
education authority (LEA) statistics on performance in this year's standard
assessment tasks for seven-year-olds in England. For the first time, the
statistics will include figures for the expenditure per primary-age pupil in
each LEA.
The spending figures were needed 'so that judgments can be made about value
for money at local level', Mr Patten said. 'More and better information for
parents is the key to the achievement of higher standards in our schools.
Under the Parent's Charter, the information about schools' performance made
available to parents in comparative tables will build up systematically over
the remainder of the decade.'
Labour published a catalogue of errors, detailing claims of several hundred
mistakes or omissions in the tables. However, Mrs Ann Taylor, the shadow
education secretary, appeared to commit the party to publishing 'raw' exam
results, which is opposed by the teachers' unions and many Labour LEAs.
Mrs Taylor said: 'Labour has always been in favour of the publication of
information for parents.
'Our proposed home/school contract would make clear the nature of schools'
records, both for all pupils in general and for each specific pupil through
their individual record of achievement.'
She called for results to be published by LEAs, not the government. 'The
fiasco of the last few days proves that national collection of results is
not the best way to provide information.'
Mr Patten said he was considering vocational qualifications for next year's
secondary school tables. All independent schools will also be obliged to
include their results.
The Education Department said it would soon publish an analysis of the
results of this year's tests of 14-year-olds in maths and science.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM to speed up search for EC deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR will accelerate his tour of European capitals this weekend in
an effort to improve the chances of deals' being reached by EC leaders at
next month's Edinburgh summit.
The prime minister expects to visit six capitals in three days, starting
tomorrow, in an attempt to forge a consensus on the future financing of the
community and possible Europe-wide economic growth initiatives. He will also
want to discuss how Danish objections to the Maastricht treaty can be
accommodated.
Downing Street officials conceded that it was 'partially coincidental' that
visits to the most crucial countries - France, Germany and Denmark - have
been left until nearer the Edinburgh summit.
They said Mr Major's meeting in Madrid on Tuesday with Mr Felipe Gonzalez,
the Spanish prime minister, might also prove critical. Spain has put an
emphasis on securing 'cohesion funds' for poorer EC countries and is
suspicious of attempts to define 'subsidiarity' - the principle of
decisions' being made at the lowest possible level of government - which Mr
Major needs to sell the Maastricht treaty to Tory Euro-sceptic MPs.
Downing Street also believes that the French government, although concerned
about the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, will be supportive in
resisting large increases in the EC budget.
Mr Major will visit Rome and Athens tomorrow, returning to London early on
Saturday. On Monday he travels to Luxembourg and probably The Hague and then
leave for Madrid in the evening. He will visit Lisbon on Tuesday. Mr Major
went to Brussels on Monday. Trips to Paris, Dublin, Copenhagen and Bonn have
yet to be arranged.
The prime minister has already phoned Chancellor Kohl in Germany. Mr Major
is not expected to visit any capital more than once before the Edinburgh
summit. Mr Major is also keen for the summit to discuss the completion of
the single market, enlargement of the EC and Gatt. The Commons will begin
the committee stage of the Maastricht bill next week.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour party sets up policy reviews
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour party's ruling National Executive Committee yesterday agreed to
set up internal working parties to examine its policies on Europe and
constitutional reform.
The NEC settled terms of reference and part of the membership of the first
two 'policy commissions', established under the party's new scheme for
scrutinising each area of its appeal to voters.
The brief given to the group conducting a review of policy on Europe and the
European Community, is 'to review and prepare proposals on Labour's policies
and approach on the European Community and on the wider issues relating to
Europe as a whole'.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, who switched party policy from
wishing to withdraw from the EC to favouring full participation in Europe,
will be one of the review group members.
The second group, dealing with constitutional reform, will consider such
issues as how to provide the best protection for fundamental rights and
freedoms of individuals, and how to reflect regional aspirations.
Its proposals should aim to ensure policies 'consistent with (Labour's)
fundamental objectives of securing fairness, social justice and individual
liberty for all people in equal measure, and achieving a wider, more open
democracy'.
Both groups have been told to produce their first report by next April, when
they will be considered by the new National Policy Forum, an elected body
representing all sections of the Labour party.
The Conservative party received more than Pounds 2.8m in donations from
British industry in 1991, according to a Labour survey published yesterday.
According to the survey of the 1991 annual reports of around 1,500
businesses, 171 companies gave a total of more than Pounds 2.8m in direct
donations to the Tory party, an increase of more than Pounds 220,000 on the
previous year.
The biggest single donation, of Pounds 130,000, was made for the second year
running by United Biscuits, which increased its donation by more than 16 per
cent. It was one of five donors that gave more than Pounds 100,000.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Political Notebook: A chancellor-in-waiting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Major has six weeks in which to reshuffle his cabinet. Beyond the first
week of January, the timetable for the March budget will make it impossible
to change his chancellor. Without a switch at the Treasury, a reshuffle
would not be worthy of the name.
We are told the prime minister has not given the issue much thought. He has
one or two other things on his mind - the economy, the Edinburgh summit and
the arms-to-Iraq scandal among them. Mr Norman Lamont has concluded he is
safe. He may well be.
Many on the right of the Tory party at Westminster are not so sure.
They are campaigning for a continuation of the status quo, warning the whips
that Mr Lamont's departure from the Treasury would shatter the uneasy calm
on the back benches.
But the most striking element of this less-than-discreet lobbying is not
their loyalty to the chancellor, but their fear of his most likely
successor.
Mr Kenneth Clarke has emerged from the chaos of the past two months as
indisputably the most powerful minister in Mr Major's cabinet. As home
secretary, officially he ranks third in the pecking order. For different
reasons, though, his influence has eclipsed both that of Mr Lamont and that
of his close friend and mentor Mr Douglas Hurd.
One - slightly jealous - colleague who has watched him at close quarters
says that the home secretary has been transformed by events since Black
Wednesday. Where others lost their nerve, Mr Clarke reinforced his
authority.
It is partly a question of temperament. After seven years on the front line
 -at employment, health, education and latterly the Home Office - Mr Clarke
is one of the government's most experienced firefighters.
Once dubbed the thinking man's lager lout (in fact he can't abide the stuff)
he has learnt to rein in his instinctive pugnacity, replacing it in public
with a more controlled self-confidence.
After the sterling debacle, Mr Clarke appeared almost daily on the nation's
television screens to state calmly that, yes, the government had suffered a
huge setback, but now it was getting on with the job of picking up the
pieces.
When Downing Street wanted someone to appear on a BBC Panorama programme to
defend the prime minister against (erroneous) charges that he had suffered a
nervous breakdown, the home secretary was the natural choice.
In the process, Mr Clarke quickly established himself as the 'bus' candidate
should Mr Major suffer a nasty accident. But what really frightens the Tory
right is that he staked a compelling claim also to what will remain for some
time the toughest job in the government - running the economy.
Black Wednesday persuaded Mr Clarke to broaden his horizons. He has never
made a secret of his strongly pro-European views. Nor has he hidden a
conviction that the pound cannot for long be excluded from any European-wide
effort to stabilise exchange rates.
Hitherto, he has been relatively circumspect about promoting his cause. The
resurgence of the anti-Maastricht, anti-ERM forces within the party
persuaded him that the other side of the argument had to be put loudly and
clearly around the cabinet table as well as to the wider world. He sees
Britain's return to the ERM as a question of when rather than if. He is
ready, if it proves necessary, to advocate higher taxation to close the
ever-widening gap in the nation's finances. He was one of the strongest
advocates of protecting capital projects in the spending round.
Mr Clarke is proud of his label as a One-Nation Tory. He wore it again this
week when he told the Tory Reform Group that the emergence of a dispossessed
underclass in the inner cities represented the greatest threat to civilised
democracies.
So the right has cause to be fearful - but those who seek to bracket him as
an old-fashioned Wet make a serious mistake. If he is unencumbered by the
baggage of theoretical monetarism, he is adamant that low inflation is the
prerequisite for a successful economy and a less divided society.
An unashamed meritocrat, he is as dismissive of Tory paternalism as he is as
some of the more extreme ideology of Thatcherism.
His call this week for a drive to help the poor and disadvantaged offered
free-market rather than statist solutions to their deprivation. His speech
to the TRG was peppered with allusions to the enterprise culture and to
individual responsibility.
He sees his principal task at the Home Office as taking on the 'producer'
interests represented by the police and the prison officers.
But above all, Mr Clarke he has proved himself confident and robust during
crises. With no immediate prospect of economic recovery, there will be
plenty more of those for the chancellor. The question Mr Clarke's admirers
are asking is whether Mr Major has the confidence to give him the job.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INQUIRY into the costs of maintaining royal palaces such as Windsor
Castle, which was partly destroyed by fire last week, was proposed last
night by a cross-party Commons committee.
The public accounts committee has asked Sir John Bourn, comptroller and
auditor general, to consider launching a 'value for money' study into the
Department of National Heritage and Royal Palaces owned by the state.
However, in spite of pressure from some Labour MPs, the committee has
decided that it will not - at least at this stage - look at wider issues of
the financing of the Royal Family and whether the Queen should pay tax. The
committee's responsibilities, in conjunction with the comptroller and
auditor-general, are traditionally to ensure efficiency in Whitehall.
In a private meeting last night, MPs on the public accounts committee
discussed the possibility of a wider inquiry into the Royal Family's
finances but no agreement was reached.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Treasury hints at economic decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY is near to admitting that Britain's long-term potential to
produce goods and services has been damaged by the lingering recession,
Treasury officials indicated last night, Peter Marsh writes.
Giving evidence to the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee,
Professor Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief economic adviser, also suggested
that unemployment was likely to continue rising through next year. It would
be 'many years' before the government's finances returned to surplus.
The new assessment by Treasury officials of the longer-term effects of the
recession is the gloomiest indication that the Treasury has given so far
into the economic decline that Britain faces deep-seated economic problems.
Mr Chris Riley, the Treasury official in charge of medium-term policy
analysis, said it was 'quite possible' that in the budget next March the
Treasury would revise down its long-term projections about the potential of
the economy.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Commons endorses plan to freeze
MPs' pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPS VOTED themselves a year-long pay freeze in the Commons last night after
the government appeared to indicate they would receive an increase of at
least 3.9 per cent from January 1994.
A government motion advocating the freeze was convincingly carried by 321
votes to 103, a majority of 218.
Opposition MPs who voted against pegging next year's salary at Pounds 30,854
included former shadow cabinet members Mr Gerald Kaufman and Mr Roy
Hattersley as well as Sir David Steel of the Liberal Democrats.
The government had previously staved off defeat on a cross-party amendment
advocating that for pension purposes, MPs should be treated as if they had a
1.5 per cent pay increase from January instead of a freeze.
This was defeated without a vote after Mr Tony Newton, leader of the
Commons, offered to consult with MPs' representatives over the possible
alternative of 'building on' general provisions for additional voluntary
contributions in pension schemes generally.
That approach, he suggested, might better resolve the difficulties the
amendment was designed to address by guaranteeing MPs a return on any
additional money they might wish to contribute.
Opening the debate, Mr Newton said that the government accepted the need for
a clear link between MPs' salaries and an accepted Civil Service grade.
However, the growing role of performance-related pay in the Civil Service
meant that changes to existing arrangements - implemented in 1987 - were
necessary.
The government had 'no wish' to return to the situation where MPs had to
decide on their own level of pay each year, Mr Newton said.
On the basis of the link established by the 1987 resolution, backbenchers
would have received a 3.9 per cent increase this year to Pounds 32,057.
Mr Newton said the government did not wish MPs to be permanently
disadvantaged by 3.9 per cent in relation to civil servants, implying they
may get a rise of at least this magnitude from January 1 1994.
He said that restraint in public expenditure was 'a necessary condition' of
the government's ability to direct resources to areas of spending which
should 'rightly be priorities'.
He reminded MPs that public-sector pay rises were being limited to a maximum
of 1.5 per cent for the year ahead. It was 'right for the government and the
House as a whole to give a lead in exercising restraint'.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, claimed the government was
trying to use MPs as a 'stalking horse' to attack and undermine the position
of others in the public sector.
By freezing MPs' pay, the government hoped to create 'an illusion of
fairness - that the highest paid are taking their fair share,' she argued.
In fact, senior civil servants and judges would next year receive more than
MPs and more than 1.5 per cent.
Mrs Beckett urged MPs to consider their overall incomes before they voted.
More than 50 of the Tory backbenchers who signed a Commons early day motion
in support of the government's position had other declared interests.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: UK guilty of breach in water
standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Court of Justice yesterday found the UK government guilty of
breaking EC rules on drinking-water quality - the first time the UK has been
convicted by the court of a breach of environmental standards.
The court backed a complaint from the European Commission that nitrate
levels in 28 supply zones in England in 1989 exceeded permitted limits, and
that the UK had failed to implement EC directives in time. It accepted that
the UK was rectifying the situation.
It threw out a second complaint from the Commission that lead levels
exceeded legal limits.
The affected zones, out of a total of 2,000 in England and Wales, were all
in East Anglia, supplied by Anglian Water and Cambridge Water.
Speaking in Copenhagen, Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said the
UK would comply with the EC directive in 12 of the areas mentioned in the
ruling by the end of this year, and in the remainder by the end of 1995.
'It would not have been practicable to have complied sooner,' he said.
'There is no danger to health in any of the areas. If there were, we would
have taken steps sooner.' Mr David Maclean, environment minister, added that
the ruling was 'mainly about technicalities rather than the quality of the
UK's drinking water and refers only to certain aspects of the situation as
it was in 1989.'
But Friends of the Earth, the environmental group that first made the
complaint about the UK's failure to meet requirements in 1986, called the
ruling a 'landmark decision' and a 'major embarrassment for the government'.
It urged that polluters, mainly farmers who use fertilisers that release
nitrates into water, and not consumers should bear the costs of meeting
requirements on nitrates - estimated at about Pounds 155m.
Mr Mike Swallow, director of the Water Companies Association, said the water
industry was involved in a Pounds 14bn investment programme to meet
environmental standards. Yet 98.7 per cent of more than 3m water samples
tested by the government's drinking water inspectorate in 1991 already met
all EC requirements.
The EC directive was issued in 1980 and was due to be in practice by 1985.
The UK government argued that it imposed no obligation to achieve a result,
but required every effort to meet the standards within the time limit.
Yesterday's court judgment was that member states were obliged to achieve
results.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTIGATORS are examining the possibility that driver error or signal
failure caused the train crash that injured 10 rush-hour commuters in London
yesterday.
The crash happened at 7.30am when a near-empty Charing Cross to Tunbridge
Wells train hit the side of a crowded Ramsgate to Charing Cross train at
Borough Market junction, near London Bridge.
Both trains were travelling slowly and injuries were slight, but the
collision caused severe disruption to thousands of commuters travelling into
Charing Cross, Cannon Street, Waterloo East, Blackfriars and London Bridge
stations.
The accident also caused the cancellation of a ceremony at Cannon Street at
which Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, and Sir Bob Reid, British
Rail's chairman, had been due to inaugurate a new generation of commuter
trains for Network SouthEast's poorly performing Kent Link services.

Pounds 471m in the same period a year before.
The deficit in cars, commercial vehicles and automotive parts and
accessories in the first nine months rose by 131 per cent to Pounds 2.56bn,
more than double the deficit for the whole of last year.
The motor industry alone accounted for more than a third of the total UK
visible trade deficit of Pounds 3.25bn in the third quarter.
The performance has worsened in the face of faltering exports of automotive
products and a rapid rise in the value of imports.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders warned that 'it may be some
time yet' before the motor industry trade balance benefited from the
devaluation of sterling.
The value of automotive imports continued to rise with a jump of 22 per cent
in the third quarter. The SMMT warned yesterday that 'stocks of imported
cars must already be at relatively high levels and any further growth could
result in serious stock problems in coming months.'

FT  26 NOV 92 / Homes raided as police probe Alan Paul chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE investigating the collapse last year of the Alan Paul hairdressing
and cosmetic shop franchise chains yesterday raided 13 homes or offices of
directors and senior employees in Merseyside, Cheshire and Greater
Manchester.
The raids, by 75 officers from several police forces, were led by Detective
Chief Superintendent Bill Coady, head of Merseyside's fraud squad. Police
removed papers and records but there were no arrests.
Homes raided included those of Mr Alan Moss, the company's former chairman,
and Mr Mike Rowlands, the managing director.
Police said yesterday they were investigating possible 'financial
irregularities' in the running of Alan Paul and the 'circumstances
surrounding the company's rights issue' of July last year. The issue flopped
with only a 15 per cent take-up, and the subsequent slide in the share price
led to Alan Paul shares being suspended, followed by receivership. Alan
Paul's rise was one of the more noticeable small-business growth stories of
the 1980s, partly because of the flamboyance of Mr Moss and Mr Rowlands -
they encouraged franchisees to emulate them by driving BMWs and Ferraris -
but also because the company became Britain's only quoted hairdresser.
It floated on the unlisted securities market in 1989 and Mr Moss, who
founded the business in Bromborough, Wirral in 1970, celebrated with a
personalised number plate for his red Ferrari, USM 1.
Expansion was via franchising and taking over other chains. The group
included Body &amp; Face Place cosmetics shops. From 60 outlets on flotation the
group grew to 542 shops and salons.
The failed rights issue, a profits warning and two changes of chairman in
two months led to shares being suspended a year ago at 20p. They had floated
at 140p and peaked at 166p.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, appointed receiver in December last year, contacted the
police in February.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Self-drive electric cars for Coventry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COVENTRY City Council and Peugeot, the carmaker whose Ryton factory is on
the city's edge, are launching a joint effort to make Coventry the UK's
first area with a public network of electric cars.
Although the cars are not likely to be built at Ryton, Peugeot and Coventry
council expect that by 1996 the vehicles will be available on rental for
individual journeys, with hirers using a 'smart card' to pay at special car
parks controlled through a computer network.
The city's transportation and highways committee voted yesterday in favour
of the project, which aims to make the city one of four in Europe each
operating trial fleets of 200 Peugeot 106 and Citroen AX electric cars. The
council will use them to help assess the potential of electric cars for
reducing pollution, noise and congestion.
The French coastal city of La Rochelle has already started a pilot project
with 50 cars and Tours is ready to start a scheme. Similar schemes are
thought to have been planned in Milan and Barcelona, but that is on a
smaller scale, involving a fleet of 50 of the small Peugeots and Citroens.
Peugeot, which believes Europeans are likely to buy 200,000 electric cars a
year by the end of the decade, is co-ordinating the project under the EC
Commission's Thermie programme for promoting new energy technologies.
Next year the Thermie programme will enter a new phase in which it will
concentrate on technologies designed to reduce environmentally damaging
emissions of carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide.
The commission will have a budget of Pounds 250m for such projects next year
and in 1994, and will be empowered to meet 40 per cent of the cost of
individual projects.
Peugeot is understood to be planning production of up to 50,000 electric
cars a year by as early as 1996 in the belief that pollution, noise and
congestion will lead to cars with petrol or diesel engines being
progressively banned from large city centres throughout Europe.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Watchdog criticises Ford finance plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD OF Britain is to amend advertising, sales literature and other material
for its Options car finance scheme after being told by the Office of Fair
Trading that aspects of it are 'misleading'.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, is to seek assurances
from other manufacturers that they will not promote similar schemes in the
same way.
Options is a modified hire purchase scheme under which the 'buyer' makes
monthly payments on a portion - usually about half - of the full price of
the car, plus interest on the full price.
The driver has to pay a final instalment of several thousand pounds. The
underlying intention is to encourage the driver to hand back the car to Ford
in exchange for a new agreement.
The OFT's criticisms were that the promotional material purported to compare
Options with a bank loan, implying that they were similar schemes.
But with a bank loan, Sir Bryan said, the customer owned the car from the
time of sale and was free to sell it as desired. Under Options, the car
remained Ford's property until the last payment was made. In not making a
true comparison, Ford was in breach of consumer credit legislation.

FT  26 NOV 92 / MPs told of risk to BR routes in south
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEA CONTAINERS, the Bermuda-based shipping, ferry and hotel group, warned
yesterday that 5 per cent of British Rail's routes would have to close if
railways were to become profitable after privatisation.
Mr James Sherwood, Sea Containers' president, told MPs that early candidates
in the Network SouthEast area would include the North Downs line between
Reading and Tonbridge and the Sussex Coast line between Brighton and
Hastings.
Sea Containers has told the government that it is interested in taking on
the franchise for the operation of Network SouthEast's passenger train
services between London and the south coast after privatisation.
Mr Sherwood told the Commons transport committee that three conditions would
have to be fulfilled if costs and revenues were to make the operation
viable:
Sea Containers would want control of the tracks as well as the trains
because it would need to secure reductions in track costs.
Mr Sherwood calculated that there was scope for savings of Pounds 50m a
year.
Double-decker trains would have to be introduced to increase revenues
because existing track and train capacity was full and higher fares would
result in loss of traffic to road transport.
Under-used lines would have to close because they were losing too much
money.
'At the moment, British Rail is spending tens of millions of pounds a year
running services that no one wants,' Mr Sherwood said.
He added that if the government wanted loss-making services to run, it would
have to subsidise them. But he said he believed the government intended to
phase out subsidies.
Three other prospective train operators appearing before the committee lent
some much-needed support for the government's privatisation proposals, but
each wanted adjustments to the proposed regime.
Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Group, said he was interested in
providing inter-city services on routes similar to those now operated by
short-haul aircraft.
The biggest single issue facing his company and other train operators was
how much they were going to be charged for the use of the tracks.
Mr Branson said rail could not compete with road at present because train
oper-ators had to pay very heavy track costs while road users enjoyed free
access to the highways.
'Are they going to continue to subsidise road at the expense of rail or are
they going to balance the books?' he asked.
'If they are going to balance the books, it will make entry that much
easier.'
Two bus companies, Stagecoach and Yorkshire Rider, broadly supported the
government's proposals but wanted Railtrack, the track-owning authority, to
be decentral-ised so that its boundaries matched those of the franchise
areas.
Stagecoach said it wanted that to be a transitional step leading to the
eventual takeover of the tracks by franchisees.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Bloodstock VAT change 'threatens jobs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of jobs could be lost in the British horsebreeding industry under
a value added tax regime to be introduced on January 1, a cross-party
committee of MPs heard yesterday.
Mr Christopher Haines, chief executive of the Jockey Club, told the Commons
employment committee the VAT charges were the reason why Tattersalls, the
UK's largest bloodstock auctioneer, was moving its most prestigious sales to
Ireland, where VAT is almost 15 percentage points lower than in the UK.
Tattersalls said yesterday it had previously believed that horses brought
from Ireland or France for sale at Newmarket would be liable for VAT at
rates applying in their country of origin, but it now appears that VAT will
be charged at the full UK rate.
The racing world has been warning for some time that the UK was in danger of
losing its position as a centre for horse breeding and sales.
Racing trade organisations say the UK's high level of VAT, at 17.5 per cent,
is driving buyers to Ireland, where VAT is 2.7 per cent, and to France, with
its 5.5 per cent rate.
The government has refused a request from horsebreeders to impose a lower
rate of VAT or to register them for VAT - as occurs in France - which would
mean they would get the VAT they pay back.
Horsebreeders claim they will be at a disadvantage with competitors
including France, which Mr Haines said was more flexible.
He said: 'We are playing Marquess of Queensberry rules with people who are
not doing so.' The British government had been slow to heed the threat to an
industry that provided employment for 30,000 people directly and 100,000
indirectly.
Tattersalls said most of its auctions would still be held at its
headquarters in Newmarket.
The move to Ireland applies only to the top-of-the-market Houghton yearlings
sale, where prices are over Pounds 20,000, and the tax differential has hit
particularly hard.
Houghton sales account for about a third of Tattersalls' turnover, which was
Pounds 53m last year and is expected to fall to Pounds 35m this year.
The absence of Arab buyers - previously big spenders at Newmarket - from
October's Houghton sale was blamed on the high tax levels.
They were well represented at the Irish sales soon after.
Britain's betting industry is pressing the government to relax restrictions
that prevent betting shops opening in the evening.
A Gallup survey sponsored by the Betting Office Licensees Association shows
that most customers want betting shops, which at present must shut at
6.30pm, to remain open to cover evening racing in the summer and satellite
televised races at other times of the year.
It is argued that the exchequer, which at present collects Pounds 500m a
year in duty from the betting industry, would be a big beneficiary as
turnover would increase by at least 10 per cent if evening opening were
allowed, bringing in an additional Pounds 50m or more in tax.
Evening opening would also secure current employment and create a
substantial number of jobs.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Scornful miners tell Willis to go back to London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CROWD of 200 'Tory haters' gathered outside Doncaster's Mansion House,
where the TUC general council met yesterday, but they saved their real anger
for their brothers from the London-based organisation.
They jostled general council members and one aimed a punch at Mr Norman
Willis, the TUC general secretary. For an hour they shouted: 'TUC get off
your knees - organise a general strike'.
But the general council - holding its first meeting outside London, apart
from annual conferences - would have none of it. Mr Willis ruled out a
general strike: 'There is no way the TUC puts its head into a legal noose,'
he said, referring to the law banning secondary action.
The TUC would urge workers to seek the views of their employers on the
position of their businesses in the economy and to build a partnership for
jobs on their National Day of Recovery on December 9.
Even Mr Arthur Scargill, the National Union of Mineworkers president,
confined himself to saying that he would demand a 'day of action' if any of
the 10 pits earmarked for immediate closure were shut before the end of the
present review procedure.
Mr Scargill was nowhere to be seen in the bar of the Armthorpe Miners'
Welfare, near the threatened Markham Main pit. Here a group from the general
council had a cool welcome at an increasingly heated meeting with about 100
miners who were carrying Socialist Worker newspapers.
They listened politely as Mr Willis criticised the government and repeated
that there would be no general strike. But when he invited questions, he got
several emotional speeches.
'Norman, please don't sit on the fence any more, because everyone is
laughing at you,' said one. 'We need some more positive leadership. We are
begging you for a general strike.'
Another said: 'Walking around Hyde Park in the rain while the Tories are sat
at home in front of the fire, drinking and laughing, is not enough. We need
a strike.'
Others shouted that Mr Willis would have no job had workers obeyed the law
in history - there would be no TUC. 'Sod off back to London, Norman,' they
said.
An NUM official pointed out that his union had not yet called for a general
strike, although it was aware of the anger of members.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Nine engineering companies will close if pit closures go
ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NINE engineering companies will close and more than 4,500 jobs be lost if
the pit closure programme goes ahead, according to the AEEU, the largest
union in engineering.
Mr Bill Jordan, the union's president, told the Commons employment committee
yesterday: 'In normal times it would be difficult to sustain the cutbacks
and redundancies the proposed pit closures would inflict on its suppliers.
But at this time, in the midst of the longest-running recession since World
War Two, such avoidable damage is the last thing that British industry
needs.'
Basing his estimates on reports from companies where his union had members,
Mr Jordan asked the committee to keep confidential a detailed analysis of
the companies affected. He said the companies did not want to be identified
for commercial reasons.
Mr Jordan said suggestions that Magnox nuclear power stations should be run
down faster to allow more room in the market for coal-fired stations would
result in thousands of nuclear power workers losing their jobs.
British Coal should seek to export its coal, which was the cheapest in
Europe, he said.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Call to break up generators: Power companies defend gas move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWEB, THE north of England power company, called yesterday for the
break-up of National Power and PowerGen, the two large electricity
generators, as it and two other regional electricity companies mounted a
robust defence of their diversification into gas-fired generation.
The three regional companies, giving evidence to a Commons committee on
energy, also supported growing calls for the government to postpone
liberalisation of the electricity market from 1994.
Southern Electricity said that maintaining the existing levels for
competition, where only large customers have a choice of who supplies them,
would allow British Coal to secure a five-year contract for 55m tonnes in
1993-94 and 45 tonnes thereafter. That is 15m tonnes a year more than the
proposed current contract between British Coal and the generators and could
help to keep more than 10 pits open.
Norweb's call for a break-up of National Power and PowerGen into five
separate companies reflects resentment among the regional companies over
generators' pricing policies since privatisation two years ago.
Mr Ken Harvey, Norweb chairman, said his company was concerned that the
present structure of the bulk electricity market did not allow sufficient
competition, and even after all independent gas-fired power stations were
built they would supply only 13 per cent of the market.
Mr Harvey said his company suspected that National Power and PowerGen were
keeping back 3 per cent, or about Pounds 100m, of the benefits of lower coal
prices.
He said the same regulatory framework that applied to the regional
companies' supply businesses should be applied to the generators.
Mr Duncan Ross, chairman of Southern, said independent power plants were the
only means to get strong down-ward pressure on generators' prices.
Yorkshire Electricity said a larger and more secure franchise
(non-competitive market) should not result in higher prices to customers.
It said there was obvious scope for monopolistic profits to be made in the
absence of generator competition.
Yorkshire also suggested a one-year interim contract between British Coal,
the generators and the regional companies while regulatory and contractual
issues were resolved.

<TEXT>
GPT, Britain's largest tele-communications manufacturer, has lost market
share in the latest Pounds 926m batch of orders from British
Telecommunications for modernising its network.
GPT is still BT's largest supplier, but Sweden's Ericsson has increased its
market share. GPT has won Pounds 579m in orders for computerised exchanges
and software over the next three years, while Ericsson has won Pounds 346m
(figures do not add because of rounding).
The bulk of the order placed with Ericsson was made in September. It was
increased yesterday from Pounds 250m to Pounds 346m to include software
development and support. The orders also represent a decline in BT's
investment in exchanges as the company's modernisation programme nears its
end, Mr Albert Mandall, GPT's manager for customer communications, said. BT
has increased its investment in software.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Sunday trade pressure fear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO THIRDS of retail companies opposed deregulation of Sunday trading but
the same proportion believes competitive pressure would force them to open
if the Shops Act were repealed, according to new research from Cambridge
University.
The research, released by the Keep Sunday Special lobby group, found that 44
per cent of shops surveyed were already opening on Sunday, particularly
larger ones, and 36 per cent of employees reported having worked at least
one Sunday in the previous year.
Half the shops surveyed by the Small Business Research Centre and the Centre
for European Legal Studies at Cambridge thought their profitability would
decline as a result of Sunday trading and only 10 per cent thought it would
increase.
The main finding of the research is that present employment legislation is
unlikely to guarantee shopworkers the right not to work on Sunday or to
receive a wage premium for Sunday working if controls on trading hours are
removed.
At present, most shops are paying double time for Sunday work, but that is
likely to become less common if Sunday becomes just another working day, the
researchers say.
Over 90 per cent of employees surveyed said they did not welcome the
opportunity to work on a Sunday and a similar proportion favoured formal
legal protection against having to work on Sunday.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Record rise in cable services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE cable television industry has enjoyeda record period of growth, the
Independent Television Commission said yesterday.
In the three months to October, 49,667 new subscribers were connected,
bringing the total in the previous 12 months to 159,569. Both figures were
records.
The quarterly ITC figures show that the total number of subscribers to
modern multi-channel cable systems rose to 380,297 with cable operators,
mainly North American, accelerating their building of cable networks.
Cable services are available to 1.75m homes. The penetration rate - the
proportion of those who subscribe out of those who could do so - is 21.7 per
cent, an increase of 2.8 percentage points over the year. The ITC believes
the cable audience exceeds 1.2m.
The most striking growth was in cable companies offering telephone services
as well as television.
Of the 57 operating franchises, 21 are offering a telephone service, almost
all in competition with British Telecom.
In the year to October, the number of telephone lines installed by cable
companies rose from 11,903 to 72,681.
Sir George Russell, chairman of the ITC, said earlier this week that by the
end of the year investment in cable would exceed Pounds 1bn.
The ITC chairman also quoted Saatchi &amp; Saatchi forecasts that by the turn of
the century 7.6m people would be receiving cable services and that 70 per
cent of the country would be covered.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Auction reflects unsettled market: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ART market is in a very unsettled state, with some important items
selling, some not.
That was apparent at Christie's in London yesterday when auctions of
illuminated manuscripts and books, and of silver, were a third unsold.
A Book of Hours produced in Paris in about 1430 sold for Pounds 154,000.
Silver, until recently a sound market, was disappointing. Two important
lots, a pair of William III andirons (estimated at up to Pounds 150,000) and
a pair of George II tea caddies, offered by the St Germans family, were
unsold.
The top price was the Pounds 48,400 paid for a George IV silver-gilt
two-handled tray by Philip Rundell, which doubled its forecast price.
A saleroom discovery, a Rembrandt drawing of 'Joseph Explaining the Dreams
of the Butler and the Baker', sold for Pounds 151,648 at Christie's in
Amsterdam to a New York dealer. The owner brought it into the auction house
in London for attribution. It was estimated at Pounds 100,000.
Another discovery, 'Phaeton's Fall' by the Dutch artist Hendrick Goltzius,
was sold to the London dealer Hazlett, Gooden &amp; Fox for Pounds 80,037.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Lloyd's elects Rowland to council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of Lloyd's of London yesterday voted Mr David Rowland to the
insurance market's governing council, clearing the way for his expected
election by 20 fellow council members to the post of chairman next week.
The council votes on Wednesday, although Mr Rowland will not be confirmed as
chairman in succession to Mr David Coleridge until the new year. Mr Rowland,
59, has spent most of his working life at Lloyd's. He announced his
resignation as chairman of Sedgwick Group, the insurance broker, earlier
this year.
Mr Rowland topped the poll of working Names - those who have jobs with
brokers and agencies in the market - winning 2,818 votes. Mr Robert Hiscox,
managing director of the Roberts &amp; Hiscox agency, came second with 2,283
votes.
Also elected were Mr Stephen Merrett and Mr Richard Keeling, both prominent
underwriters, with 1,513 and 1,214 votes respectively. Mr Hiscox and Mr
Merrett were members of a 14-strong market task force chaired by Mr Rowland
that proposed wide-ranging reforms at Lloyd's in January.
Mr David James, a 'company doctor' who is chairman of Lep Group, Eagle Trust
and Davies &amp; Newman, was also elected to the council.
Mr James topped the poll of outside Names with 4,230 votes. His closest
challenger was Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker Names
Action group, with 3,598 votes. He failed to gain election to the council.
The Association of Lloyd's Members (ALM), the biggest Names organisation,
which represents 9,000 of Lloyd's 22,400 Names, backed Mr James's candidacy.
Its chairman, Mr Neil Shaw, welcomed the result: 'David Rowland's election
means that Lloyd's top team is now in place. The ALM looks forward to
working with them to build a successful Lloyd's and to handle the problem of
damaged Names in the most sympathetic way possible without being unfair to
the majority.'

FT  26 NOV 92 / Monetary union holds no fears for Caricom: EC's problems
provide useful lessons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CENTRAL bankers and finance ministers from the Caribbean Community (Caricom)
have been watching with great interest the recent difficulties of the
European Community's monetary system and its exchange rate mechanism. They
see lessons for their own attempts to create a common market by establishing
a monetary union with a single currency over the next eight years.
Europe's problems appear, if anything, to have confirmed the Caribbean
intention to proceed towards a monetary union - but to do it with caution.
Despite its flaws, said one central banker, the European experience has
shown that any meaningful economic integration must include a monetary
union.
Caricom's aim is to bring some order to a confusion of currencies and
financial policies among its 13 members, whose population totals only 5.5m.
Monetary union is also seen by some as an answer to sometimes chronic
problems of trade payments.
Finding common ground, however, on the policies which will guide them
towards such a union could be difficult for governments which, at times,
tend to sacrifice regional economic co-operation to narrow parochialism.
Under the first phase Barbadian, Trinidadian and East Caribbean dollars will
be freely convertible with each other. The three central banks will
establish a regional monetary authority to co-ordinate policies, while the
governments will pursue common policies leading to a deregulation of wages,
prices and trade.
Other Caricom members will join the monetary authority after they have met
criteria based on their reserves. Eventually, all the currencies will be
floated and made freely convertible against each other. In due course the
monetary authority will be converted into a regional central bank to
administer a common currency.
The region already has a functioning monetary union which is being used as a
model. The Eastern Caribbean dollar, one of the area's stronger currencies,
is used in the seven islands of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean
States, a sub-group of Caricom. Its value is fixed at 2.7 to the US dollar
and cannot be changed unilaterally.
The Barbados dollar is fixed at 2 to the US dollar, but has been under
pressure recently because of shortfalls in the island's fiscal and external
accounts, brought on by reduced earnings from tourism and sugar, the pillars
of the economy.
The Trinidadian currency has remained at 4.25 since 1989. It comes under
pressure in line with the state of the international oil market. Trinidad
and Tobago's economy is 75 per cent dependent on its oil industry.
Integrating the Jamaican and Guyanese currencies could be a test of
financial management. Both are floating as part of programmes to deregulate
those countries' economies.
The Jamaican dollar, floated 15 months ago, tumbled 56 per cent before being
revalued by 26 per cent. The Guyanese dollar appears to have found its real
parity after plunging 55 per cent when first floated.
In the words of a St Lucian official, however, Caricom should not approach
the common currency and the establishment of the monetary union with
trepidation. 'Although many do not realise it, the community has had a
common currency for some time,' he said. 'It is the US dollar. The only
problem is that there has never been enough of it around.'

FT  26 NOV 92 / Clinton aide mulls options for activism: Michael Prowse
profiles a key member of the president-elect industrial team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAURA D'Andrea Tyson is one of those 'cautious activists' who surround Bill
Clinton. If there is a more aggressive US industrial policy under the new
president, much of it will be put down to her.
'I have always walked a tightrope,' says Ms Tyson, a professor of economics
at the University of California's Berkeley campus and one of the few women
likely to exert an important influence on the Clinton administration's
economic policy.
She performs something of a balancing act within the US economics
profession. She is far more sceptical of free market theories than many
colleagues. She was one of the few US academics willing to defend the 1986
semiconductor trade deal between the US and Japan under which Tokyo agreed
to assist foreign companies in achieving a 20 per cent share of the Japanese
market. Many theorists regard such 'managed trade' agreements as covert
protection.
Yet she is anxious not to be typecast as a believer in crude government
intervention. 'I was defending a particular form of managed trade in special
circumstances,' she says.
Ms Tyson is a senior member of President-elect Bill Clinton's economic
transition team and is likely to get an important economic post in the new
administration, probably in a revamped commerce department or the proposed
new Economic Security Council.
Over the next month her main task is to prepare policy options for Mr
Clinton in high-technology and manufacturing industry. In other words, she
will be mulling the options for a more aggressive US industrial policy.
'Cautious activist' is Ms Tyson's self description. It is a phrase that
accurately describes most of Mr Clinton's advisers, including his economic
czar, Mr Robert Reich of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Mr Reich -
who has hinted he wishes to return to Harvard after the transition - has
argued for a bigger government role, especially in education, training and
infrastructure.
Mr Lawrence Summers, chief economist at the World Bank and another leading
economic transition team member, is a cautious activist too. He has long
supported tax incentives to spur industrial investment and at the World Bank
has directed a project analysing east Asian industrial development, which
stressed the role of government more than has been fashionable in the US.
However, main economic innovations in the Clinton administration are likely
to occur in industrial and technology policy - Ms Tyson's field.
She sets out her thinking at length in a new book, Who's Bashing Whom: Trade
Conflict in High-Technology Industries, published last week by the
Washington-based Institute for International Economics. This focuses on
trade conflicts in areas such as semiconductors and commercial aircraft as a
platform for articulating a new activist agenda.
The message is that the US must react domestically to competitors' policies:
'Flawed domestic choices, not unfair trade practices, are the main cause of
the nation's long run economic slowdown,' she writes. Trade policies 'cannot
compensate for domestic programmes that remain fiscally and intellectually
impoverished'.
As part of a strategic response to the end of the cold war, she wants the US
to 'develop an institutional capability for assessing competitive and
technological trends in high-technology industries and begin to shift its
R&amp;D (research and development) moneys from military to civilian programmes'.
Such an agency, possibly within the Commerce Department, could provide
'industry-specific information' to formulate domestic strategies for winning
back market share. To improve US competitiveness she favours more generous
tax incentives for corporate R&amp;D, heavy federal investment in civilian R&amp;D
and targeted subsidies for strategic industries, such as semiconductors and
supercomputers.
She says the wisest response to subsidies abroad is often to introduce
subsidies at home. The scope for action is large: US industrial subsidies
are worth only 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with 1 per
cent in Japan and 3 per cent in Europe.
On trade, she believes the US should continue to promote a multilateral
rule-based system. But the rules should be modified to permit domestic
subsidies. She believes the European Community was justified in subsidising
Airbus.
What Ms Tyson regards as cautious activism, however, may be seen abroad as
threatening behaviour. If her thinking proves a good guide to the Clinton
administration's approach, other countries will have to come to terms with a
US which pursues its own interests far more nakedly than in the past.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Georgia vote lifts Republican spirits: Democratic incumbent
loses run-off for Senate seat despite Clinton support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Democratic party's majority in the US Senate will not be increased
following the defeat of Senator Wyche Fowler in a run-off election in the
state of Georgia on Tuesday.
Mr Paul Coverdell, the Republican candidate and director of the Peace Corps
under President George Bush, apparently beat Mr Fowler by about 15,000 votes
in a poll of 1.25m, less than half the turnout recorded on November 3. Mr
Fowler did not formally concede defeat, pending a count of absentee votes,
but admitted it looked as if Georgia would be getting a new senator.
The Coverdell victory gives the Republicans 43 seats, the same number as in
the old Senate. The Democratic total is expected to remain at 57 assuming
that in North Dakota Mr Kent Conrad wins another special election next week.
Mr Conrad is already a senator from the state. He declined to seek a second
term because of congressional inability to reduce the budget deficit, but
changed his mind when another seat came up.
Mr Fowler narrowly won on November 3, beating Mr Coverdell by 49-48 per
cent. But Georgia state law, unique in the US, requires a run-off if no
candidate wins at least 50 per cent, a total denied both men by the 3 per
cent scored by the Libertarian party candidate, who was excluded from
Tuesday's election.
President-elect Bill Clinton had campaigned in person for Mr Fowler on
Monday, but Mr James Carville, his political strategist, rejected
suggestions yesterday that he had sacrificed prestige by becoming involved.
Mr Clinton carried Georgia in the November presidential election, an
important breakthrough in the south even though his victory was by a slender
margin.
Mr Coverdell becomes only the second Republican senator from Georgia since
the reconstruction era after the Civil War. The first, Mr Mack Mattingly,
was defeated in 1986 by Mr Fowler, previously a congressman. Mr Coverdell
consistently attacked Mr Fowler for being an inside member of the Washington
establishment
His victory is also the first piece of good news for the national Republican
party since the presidential election. The party has been consumed by
painful post-mortems of why it lost the White House and achieved only small
gains in the House of Representatives.

ILLINOIS Governor Jim Edgar has outlined a plan to locate a third
international airport in the Chicago area near rural Peotone, disregarding
criticism that it would be too far away and would not draw airlines or
passengers, AP reports from Chicago.
The Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.2bn) plan includes proposals to build an
additional runway to relieve congestion at Chicago's O'Hare International
Airport and create a Dollars 423m high-speed rail system linking down-town
Chicago to the proposed new airport about 35 miles away.
The airport would create 102,000 construction jobs and 167,000 permanent
jobs by 2020, Mr Edgar said.
The Illinois Senate turned down an earlier proposal for a Dollars 10.8bn
airport, for which Chicago Mayor Richard Daley fought for three years.

<TEXT>
HAITI'S military-backed administration has said it will hold Senate
elections next month, amid signs of mounting anti-government sentiment,
writes Canute James.
The vote, for nine of the 27 Senate seats, is seen as an attempt to
legitimise the administration, following a coup by the army 14 months ago.
The announcement by Mr Marc Bazin, the army-appointed prime minister,
coincided with several blasts in Port-au-Prince, the capital of the
Caribbean republic.
The military is continuing attempts to suppress public displays of support
for Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who lost the presidency in the coup and who
is now in exile. No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing, in
which one person was killed.
Meanwhile, Gen Prosper Avril, a former military ruler, was held by the army
after returning from exile.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Communist old guard turns the tables on Moslems in
Tajikistan: A setback for Islamic militants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOSLEM LEADERS in troubled Tajikistan, the only former Soviet nation where
Islam had become a key political force, appear to have lost most of their
power during the last week in a stunning reversal engineered by
ex-communists.
The political shift comes just 10 weeks after Islamic fighters expelled
ex-communist President Rakhmon Nabiyev, becoming major partners in a
coalition government. The central Asian nation of 5m people will once more
be dominated by the old Soviet hierarchy of politicians and industrialists
staunchly opposed to the Islamic militants.
They will call the shots behind the nominal leadership of the newly elected
parliamentary speaker, Mr Imamali Rakhmanov, who until recently ran a state
collective farm.
'Whatever they do, they're finished,' a senior diplomat said of the
Islamists. 'This is the old guard coming back.'
Analysts have watched central Asia, Algeria and Tunisia as laboratories for
the world's new strain of Islam that, unlike the violent movements of the
1970s and 1980s, aims to gain power through popular means.
In the five ex-Soviet central Asian nations, only Tajikistan has experienced
a rise of political Islam.
The new government could eventually help stabilise Tajikistan if it reduces
the fighting that divided the republic into what amounts to independent
cantons. The counter coup reinforces the growing power of irregular military
commanders who, propping up the opposing political forces, are largely
responsible for the ex-communists' triumph.
The capital Dushanbe has been in turmoil for most of this year as the rivals
tussled for power, while across the south-eastern republic dozens of private
armies, some with largely criminal rather than political motivations, have
clashed repeatedly.
In recent weeks, militias loyal to the ex-communists have routed the Islamic
forces, and now lay siege to Dushanbe where Islamic fighters are holed up.
The strongest of the ex-communist commanders is Mr Sangak Safarov, who spent
23 years in prison for murder. Now Mr Safarov is a power behind the throne.
Only after Mr Safarov and allied militias won a string of triumphs did
Tajikistan's weakened parliament, dominated by the old guard, reassert
itself. The parliament met for a special session in the northern city of
Khojand, home of Tajikistan's former Soviet hierarchy. Last week the
parliament elected Mr Rakhmonov as its speaker - effective head of state as
there is no president. It has agreed to meet again today.
Mr Rakhmonov succeeds Mr Akhbarshah Iskandarov, who led a coalition
government propped up by its Islamic and democratic partners. Until last
month, Mr Rakhmonov administered a state farm near Kulyab, the anti-Islamic
regional stronghold. Then, with the backing of the militia leader, Mr
Safarov, was named governor of Kulyab.
The pro-old guard prime minister, Mr Abdumalik Abdullajanov, is more
experienced than Mr Rakhmonov and an influential power broker. Enjoying
considerable influence in the north, which produces two thirds of
Tajikistan's industrial output, he could become an important figure.
Having forced out Mr Iskandarov, the old guard is still in Khojand deciding
how and when to return to Dushanbe. The little changed ex-communists know
that when Mr Rakhmonov enters the capital he may provoke fresh fighting as
defending forces make a final stand.
Even with a more stable situation, the new government faces enormous
problems.
The winter will be difficult, as six months of fighting has prevented
farmers harvesting crops in the southern regions of Kulyab and Kurgan-Tybe.
More than 100,000 refugees from the fighting have swollen Dushanbe, under
blockade for two months.
Until now Tajikistan's paramount Islamic leader, Qazi Akhbar Toradzhon Zoda,
was perhaps its most important political force. The republic's competing
political factions were said to consider him a rational moderate capable of
solving differences between political rivals. Mr Zoda's well-armed military
force put muscle behind his words.
A twin political force was the Islamic Renaissance party. The IRP, including
a wing demanding an Islamic government in Tajikistan, was often at odds with
Mr Zoda politically. But its equally effective army, partly supplied and
trained by Afghan rebel leader, Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, fought alongside Mr
Zoda's fighters.
While Mr Zoda's influence will be eroded, a new Islamic leader has risen in
importance. Mr Haidar Sharifov, chief mullah in the Kulyab region, is the
strongest Islamic force in the new power circle.

THE MONTREAL Protocol to protect the atmosphere's ozone layer, one of the
most successful worldwide international environmental treaties, was
yesterday tightened for the second time in its five-year life. The 93
signatories voted to bring forward the phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs), the chemicals most damaging to the ozone layer, by four years to
1996.
Dr Mustapha Tolba, executive director of the UN environment programme and
architect of the new agreement, called depletion of the layer 'an unfair
action to future generations. We have done the damage; we have to undo it.'
Scientists have feared that the thinning of the layer, partly caused by
man-made chemicals containing chlorine and bromine, could lead to more skin
cancer and lower crop yields. Dr Rumen Bojkov, head of ozone research at the
World Meteorological Organisation, said the agreement would bring forward
the date by when the layer had recovered to normal levels, and the 'hole'
over the Antarctic had disappeared, by 10-15 years to the middle of the next
century.
The 'make-or-break issue' was the pledge by industrialised countries of an
extra Dollars 500m (Pounds 331m) to a fund to help developing countries
adapt in 1994-96, on top of Dollars 240m already committed. In return,
developing countries agreed to bring methyl bromide, a substance used for
preserving fruit and grain, under the protocol for the first time, and to
freeze production at 1991 levels by 1995. The new agreement also stipulates
industrialised countries will phase out:
Halons, used in firefighting, by January 1994 instead of January 2000;
Trichloroethane, used in cleaning metals, by January 1996 instead of January
2000;
HCFCs, a less damaging substitute for CFCs, by 2030;
Carbon tetrachloride, a rarely-used solvent, by January 1996 instead of
January 2000;
Even with implementation of yesterday's agreement, ozone depletion will
worsen because of chlorine already in the atmosphere, Dr Bojkov said. The
worst years are likely to be 1995-2005 when depletion of the ozone layer
over inhabited regions of the northern hemisphere could reach a yearly 15
per cent average.
The Copenhagen agreements fell short of some countries' demands, including
the US and UK, and next year's meeting, probably in Nairobi, will face a
testing agenda. Phasing out methyl bromide is posing problems because it is
damaging to the ozone layer and few substitutes are available. Signatories
will want to see if effective use of the fund to help developing countries
adapt has increased. The fund has been criticised for its failure to move
forward any ozone-saving projects.
UN scientists also say more research is needed into how much ozone depletion
is due to man-made chemicals and how much to natural causes.

AUSTRALIA'S Labor government could face a difficult by-election before next
year's general election following a High Court ruling yesterday which ejects
an independent MP from parliament, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney.
Mr Phil Cleary won the Melbourne seat of Wills in April in a by-election
dominated by his attacks on the liberal economic policies of both the
government and the conservative opposition. The defeat was doubly
embarrassing for the government because the seat was held until March by Mr
Bob Hawke, former prime minister.
Mr Cleary, a Melbourne teacher, lost his seat after the court ruled that he
was a paid public official at the time of the election, even though he was
on unpaid leave throughout the campaign.
Mr Cleary could be required to repay his parliamentary salary, and could be
fined ADollars 200 (Pounds 91) for each day he sat in parliament if an
elector pursued the issue in court.
Ironically, the court ruled that the Labor and conservative candidates were
also ineligible because both were dual citizens who had taken insufficient
steps to renounce their foreign citizenship.

FT  26 NOV 92 / S Africa investment up - but so are the outflows:
Disinvestment and investments abroad amount to more than double inward flows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S business leaders seldom waste an opportunity to lecture the
politicians that without political stability there will be no foreign
investment in the country.
Recent evidence suggests they are at least half right. A study* by the
London School of Economics shows that while South Africa has enjoyed a
renewal of foreign direct investment since President F W de Klerk embarked
on reforms in late 1989, it has been less than half as much as
disinvestments and investments abroad by South African companies in the same
period.
Indeed, the impact of this investment outflow is probably the main reason
behind the recent weakening in the financial rand, the investment currency
for foreigners investing in South Africa, and South Africans investing
abroad. Yesterday the currency closed at R5.00/Dollars 1 - a 40 per cent
discount to the commercial rand rate of exchange of R3.00/Dollars 1. The
discount, which is a barometer of investor confidence in the country, was
only 13.5 per cent at the end of 1991.
The recent trend to invest abroad is being investigated by Mr Derek Keys,
minister of finance and trade and industry, and it is possible changes in
exchange control regulations may follow.
Another recent study, by the Washington-based Investor Responsibility
Research Centre (IRRC), concludes, however, that the trend of disinvestment
has been reversed over the past year.
The IRRC report on International Business in South Africa, notes that 508
non-US companies have direct investment or employees in South Africa, up
from 454 a year ago. US companies have returned in smaller numbers,
increasing to 111 from 106 a year ago. There has also been a considerable
upsurge in foreign companies having non-equity links (such as licensing or
distribution arrangements) in South Africa.
A longer term perspective on capital outflows from South Africa was recently
offered by Mr Michael Marks, chief executive of brokers Smith New Court. He
noted that since 1959 capital inflows have totalled R100bn, in 1990 values.
During this period, disinvestment has taken R84bn back out. He speculates
that without spells of heightened political tension, South Africa could have
expected capital inflows to have continued, as they did between 1946 and
1959 and between 1965 and 1976. He calculates that this might have added
another R104bn, in 1990 terms.
It has often been pointed out that South Africa is not so much short of
funds to invest, but of attractive investment opportunities. Continued
current account surpluses, and large sums raised on the stock exchange,
testify to the former. Reserve Bank figures, showing that real investment by
the private sector shrunk by 9.5 per cent from the end of 1989 to mid-1992,
are evidence of the latter.
It is hardly surprising that foreigners are also holding back. Business
confidence - reported recently by the Bureau of Economic Research to be at
its lowest level since ex-President P W Botha's disastrous Rubicon speech in
August 1985 - is clearly the key factor, with political uncertainty one of
the main contributors. But there are also important economic realities which
are a disincentive to investment for domestic and foreign businesses alike.
Mr Ted Osborne, group economist at the Nedcor group, listed them earlier
this year as including such factors as 'high tax rates, high wage rates in
relation to skill and productivity levels, shortages of skill, a less than
demonic work ethic, highly politicised trade unions, and high inflation'. He
also mentioned the limited size of the South African market and its growing
exposure to international competition as tariff walls are lowered.
These factors, together with a logical desire to spread risk and access new
markets, explain the recent upsurge in investments abroad by South African
companies. These include large investments by the country's two forest
products groups, Sappi and Mondi, acquisitions by First National Bank and
the Standard Bank group and the proposed takeover of Del Monte Foods
International by the Royal Group and Anglo American.
Large disinvestments this year appear to have been more a function of
internal strategic issues within the companies concerned than any particular
view of the South African economy.
At the same there has been a steady flow of mostly smaller inward investment
flows. The LSE study (which does not pretend to be exhaustive, especially of
smaller projects) identifies a total of 51 new investments made in South
Africa since late 1989. The 20, to which an exact size could be put had a
cumulative value of just more than Dollars 700m. The authors say they
believe it unlikely that the total new inflow to South Africa as a result of
these new investments will exceed Dollars 1.5bn.
Although economists caution against trying to establish a relationship
between capital inflows and economic growth, figures from the Central
Economic Advisory Service, a government economic research body, suggest that
if the country is to achieve an average GDP growth rate of 3.5 a year
between now and the end of the century - the minimum necessary to absorb new
entrants to the labour market - then an annual capital inflow of 1.5-2 per
cent of GDP (R4.5bn-R6bn in 1991 terms) is necessary.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Thai premier defends shares crackdown
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THAILAND'S prime minister, Mr Chuan Leekpai, yesterday defended his
government's crackdown on share speculators, saying the move was aimed at
raising standards on the volatile Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). 'We
realised it would have some negative effects,' Mr Chuan told the Financial
Times. 'But taking a long-term view, we believed it would raise the stock
market to international standards.'
The SET index has plunged since charges were filed against Mr Song
Watcharasriroj and 11 associates for allegedly manipulating the price of
shares in Bangkok Bank of Commerce, the country's ninth largest bank.
Yesterday, the index fell 12.10 points to 847.33, down 12 per cent from its
year's high of 963.03 three weeks ago. Foreign stockbrokers, pointing to
strong corporate profits and annual economic growth of 7-8 per cent, have
urged clients to buy while prices are low.
The market has been depressed because the government has told stockbrokers
to curb the credit they extend to clients to buy shares, and because Thais
fear further cases will be brought against speculators by the six-month-old
Securities and Exchange Commission.
'We discussed this matter for about three weeks before it erupted,' said Mr
Chuan. We had to conclude this was the best way out because the law did not
give us any other option.
'We realise that investors still behave like gamblers. They are not
interested in dividends. They probably don't know what businesses the
companies are involved in, or what dividends are paid. It's only day-to-day
trading.' Unlike Mr Anand Panyarachun, his predecessor as premier, Mr Chuan
is not a Bangkok businessman. He says he has no shares of his own.
Mr Chuan, 54, came to power at the head of an elected five-party coalition
after the pro-democracy uprising in May in which 50 people were killed. He
promised to stress rural development more than previous governments, but
within weeks, is being accused by his opponents of being indecisive.
'Coalitions will always have these problems,' he said. 'I've been in many
coalitions, so I'm prepared to face the obstacles. I believe we'll be able
to maintain the coalition so it follows the principles of the parties which
got together to draft (our) common policy statement. It may be slow, but I
think we can continue this way.'

MORE than 50 French police were injured yesterday in clashes with
demonstrators as French farmers massed in Paris to protest at the European
Community trade agreement with the US.
CRS riot police fired tear gas and made repeated charges at militant farmers
who in turn let off fireworks and threw iron bars and crowd-control
barriers. Five police were taken to hospital and 12 protesters were
arrested. By last night the crowd was dispersing.
Earlier about 3,000 farmers had converged on the Esplanade des Invalides and
the nearby National Assembly as parliament debated whether to reject the
accord. Workers at the National Assembly peered nervously out of windows
behind the safety of police barriers.
Trading was interrupted on the Paris Stock Exchange when farmers broke in,
unfurling banners and setting off firecrackers.
Coachloads of farmers from all over France poured into the Invalides
throughout the afternoon. They chanted anti-American slogans and carried
banners emblazoned with 'Tomorrow, US food, Japanese cars, Asian textiles
and French job losses' and 'No to the US green army'.
An elderly farmer stared forlornly at the scarred shields of the riot
police. 'Whatever happens, French farming is finished,' he said. 'It's not a
question of whether we'll be ruined, but of when. That's why we can't give
up without a fight.'
There were other demonstrations elsewhere in France. Farmers in
Clermont-Ferrand burnt piles of tyres outside the local McDonald's fast-food
store in protest against the US-owned group and the British flag was burnt
in Boulogne and Calais.
Farmers blockaded the home of Mr Andre Bourgeois, Belgium's agriculture
minister, late yesterday and set tyres alight in the street in protest at
the trade deal, Reuter reports from Brussels, quoting a local news agency.
Paramilitary police moved the 200 farmers and their 50 tractors.

AN Israeli company has signed a Dollars 160m agreement with Kazakhstan's
government to make and install irrigation equipment in the republic's
southern Chimkent province, writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem.
The Eisenberg Group announced the deal this week during a visit by a trade
delegation from Kazakhstan. It is the biggest contract won yet by Israeli
companies working to establish ties with the Moslem former Soviet republics.
Under the agreement, Eisenberg will build a plant to produce drip irrigation
piping and will install systems covering 50,000 acres of cotton, cereals,
fruit and other crops. Payment will mostly be in locally produced
commodities, it is understood.
The remoteness of the central Asian states and their lack of hard currency
have not deterred several Israeli companies from seeking to establish trade
ties. They are backed by the government, which sees long-term advantages in
forging links to non-Arab Moslem countries with large natural resources on
the northern fringe of the Middle East.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INSIDE a National Assembly virtually surrounded by protesting farmers,
France's political parties yesterday sought to outdo each other in opposing
the European Commission's draft Gatt accord with the US on agricultural
trade.
Opposition complaints that Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, was
seeking to turn the anti-Gatt consensus into a vote of confidence in his
weak Socialist government obscured the fact that the only real point
dividing the two sides was whether a French veto of the deal should be
threatened now or later.
Mr Beregovoy's declaration, which was approved last night with Communist
support, committed the government 'to veto any draft agreement contrary to
France's fundamental interests'.
The prime minister had been anxious to leave himself, and President Francois
Mitterrand, who had wisely left town for a Middle East trip, some
flexibility in the possible use of a veto which would provoke a crisis in
the European Community. But, pushed by the opposition, he pledged that
France would use its veto at any stage once it was presented with a legal
text enshrining the draft Gatt deal.
Mr Alain Juppe, secretary-general of the RPR Gaullists, fearful of a hot
political potato landing in the lap of a right-wing government after next
March's elections, had urged that the government immediately inform its EC
partners that it could not accept the deal and insist talks with the US were
re-opened.
Even while supporting his own party in power, Mr Laurent Fabius, the
Socialist party leader, said: 'There are moments when one has to say No (to
the Gatt deal), and this is one of them.'
Yesterday's debate may yet prove to be the point of maximum French political
fury, with protesting farmers outside putting pressure on politicians who
only learnt during the session that Brussels considered the Gatt deal
compatible with reform of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy.
The main feature of the debate was an anti-Americanism, which was
predictably most virulent from Mr Andre Lajoinie, leader of the Communist
deputies. He denounced 'the American attack on world trade'. Far from
winning reciprocal US concessions in non-farm aspects of the Gatt
negotiations, EC agricultural concessions would only 'reinforce American
arrogance'.
The only reason why the Communists backed the government was that they are
the party with most to fear from a premature election. But most other party
leaders joined in the denunciation of the US, which Mr Juppe accused of
wanting to 'dominate the world food market'.
Other targets were Britain and New Zealand. Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, leader of
the centrist UDC coalition, took a side-swipe at Mr John Gummer, UK
agriculture minister, whom he said should be 'sanctioned for his scandalous
behaviour' in forcing the Gatt deal through as a member of the current
British presidency of the EC. He added that if the New Zealand prime
minister could hail the Gatt accord as 'exceptionally good', it must be
'exceptionally bad for France'.
The left, in the persons of Mr Fabius and Mr Lajoinie, hit back at the
right, but hardly in terms that would provide comfort for proponents of free
farm trade. Both men denounced past conservative French governments for
acquiescing, in 1962, in duty-free entry for US animal feeds into the EC,
while Mr Lajoinie said it had been a mistake to have let the UK and its
former colonies dilute Community preference when Britain joined the EC in
the early 1970s.
From the opposition and government alike came a common plea for France's EC
partners to show the sort of solidarity that France had shown to Britain
over that country's EC budget rebate and to Germany over its unification.

<TEXT>
THE European Commission last night agreed that the EC-US compromise on farm
subsidies in the Gatt world trade talks was compatible with reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), writes Lionel Barber in Brussels.
After reviewing a document produced by Mr Ray MacSharry, the Irish
commissioner for agriculture who secured the breakthrough in last week's
trade talks, the Commission approved without a vote the EC negotiating
position.
A 10-page paper is to be distributed to member states today which is also
expected to set out the concessions made by the US in sectors such as
services in the Gatt talks. EC concessions on agriculture will also be
outlined.
Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president who clashed with Mr
MacSharry in the run-up to last week's breakthrough, did not voice
opposition to the EC-US deal yesterday. Instead, he rallied commissioners
behind the MacSharry paper on the grounds that it was the best result
attainable. 'There was a grudging consensus,' said one senior EC official.
France has pushed strongly for the Commission to show that the EC's new
international obligations on farm subsidies are incompatible with this
year's CAP reform.
Some officials in Brussels say publication of the detailed concessions on
agriculture could upset negotiations to be conducted in Geneva, which are
needed to wrap up a comprehensive Gatt deal.

THE European Community is likely to lift the threat of import duties on
Austrian-made Chrysler vans, following a compromise between Vienna and the
European Commission on reducing state aid to the US manufacturer.
Austria has agreed to cut the level of aid to Chrysler's plant in Graz from
33.3 per cent to 14.4 per cent of the investment. The Commission yesterday
approved the compromise which will now be put to EC member states.
Austrian officials said Chrysler would not have to repay any of the aid, but
a final tranche will be paid only if the company goes ahead with the final
phase of construction.
The imposition of duties would have unleashed a diplomatic storm between the
EC and Austria, which has applied to join the Community. Chrysler had also
threatened legal action against the Community.
Brussels had wanted aid to the Sch5.6bn (Pounds 328m) plant to be brought
down to 8 per cent, in line with rules on state aid for carmakers in the
wealthiest Community countries.
Its demands were made under the 1972 free trade agreement with Austria,
which outlaws subsidies which distort competition in the EC.

<TEXT>
SENIOR trade negotiators will today formally endorse a negotiating timetable
designed to conclude the Uruguay Round of global trade talks early next
year.
The meeting of the trade negotiations committee (TNC), the overseeing body
for the 108-nation Round conducted under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (Gatt), follows the deal struck last week by the US and EC on farm
subsidies. The agreement broke a logjam which has stalled talks since last
December.
Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general and TNC chairman, will propose
finalising the Uruguay Round package of rules by Christmas and completing
bilateral negotiations on market access for goods and services by February,
at the latest.
This is to beat the March 1 deadline for the US administration's
'fast-track' negotiating authority, which prevents Congress tinkering with
the final trade liberalising accord.
Diplomats yesterday cautioned against over-optimism, pointing out that
several important and politically sensitive issues were unresolved. The
Round, launched in 1986, spans 15 broad trade areas and extends fair trade
rules for the first time to agriculture, textiles, services and intellectual
property protection.
Mr Dunkel's first task will be to see if countries are willing to modify the
draft 'final act' presented to negotiators last December to incorporate the
US-EC farm trade accord. Beyond this he will emphasise that those wanting
changes to the draft must show evidence of a consensus in their favour.
It remains to be seen to what lengths Japan and South Korea are prepared to
go to press objections to opening their rice markets. Many countries,
including the US and EC, also have reservations about aspects of the draft
but may not insist on changes if others show the same restraint.
The bilateral negotiations - an integral part of the package - could also
fail if countries are not able to make the necessary political decisions to
reduce protection across the spectrum of goods and services.
Gatt officials have recently visited 32 developing countries to help them
prepare services liberalisation offers, without which they cannot become
signatories to the proposed services accord nor to the Multilateral Trade
Organisation, which will incorporate it, and Gatt.

FT  26 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Central Europe is plugged in to power
trade - The linking of Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland to west's
electricity grid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW possibilities for trade in electric power have been opened up by an
agreement signed recently to link Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland with
the west European electricity grid.
The three central-east European (CE3) countries committed themselves at a
meeting in Prague to higher standards of power transmission in exchange for
admission to the west European electricity club by 1998.
The CE3 will withdraw from the east European system, set up a central
European electricity 'island' insulated from the weak and fluctuating supply
from power stations further east and prepare to integrate with western
Europe.
Turning toward the west will cost about Dollars 500m, according to Mr Walter
Fremuth, vice-president of the Union for the Co-ordination of Production and
Transmission of Electricity, the western electricity grouping, which
announced the Prague accord. Mr Fremuth, who also heads Osterreichische
Elektrizitatswirtschaftsverbund, Austria's electricity utility, will host a
meeting in Vienna soon to flesh out a financing programme.
The CE3 countries will need to smooth out fluctuations in their own current
frequency before they can be fully integrated. Western utilities expect that
it will be 1998 before they can be connected without causing fluctuations as
far away as Paris or Lisbon.
But western electricity utilities are not waiting until 1998 to bring the
CE3 into their camp. Germany and Austria are already building special
convertor stations to smooth frequencies and facilitate transfers.
Austria recently commissioned a Sch1bn (Pounds 58m) convertor at Vienna
Southeast connected by a high-voltage power line to Gyor in Hungary. That
complements Austria's existing facility at Durnrohr near the Czechoslovak
border. Another plant for connecting Czechoslovakia is undergoing trials at
Etzenricht in Germany.
Conversion equipment could be moved eastwards along with the border of the
west European grid when the CE3 join, according to Mr Fremuth. That would
allow central-eastern Europe countries to retain electricity links with
Soviet successor states even as they abandoned their common system.
The CE3 at first pushed for integration of their electricity distribution
systems with western Europe to increase their diversity of supply and reduce
dependence on erratic deliveries from the former Soviet republics.
That motivation, which has dimmed a little as falling industrial production
has reduced electricity consumption, will strengthen again when the region's
economy rebounds.
The option of taking supplies from western Europe, even if never exercised,
improves their bargaining position with Russia. 'Maybe the connection will
never be used,' says Mr Tamas Jaszay, a senior energy official at the
Hungarian industry ministry. 'But it makes it easier to push down the price
in negotiations.'
In the meantime the convertor stations will allow the CE3 utilities to
export their temporary electricity surpluses to the west to earn hard
currency.
For their part, west European utilities foresee a need for electricity
imports from their eastern counterparts because public environmental
concerns are restricting their ability to expand capacity to keep up with
demand. Austria, for one, became a net importer for the first time in 1991
because the public opposed new hydro and nuclear power stations.

FT  26 NOV 92 / ERM turmoil hastens day of a two-speed Europe: Some European
officials expect to see a fixed exchange rate D-Mark bloc
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recent turmoil in the European exchange rate mechanism has hastened the
advent of a two- or multi-speed Europe, according to monetary officials in
several continental European countries.
The officials, of the 'core' countries of the European Monetary System, are
quietly optimistic that currencies grouped around the D-Mark will be able to
form a bloc in which parities stay virtually unchanged once the turbulence
on currency markets dies down.
But despite last weekend's devaluations of the Spanish peseta and Portuguese
escudo, there is much less confidence that the Iberian currencies or the
British pound and the Italian lira, which at present are floating outside
the ERM, will be able to maintain stable relationships with the other EMS
currencies.
In a number of conversations since the weekend realignment, the officials,
who declined to be identified, said that they did not believe that the
recent upheavals in the ERM meant the end of the system.
However, most accepted that the dislocation of the ERM in the successive
waves of speculation since early September had made the achievement of
economic and monetary union in line with the Maastricht Treaty less certain
and at least subject to delay.
But unlike London-based analysts who have forecast the collapse of the ERM,
the continental monetary officials are looking ahead to a period in which
economic fundamentals, such as inflation and trade performance and
international competitiveness, will play a bigger part than in the past in
determining currency relationships in Europe. As a result, Germany, France,
the Benelux countries, and possibly Ireland and Denmark, will effectively be
able to form a fixed exchange rate bloc. Austria, which links its currency
to the D-Mark, would also be a member of this group.
There are still battles to be won, notably convincing financial markets that
the Danish krone and Irish punt are not candidates for devaluation. The
scale of speculation in such small currencies can be spectacular. In three
hours last Friday, for example, the Belgian National Bank had to buy Dollars
1bn worth of Irish punts.
But trading in the Danish and Irish currencies, as well as the French franc,
was calmer yesterday. This prompted hopes that the speculators may have been
deterred by the resolute action taken in all three countries to raise
interest rates since Monday.
While officials generally expect the inner group of ERM countries to emerge
as a recognisable and cohesive group of countries, there are differences
about the implications of such a development for Emu.
French monetary officials believe that the recent crisis in the ERM has
underlined the need for monetary union among those countries with convergent
economic conditions. 'There would have been no crisis between the French
franc and the D-Mark if they were a single currency,' observed one official
in Paris. 'So long as there is real convergence, it should be a case of the
quicker the better in turning the EMS into a single currency system.'
Germany, however, is far more cautious. Earlier this month, Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice president, warned against too rapid a move to
Emu. He told an audience in southern Germany that the premature creation of
a single European currency and central bank could be threatened by tensions
in pay developments and fiscal policy.
Fears about sharply rising German wages have been expressed by Mr Alfons
Verplaetse, the Belgian National Bank governor. In an interview with the
German newspaper Handelsblatt, he said he regretted that the Maastricht
convergence criteria made no reference to income trends and advocated an
incomes policy for Germany.
Indeed, while monetary officials in the EMS core countries are looking to a
future in which their currencies stay closely linked to the D-Mark, there is
strong underlying concern about economic developments in Germany.
High labour costs and relatively high inflation compared with countries such
as France, Denmark and Ireland, have caused Germany to lose competitiveness.
The cost of subsidising the new eastern Lander and Germany's continuing high
budget deficits have caused some officials to wonder whether the German
economy will be able to fulfil the Maastricht convergence criteria by the
end of 1996, when the EC is due to assess whether a majority of its member
states is willing and able to embark on Emu.
The consensus among senior officials is that Germany will be able to
overcome its difficulties. But one noted that the D-Mark really should
devalue against the French franc and other ERM currencies because of
Germany's declining competitiveness.

West German industry is planning more production cuts after a further fall

yesterday, writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt. Business conditions again
worsened and manufacturers had become even more pessimistic, a monthly
survey said.
A modest reduction in west German inflation from 3.7 per cent in October is
widely expected to be followed by further rises.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Kohl rejects 'poison' of tax increases to help the east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday again rejected opposition calls for
immediate tax rises to help rebuild eastern Germany and reduce the budget
deficit, but promised a decision early next year on a tax increase from
January 1, 1995.
Departing from his prepared text in a speech to parliament, Mr Kohl said:
'In this phase of recession it would be poison to introduce new tax
burdens.'
His statement came amid new indications that both government and opposition
are keen to agree on a 'solidarity pact' to stop the collapse of the east
German economy.
Mr Kohl spelt out a little more of his ideas about such a pact, insisting on
the one hand that he had no intention of 'bashing the trade unions' in the
negotiations for wage restraint, and that he expected German industry to
contribute 'billions of D-Marks to retraining and youth programmes in the
new Lander' as their side of the bargain.
Leaders of the opposition Social Democrats repeated their desire to reach
agreement on a deal, which would include a more directly interventionist
industrial policy, to save key sectors of east German industry, wage
restraint on the part of the unions, and some agreement on future financing.
It is the last element, on how to reduce the budget deficit and the future
debt burden, which still appears to be the most difficult part of the
negotiations.
Mr Kohl said he had every intention of reaching an agreement on the pact by
Christmas, although he warned that simultaneous negotiations between the
central government and the 16 Lander on the future division of the financial
burden of subsidies to the east could delay a deal.
He said agreement had to be reached on the financial burden-sharing before
the size and shape of the 1995 tax rise could be fixed. The increase in
revenue was essential to pay for an estimated annual DM40bn (Pounds 16.5bn)
in debt servicing on all the accumulated debts of east Germany, including
the forecast DM250bn to be handed on by the Treuhand privatisation agency in
1995. All the debts should be brought together in a single fund for 'burdens
of the past', he said, and the tax rise dedicated solely to financing it.
Both the Social Democrat opposition, and many economists, have urged the
government to introduce earlier tax measures, both to raise finance and to
make burden-sharing in the west more equitable.

<TEXT>
TURKEY together with eight Balkan countries yesterday urged the United
Nations to consider the deployment of forces in the Serbian province of
Kosovo, where violence has raised fears that this ethnically Albanian region
could become the next flashpoint in the worsening Yugoslav conflict.
A joint declaration issued at the end of a one-day conference in Istanbul
agreed to set up a consultative body, in an effort to prevent the Yugoslav
crisis dragging in regional powers.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, on Tuesday agreed to
send 'a dozen military, political and civilian personnel on an exploratory
mission' to Macedonia, after which he will seek the Security Council's
authority for a larger force. The immediate mandate is to visit Macedonia's
border areas with Albania and Serbia.
Foreign ministers called for rapid deployment of UN observers on the border
of Bosnia-Hercegovina, and urged the UN Security Council to 'examine the
possibility of deploying forces in Kosovo, Vojvodina and Sandjak to contain
the 'explosive situation.'
Ankara believes it is now in a position to urge moderation at the December 2
meeting of the 47-member Organisation of Islamic Conference countries, which
has become impatient at the failure of the UN and EC to stem Serb attacks on
Bosnian Moslems. Turkey said it would seek Arab funds for a bigger UN
peacekeeping role.
Yesterday's statement also called for the setting up of 'militarily
protected safe areas in Bosnia Hercegovina.'
Kerin Hope adds from Athens: Greece has partially lifted its oil embargo on
Macedonia by permitting the shipment of 20,000 tonnes of crude to the former
Yugoslav republic in what the Greek government claimed was a humanitarian
gesture.
However, the timing of the oil shipment suggests that the Greek government
is mainly concerned with appeasing its EC partners, who are anxious to see
the embargo against Skopje lifted ahead of the Edinburgh summit.
Lord Owen, co-chairman of the peace conference on the former Yugoslavia,
said the EC must decide at the summit whether to recognise Macedonia as an
independent republic.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Ireland's poll promises a coalition conundrum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was brisk voting in Ireland's general election yesterday, but the
process of deciding on a new government will be anything but brisk.
The outcome of the poll will be known by tomorrow, but with no party
expected to win outright, and uncertainty over how voters will cast their
transfer votes under Ireland's single transferable vote system, it could be
weeks before a new coalition is settled.
The biggest uncertainty centres on the prospects for the Labour party.
In opinion polls, Labour has been running neck-and-neck with Fianna Fail in
Dublin, with more than 30 per cent each, while Labour has 22 per cent in the
country as a whole. Mr Dick Spring, the Labour leader, is preferred by 38
per cent as next prime minister, far ahead of any other party leader,
suggesting that many non-Labour voters will use their second and subsequent
preferences for the party.
Ireland has three- or five-member constituencies. In a three-seat
constituency, a candidate requires more than 25 per cent of the vote to
obtain a seat, while in a five-seat constituency 16.7 per cent of the vote
is required. Under the single transferable vote system, candidates who fail
to get the minimum number of votes to obtain a seat are successively
eliminated and have their votes transferred to other candidates according to
the voters' preference indicated on the ballot paper.
Estimates put Labour with at least 23 seats, well up from its present 16. If
there is a strong transfer vote to Labour, though, it could win more than 30
seats, putting Mr Spring in a very powerful position to determine the shape
of a coalition.
Fianna Fail is expected to lose five to seven seats, leaving it with around
70, while Fine Gael may also drop several seats to around 50. A total of 83
seats are needed to form a majority government.
Policy and personality clashes will make the piecing together of a coalition
very difficult. Fianna Fail and Fine Gael have ruled out a coalition
together. On policy issues Fianna Fail and Labour share the greatest common
ground, but Mr Spring has effectively ruled out such a coalition while Mr
Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, remains leader.
The so-called 'rainbow coalition' of Fine Gael, Labour and the Progressive
Democrats, proposed by Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, would face
serious strains over taxation and public spending.
Mr Spring has also said that he wants to share the leadership if he enters a
coalition with either Fianna Fail or Fine Gael, a demand ruled out by the
other party leaders.

FT  26 NOV 92 / EC plan links coal aid to output costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S coalmines will have to bring production costs in line with the EC
average or lose their right to state aid, according to a plan agreed by the
Commission yesterday.
But the Commission - under strong political pressure from German and Spanish
governments, and the coal industry itself - has amended its original
proposals to allow more flexibility in deciding whether inefficient pits can
continue to receive state aid.
The amendments to the plan, which would replace the existing state aid
regime for coal in January 1994, should slightly reduce the risk that
high-cost German and Spanish mines will be forced to close.
The Commission's original plan would have penalised pits which produced at
more than the 1992 average cost. The amended plan merely aims for
'convergence' between the high-cost Spanish and German pits and the more
competitive British mines. State aid for high-cost pits will be approved
only if the plans include restructuring proposals which will help the mines
lower their costs towards the EC average.
The proposals will still tighten the screw on inefficient mines in the eight
years before the abolition of the European coal and steel treaty in 2002,
and could face severe opposition when they are put to EC ministers. Member
states must approve the replacement plan unanimously.
Some EC pits produce coal at a cost of more than Ecu200 (Pounds 162) a
tonne, compared with an EC average of Ecu110 and a world price of Ecu40.
As if to underline the dependence of some national industries on state aid,
the Commission also approved yesterday subsidies of up to DM11.8bn (Pounds
4.8bn) for the German industry. However, Brussels also acknowledged the
parallel efforts being made in Germany to restructure the industry and make
the aid system more transparent.
The Commission is also calling for coal producers to detail state aid
received in their balance sheets after 1994.
Some commissioners had argued that it would not benefit the EC industry if
high-cost producers were driven out of business because there is little
competition between Community producers. Critics of the original plan said
that EC users would choose to buy much cheaper non-EC coal rather than
drawing on remaining EC supplies, however efficiently produced.
West European coal producers - like their counterparts in the EC steel
industry - have lobbied hard for the Commission to recognise the grave
situation in the industry. They want the EC to recognise 'the essential role
of coal, and notably of Community coal, in meeting the Community's energy
supply.
The Commission's statement says that Brussels will take decisions on coal
aid 'within the limits of its overall policy which takes into consideration
security of supply'.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Return of lira turns into game of chance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE return of turbulence in the currency markets has forced Italy to
reconsider the timing of its re-entry into the European exchange rate
mechanism.
Until this week, the Italian government consistently stated it was anxious
for the lira to rejoin the ERM as soon as possible. However, the devaluation
of the peseta and escudo, together with continued pressure on other EC
currencies, has brought home the advantages to Italy of sustaining the lira
in a free float.
The government of the prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, did not spell out a
timetable for re-entry when the lira was forced to leave on September 17
along with sterling. The public commitment to returning was a statement of
faith in the European Monetary System. It was also intended to convince the
markets that Italy would not allow a free floating lira to become an excuse
for relaxing fiscal policy or the fight against inflation.
Nevertheless, an unofficial timetable had been mapped out. This hinged on
parliament's approval of the 1993 budget, completion of negotiations with
the EC on an Ecu8bn (Pounds 6.5bn) stand-by loan, agreement with the
Bundesbank on repayment of the heavy obligations incurred during the
September defence of the lira, and a period of reasonable calm on the
foreign exchanges. On this basis officials were considering rejoining during
December or January at the latest.
The budget will be approved by early December and the Bundesbank is
reportedly willing to roll over if necessary the still unspecified sums lent
in defence of the lira which are due on December 16. But the stand-by loan
is now unlikely to be agreed before January.
Added to this, it suits Italy not to have to defend the lira, which this
week has weakened slightly against the D-Mark, hovering around L865.
Deciding the correct level for re-entry is complicated. The French for one
are concerned by the competitive edge acquired by the lira's 14-15 per cent
devaluation since September. But equally, if the lira were not permitted to
devalue on this scale on re-entry, the markets would put immediate pressure
on the Italian currency - once again forcing costly intervention, or a
second exit which would be even more damaging to the credibility of the
system.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WAR of nerves between Bosnian Serb leaders and the UN mounted yesterday
when Serb militiamen refused to allow food aid to reach the stranded Moslem
town of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia.
A relief convoy to another Moslem-held town, Gorazde, also under siege by
Serb forces, was forced to turn back when a French armoured personnel
carrier hit a mine.
At the same time, the UN interrupted its humanitarian flights into the
Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, after a French aircraft was hit by small arms
fire on approach to the airport.
A spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said it was
not thought the aircraft had been deliberately targeted. There were no
casualties.
More stringent security precautions have been introduced since an Italian
cargo aircraft was shot down by a missile over Bosnia in September.
The 20-lorry UNHCR relief convoy to Srebrenica, which has been cut off since
May, was blocked despite guarantees by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of
Bosnia's Serbs, that it would be allowed to cross Serb lines.
The incident followed a tougher stance by the UNHCR, which has said it will
cut off aid to Serb-held areas in eastern Bosnia until convoys are allowed
through to the two besieged towns, swollen with refugees. The UN has until
now tried to adopt an even-handed position on aid to the different Bosnian
regions.
Mr Laurens Jolles, the leader of the UNHCR convoy, held out little hope that
the convoy, escorted by three armoured personnel carriers, would reach
Srebrenica yesterday. He called the blockade the 'beginning of a crisis'.
Across the bridge in Ljubovija, most villagers were hostile towards western
journalists and the UN. Some spat angrily, saying the convoy would never
pass. 'You think the west can tell us what to do? Why should we allow the
enemy to be fed? They never should give aid to Moslems who will just attack
us again,' said one Serb.
A UN peacekeeper with the convoy said the protest was ordered from the top,
saying that it was part of the strategy to appear 'spontaneous.'
Serb women from the nearby town of Bratunac have blocked two previous
convoys attempting to reach Srebrenica.
However, Mr Jolles was adamant that he would continue efforts to get the aid
through. 'We will wait for days at the borders if need be to get to
Srebrenica,' he said.
At the same time, villagers in Ljubovija appeared ready to risk the severing
of aid in order to allow Serbs to keep control over eastern Bosnia.

FT  26 NOV 92 / France ready to veto farm deal: Parliamentary vote puts
Paris on collision course with EC partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, told his parliament last
night that Paris would use its veto 'at every stage' to block the draft farm
deal with the US, which it judges unacceptably damaging to French farmers.
This appeared to set France on a collision course with those of its European
Community partners which hope the long-sought transatlantic farm accord will
pave the way for a new world trade agreement.
Mr Beregovoy seemed to accept the inevitability of this, when he told
deputies that 'Europe has advanced through successive crises. If there has
to be a crisis over this, there will be a crisis'. Mr Beregovoy said he
would request an early meeting of EC foreign and agriculture ministers
formally to record France's opposition.
More than 50 French police were injured in clashes with riot police which
broke out after thousands of farmers demonstrated near the National
Assembly. Leaders of the French farm unions congratulated the government on
its 'firmness' in the trade negotiations.
The chief element in the farm deal between the US and EC which has drawn
French anger is the proposed 21 per cent cut in subsidised EC farm exports
over the next six years. Although France has expressed its opposition to the
deal throughout the recent negotiations, it appeared to have hardened its
position yesterday in the face of parliamentary and popular pressure.
A French veto could provoke a crisis with Paris's partners, particularly
Germany. Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday said he hoped France would accept
the deal but also asked for understanding of 'our French friends' problems'.
Paris won backing yesterday from the Belgian economy minister, Mr Melchior
Wathelet, who called the EC-US agreement 'unacceptable'. The Belgian
government, which is under pressure from its own farmers, is to decide its
position tomorrow.
Mr Beregovoy at first sought to give himself, and President Francois
Mitterrand, who left Paris yesterday for a Middle East trip, some leeway on
a possible French veto.
But after being pushed hard by opposition deputies in a debate marked by its
anti-Americanism, Mr Beregovoy said France would use 'its veto at all stages
of the procedure, from the moment that it is presented with a legal text'
enshrining the draft deal in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Beregovoy said the draft farm accord, which the European Commission last
night pronounced as compatible with the Community's own recent farm reforms,
had 'no legal significance'.
A confidence motion based on a text threatening a French veto was passed
late last night by 301 votes to 251, with the Communists backing the
Socialist gov-ernment.
The main centre-right opposition parties, which did not wish to appear to
endorse the government with parliamentary elections only four months away,
opposed the motion.
Mr Alain Juppe, secretary general of the RPR gaullists, complained that Mr
Beregovoy had refused to demand an immediate reopening of farm negotiations
with Washington.
The government was strongly criticised by the opposition for not extracting
from France's EC partners promises of solidarity in the Gatt negotiations
when it acquiesced in last May's reform of the EC's Common Agricultural
Policy.
In Brussels, the European Commission last night agreed that the EC-US
compromise on farm subsidies in the Gatt world trade talks was compatible
with reform of the CAP after reviewing a document produced by Mr Ray
MacSharry, the commissioner for agriculture.
Mr Jacques Delors, who clashed with Mr MacSharry, the EC's Gatt negotiator,
in the run-up to last week's breakthrough, rallied commissioners behind the
paper produced by Mr MacSharry.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Plan for Lloyd's 'success fees' is attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROPOSAL to pay 'success fees' which could be worth hundreds of thousands
of pounds to representatives fighting to recover losses on behalf of Lloyd's
Names was strongly criticised yesterday.
The 12-man committee of the Gooda Walker Action Group - which represents
some 2,000 loss-making Names - is proposing it should receive 1 1/2 per cent
of any legal settlement, less a contribution to legal costs.
With the group seeking to recover up to Pounds 500m, some past and present
members of the committee could earn over Pounds 300,000 a head if the action
is successful.
Mr Norbert Mallet, a Gooda Name, said yesterday: 'There is no way you can
justify sums of this kind. Frankly I think it's absolutely obscene.'
Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, the action group chairman, said the proposal would
be put to the group's annual general meeting on Monday. At present the
group's rules say committee members should be unpaid.
'If group members don't like it, they can vote against it,' said Mr
Doll-Steinberg, who is expected at the meeting to ask members to back legal
action against Lloyd's agents.
He said an 'incentive package' was needed because 'negotiations are a
nerve-wracking and all-consuming process. A skilled negotiator gives his all
to get the last item in a deal'.
The Association of Lloyd's Members said: 'We are aware of strong objections
being expressed by members.'
Mr Raymond Nottage, a deputy chairman, said 'action groups are important
businesses with a lot of money at stake. If you have able people, they need
remuneration'. He admitted that, if the group were successful in obtaining a
good settlement, the amounts that committee members might earn 'seemed
large'.
Over the past two years Lloyd's has recorded losses of over Pounds 2.5bn,
ruining several thousand Names, the individuals who provide capital for the
market.

FT  26 NOV 92 / US growth may alter Clinton's strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US PRESIDENT-elect Bill Clinton may change his plans for an immediate growth
package as a result of yesterday's revised growth figures, which show that
the US economy expanded by 3.9 per cent in the third quarter.
The revision upwards from 2.7 per cent, announced by the Commerce
Department, makes it the strongest quarter of Mr Bush's presidency. The
economy last reached this growth rate in the final three months of Mr Ronald
Reagan's administration.
Mr Clinton said the data would not alter his long-term plans for the
economy, but 'could have some impact on short-term judgment'.
'It could be that we are finally seeing the impact of lower interest rates,'
he said.
Mr Bush has spent much of the past year insisting that the economy really
had emerged from recession. His fellow Republicans, and several economists,
believe that his successor will inherit a strong recovery of Mr Bush's
making.
But Mr Clinton may now be trapped by the expectation that he will announce a
package totalling Dollars 20bn-Dollars 50bn (Pounds 13bn-Pounds 33bn) as
soon as he takes office on January 20.
If the economy is already growing strongly under its own steam, stimulus may
no longer be needed and could prove counterproductive by worrying financial
markets about the prospect of bigger deficits and higher inflation.
When the Commerce Department initially estimated GDP growth at 2.7 per cent
just a week before the presidential election, some suggested the number had
been inflated to benefit Mr Bush. Mrs Barbara Hackman Franklin, the commerce
secretary, said yesterday's upward revision 'should serve as a vindication
of the integrity of both the process and the professionals involved'.
Commerce Department economists said estimates of exports, business
inventories and personal consumption were all revised upwards.
The GDP data have been reinforced by other economic statistics showing a
recovery, including higher orders for durable goods, more home sales and
stronger consumer confidence. Home sales, reported yesterday, rose by 9.1
per cent in October, their highest level for four years. Earlier this week
the Conference Board, a New York-based business group, said its consumer
confidence index rose 11 points in November.
Mr Lyle Gramley, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association in
Washington, cautioned that the recovery was still at risk because of the
fragile economies of many of the US's most important export markets, and the
lack of improvement in employment, which is critical to public confidence.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Ratner quits retail group after shareholder pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GERALD RATNER, the jeweller who became famous for applying the
description 'crap' to one of his products, has quit the ailing retail group
which bears his family name.
He follows many other retail personalities who flourished in the 1980s
consumer boom but have since been deposed, such as Sir Ralph Halpern of
Burton and Mr George Davies of Next.
In a prepared statement, Mr Ratner said: 'I am obviously saddened to be
leaving a business of which I am so proud. However, the continuing negative
press I have attracted leads me to believe that this decision is in the best
interests of the group and the people working in it.'
Mr Ratner is thought to have felt under pressure from the group's bankers
and shareholders. At the annual meeting in September, shareholders called
for his resignation.
Mr Jim McAdam, Ratners' chairman, who will now take over Mr Ratner's role as
head of the group's UK jewellery business, said Mr Ratner's departure was
'very much his own decision'. Mr Ratner will receive compensation of Pounds
375,000, equivalent to a year's salary.
Although Mr Ratner's departure had been discussed internally for some time,
it was only agreed yesterday. Ratners' fall from grace follows a familiar
pattern of companies which expanded too aggressively, financed by
borrowings, and failed to anticipate the recession.
Its profits grew from almost nothing in 1984, when Mr Ratner took charge of
the group from his father, to a peak of Pounds 130m in 1990. He expanded in
the UK, acquiring chains such as H. Samuel and Ernest Jones, and into the US
with the purchase of Sterling and Kays Jewellers. The group's stock market
value peaked at Pounds 840m in June 1990, just before the Kays deal was
agreed. From there the slide was rapid. Yesterday the shares closed at 18p,
down 1p, valuing the company at Pounds 52.7m. News of his departure came
after the market closed.
Mr Ratner was credited with changing UK jewellery retailing from a staid
business with customers making rare but expensive purchases to a fashion
business. Ratners' extensive use of 9-carat gold and the development of
devices such as hollow earrings, brought the prices into the range of
everyday purchases.
But Mr Ratner's fate was sealed by a remark to a meeting of the Institute of
Directors in April 1991 that a sherry decanter with six glasses on a silver
plated tray which sold in his shops at Pounds 4.95 was 'total crap'. The
comment hit sales in the shops.
In August this year, Ratners reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 122.3m for
the year to February 1, compared with a profit of Pounds 112.1m the previous
year. It announced a change in marketing strategy, a plan to close 330
shops, and said its bankers had agreed to extend its loans until June next
year.
Mr Ratner holds 790,000 Ratners shares, 0.3 per cent of the company.

debt

<TEXT>
MOODY'S Investors Service, the US-based rating agency, has lowered the
senior debt rating of Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, due to the
financial pressures caused by weak third-quarter results.
Moody's downgraded DnB's senior debt, affecting approximately Dollars 1.7bn,
to A3 from A2, but confirmed the bank's commercial paper rating at Prime-2.
DnB plunged to a nine-month net loss of NKr2.46bn (Dollars 374m), compared
with a NKr2.33bn profit in the same period last year.
On Monday, the state-backed bank insurance fund announced a rescue package
in which DnB will receive NKr1.5bn (Dollars 228m) in preference capital and
a NKr600m state guarantee. The fund gave DnB NKr5.9bn last year.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Local grocers set
out new stall - Independent retailers, under pressure from supermarkets for
the last decade, are banding together to fight back.  Their plans to be a
cohesive second force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are few more striking measures of Britain's changing shopping habits
than the retreat of small neighbourhood grocers in the face of ever larger
supermarkets operated by powerful national chains such as J. Sainsbury and
Tesco.
Once the main purveyors of household provisions, the number of independent
retail outlets shrank by a third during the 1980s while their share of total
food and drink sales fell from a quarter to a seventh.
In the past year, widespread Sunday opening by food superstores has added to
the pressure. Richard Hyman of Verdict, a retailing research company, puts
the independent grocers' market share today at barely 12 per cent, the
lowest in western Europe.
Now, the independents aim to stand and fight. This week, Nisa Today's, the
largest association of supermarkets and wholesalers, announced plans to turn
its members into a cohesive second force by co-ordinating more closely their
operations, from product specification to the point of sale.
Formed 15 years ago, Nisa Today's negotiates annual bonuses and discounts
with suppliers and organises promotion campaigns on behalf of its 718
members, which have combined sales of Pounds 9bn. It also helps with the
development of own-label products and distribution.
These activities are set to move into higher gear with the formation of a
central buying consortium which aims to present a common front to suppliers
by combining the purchasing power of its members.
Initially, the consortium will be backed by Nisa Today's seven biggest
members, including Booths, Budgens, Circle K, Grandways, Londis and Walter
Willson. They will be joined later by a further 28 organisations.
Together, this group serves 10m customers a week and has annual sales of
Pounds 3bn. Though only a third of Sainsbury's or Tesco's turnover, that is
more than the revenues of Morrisons, the north of England supermarket chain.
As well as aiming to secure keener discounts by buying in bulk, the
consortium expects to double the total number of lines available to its
members to 13,000, almost as many as are stocked by Sainsbury's.
The consortium also hopes to cut the cost of own-label procurement by
getting its members to agree on standardised product specifications and
packaging.
In the next few weeks, the consortium plans to negotiate with about 70
leading manufacturers. However, it is coy about the price reductions it
expects to achieve. Nor will it say how much of any savings will be passed
on to consumers, arguing that this will depend on the costs and volumes of
individual retailers.
On most price comparisons, the independents fare poorly, charging as much as
20 per cent more than Sainsbury's or Tesco for a typical shopping basket.
For some items, such as fish fingers and tomato ketchup, the difference
averages well over 30 per cent.
However, John von Spreckelsen, appointed last year as chief executive of the
ailing Budgens supermarket chain and a prime mover behind the formation of
the consortium, believes the gains will be appreciable.
He argues that buying consortia have already proved their worth in
continental Europe.
He says a German retail chain he previously managed achieved savings equal
to 1.25 per cent of turnover after it joined a consortium.
But why should food and drink manufacturers want to play ball at a time when
many of them view the growing concentration of retailer power across
northern Europe as the single biggest competitive threat to their future?
Nisa Today's has two answers. First, it says, bulk purchasing will provide
large, regular orders for suppliers, enabling them to schedule production
more efficiently.
Second, the organisation argues that it offers manufacturers the opportunity
of a more constructive partnership than do the big supermarket chains, with
their heavy emphasis on own-label lines which compete directly with branded
products.
Terry Blackman, trading director of Circle K which operates 230 convenience
stores, claims that though his customers' weekly purchase averages only
Pounds 45 - against Pounds 75 at Tesco - more of what they buy is
manufacturer branded goods.
Among the incentives the consortium will offer suppliers is a joint
commitment by its members to support their marketing effort by, for example,
devoting a specified amount of shelf space to their products.
Will the initiative succeed in stemming the tide of decline, which has
relegated many small grocery outlets to a precarious existence as a source
of occasional 'top-up' purchases or as suppliers to remote rural
communities?
David Shriver, retailing analyst with County NatWest, calls it a belated
step in the right direction, but cautions: 'It will require a lot of
co-ordination and communications and a big commitment of management time.'
Hyman thinks joint buying could help independent grocers improve margins and
check their loss of business to the big multiples. However, he thinks they
have left it too late to regain market share.
'Anyone who expects people in Britain to turn the clock back and start
buying most of their food in neighbourhood shops again isn't living in the
real world,' he says.

FT  26 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Pricing of World Bank's sterling issue
provides controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING shifted nearer to centre stage in the international bond markets
yesterday, benefiting from currency nervousness elsewhere in Europe. The
terms of the World Bank's first sterling issue for nearly two years, a
Pounds 200m six-year exercise priced to yield 20 basis points over gilts,
provided most of the day's controversy.
Although the World Bank is a rare issuer in sterling, and a triple-A rated
name, traders claimed that Baring Brothers, the lead manager, had been, at
best, naive in its pricing tactics.
Critics pointed out that the gilt over which they were priced is much closer
to five years than six years, and that investors would do better buying
existing World Bank bonds in the secondary market.
Barings acknowledged that the bond was expensive but insisted that the
pricing was transparently and unashamedly pitched tightly, for what it
described as the best credit in the market other than the UK government.
Barings also pointed out that remarks made by the French prime minister, Mr
Pierre Beregovoy, about vetoing the GATT accord after the syndicate broke in
early afternoon hit Europe's bond markets, including sterling.
Barings said the bonds held their spread of 20 basis points over gilts
throughout and closed the day at 18, while other banks said the spread had
widened to around 24 to 25 basis points for a period. The World Bank swapped
the proceeds swapped into floating rate D-Marks.
The Pounds 185m five-year issue for Cardiff Automobile Receivables is the
second car loan-backed issue from that vehicle, note traders.
One of its attractions is the clear short final maturity: issues of this
type normally amortise at each coupon date. Goldman Sachs did well to put it
together at speed, say traders, although they add it also looks expensive
compared to bonds in the secondary market.
Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer Francais was able to increase its
Kidder Peabody-led 10-year collared floater to Dollars 150m from Dollars
100m, to the surprise of some other bankers who feel that this particular
market niche is not particularly attractive in current market conditions.
Fans of the structure argue, however, that the underlying reasons for its
use - a wish for a yield in dollars coupled with uncertainty about the
direction of yields - are still relevant.
The issue was said to have benefited not only from the quality of the name
but from switching out of existing issues by other borrowers. SNCF swapped
the proceeds into fixed-rate French francs. The European Coal &amp; Steel
Community's DM217m five-year issue was described as looking expensive.
In equity warrants, the four year issues by Matsushita Electric Works and
Nishimatsu Corporation emerged at Dollars 300m and Dollars 150m
respectively, through Yamaichi International. In line with current trends
for higher pricing on these instruments, both pay a coupon of 2 3/4 per
cent.

FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: Shintom to close electronics
factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE decline in the world market for video equipment has forced Shintom, a
medium-sized Japanese electronics company, to shut down production at its
factory in Kofu, with 94 job losses.
The outright closure of a factory and elimination of jobs is a rare event
for a listed Japanese company and is symptomatic of the severe pressure
facing the country's consumer electronics industry, which has huge excess
capacity.
Shintom has shed 242 full-time jobs in the past year, bringing its worldwide
workforce down to 540. It is looking to reduce the workforce by another 150
through 'voluntary' retirement.
Shintom's main business has been to produce video recorders on an original
equipment manufacturer basis, and 90 per cent of its production is exported.
Consolidated sales plunged to Y36.65bn (Dollars 295m) in the year to March
1992 from Y80.59bn in the previous year. The company posted pre-tax losses
of Y7.31bn, against profit of Y75.98bn, and is expected to be in the red
this year as well.
Although Shintom hardly ranks as a pillar of the Japanese electronics
establishment, the shutdown of production facilities is nonetheless an
important part of a restructuring process that the Japanese industry must go
through if it is to regain reasonable levels of profitability.
Between the worldwide decline in video equipment sales and the rising value
of the yen, Shintom found itself squeezed out of the market.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE board appointed by the Norwegian government to administer Uni
Storebrand, the country's biggest insurer, yesterday unveiled a 'final'
proposal for recapitalising the crippled group designed to convert debt to
equity and to raise fresh capital.
Uni collapsed in August into the hands of public administrators under the
strain of NKr4bn (Dollars 608m) worth of debt incurred through financing its
28.3 per cent, NKr4.7bn, non-influential stake in Skandia Forsikrings,
Sweden's biggest insurer.
The proposal is comprised of a write-down of Uni's outstanding shares,
conversion of debt to equity and a share issue based on cash payment for
subscription. Uni's administration board is hoping to raise about NKr1bn
through the issue.
The board has set a deadline of November 30 for creditors to respond to the
recapitalisation proposal.
Uni's biggest creditor is West Deutsche Landesbank with an estimated NKr1bn
in outstanding debt. Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, has
outstanding debt totalling NKr400m and the country's three biggest banks -
Den norske Bank, Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank - all hold Uni debt.
Under the terms of the proposal, creditors with outstanding debt of more
than NKr5m can covert their debt partly to shares in the company and partly
to convertible bonds - which can later be converted to shares - and partly
to ordinary long-term bonds.
Creditors with outstanding debt of less than NKr5m can convert their debt
into ordinary long-term bonds which will be bourse-listed.
Uni's nominal share value of NKr20 a share is to be written down to NKr1 a
share with a subscription price for the new share issue set at NKr2 a share.
In an earlier proposal which creditors rejected, shares were to be written
down to NKr2 each, while subscription to the share issue was set at NKr3 a
share.

A FRESH controversy yesterday broke over Ciments Francais, the French cement
producer, when the Paris stock market watchdog, the Commission des
Operations de Bourse (COB) accused it of breaching takeover rules.
The COB said it had sent a report to the public prosecutor indicating that
Ciments Francais had obtained control of more than one-third of Guintoli, an
Arles-based construction group, without launching a takeover bid as demanded
by stock exchange rules.
This is the second scandal to surround the cement group after the disclosure
last month of FFr655m (Dollars 120.3m) of exceptional losses on off-balance
sheet dealings. As a result, Mr Pierre Conso, its former chairman, was
forced to stand down. He bought FFr1.4bn of shares off the balance sheet,
including FFr350m worth of Guintoli shares, according to Mr Bernard Laplace,
the new Ciments Francais chairman.
Ciments Francais declared a 32.9 per cent stake in Guintoli last June, says
the the COB report, the result of a two-month inquiry. However, the COB
believes Ciments Francais really controlled more than that through an
agreement it signed in 1989 with Prigest, a management company, to buy
Guintoli shares.
This accord covered 17.9 per cent of Guintoli's capital at its most recent
renewal date, two months ago.

FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Coal contraction prompts Pounds 6.2m cuts
at Senior Eng
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER

<TEXT>
SENIOR ENGINEERING is withdrawing from the mining equipment business and
large turnkey power generation projects due to the contraction of the UK
coal industry and the associated reduction in coal-fired power generation.
The tubing, boilers and ductwork group said yesterday that discontinuing
these operations, along with closure and disposal provisions, would cost
Pounds 6.2m net of tax, excluding the impact of any original goodwill
previously written off.
The decision will cause the loss of 90 jobs in Senior Thermal Engineering's
power division, which is being closed, and could affect 350 jobs in the
mining equipment businesses, which are being offered up for sale.
But Mr John Bell, group chief executive, said the move was more a 'strategic
refocusing' than a job-cutting exercise.
'The rest of the group is performing well. We are getting rid of things we
can't do anything with, and which could cause us problems in the future.'
Senior has made no secret of its wish to quit the mining equipment industry,
and at the end of last year had changed the business sector's name to
control engineering to emphasise its intention to reduce dependence on coal
mining.
The mining equipment businesses up for sale have annual turnover of Pounds
14m-Pounds 15m and are currently breaking even, said Mr Bell.
They are Senior Davis Derby, which makes electronic equipment used in mining
and other hazardous environments; and Senior Conflow, which - along with
Senior Conflow USA, makes equipment to control water at very high pressure.
Mr Bell said Senior was already talking to potential purchasers, and
envisaged two separate deals.
Senior will retain the one remaining part of its control engineering
business, Senior Entex, which makes springs.
The power division, meanwhile, is being closed because of the increasing
dominance of the big turnkey contracting business by sizeable companies such
as Siemens and Asea Brown Boveri.
Senior has had some success in this business, with large projects such as
the Pounds 25m power station it built for Slough Estates. But turnover this
year of Pounds 7m-Pounds 8m will be lower than in recent years, and a modest
loss is expected.
Mr Bell said Senior was actively looking for expansion in its core
businesses, and singled out the recently acquired Flexonics of the US as a
business with significant growth opportunities.
On present accounting standards, the Pounds 6.2m would be an extraordinary
below-the-line item, but Senior plans to present its 1992 accounts in line
with the new standards for discontinuing businesses and acquisitions which
are being introduced next June.

FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Wassall document attacks Evode debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WASSALL, the mini-conglomerate which has launched a hostile Pounds 94.3m bid
for Evode, is expected to publish its offer document later today,
highlighting the chemicals and plastic group's net indebtedness.
According to Wassall, Evode's net debt has risen from Pounds 6.6m in 1987 to
Pounds 113m in 1991, which includes Pounds 40.7m of convertible preference
shares and the Dollars 43m (Pounds 28.4m) unlisted US redeemable preference
shares.
Evode argues that since the UK preference shares do not have to convert
until 2001 they should be treated as equity.
However, Mr Christopher Miller, Wassall's chief executive, said holders of
the preference shares would only be willing to lose their 7 per cent coupon
and convert into equity if Evode's dividend grew by an annual rate of 18 per
cent from 1993.
'Having cut last year's dividend by 44 per cent, I cannot see how Evode
could increase their pay-out by 18 per cent a year,' said Mr Miller.
Wassall also argues that some of the Pounds 70.2m of goodwill relating to
Evode's 1989 purchase of Chamberlain Phipps should be written back into its
profit and loss account following the recent sale of Chamberlain's shoe
business.
Mr Miller said: 'If just 10 per cent of the goodwill relating to Chamberlain
is written back into Evode's accounts, it will wipe out the Pounds 6.5m
which its own broker forecast for Evode's after-tax profits to September
28'.
Evode's financial adviser yesterday said some goodwill relating to
Chamberlain might be written back into its profit and loss account, but did
not want to comment further until publication of the group's results next
month.
Mr Miller said: 'We will be asking how Evode will be able to fund capital
expenditure, meet its redemption obligations, pay back the bank debt and
payout preference and ordinary dividends all at the same time.'
Evode is likely to take the two weeks allowed under Takeover Panel rules to
reply to Wassall's offer document.

FT  26 NOV 92 / SmithKline and Glaxo in row over patents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SQUABBLE broke out yesterday between the UK's two leading drugs companies,
Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham, over patents of one of Glaxo's most important
new drugs, Zofran.
SmithKline Beecham said the European patent office had decided to grant it a
European patent for use of ondansetron (Zofran's chemical name) for the
treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer therapy and
cytotoxic agents.
Zofran is marketed by Glaxo for that use. The decision is an embarrassment
for Glaxo. The drug won the Prix Galien last year as Europe's most important
new drug. Last financial year, Zofran generated sales of Pounds 259m
compared with Pounds 78m in 1991. Its launch was described by Mr Ernest
Mario, chief executive, as one of the most successful in the history of the
pharmaceuticals industry.
SmithKline Beecham is unlikely to call for the product's withdrawal and is
unable to market the drug directly. However it will be looking for royalty
payments. Mr Robin Gilbert, analyst at James Capel, said: 'This is unlikely
to have any immediate impact on Glaxo's bottom line.' Glaxo shares fell 20
1/2 p to 786 1/2 p, while SmithKline Beecham rose 2p to 538p.
SmithKline Beecham said it expected to have a European patent within six
months. Glaxo said eight countries were covered by the decision: Belgium,
France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the
UK. They represent about 25 per cent of Zofran's sales.
Glaxo said it would appeal against the decision and would seek to invalidate
the patent in any country where SmithKline Beecham tried to enforce it.
Glaxo's US and Japanese patents for the use of ondansetron for nausea
associated with chemotherapy are also being challenged by SmithKline
Beecham.
Glaxo said it had discovered, patented and marketed ondansetron worldwide.
It was originally patented for migraine and anxiety. SmithKline Beecham,
which has expertise in nausea in chemotherapy, tested the drug for that use
and then patented it. The company markets Zofran's main competitor, Kytril.
The main legal debate is about the difference between nausea in migraine
patients and nausea in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Tate &amp; Lyle falls as US weather hits sales and crops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TATE &amp; LYLE, the sugar and sweeteners group, announced a drop in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 230.8m to Pounds 189.5m for the year to end-September,
with poor weather in the US blamed for much of the fall. The reduction was
the company's first profit reverse for 14 years.
However, Mr Stephen Brown, chief executive, said he was 'extremely bullish
about this year' and expected a 'rebound in profits'. The eight weeks
trading since the September year-end underscored this view, he said. The
shares rose 12p to 368p.
A final dividend of 8p is proposed, up from 7p, to give a total of 12p, a
7.1 per cent rise. The dividend is covered more than twice by fully diluted
earnings per share of 26.2p, down 20.6 per cent. Mr Neil Shaw, chairman,
said the dividend increase reflected the 'long-term cash generative nature
of the business'.
He said the group faced no lack of opportunities and had made heavy
investments, for instance in eastern Europe, but these were yet to make a
return.
Developments in the common agricultural policy, the Gatt talks and the North
American Free Trade Agreement were not negative and some might be positive
for the group, he said.
Group sales rose 3.2 per cent to Pounds 3.4bn, but problems in Tate's US
sugar and corn sweetener subsidiaries hit pre-interest profits, which fell
from Pounds 280.5m to Pounds 237.4m. At this level the net interest charge
of Pounds 47.9m, down from Pounds 49.7m, was still covered 5 times.
Staley, Tate's US high fructose corn syrup business, suffered as poor summer
weather depressed soft drinks sales and overcapacity in the industry put
pressure on prices. Pre-interest profits in the division fell from Pounds
96.8m to Pounds 65.3m. A new chief executive has been hired.
At Western Sugar, the US sugar beet business, a frost followed by a thaw
damaged the beet. Western was barely profitable and profits from the US
sugar division, which includes cane, fell from Pounds 49.3m to Pounds 30.9m.
Good performances were seen in UK sugar refining, where productivity rose,
and a record tonnage was processed in Portugal, where Tate has increased its
stake in Alcantara from 62 per cent to 97 per cent, and at Bundaberg, the
Australian sugar business acquired in June 1991.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Fisons starts disposals with Dollars 140m sale in N America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISONS, the troubled UK healthcare group, yesterday sold its US and Canadian
consumer health businesses for Dollars 140m (Pounds 93m) to Ciba-Geigy
Corporation, the US subsidiary of the Swiss chemicals group.
The deal marks the start of Fisons' disposals programme that will involve
the sale of its horticultural and consumer healthcare operations. It will
concentrate on ethical pharmaceuticals and scientific instruments.
Mr Roy Thomas, finance director, said: 'We are very pleased with this sale
because we thought it would be the most difficult to get away.' The
consideration will be used to reduce group debts.
The North American operations had a turnover last year of Dollars 65m and
made an operating profit of Dollars 5.5m. They represented about 40 per cent
of the division's profits.
Mr Thomas said negotiations were continuing for the sale of remaining
consumer healthcare businesses. The largest, in the UK, generated sales last
year of Pounds 27m, those in Australia Pounds 16m and those in South Africa
Pounds 11m. The most important product line is Sanatogen vitamins.
Bids are being considered for each of the remaining national consumer
healthcare operations.
One company looking at the vitamin business is thought to be E. Merck of
Germany. Mr Thomas said negotiations for the sale of the horticultural
business, which had sales last year of just over Pounds 100m, were advanced.
There was at least one interested buyer offering an acceptable price. An
announcement would be made in the near future.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Technology: Consultant's critique
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For many people, change is like bereavement - the loss is forever. Coutts is
being dragged up to date by its parent, NatWest, which now demands a
financial return.
In this case, the technology will only be constrained by a culture steeped
in tradition. Employees wield power to resist change; such 'negative power'
may take the form of ignoring information or downplaying its importance.
Coutts depends upon gaining competitive advantage by differentiation. Many
customers enjoy, and will pay
for, the special cachet of banking there. But success lies in reducing costs
on those items which do not matter to customers while not stinting on those
that do. Coutts is just beginning to identify which clients or classes of
business produce profit.
The Product and Customer Profitability Information (PCPI) system now has a
year's data on which to base strategic decisions. I was very concerned,
though, that some senior managers were allegedly consigning reports to the
bin. While IT people often
see this as resistance to change, it may indicate that the users' needs are
not being met. There seemed to be little interchange between the development
team and the managers that PCPI was designed to serve.
Without complete commitment from the top downwards and rapid response to
feedback, the system is doomed. Nick Willmer seems to be driving the system
forward on his own, which can feel like swimming against the tide.
I felt that Coutts might be
making concessions to the 20th century but its heart is still entrenched in
the values associated with its antique boardroom wallpaper. Any drive
towards profitability will be resisted if it conflicts with tradition. To be
truly successful, Coutts will have to instil a climate of change. This need
not mean abandoning its culture but adapting and enhancing traditions that
help the business as a whole.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Technology: Putting a price on tradition - Claire Gooding
explains how Coutts Bank is using computers to assess the cost of its
exclusive service, in a series on getting the most out of software /
Software At Work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A frock-coated gentleman seated at a computer is a commonplace sight at
Coutts. The bank revels in a deliberate juxtaposition of old and new. The
varnished 200 year-old Chinese wallpaper from a previous boardroom dictated
the exact dimensions of the one so painstakingly reconstructed in its London
headquarters.
Coutts prides itself on a different sort of service from the bustle of
high-street banking. It preserves tradition, but at a cost. Known for its
wealthy clientele, including the Queen, the bank now wants to know more
about its customers: how much they are worth to the bank, and how much it
costs to preserve its exclusive service.
In the late 1980s, Coutts had to respond to the commercial pressures imposed
by its owner, National Westminster Bank. Julian Robarts, Coutts' managing
director at the time, triggered a project known as Product and Customer
Profitability Information (PCPI) to understand better where the bank makes
its profits, whether it be in asset management or standard banking services.
'The bank recognised the increasing pressure upon it to improve
profitability through a greater understanding of its business, and a need to
streamline its financial reporting,' explains Nick Willmer, the senior
manager who leads the project.
The next concern was to understand individuals. 'We're interested in the
relationships, the connections between customers,' explains Willmer. 'We
genuinely believe we look at every person to see whether they would bring
the amount of business that would benefit us and benefit them.'
This factor drives the account management at Coutts. It wishes to re-focus
the business, which means dividing it into personal and commercial
customers. Where an entire family is looked after by one account manager,
these are bound to overlap, but it is still essential to determine a key
factor and assign the account accordingly. 'We need to recognise where the
influences are, the driving forces, as it were, within the wider context,'
says Willmer.
Costing information did exist for some activities in the private banking
sector. The length of time, skill of staff, and grades of staff needed to
perform certain tasks were available. To define the 'relationship' with the
customer, Coutts needed similar and more detailed information on its
advisory and investment work.
'What we have to have as a relationship bank is a complete picture of the
profitability of the customers' activities. We need to know everything, and
if we only know 70 per cent, we could be missing out on critical
information,' says Willmer.
Robarts' strict deadline of July 1991 ruled out a bespoke solution, which
would have needed skills Coutts did not have and also demanded much
management time. A package was likely to be quicker and cheaper, and Coutts
started to search for a PC-based solution.
Local UK support was a priority. Willmer came across a new offering through
a long-standing business contact who was now part of a start-up business,
CSI. London-based CSI's On-Q package seemed to be a lucky find. 'The people
involved have worked in this field for 20 years, and it shows,' comments
Willmer. Despite his confidence in them, he was taking a risk by hiring a
company which had never undertaken a job of this size.
The package met Coutts' criteria for user-friendliness, data integrity and
adaptability. It could hold data at a detailed level which made reports
flexible. It also looked as though it could be successfully implemented
using in-house resources, which was an important consideration for Willmer.
Where some would have rejected CSI and its product on the basis of its new
and untried status, Willmer saw it as a positive advantage since he could
input his own requirements into a piece of software which was still
developing.
The aim was to look at the data by customer, instead of by account. This
demanded the ability to summarise at customer level, which effectively meant
starting from scratch. Much of the data was held in-house in NatWest
systems, but not under Coutts' direct control.
CSI helped write interfaces to bring in static customer information.
Although the bank is not given to using outside resources, it also enlisted
help from Price Waterhouse in analysis.
The data is taken from bespoke in-house systems, such as a relational
database running on a Dec Vax computer, and a wholesale banking system
running on a McDonnell Douglas minicomputer. Sources include the bank's main
transaction processing system, for information on income, balances, volumes
of transactions, and a marketing database for static data about those
customers. Cost information comes from computerised ledgers and payroll,
with a minor amount coming from manual ad hoc records such as timesheets.
Willmer, who describes himself as 'a sort of information man, a true
hybrid', knew enough about system design to be convinced that CSI's product
was viable. It has proved robust and bug-free, and he still says he could
not have done better.
While the project works in one small corner of the bank, it draws on almost
every area of operation. There is a reluctant recognition that it is
necessary. 'There is a natural resistance and fear of change in a company
which prides itself on consistency of service to customers and its
continuity of employment,' comments Willmer.
The On-Q system was implemented by July 1991 on PCs that were later linked
together on a Novell 3.0 network. CSI designed the system with the expansion
of PC power in mind, and the limits on the number of customer details stored
disappeared as larger PCs appeared.
The PCPI project demands some heavy manipulation of information, and despite
'exciting' volumes of data, the system has proved reliable, if sometimes
slow.
Inevitably, there will be some crossing of responsibilities and reporting,
as account managers in one area will have to deal with issues in another to
retain the personal service ethic. But the hope is that the customer
profiles will become clearer cut.
The project is still in its early days. It has taken a painstaking approach
to costs, using actual (not budget) figures, and reconciling exactly to
official accounts, including all overheads, shown separately. There is
sometimes resistance, according to Willmer: 'People don't always understand
the necessity of re-examining certain areas.'
John Galley, manager of costing and profitability, sends summarised reports
to 50 or 60 people. 'We don't get as much feedback as we'd like, but that's
part of the educational process,' he says. Willmer expects the marketing
users, only three at present, to refine and make selective choices as they
begin to use the database properly. At present the reports go to about 20
senior managers, but he is hoping usage will percolate down.
'In future the data should change our marketing approach,' he comments,
'although we really need a full year's data to make sense of it.' He feels
Coutts has come a long way, and is ahead of the game, because people are
beginning to understand the role of the system.
'The size of our customer base made it possible, but also made it more
necessary. Some users are saying that they knew some of this information
anyway, but now we have proof.'

<TEXT>
THE ISRAELI government plans to move next week to revoke controversial
legislation banning contact with the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
although it will continue to oppose any direct PLO role in Middle East peace
negotiations, writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem.
The decision was announced yesterday by the Justice Ministry just before the
arrival in Jerusalem of President Francois Mitterrand of France who has
urged Israel to accept the involvement of the PLO in the peace process.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, who held talks with Mr Mitterrand last
night, has turned a blind eye to close contacts between the PLO leadership,
based in Tunis, and the Palestinian delegates to the Washington peace
negotiations who are all residents of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
But he has refused to allow any deeper PLO involvement.
The move may be aimed at improving the atmosphere at the next round of peace
talks starting on December 7. Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, told
Reuters this week that the Palestinians were close to pulling out of the
talks which he said had reached 'a dead end'.

</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S most prolific management consultant, Mr Kenichi Ohmae, yesterday
launched an attempt to revolutionise the country's political system within
six years.
He has founded a group with some 30 politicians to be known as Reform of
Heisei, because, he says, the current political system works against the
interests of Japan and the rest of the world.
Mr Ohmae, chairman of the Japanese arm of management consultants McKinsey
and Co, used three specially written books, flow charts and an array of
acronyms to explain his plans to build up and lead a 1m-strong political
movement.
He conjured up the 19th century Meiji Restoration, foundation for Japan's
modernisation, by calling for similarly sweeping reform in the 1990s. Heisei
is the name of the current era of imperial rule.
'We have to clear the system away and start afresh. We wish to restore
nothing from the past. We have to press the all-clear button,' Mr Ohmae
said. His group aims to sweep away the Liberal Democratic party and the main
opposition Socialist party.
'We believe the effectiveness of the two parties has come to an end. Having
written off the existing parties, we find some members of the Diet (the
Japanese parliament) prepared to change this country for its own good.'
He had decided to found the group after talks with socialist and LDP leaders
convinced him they were incapable of introducing radical change.
The launch comes as Japanese party politics is in flux following the Tokyo
Sagawa Kyubin scandal which has split the Takeshita faction, the LDP's
largest. The Miyazawa government's popularity has fallen amid the scandal;
today, Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister, gives parliamentary
evidence on the affair.
Mr Ohmae has mapped out a plan for his group, to end in 1997 with a
revolution in Japanese politics. The group plans to recruit 1m members, each
paying Y10,000 (Pounds 53) to create a fund to support 50 candidates in next
year's lower house elections. These 50, drawn from the established parties,
will be assessed by a panel rather like a political credit rating agency, to
determine if they are sufficiently committed to Mr Ohmae's policies to
deserve its support.
They will then form a party to build a third way between the LDP and the
Socialists. It is committed to reform Japan's constitution to decentralise
power from Tokyo to the regions, and will represent consumers, citizens and
communities, not companies, unions and vested interests.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Hopes rise for meeting between Mandela and Buthelezi

PROSPECTS for a meeting between South Africa's two rival black leaders, Mr
Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, and Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party, brightened
yesterday as delegations from both sides attempt to set up top-level talks.
Officials of the two sides said senior delegations from the ANC and Inkatha
would meet 'as soon as possible' to finalise arrangements for a bilateral
meeting between the two leaders.
But officials of the National Peace Committee, which worked towards a
meeting for weeks said it could still collapse.
Asked whether the ANC had dropped pre-conditions it earlier set for meeting
Chief Buthelezi - including agreement on fencing migrant workers' hostels
and banning so-called traditional weapons such as clubs and spears,
conditions rejected by Inkatha - the chairman of the National Peace
Committee, Mr John Hall, said the preparatory teams would have to work this
out.
Mr Hall and other intermediaries, including western diplomats, have for
months tried to persuade Mr Mandela and Chief Buthelezi to meet to address
the problem of worsening township violence which has left 3,000 people dead
this year alone.
Mr Hall said he believed prospects for a meeting were better now than at any
time in the recent past.
The two men last met bilaterally nearly two years ago, but failed to reduce
the level of violence between their supporters.
Mr Hall said a meeting of all signatories to the National Peace Accord,
including main political groups in South Africa, would also be held soon,
adding this could pave the way for the resumption of multi-party talks on a
new constitution.
The ANC yesterday confirmed its more moderate position in those talks when
its national executive committee endorsed power sharing in a government of
national unity, even after a post-apartheid constitution is in place.

THE European Commission fined the International Union of Railways (UIC)
Ecu1m (Pounds 810,000) yesterday after railway companies effectively
prevented customers from buying cheaper tickets, Reuter reports from
Brussels.
The companies limited their competition by restricting the number of
agencies which could sell railway tickets and setting a single rate of
commission linked to uniform conditions of payment, the Commission said in a
statement.
They also prevented agencies from lowering the fares they offered by passing
on some of the commission to customers.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Directors at 3i resign after cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE directors of 3i, the venture-capital company owned by the Bank of
England and the clearing banks, resigned yesterday as a result of staff
cuts announced last month, Charles Batchelor writes.
Two of the directors, Mr John Petrie and Mr Clive Brook, headed 3i's
Brighton and Milton Keynes offices respectively. Those offices are to
close as the branch network is streamlined.
The other director to resign was Mr Stephen Denford, in charge of 3i's
Southampton office, which will remain open.  The three resignations
leave 3i with a total of 26 directors responsible for UK investments.
The senior decision-making body at 3i is its six-strong executive committee.
The cost-cutting programme announced in October involved the closure of five
of 3i's 22 regional offices and the shedding of 100 jobs.
3i has been forced to postpone public flotation several times in recent
months because of the recession.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Pressure over environment audit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INCLUDING local authorities in EC requirements for environmental auditing
would dilute the proposed regulations and should be resisted, the Lords
environment committee heard yesterday.
Mr David Wheeler, environment health and safety manager at Body Shop, the
retailer, argued in a written submission that eco-audits should be mandatory
for British companies but not extended to local authorities.
The EC's eco-audit proposals have already been diluted, and would offer
voluntary guidelines which companies could use to govern scrutiny of the
environmental impact of individual sites.
Mr Wheeler said the British government was attempting to extend the
requirement to local authorities, a move which risked turning it into 'a
completely nebulous directive'.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories beat off attack on EC role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government last night survived a Labour attack on its discharge of
Britain's presidency of the European Community, which is due to end next
month. It secured a Comons majority of 50 (312-262), in favour of its
policy.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, intervened in the closing stages of the
debate to dismiss suggestions by Labour leaders that the summit meeting due
to open in Edinburgh on December 11 could result in adverse changes to the
arrangements negotiated by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister,
to reduce Britain's contribution to the EC budget.
'We are not prepared to accept a change,' Mr Lamont insisted.
Sir John Cope, paymaster general, who wound up the debate, said Britain's
underlying net contribution through the public sector to the EC budget was
now running at some Pounds 2bn a year. He stressed it would be much higher
without the abatement negotiated by Mrs Thatcher.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, assured the House that there would
be radical changes in the operation of the EC, with more decisions taken at
national level, as a result of the British presidency.
He praised the role of Mr John Major, the prime minister, in opening the way
for a wider agreement on liberalising world trade which,coupled with the
steps taken to ensure a single European market by the start of next year,
would be seen as 'massive achievements'.
Mr Hurd dismissed remarks by 'flustered' French politicians attacking the
ineffectiveness of the British presidency and urged Labour MPs to be more
careful in expressing similar sentiments.
That did not deter Mr John Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, from
arguing that the humiliating and total collapse of government policies in
the wake of sterling's forced withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism
had put Britain on the 'sideline in Europe'.
He ended an appraisal of the achievements of the British presidency, based
on the benchmarks set by the government itself, by awarding one mark out of
10.
Labour MPs encouraged Mr Nick Budgen, the prominent Euro-sceptic Tory MP for
Wolverhampton South-West when he complained that the whips had used a 'hard
ball' when seeking to contain the recent revolt by Conservative backbenchers
over the Maastricht treaty when the government survived by just three votes.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Economists expect 0.5% GDP rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC GROWTH next year will be too weak to forestall further rises in
unemployment, which will remain very high for the rest of the decade, the
Society of Business Economists says today.
According to the society's latest forecast, gross domestic product will grow
by only 0.5 per cent next year - half the rate forecast by the Treasury in
the Autumn Statement this month.
As unemployment continues to rise next year, lack of confidence because of
job insecurity, along with the high burden of debt and a subdued housing
market, will dampen the recovery.
The society forecasts that inflation will remain low in the short term, but
will start to move upwards at the end of next year and during 1994. Of the
116 economists surveyed, only 7 per cent expected GDP to fall again in 1993,
compared with 78 per cent forecasting growth of between 0 per cent and 2 per
cent next year; 15 per cent expect growth of more than 2 per cent.
The society also forecasts that:
GDP will fall sharply this year, and grow by 0.5 per cent next year and by
2.2 per cent in 1994.
Consumer expenditure will rise by 0.9 per cent next year and 1.5 per cent in
1994, after a decline of 0.2 per cent this year.
Gross fixed investment will fall by 1 per cent next year, the fourth
successive annual fall. The society forecasts it will rise by 5.3 per cent
in 1994.
Manufacturing investment will rise by 0.4 per cent next year and by 11.6 per
cent in 1994.
Retail price inflation will average 2.2 per cent in 1993 and 5.8 per cent in
1994.
The current-account deficit will narrow marginally over the next two years
to about Pounds 11bn in 1994. Exports will rise by 4.6 per cent next year
and 5 per cent in 1994, a slightly faster growth rate than that of imports.
In the longer term, the society expects unemployment to average 2.75m for
the rest of the decade, while GDP will manage only below-trend growth of 1.9
per cent between next year and 1997.
Inflation and average earnings growth will also be subdued, averaging 3.6
per cent and 5.3 per cent respectively over the next 10 years.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Bolivia has worst rural poverty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LA PAZ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOLIVIA has 97 per cent of its rural population living below the poverty
line, the highest percentage in the world, according to a report by the
International Fund for Agricultural Development, a United Nations agency,
writes Chris Philipsborn in La Paz.
The report is a blow to successive Bolivian governments, which since 1985
have embraced painful economic restructuring on the premise that benefits
would eventually trickle down.
The report says rural poverty has grown since 1965, when only 85 per cent
lived below the poverty line. At the same time, Bolivia's rural population
increased by 1.4m, to 3.4m, or more than half of the total population.
The report blamed the increase in poverty on population growth unmatched by
increases in agricultural productivity.
'There have been some attempts at redistribution of land. However, the
majority of Bolivian farmers still work very small plots . . . without
direct investment from the state,' said Mr Mohiuddin Alamgir, a co-author of
the report. Mr Alamgir believes the situation will worsen unless there is
direct policy intervention from government.

FT  25 NOV 92 / New row erupts over car pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROVERSY over car pricing in the EC broke out again yesterday. A new
consumer group report claimed that Commission efforts to open up the car
market were still not working, and a senior UK motor industry executive
called for Belgium to be ordered to end price controls as part of the
solution.
The consumer report, by the Bureau Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs
(Beuc), claims that long-winded import procedures and unhelpful dealers
continue to stop car buyers in some EC states taking advantage of low prices
in others.
It says the situation has not improved since 1989, and that price
differentials across Europe are in many cases still much wider than the 12
per cent recommended in EC rules.
However, the Commission and car manufacturers claimed yesterday that they
were moving towards agreement on how to make it easier for consumers to
compare cross-border prices.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, told the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders in London last night that manufacturers might be
prepared to publish lists indicating prices of certain models and options in
different national markets.
Brussels and the producers have agreed that it would be both difficult and
confusing to publish detailed lists covering all models and options.
Sir Leon said manufacturers were also now prepared to write to dealers
urging them not to discriminate against buyers ordering cars for export to
other EC countries. Brussels wrote to manufacturers in May urging them to
make their pricing more transparent.
Sir Leon seemed unprepared, however, for a determined attack by Mr Colin
Hope, the SMMT's president and chairman of components group T&amp;N, on the
price controls which have been a long-standing part of Belgian economic
policy.
'We in this (UK) industry are fed up with being hauled in front of the media
to be asked why our prices are higher than in Belgium,' said Mr Hope. If the
single market meant anything, Belgium should be ordered to end controls.
Commenting on the Beuc report, a spokesman for the Association des
Constructeurs Europeens d'Automobiles (ACEA), the EC manufacturers'
federation, said yesterday: 'Beuc seems to suggest we are trying to avoid
the issue and trying to hide information. We're not hiding anything. We want
to co-operate in a way which is simple and meaningful.'
The manufacturers have until 1995 to demonstrate that the 'selective
distribution' system of exclusive car dealerships is not hampering the
single market for car buyers.
The Beuc study details wide differences in price across the Community with
Britain the most expensive country for car-buyers and Denmark the cheapest.
But the organisation was also sharply critical of national authorities and
dealers which it said hampered consumers' attempts to take advantage of such
price differences.

<DATELINE>
   VALLETTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MALTA last night devalued the Maltese lira by 10 per cent in a move
apparently hastened by this week's devaluation of the Spanish and Portuguese
currencies.
The lira, which was yesterday quoted at 1.89 to the pound sterling, had been
widely regarded as pegged at an unrealistically high rate by successive
governments.
The decision was announced by Finance Minister John Dalli while presenting a
LM400m budget in parliament for the coming year.
He said devaluation would lessen the impact of worldwide economic slowdown
on the island's developing economy.
It would also help meet the challenge of more competitive Mediterranean
holidays and preserve the island's attractions as an investment base, Mr
Dalli added.
Previously Malta has steered clear of devaluation for fear of the spiralling
cost of imports, on which Malta is heavily dependent.

Lengthening payment delays by European customers are adding to cash-flow

GETTING on in their job is becoming more of a priority for women under 35
than having children, the National Council of Women of Great Britain said
yesterday.
The survey by the council, an umbrella organisation for more than 100
groups, shows that only a small minority of women aged between 16 and 44
thought a women needed a child to feel fulfilled.
When asked what they would like to spend more time on, families came third
on every woman's list. Only a fifth wanted to devote more hours to their
home life. Time for hobbies and educational opportunities scored twice as
highly.
Women also believed that society undervalued the work they did in the home
and with their families.

FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc given share sale
timetable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government said last night that the previously announced sale by
the state of at least 6m shares in Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals and drugs
company, would take place by February 1 next year, depending on market
conditions.
The sale, which is expected to raise between FFr3bn (Dollars 550m) and
FFr4bn, will be a watershed in French industrial policy because it will be
the first time that the country's socialist government has allowed its
direct holding in a state-controlled company to fall below 50 per cent.
France's finance minister, Mr Michel Sapin, said in last night's
announcement that the shares would be sold in four tranches:
At least 2.7m would be sold to the French public;
At least 1m shares would be placed on the US market;
At least 1.7m shares would be placed internationally;
At least 600,000 shares would be reserved for Rhone-Poulenc employees, who
would pay 10 per cent less per share than the public.
In France, small investors who apply for up to 10 shares will be given
preference in the allocation.
After the sale the state's direct voting rights will be reduced from 77.5
per cent to 45 per cent. The government will exercise indirect control
through stakes held by other state-controlled institutions, such as Credit
Lyonnais bank and Assurances Generales de France, the insurance group.
On Sunday, Rhone-Poulenc reported a third-quarter net loss of FFr133m
compared with a profit of FFr548m in the corresponding period of 1991. Net
income was hit by exchange rate fluctuations, primarily the US dollar's
decline against the French franc.

The cutback, which is the first at any of GM's assembly plants in

GM said it would eliminate 13 production days during the first four months

KARSTADT, Germany's largest department store group, yesterday reported that
group sales climbed by DM1.1bn (Dollars 686m), around 8 per cent, to
DM14.5bn in the first nine months of the current year.
The group said that although the consumer climate had deteriorated in
Germany in the third quarter of the year, the retail sector had livened up
slightly in September and predicted that the trend would continue in the
run-up to Christmas.
It said that although sales for the year would exceed the 1991 level,
profits would not reach the same level of last year because of increased
costs: operating costs climbed by 11.5 per cent, reflecting staff numbers up
from 49,619 to 52,719.
Group profits last year were DM256.99m on gross sales of DM20.13bn.

FT  25 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Sweden savours delights of devaluation
 -Many believe that the revival has much further to go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing does more to get a stock market going than an unexpected
devaluation, as Sweden has become the latest European country to
demonstrate.
Swedish equities have climbed by 13 per cent since the krona was floated
last Thursday, and such was the excitement on Friday that turnover more than
doubled to SKr2.7bn (over Dollars 400m), some five times its level of a week
earlier. It slipped back to SKr916m yesterday.
Many believe the revival has further to go. They suggest that in the next
two months the Affarsvarlden General index, which closed at 841.3 yesterday,
may yet be able to climb back to the 912 level at which it began the year,
or even to the 1,000 mark which it touched briefly in May.
Even for foreign investors, this would be adequate compensation for the
effective devaluation of the krona against the dollar of 11 per cent to
date. The atmosphere of sudden hope marks a dramatic change from the mood of
late summer and early autumn when high interest rates, gloom about the state
of the domestic economy and the general world recession saw the
Affarsvarlden sink 37 per cent in just under five months to October 5.
The major beneficiaries of the recent rally have been the export-orientated
multinationals, the weaker krona improving their competitiveness sharply. No
sector has performed better than forestry, now felt to be back on level
terms with rivals which benefited from the weak dollar and a devalued
Finnish markka earlier in the year. The forest index has soared more than 30
per cent since the krona floated, climbing by a massive 19 per cent on
Friday alone.
Yet if Friday saw virtually all shares swept higher in an indiscriminate
buying spree, more selective buying has since become the pattern, and
profit-taking has set in. Some companies are not beneficiaries of a
devaluation, such as the clothing chain Hennes and Mauritz (down 6 per cent
since Wednesday), while the banks remain overshadowed by concerns about the
size of their credit losses and have rallied only marginally.
In the short term, the market may well see a correction. There has still
been no formal relaxation of interest rates and the impression is growing
that Sweden is going to maintain a tight monetary policy to protect its
currency from weakening further and to hold down inflation. Indeed, the
central bank's overnight lending rate remains at 12.5 per cent, one
percentage point higher than last Wednesday. There could also be an adverse
effect on sentiment if Finland goes ahead with a planned general strike on
Thursday.
But the feeling persists that December and January will be good months for
the bourse. One reason is past experience has shown that a devaluation is a
good time to buy shares. Another is that there was a lot of pent-up demand
after the gloom of the summer and early autumn - hence the record volumes
which the bourse has seen in recent days. Swedish buyers are now strongly
back in the market, and foreign institutions have become net buyers again
after a summer lull.
'The Swedish stock market has decoupled itself from the state of the
domestic economy, because we are seeing foreign investors buying shares in
internationally-orientated companies,' says Mr Bjorn Karlin, chief executive
of the Swedish Association for Share Promotion. He notes that share prices
were already starting to move upwards, even before the flotation took place,
because of the weight of foreign buying in the market.
For the pessimists, however, there is still plenty to worry about. Economic
fundamentals have not altered, with 1993 expected to be the third
consecutive year during which Swedish GNP falls. The budget deficit
continues to grow and further austerity measures are expected. The banking
system remains in crisis.
Internationally, currency instability persists while Germany, Sweden's
largest export market, is facing an economic downturn. In other words, the
mood of buoyancy is all too prone to a setback until there is firmer
evidence of Swedish and world economic recovery.

the morning on buying by public funds, investment trusts and arbitrageurs,
and a low of 17,080.04 on arbitrage-related selling and profit-taking.
Trading remained slow following Monday's holiday and volume fell to 200m
shares from 293m. Advances led declines by 650 to 291, with 185 unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 4.98 to 1,281.89 and, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.00 to 1,025.82.
Traders said that activity was subdued ahead of the last trading day for the
November settlement period today. However, sentiment is expected to remain
stable now that the interim earnings announcement season is almost over and
debates on the supplementary budget have resumed.
Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said that in the near term the Nikkei
average will probably move between 16,700, the 100-day moving average, and
17,800, the 200-day moving average.
Housing companies were popular on the recent rise in demand for cheaper
houses. Daiwa House Industries, the most active issue of the day, rose Y20
to Y1,380. Misawa Homes rose Y20 to Y1,070 and Nippon Housing Loan, the
housing loan company, gained Y7 to Y287 on bargain-hunting.
High-technology issues were mixed. Hitachi fell Y6 to Y704 and Toshiba lost
Y1 to Y608 on profit-taking but Fujitsu gained Y4 to Y535 and TDK gained Y50
to Y3,480.
Aids-related issues were sought by dealers. Hitachi Chemical gained Y100 to
Y950 on reports that it had developed a new anti-Aids agent with a Japanese
university. SS Pharmaceutical rose Y10 to Y1,240 and Meiji Milk Products by
Y2 to Y923.
Road construction companies were higher on prospects of an increase in road
projects. Nippon Hodo rose Y30 to Y2,070 and Maeda Road Construction gained
Y60 to Y2,740.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 95.61 to 18,376.07 in volume of 17.7m
shares. Steel issues firmed on hopes of lower interest rates.

FT  25 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rallies on strong durable
goods orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stock markets rallied strongly in heavy trading on unexpectedly good
economic news, although late selling took the edge off some of the gains,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 25.66 at 3,248.70, well
below earlier highs when the index had been up 40 points. The more broadly
based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 finished 2.47 higher at 427.59, the Amex composite
0.79 firmer at 391.53, and the Nasdaq composite up 7.10 at 645.94, a new
all-time high. Turnover on the NYSE was extremely heavy at 242m shares, and
rises outpaced declines by 1,113 to 707.
After a relatively quiet opening, prices moved higher after the Commerce
Department said that durable goods orders in October rose by 3.9 per cent,
and the Conference Board that its index of consumer confidence had climbed
from 54.6 in October to 65.5 in November.
Both reports were much more positive about the economy than analysts had
been expecting. Investors were initially hesitant about responding to the
durable goods orders number - one of the most unreliable of the monthly
indicators, and heavily affected by volatile defence and civilian aircraft
orders - but the consumer confidence figures were more convincing.
Cyclicals and other blue-chips posted especially big gains. International
Paper rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 , IBM climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 64 7/8 , Procter &amp; Gamble put on Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 54 5/8 ,
Caterpillar rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 54 and Minnesota Mining &amp;
Manufacturing firmed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 101 3/4 .
The effects of some of Monday's big corporate announcements continued to
wash through the market. Martin Marietta, which rose sharply on Monday on
news of its Dollars 3.05bn acquisition of General Electric's aerospace
interests, suffered a reaction, dropping Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 62 1/8 .
GE, which had also risen on the news, fared better, firming Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 82 7/8 .
Westinghouse was another stock to run into profit-taking. Following a big
rise on Monday's major restructuring news, the industrial conglomerate fell
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 11, erasing part of Monday's advance.
On the Nasdaq market, Dell Computer rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 35 1/2 on
the news that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into recent
trading patterns in the stock, particularly the gains that followed its
earnings last week, and the sharp losses which came after Kidder Peabody,
the broking house, issued a report raising questions about improper
accounting of foreign currency trading activities at Dell.
Microsoft jumped Dollars 3 to Dollars 91 1/2 in turnover of 4.3m shares
after Mr Rick Sherlund, who cut his earnings forecasts for the computer
group on Monday, said that his new estimates were 'likely too conservative.'
Canada
Final closing volume on the Toronto Stock Exchange was 31.92m shares,
including after-hours trading volume of 129,700 shares.
PWA Corp fell 24 cents to CDollars 1.21 and traders said that a federal
government promise to provide the company with up to CDollars 50m in
financial aid was not enough to support the share price.

FT  25 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses end mixed after
intraday recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DAY of grief in a number of early-closing markets was balanced later when
Wall Street responded to an improvement in consumer confidence, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT ended yesterday's floor trading with the DAX index at the day's
low of 1,510.28, down 20.61, reflecting interest rate and currency worries
and poor performances from the car maker, Volkswagen, and the steel group,
Thyssen. Turnover rose from DM3.8bn to DM4.6bn.
Interest rate hopes foundered on M3 growth of 10.2 per cent in October
against 9.3 per cent in September and a Bundesbank target of 3.5 to 5.5 per
cent for 1992. Cyclicals weakened on an easier dollar and Germany's
worsening terms of trade with many of its European partners.
Automotive producers and component makers all weakened, but Volkswagen had
the worst of the session with a fall of DM17 or 6 per cent to DM268.50 on
lower nine-month profits and a forecast of a dramatic worsening in the
fourth quarter. The shares recovered to DM271 in London in the afternoon on
short-covering.
In a weak steels sector, Thyssen fell DM5.30 to DM158.70 on expectations of
a dividend cut when it produces its 1991-92 figures tomorrow.
Karstadt fell DM13 to DM504 and dragged other retailers down with it on a
forecast of lower 1992 profits. Bayer continued to suffer from Monday's news
of a sharply lower third quarter, ending DM6.30 lower at DM248.50.
PARIS jumped 2.7 per cent on bargain-hunting on the first day of the
December trading account, historically a good account as fund managers
indulge in some year-end window-dressing. Investors were also encouraged by
much better than expected third quarter GDP data which showed a rise of 0.4
per cent, compared with expectations of a rise of just 0.1 per cent. The
CAC-40 index closed 45.84 higher at 1,720.61 in steady turnover of FFr2.4bn.
Dealers believed that some players were buying the market in the hope that a
devaluation in the franc which prompt a rally in share prices. The Bank of
France was reported to have intervened in the currency market yesterday to
prevent the D-Mark rising above FFr3.40.
Among active risers, Euro Disney recouped FFr2 to FFr63.50 after its recent
drop to a record low and Elf put on FFr13.10 to FFr323.70.
MILAN fell further as buying interest dried up but dealers reported some
demand just before the close which lifted share prices off the day's lows.
The Comit index fell 15.54 to 446.45 in turnover estimated at around
L224.3bn.
Sme, the state-controlled food company, was fixed L38 lower at L5,361 as a
number of speculators sold out, taking the view that it would be some time
before the company was privatised. But the stock reached a high of L5,695
after hours. Banca Commerciale Italiana, another privatisation candidate,
fell L18 to L4,501.
Dealers said Generali's performance reflected the market's volatility as the
stock dropped L1,080, or 3.7 per cent to L28,400.
Nordic markets were a study in contrasts. HELSINKI climbed 3.2 per cent, the
Hex index closing 25.1 higher at 810.1 on hopes that a nationwide strike
could be avoided. OSLO slipped on renewed worries that Norway would be
forced to devalue the crown, the all-share index closing 2.07 lower at
346.68 in turnover worth NKr215m. COPENHAGEN dropped 1.8 per cent, the CSE
index ending 4.59 down at 257.44 on fears that the strong Danish line on
maintaining the parity of the Danish currency would rebound on equity
prospects.
AMSTERDAM finished mixed as the CBS Tendency Index closed at 102.3, down
0.3. Unilever fell Fl 2 to Fl 180.70 on news that its co-chairman Mr Floris
Maljers said he saw no improvement in trading conditions in the near term.
ZURICH staged an intraday recovery to close with the SMI index 12.5 easier
at 1,879.1, some 10 points above the day's low. Similarly, late buying
lifted MADRID off its lows but the general index still dropped 1.82 to
210.22 as turnover thinned to Pta11bn from Pta17bn on Tuesday and more than
Pta30bn late last week.
VIENNA continued its slide with a fall of 1.2 per cent, the ATX index
closing 9.23 lower at 769.64. Austrian Airlines fell nearly 5 per cent or
Sch81 to Sch1,699 as domestic and foreign investors moved out.

FT  25 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: News from the US brings share rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TUG-OF-WAR in the London stock market ended in a victory for the bulls
yesterday afternoon when share prices regained ground rapidly on good news
about the US economy. Less convincing was the sudden rash of rumours that
European central banks had put pressure on the Bundesbank to cut German
interest rates.
Earlier trading had seen the FT-SE Index fall by more than 18 points to
within five points of the 2,700 mark against a background of continued
turmoil in the currency markets and new signs of recessionary pressures in
the UK.
The recovery came late in the afternoon and was sparked by Wall Street's
positive response to a sharp rise in US consumer confidence disclosed by the
Conference Board; the Board's confidence indicator registered 65.5 for
November, compared with a readjusted 54.6 in October, and the Dow Industrial
Average was 26 points ahead in London trading hours.
Led by a sharply extended premium on the Footsie December futures contract
over the cash market, equities rallied quickly and moved into positive
territory in the final minutes of the somewhat erratic trading session.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,727.1 for a net gain of 4.2 on
the day. Trading volume, sluggish at first, increased smartly as the market
turned higher. The day's Seaq total of 578.4m shares compared with 461.3m on
the previous day when the value of retail business slipped to Pounds 855.2m.
Equity strategists were not over-impressed by the late upturn in yesterday's
market, preferring to remain somewhat cautious. Several leading securities
houses were believed to be warning clients that the UK stock market might
have moved 'ahead of events'.
Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull said that fund managers appeared
unwilling to buy the London market on fundamental valuation at present,
noting also that the yield relative of gilts to equities had returned to
about two times this week.
At the start of trading, equities refused to respond to an urgent call for
interest rate cuts in Germany from Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of
the exchequer. Any hopes of such a move were later discouraged by the fall
in the Frankfurt stock market on news that Germany's money supply rose
sharply in October.
News from the corporate trading front remained relatively negative for
equity investors. Shell disclosed that it was making heavy redundancies at
an oil refinery in the north of England, and the Dutch chairman of Unilever
was quoted as seeing no improvement in trading conditions.
International blue chips and other US-orientated stocks rallied sharply with
Wall Street and Shell managed to close higher on the day. Hopes that the
European countries will make every effort to reduce interest rates despite
the uncertainties in currencies helped to keep most store and retail issues
firm.
But the stock market, although evidently determined to hold firm above
Footsie 2,700, remained well short of the peaks recorded last May. Several
strategists repeated the view that only an imminent cut in interest rates
would be likely to drive equities further ahead at present.

FT  25 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend hope for Barclays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BEST performance in the Footsie list came from Barclays Bank, which
raced up 4.3 per cent after two leading broking houses, County NatWest and
Hoare Govett, came down firmly on the side of those who say the bank will
maintain the dividend when it reports its 1992 figures next February.
Forecasts that Barclays may cut its 1992 dividend have been unsettling the
stock market for some time.
Focusing on Barclays' recovery potential and the dividend, County analyst Mr
John Aitken said Barclays was the only stock offering good value in the
sector. He expects Barclays' profits to rise from Pounds 75m for the current
year, to Pounds 525m for 1993 and to Pounds 1.35bn for 1994. 'We take the
view that this is the bottom of the profits cycle and that there is
significant recovery potential in 1993-4,' he said.
Hoare Govett's banks team told clients that Barclays' Tier One capital ratio
will remain around 5.5 per cent during 1993 and that the management will not
be pressured into cutting the dividend. 'The shares are 30 per cent
undervalued relative to the sector,' said analyst Mr Steve Thorn.
US buys Hanson
Conglomerate Hanson received a push from the US ahead of full-year results
next Thursday. US investors continue to pick up the stock for its yield
attractions and the shares lifted 5 1/4 to close near the top of their
trading range at 229 1/2 p. Turnover was heavy at 8.5m shares.
The rise in the shares was prompted by awareness that the upstate New York
broking house First Albany had put Hanson on its 'pick of the week' list.
There was also some speculation that Goldman Sachs had raised its dividend
forecast. Goldman's Hanson specialist Mr Jack L. Kelly said that he
maintained his estimate but did believe it would be up to a penny higher
than last year's 11p. He did not feel the group's figures will be be unduly
affected by new accounting rules and he is confident that any moves by
President-elect Clinton to clamp down on overseas companies will not hit the
conglomerate. Meanwhile County NatWest has been recommending Hanson in the
UK and US arguing that 50 per cent of operating profits emanate from the
highly operationally geared US subsidiaries such as Beazer USA, Peabody
Coal, Cavenham Forest and SCM Chemicals.
Vodafone strong
Interim profits up over 23 per cent and a 20 per cent increase in the
interim dividend from Vodafone, the UK's dominant cellular telephone group,
were the trigger for an upsurge in the shares. The profits and dividend were
well ahead of market estimates.
The stock was the second best performer in the Footsie, rising 14, or 3.6
per cent to 401p, the first time the stock has traded over the 400p level
since April 1991.
Analysts quickly upgraded their earnings forecasts for the full year and for
next year. Henderson Crosthwaite moved up from Pounds 310m to Pounds 320m
for the twelve months and to Pounds 360m for next year, with analyst Mr
Brian Newman saying that the results confirmed Vodafone as 'the most
profitable cellular phone company in the world.
County NatWest moved up to the same figures for the full year and next year.
Mr Patrick Wellington, telecoms specialist at County described Vodafone as a
'defensive, growth and cyclical stock, that offers all things to all
people.'
Thorn active
Sparkling figures from Thorn EMI calmed the recent nervousness in the
group's shares and led to a welter of upgrades. Strong cash control and
improved cost cutting offset any weakness in the rental business, while
margins in the recently derided music division were also improved. Most
analysts are now forecasting around Pounds 340m for the full-year, with
Virgin records expected to contribute some Pounds 45m. The shares jumped 21
to 796p. Having been under fire from some in the market who believe that it
paid too much for Virgin Records, the Thorn management will have been
pleased to hear that its former chairman Mr Richard Branson bought an
'undisclosed' number of Thorn shares yesterday.
The power generators came under pressure with Smith New Court, the
stockbroker, said to have been responsible for much of the selling in the
sector. National Power fell to 281 1/2 p before settling a net 3 off at 284p
while PowerGen lost 5 at 282p, after 280p. Kleinwort Benson was said to have
been the prime mover in South West Water, 4 easier at 503p and Thames,
marginally higher at 493p.
Lowndes Lambert was the pick of the insurance broking area of the market,
the shares racing up 11 to to 300p after the much better than expected 7 per
cent increase in the interim dividend.
Wellcome rose a further 7 to 1043p. Some securities houses have been
discussing the company with Japanese institutions.
Shares in Associated British Ports fell 9 to 313p after Kleinwort Benson
weighed in with a profits downgrade. The securities house now estimates that
current year figures will be between a profit of Pounds 10m and a loss of
Pounds 10m, against a previous forecast of a profit of Pounds 30m, to take
account of property write downs.
Bargain hunters favoured Tiphook and the shares moved 10 ahead to 265p, with
volume reaching 1m.
Among motor stocks, Laird Group eased 8 to 269p, hurt by a report that west
European new car sales are expected to fall by 3.5 per cent next year.
Laired is supplier to several European car manufacturers.
Last week's downgradings in TI group continued to weaken the shares and they
gave up another 5 to 277p. Rolls-Royce gave up 2 to 92p. Market watchers are
hoping an analysts visit to the company's NEI site tomorrow will help the
shares recover some of the lost ground. Siebe were in demand and the shares
hardened 3 to 372p.
International drinks group Guinness dropped 12 to 533p as Kleinwort Benson
reiterated its sell stance.
Food manufacturer Unilever suffered a volatile session as a reported speech
by the Dutch division's chairman, Mr Floris Maljers, was taken to imply
trading difficulties in Unilever's markets, dealers reported. However,
reassurances from the company that Mr Maljers speech, said to be given at a
private internal company briefing, referred to the general economic
situation and not Unilever specifically rallied the shares. They closed 8
off at 1038p, having touched 1026p.
Boots surged as UBS Phillips and Drew was reported to be recommending the
stock. The company has been doing a round of presentations recently and has
been stressing improved productivity gains. The shares gained 11 to 497p.
Good music figures from Thorn impacted on WH Smith, which owns the Our Price
music business, lifting the shares 15 to 475p. Dixons were strong as dealers
ran short of stock, the shares adding 8 to 238p.
Interim results from Argyll, while in line with market forecasts, upset some
as worries emerged over the price the company was paying for new supermarket
sites. The shares retreated 8 to 365p.
Conglomerate Tomkins had a busy session in which turnover reached 12m as the
shares gave up 3 to 212p.
The UK's biggest textile group Coats Viyella was held back by some large
agency crosses and the offloading of a block of 1.1m shares at 206p. The
stock slipped 3 to 208p on good turnover of 5m shares.
Dawson International announced profits of Pounds 15.5m in the first half,
down from last year's Pounds 16.2m, and said it saw no end to the recession.
The shares fell 3 to 224p and Mr Khaleeq Taimuri of Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken
recommended buying on weakness.

FT  25 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SQUEEZE together with news of an improvement in US consumer confidence
sent stock index futures sharply forward in the last hour of trading,
enlivening what had otherwise been a mundane session, writes Joel Kibazo.
The rather dull opening of the December futures contract on the FT-SE, at
2,722, seemed to indicate a quiet session was in store. A mid-morning seller
of around 650 contracts sent the contract falling to 2,715 before settling
to trade in a narrow range of 2,718 to 2,730 for the next 3 hours.
The strong opening on Wall Street together with the favourable US economic
data led to buying interest in December. The upward momentum was given added
impetus when a leading securities house became an aggressive buyer, not only
taking rival traders in Footsie futures by surprise but also pulling the
underlying cash market sharply forward.
The move led to some arbitrage activity and having traded around fair value
for most of the session December jumped to a healthy premium. It finished at
2,753, up 30 on 8the previous session and around 16 points above its fair
value premium to cash of about 9. Turnover was 7,051.
Most of the day's activity in the traded options was was in the November
stock options that expire today. Tesco was the most active with a total of
3,672 lots dealt. Total turnover was 25,972.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Gathering storm in ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK OF FRANCE intervened in foreign exchange markets yesterday, buying
the French franc, as continuing strains in the European Exchange Rate
Mechanism raised doubts about whether the system of fixed parities could
survive for long, writes James Blitz.
The franc fell to FFr3.40 per D-Mark in European trading yesterday, its
lowest level since mid-October, putting the currency at the centre of a
gathering storm in the ERM.
The market in European currencies was extremely jittery yesterday, and a
number of ill-defined rumours circulated that ERM members would quit the
system if Germany refused to cut rates.
However, dealers were increasingly convinced that the Bundesbank is not
about to unwind this latest round of tension by easing credit policy.
Yesterday's figure for M3 German money supply growth in October - at 10.2
per cent - quashed vague speculation that a cut might come at tomorrow's
Bundesbank council meeting.
Dealers reported heavy selling of the French franc for D-Marks. Some
stressed that the selling was nothing compared with the pressures that
forced the lira and sterling out of the ERM earlier this year.
However, pressures are building. The French authorities intervened twice in
the European day, defending the currency at FFr3.40, and short-dated French
money market rates rose sharply.
Strains also intensified in the Irish punt and Danish krona markets, with
central banks in both countries intervening to support their currencies.
Irish overnight rates shot up to 75 per cent, from around 30 per cent the
previous day, although this did not stop the Irish currency falling to its
ERM floor against the Belgian franc, which is the strongest narrow band
currency in the system.
Analysts said that a devaluation looked increasingly inevitable after the
Irish general election, because of the loss of trading competitiveness
caused by the recent devaluation of sterling.
The Danish krona also weakened, only just managing to stay above its ERM
floor against the Belgian currency, despite extremely high overnight rates.
Mr Christopher Potts, an economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris, said that it
was hard to believe that the markets were about to re-run the battle of the
franc that was waged in the summer.
'The key now is the attitude of the Bundesbank,' said Mr Potts. He believes
that strains can be avoided if the Bundesbank eases policy in the wake of
the wage and budget negotiations in progress.
Mr Potts says that the second battle of the franc would not be won by
raising French interest rates. 'That would not be credible now that the
market is placing a new premium on economic growth.'

FT  25 NOV 92 / Money Markets: French rates rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CASH RATES in the french franc money market continued to firm upwards
yesterday as dealers took the view that a second battle to save the French
franc from devaluation is in prospect, writes James Blitz.
The continuing tension in the European exchange rate mechanism pushed the
franc below the FFr3.40 level against the D-Mark, some 3 centimes above its
ERM floor against the German currency. Tensions were also felt in other
European currencies, with the overnight rate for Irish punts rising to 75
per cent, while the cost of borrowing Norwegian krona for 1 day was up at
500 per cent.
However, the growing strains on the French franc may threaten the long-term
future of the ERM. Three-month money firmed to around 11 per cent from 10
1/16 per cent on Monday, 1 month money was quoted at 12 per cent, while the
overnight rate was up at 11 per cent from 10 per cent the previous day.
French franc futures reflected extreme pessimism about the future of French
credit policy. The December french franc contract dropped 52 basis points,
to a low of 89.67 yesterday morning. At that level, it prices 3 month francs
next month at 10.33 per cent. It later closed higher at 89.74.
The firming of French rates should have no immediate impact on French base
rates which have recently been reduced. The French government's large
shareholding in the French banking system means that commercial banks will
find it difficult to pass on tighter credit conditions in the immediate
future.
But one London-based commercial bank dealer said that if the Bundesbank does
not cut its officially posted rates soon, France will be faced with a grim
choice: 'Either they will put up base rates again in the thick of an
economic slowdown. Or they will suspend ERM membership.' With parliamentary
elections looming in March, it is hard to see the French government taking
the first course.
German markets continued to reflect faint optimism that the Bundesbank will
ease policy, although yesterday's figure for M3 money supply in October
makes that an even less likely prospect.
The December Euromark contract rose 8 basis points from its opening level to
a close of 91.39.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Survey of Derbyshire (8): Second only to Mount Fuji -
Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To arrive at an overall picture of what tourism means to Derbyshire in
economic terms is difficult. Although the Peak National Park has 75 per cent
of its area within the county, it by no means occupies all of Derbyshire.
The park, which covers 550 sq miles, impinges on five other counties. But
some of the Derbyshire's best-known tourist attractions lie outside its
boundaries.
Buxton and Matlock, two well-known spa towns in Derbyshire, are both outside
the park. Buxton was once known as the Bath of the north. Today, it is
regrettably blighted and its famous 'Crescent' - John Carr of York's terrace
built in 1784 - is now boarded up and decaying.
But, using its famous opera house, it holds a festival each July. Buxton
also has a number of hotels.
Matlock Bath has a cable car, the Heights of Abraham Park and nature reserve
and Gulliver's Kingdom, a theme park.
These attractions pull in visitors over and above those going to the Peak
National Park, as does Derby itself with its art gallery and museum.
However, the county council does not concern itself greatly with the
promotion of tourism, leaving this to the district councils.
The authorities who run the national park do not involve themselves with
mass or popular tourist products such as theme parks. They believe these are
antithetical to the goals of running a national park.
These goals, they feel, are: preserving and improving the landscape,
encouraging the right kind of environmentally-concerned visitor and looking
after the interests of people who work and live in the park. There are
38,000 living and working there.
Neither the county council nor the Peak National Park has figures for
tourism for the county as a whole. The East Midlands Tourist Board said
three years ago it thought that tourism earned Pounds 120m for Derbyshire
and employed about 9,000 people.
The Derbyshire Dales District Council is heavily involved in tourism
promotion. Part of its area is within the national park and part outside.
The attractions it extols include the historic houses of Chatsworth and
Haddon Hall, the homes of the Dukes of Devonshire and Rutland respectively.
These are inside the park. The council also covers Matlock.
In 1990, Derbyshire Dales council estimated that it had 17m day visitors and
1.5m staying visitors. Estimated spending by visitors was Pounds 107m and
the number of people employed in tourism was 7,100.
The council estimated that this number represented 25 per cent of total
employment opportunities in the district of 66,000 people
Derbyshire is where Isaak Walton, a renowned angling writer, once fished
trout streams. It is where Charlotte Bronte set Jane Eyre. Clearly, the
county has a tourist industry apart from the national park, even if it is
difficult to quantify how big it is.
But it is the Peak National Park which is overwhelmingly the greatest
visitor attraction.
The latest survey undertaken by the park estimates that in 1991 it had 22m
visitor days.
According to Mr Roland Smith, spokesman for the park, this makes it the
second-largest visited national park in the world. Only Mount Fuji in Japan
attracted more visitors, he says.
The Peak National Park attracts far more visitors than any of the other 10
national parks in England and Wales. It is much more heavily used than any
of the famous parks in the US.
It is not hard to see the reason why. The Peak district is surrounded by
large conurbations. Sheffield and Manchester to the north, Derby and
Nottingham to the south.
It has been estimated that half the population of England is within two
hours' drive of the park.
Apart from the historic houses and pretty country towns, visitors go to
explore the huge subterranean caverns, and for walking, bird watching, and
other outside pursuits.
The Pennine Way begins in the park. It starts at Edale and winds 250 miles
to the Scottish borders.
The proximity of large cities and the ease of access puts the park's
authorities in a dilemma. The sheer volume of visitors means great wear and
tear on often fragile terrain. Moreover, although there are 22m visitor days
there are only 500,000 'staying guests' visitors.
This means the park does not make as much income as it might.
In 1991 it was estimated that the park made Pounds 75m. The town of
Portsmouth on the south coast makes three times as much from a fraction of
the number of visitors. This figure does not include those staying in hotels
in places like Buxton.
The aim is to diversify the kind of visits to increase income and to ease
the pressure. The pattern has been changing.
Mr Smith says: 'A few years ago visitors were people having a day out. They
often didn't leave their cars. They drove around, drank tea from a Thermos
and threw litter out of the window. They spent little and usually didn't
even buy petrol in the park. I have noticed that recently the number of
walkers has crept up to the point where they are probably as many as the
drivers.'
To encourage more environmentally-friendly tourists who stay longer, the
Peak authorities have tried to open up the district. They have negotiated
between 20 and 30 access agreements with private landlords. These agreements
now cover 80 sq miles.
They have signposted trails and footpaths and published literature on walks.
They have have set up visitor information centres and have encouraged cycle
hire centres. The park has a number of park rangers who have a policing
role, although they do not like to be called police.
There is a constant programme of repair and improvement of footpaths and the
landscape.
In terms of increasing accommodation, the park is not the planning
authority. That task falls to the High Peak District Council and the other
district councils.
But it has been closely involved with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food (Maff), the Rural Development Agency (RDA) and other bodies in
helping farmers diversify into farmhouse holiday accommodation.
It has also been active in converting barns to provide basic camping
facilities for school groups and similar visitors.
Mr Smith emphasises that any building has to be sympathetic to the local
environment. Local materials have to be used and planning applications are
expected to be in tune with the park.
He says: 'A scheme for a time-share project was turned down by the council.
We are not here to encourage mass tourism. We are here to look after the
landscape and conserve the environment and to encourage the kind of tourists
who will appreciate what is on offer.
'Increasingly, we must look after the interests of people who live here.'

FT  25 NOV 92 / Survey of Derbyshire (10): Special proposals - Derby, The
City Challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAZEL DUFFY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERBY'S inner city deprivation indicators are depressingly familiar in a
country straddled with poorly resourced industrial cities, big and small.
Unemployment in the city is 12.5 per cent. In the two inner city wards of
Litchurch and Babington, it was 30 per cent and 25.7 per cent respectively
last July. It is expected to go higher. Absence of work, and low pay for
those in work, are all too common in areas of late 20th century cities in
Britain.
Unemployment is highest among the ethnic minorities. Poor health is common.
Two Derby wards with bad housing conditions and hygiene recently reported an
outbreak of a strain of dysentery, for example. Most reported cases of
tuberculosis in south Derbyshire are in Derby city.
And, in the past year, there have been disturbing indicators of tensions
building up between residents and the police in these districts.
The worst-affected areas are in the south-east of the city, in Normanton and
Osmaston. They are part of the area which is the target of the city's
successful bid to the government for the second round of City Challenge
funds.
Derby officials believe that while their inner city problems are common,
their proposals to improve this part of the city are special. The area is
sliced into three triangular shapes by two main railway lines and the River
Derwent.
The residential population of about 26,000 is adjacent, but separated by
railway tracks from the eastern part of the city, where some 250 acres of
land lie derelict. The plan is that this acreage, plus another 50 acres,
will be prepared in readiness for development.
The site so created will be the focus of city and business efforts to
generate new business and leisure ventures in the city. At the same time,
special plans are in preparation to meet the social, educational, language
and training needs of the inner city residents on the other side of the
tracks, so they will be able to take advantage of jobs in the re-developed
area.
City Challenge money offers the pump-priming. A new company, Derby Pride,
has been set up by the partners in Derby City Challenge to carry out the
proposed programmes.
City Challenge and Derby Pride are chaired by Mr Nigel Rudd, who heads the
Williams Holdings conglomerate. The vice-chairman of City Challenge is Mr
Nick Brown, leader of Derby City Council. Mr David Dawson, chief executive
of Rolls-Royce's nuclear division, will head the City Challenge executive
management from next January.
The city business forum proposed two years ago never progressed. Much of the
groundwork, however, found a ready vehicle in the City Challenge format
where government requires that the public and private sectors work in
partnership with the community. The attention now to be paid to the inner
city will also, it is hoped, divert some of the private sector's preference
for outer city developments, which was stimulated by the Toyota plant, eight
miles south-west of the city.
The owners of the inner city site are mostly British Rail Property Board,
Brel and British Gas. Derby is not plumping for a single developer of the
site, as preferred in some cities. Instead, it plans to use a number of
local developers, who will be responsible for bringing in the end-users. The
site will be broken up into several smaller sites.
The marketability of the site will be much improved by the proposed spine
road, which will ensure better access into the area from the big road
networks around the city. Specific plans for the site include the relocation
of Derby County Football Club to a new all-seater stadium, the National Ice
Training Centre, for which Derby has been shortlisted, offices, an arts and
media centre, and three new faculty buildings for the new Derby University.
Student accommodation, and housing, is also mooted.
The promotion of links between the university and business in planning new
employment activities to the benefit of the inner city area will be stressed
from the outset.
Plans for the Normanton and Osmaston residential areas will focus on the
rehabilitation of housing - about 70 per cent is owner-occupied or privately
rented - using a variety of funding channels. Space for the community to
meet the police will be provided at one of the neighbourhood police
stations. A new managed workspace centre in the heart of the area will
create jobs.
All of these schemes, large and small, will use relatively small amounts of
public money - City Challenge funds total Pounds 37.5m over five years - to
attract a total spend of Pounds 212m. Some Pounds 36m will be from other
public funds, for example, from the Housing Corporation, City Grant, and
from the voluntary sector. But the bulk must come from the private sector.
This is why City Challenge has to be a thoroughly well-planned and managed
operation from the start. Derby believes it is well on the road.

Derby, The Toyota factor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The City of Derby is slowly stirring from its slumbers. For many years, the
Derby economy did reasonably well as one of the country's biggest railway
engineering centres and, later, as the home of Rolls-Royce aero-engine
manufacture. These were, and still are, leading employers in the area.
Power engineering in the form of boilers and pressure vessels is centred on
the Derby plant of Northern Engineering Industries (NEI is now part of
Rolls-Royce).
Engineering is complemented by printing (Bemrose Security and promotional
Printing), chemicals (Courtaulds), china (Royal Crown Derby), public clocks
(Smith of Derby), all with a long history in the area, and many other
activities.
The decision of Toyota to locate its first European car assembly plant just
outside the city took most people by surprise, even those in the city
council who had worked hard at luring the prized outsider to the area.
City leaders were jerked into action. Could Derby capitalise on the Toyota
factor? What did it need, to project itself to other potential inward
investors? What were the consequences of just going on as before?
The Conservative-led council, prompted partly by local property developers
keen to get the city on the move, appointed consultants Braxton Associates -
who had worked for Toyota - to summarise Derby's strengths and weaknesses,
and recommend a strategy.
Braxton, reporting in autumn 1990, identified a city with little recognition
outside Derbyshire and the East Midlands; small - population static at
nearly 218,000; more dependent on manufacturing than the country as a whole
 -36.4 per cent against a national average of 25.5 per cent; few good office
sites; a rather shabby city centre; roads in need of improvement; and no
academic institution above a college of higher education.
In Derby's favour, however, were its central location, fairly good 'quality
of life', relatively low labour costs, and plenty of land available for
development.
Two years on, and Derby is changing. The college has become a university.
The roads programme which will improve access to the MI, and upgrading of
the A38 south Derby bypass, which goes past the new Toyota plant, have
started, or are ready to begin.
Pedestrianisation has made the city centre more welcoming, even if its shops
are festooned with out-of-season sales, and some have closed.
Not visible, but equally worthwhile, is a greater sense of the leading
players in Derby pulling together more than they did. They include the
council - still Conservative, although now with a wafer-thin majority - the
business community, the Training and Enterprise Council, and the county
council, which is Labour-led, but now less stridently left-wing.
All of the big employers have shed labour. Rolls-Royce is nearly 2,000 down
in two years, employment at Brel - now part of Asea Brown Boveri - reflects
the low rate of investment in Britain's railways. Officials hope that the
worst is over, that it will be more of a trickle than a cascade in the
months to come. Male unemployment in the city was 15.5 per cent in July
1992, up by 20 per cent in 12 months.
Better-planned marketing of the city to outsiders by the city council and
the business community had been recommended by the consultants. The proposed
relocation of the Home Office Prison Service to Derby, which would have
brought about 1,000 civil servants to the area and another 1,000 or so jobs
to be filled locally, was a significant step in that direction.
But in the summer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, announced that the
Pounds 70m project would not be going ahead. Derby's best hope now is that
it will be in line for other civil service relocations from London, although
downward rents and climbing unemployment in the south-east have cut the cost
benefits of other places.
The precise effect of Toyota on Derby cannot be assessed yet.
This will have to wait until the Impact Study, commissioned by the
government, completes its work. An earlier estimate put the possible
employment generation at about 3,000 in addition to the 1,700 jobs by 1994
created by the first phase of the plant, which goes into production in
December. The second phase is scheduled for 1997, when employment would
expand to 3,000.
Component makers have not been queueing up to locate close to the plant.
Derby's easy access to suppliers in the West Midlands, and improving links
to East Coast ports, were obvious clinching points for the Japanese
manufacturer's decision to go to the area in the first place.
The proportion of recruits to work in the assembly plant who will come from
the city is not known. The only crude indicator is that about half of the
applicants for the first tranche of jobs came from within 15 miles of the
plant.
Not in doubt is that Toyota has sharpened the marketing message that Derby
plans to launch early next year. The city is more sure that it can come out
from under the shadow of its bigger neighbours in the region.

Industrial development
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DERBYSHIRE'S economy has diversified sharply from its traditional base of
coal mining, engineering, quarrying and textiles, but over the past decade
there has not been such marked growth in the service industries as elsewhere
in the UK.
Despite the large tracts of rural land, the local economy remains firmly
embedded in manufacturing variety. Successive censuses of employment
throughout the 1980s showed that the proportion of those employed in the
service industries grew from 47 per cent to 55 per cent. At a national
level, however, the growth was from 62 per cent to 69 per cent.
Although the shifting proportions denote an expansion of the services
sector, they also reflect the rationalisation of traditional industries
during the 1980s recession. Underlying this shift is a change in the
composition of the workforce, as more women move into service industries
jobs.
The second recession in 10 years has meant that the economy has again moved
into a period of flux, the manufacturing future of which is uncertain. Job
prospects are increasingly conditioned by higher technological demands as
the county's industrial base shifts away from traditional industries with
their demand for semi-skilled labour.
Over the past decade especially, Derbyshire has expanded into the paper and
packaging industries, into general metal manufacture, chemicals, timber and
furniture. But it has not been immune from general economic conditions and
there are few areas untouched by the ferocity of the recession.
The seemingly inexorable rise in unemployment, as companies seek both to
strengthen their balance sheets and to raise productivity as a protection of
their margins, is a manifestation of this uncertainty.
From Rolls-Royce, Brel, the railways equipment manufacturer, and Courtaulds,
longstanding mainstays of the Derby economy in the engineering and chemicals
sectors, through medium-sized companies from the Chesterfield area such as
Robinson, Bryan Donkin and Biwater, respectively in the healthcare and
packaging, engineering and water equipment sectors, to small groups going
into receivership, the shake-out continues. Size makes no difference.
The cumulative effect is to pose a question for which there is yet no
answer, either in Derbyshire or any other county with a strong manufacturing
base. It is how to secure expansion on a scale which will absorb those
thrust onto the labour market. 'It is a job just to tread water,'
acknowledged Mr Nick Hodgson, the County Council's deputy director.
Arguably, the problem is more severe in the industrial north-east of the
county based on Chesterfield than it is in the south, where the Toyota plant
can act as a long-term stimulus to growth and where there is the prospect of
expansion in the fortunes of groups such as Rolls-Royce once recession has
ended. The problems of the south are more related to downturns in orders
than to structural change.
In the north-east, however, the shadow of closure hangs over the collieries
of Bolsover, Markham and Shirebrook. It is true that collieries have have
been closing steadily in Derbyshire since the 1950s. Indeed, 50 years ago,
the county coal mines employed 60,000.
The three collieries whose future is now in question employ less than 3,000.
But their closure, apart from the knock-on effects on local suppliers and
the withdrawal of funds from local communities, will accelerate the gradual
change from an economy based on coal and steel. The difficulty is that, with
the wider economy depressed, there is no immediate means to effect that
change.
By contrast with Derby and the south of the county, in the Chesterfield
area, noted Mr Philip Robinson, president of the North Derbyshire Chamber of
Commerce, 'The larger proportion of people are employed by large companies -
at a higher rate than the national average.' The larger companies have been
reducing their numbers significantly, he added, but it is the smaller
companies which create the jobs.
With sluggishness in the international economy, there is little immediate
hope of any large-scale inward investment. 'I don't know where the jobs are
going to come from,' said Mr Robinson, observing that the average age of the
miners likely to be laid off was 33.
For all that, the county economy is not grinding to a halt. Mr Robinson's
eponymous company pushed up its 1992 first-half pre-tax profits to Pounds
714,000 from Pounds 495,000 in the 1991 first half. Rolls-Royce is still
receiving orders for aero engines. Birch, the Derby construction company,
has doubled turnover in the year to last September. LB Plastics continues to
invest at its Nether Heage plant.
Likewise, despite all the problems of the textile industry, exemplified by
the closure of a Tootal mill, Peak Textiles of Ashbourne wanted to extend
its plant. Similarly Charnos was expanding its clothing and lingerie
operations. In other sectors, Denby Pottery reported plans to increase its
workforce.
For the medium term, at any rate, the future prosperity of the county looks
increasingly tied to light manufacturing, with a services sector dependent
on the growth of industry.
Independent expansion of the services sector looks unlikely given the
proximity of older-established centres such as Birmingham and Nottingham.
There has not been a great effort by the county to attract back operations
from financial services companies, no attempt to establish an insurance
sector like, for example, Bristol.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Survey of Derbyshire (7): A fresh approach - Politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERBYSHIRE'S relations with central government have moved into a more
emollient phase. It used to be one of the counties which the Thatcher
government loved to hate and politicians of both parties would talk of 'the
Bookbinder factor' - a testimony to the high profile of Mr David Bookbinder,
the County Council's Labour leader.
He was a controversial figure of firm opinions and firm expression, not
least in his attacks on the Conservatives, a man who flittered across the
national consciousness when he mooted property ventures in the Crimea, sold
part of the county art collection and became engaged in rows about rates and
Poll Tax capping.
But he stepped down last April. Since then he has faded from political view
and his place has been taken by Mr Martin Doughty whose approach is more
pragmatic and conciliatory. Accepting the reality of the last general
election result, he is reconciled to working within the system.
Mr Doughty acknowledges a change of style. An example is the thorny question
of local government financing where Derbyshire argues that it, like other
counties of the Midlands and North, is disadvantaged in comparison with
southern local authorities.
The favourite comparison is with Hertfordshire which, three years ago, is
said to have been spending Pounds 3m a year less than Derbyshire but which
is now spending Pounds 60m more. Derbyshire complains that the way in which
the county's Standard Spending Assessment is made up by the central
government has deprived it of Pounds 90m over three years.
'In the past we might have said this is a Tory plot, shouted from the
rooftops and not got anywhere. What we've done this time is to put the
technical argument together,' said Mr Doughty, referring to submissions made
to the government earlier this month.
Such an approach requires patience and the county accepts that action is
likely to be slow. 'Whilst the case for change is convincing, it is accepted
that some of the major issues affecting local government finance for 1993-94
 -in particular the introduction of the Council Tax - may leave insufficient
time to look at flaws in SSAs,' the submission said.
Derbyshire, in short, has learned to live with a central government of
different political persuasion. It is true that since Mr John Major formed a
government the attitude towards Labour local authorities has become less
antagonistic. But a combination of softer attitudes both at the centre and
in Matlock, the county seat, has taken the heat out of contentious issues.
Thus there is a more co-operative attitude on both sides to the running of
the Derbyshire police, whose standards and financing had been sharply
criticised by the inspector of constabulary, and the government has backed
away from its threat of a public inquiry into the running of the country's
public libraries.
Such an amelioration in relations between Whitehall and Matlock, however,
comes against background of growing competition between the local
authorities of the county. This has been set off by the presence of the
county in the first tranche of authorities whose boundaries are being
considered by the Local Government Commission in line with the government's
policy of stripping out a tier of local government wherever it can.
Each of the 10 local authorities in the county is arguing the case for its
own retention, the county council no less than any of the others. Such
rivalry transcends party political allegiances. And the more relaxed
attitude of Labour on the county council since the departure of Mr
Bookbinder seems to have lowered the political temperature.
The altercations between Conservative Derby city and Labour county council
have stopped. 'I've started to have meetings with the leader of Derby city,'
said Mr Doughty. 'I'm particularly keen to decentralise power away from
myself.
'I've also been at pains to involve opposition groups in decision-making,'
he added, noting that the Conservative leader has been joining the
representations to the government on the questions of the Standard Spending
Assessment and the local government review.
It is a comment on past political relations in Derbyshire, as distinct from
some other parts of the Midlands, that such aims are worth expressing and
not taken for granted. In Birmingham, for example, political squabbling has
not prevented a bipartisan approach to the big issues of civic development.
The political colour of the county is, in any case, mixed. Although Labour
is strong at the county council level, it is less dominant at the
parliamentary level. At the last general election, despite swings in its
favour of between 1.96 per cent and 7.94 per cent in all but two of the
seats in the county, it failed to make any gains. The two exceptions to the
general swing were Chesterfield, the Labour constituency of Mr Tony Benn,
where there was a swing to the Liberal Democrats, and Derbyshire West where
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, the sitting Conservative member, had a swing of 6.55
per cent in his favour from the Liberal Democrats.
Indeed, six of the 10 parliamentary seats in the county are held by the
Conservatives. Of the two seats in Derby, which at first glance would appear
a natural Labour area, one is held by the Conservatives. And the
Conservatives have managed to retain control of - just - the city council.
But, apart from Derbyshire Dales, a largely rural area, and High Peak, where
the council is hung, Labour have control of all the other boroughs and
districts.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Survey of Derbyshire (6): A severe squeeze on incomes - The
rural economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON paper, Derbyshire has a smaller agricultural sector than many other parts
of Britain generally thought of as rural.
Only 1 per cent of the workforce is engaged in agriculture, compared with a
national average of 2 per cent and a higher level for some counties such as
Devon and Cheshire.
However, agriculture is only part of the countryside's activities these days
and Derbyshire has a large rural economy with some 38,000 people working and
living in the Peak National Park alone.
Farming in Derbyshire is mixed. There is hill farming of livestock in the
north of the county while in the Peak district, where the upland soils are
acidic, there is dairy farming. A small horticultural sector flourishes in
the south of the county on loamy soils and in the east there is some arable
farming on the clay soils. Roughly 70 per cent of the farming is
grass-based.
There are about 4,000 farms in Derbyshire. The average size is 50 hectares
but sizes range from the vast sporting estates to smallholdings in the
hills. Typically, a hill farmer in the north of the county would supplement
his income by either working in the coal mines himself or have male members
of his family work in the mines.
In the past, lead mining in the Peak District served as an additional
occupation for farmers. Farm incomes depend on a number of factors such as
the level of debt, the kind of farming involved, the efficiency with which
the farm is run. What is common to all farms, however, is the severe squeeze
on net incomes seen since the mid-eighties, as the reforms of the Common
Agricultural Policy of the European Community have reduced subsidies and cut
prices.
Mr Brian Angel of Adas, the advisory service of the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food (MAFF), reckons that the trend of net farm incomes in
Derbyshire would broadly be in line with national figures which indicate a
steady fall of about 50 per cent between 1981 and 1991.
He says: 'What has happened is there has been continuous upward pressures on
inputs as prices have levelled off or stabilised. Farmers do everything to
keep costs down. For fixed costs they have machinery rings where they share
machinery. Variable costs are kept down by shedding labour'.
With such a squeeze on incomes there is a great emphasis on trying to
diversify the agricultural economy into the broader rural economy. A whole
raft of government schemes and measures are available for diversification
and for conversion.
Part of the Peak District, the High Peak, has been designated an
economically sensitive area (Esa); one of 19 such areas in the UK.
Participation in the Esa scheme is voluntary. Farmers who join sign a
legally-binding, five-year management agreement with MAFF and comply with a
set of management prescriptions in return for an annual payment.
For farms not within an Esa, there are various other schemes including the
'set-aside' where farmers are paid to leave land fallow for certain periods;
and the farm woodland project. For Derbyshire, however, the two most
relevant and widely-applied programmes are the farm diversification grant
scheme and the Rural Development Commission's grant scheme. Parts of
Derbyshire are designated rural development areas.
The Rural Development Commission can provide grants for the refurbishment of
redundant buildings to bring them back into productive business use. The
grant can also be used for the upgrading of mains services (electricity,
gas, water etc) in premises already in productive use, provided that the
work will enable the business to survive or expand. The rate of grant is 25
per cent of the eligible costs of conversion or refurbishment subject to a
minimum grant of Pounds 250 and a normal grant maximum of Pounds 12,500.
Grants are also available under the farm diversification grant scheme. This
is run by Adas and offers a package of assistance to farmers thinking of
diversifying into non-agricultural profit-making activities on their farm.
Various kinds of advice on drawing up projects and marketing products are on
offer.
Mr Angel says he has seen no precise figures for the number of farms which
have attempted diversification, but at a rough guess he would think it was
about 2,000 farms.
Schemes include not just conversions to take in tourists or create farmhouse
holidays but also projects such as farm shops, riding schools, trekking
centres and various craft workshops.
Mr Angel stresses that the emphasis is as much on conservation as on
diversification. He says: 'It becomes increasingly difficult to
conceptualise the farm economy as something separate from the wider rural
economy.'
Many of schemes are geared to keeping people on the land and employed in the
rural sector as far as possible.
What many schemes try and avoid is giving grants for barns to be converted
into second homes for rich city dwellings or first homes for commuters into
Derby and Nottingham.
Derbyshire, as elsewhere, has witnessed the phenomenon of sons and daughters
of farmers and agricultural workers being unable to afford properties in the
villages where they grew up because of pressure from outsiders.
The recession has eased the problem, but it is one which those concerned
with the rural economy in Derbyshire do not want to recur.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Survey of Derbyshire (3):  Built within schedule and budget
 -Toyota, The Burnaston plant / Phase One
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE construction by Toyota of its Pounds 700m car assembly plant at the
former Burnaston airfield close to Derby is a success - even before the
first cars have been produced.
The world's third-largest vehicle manufacturer has been very pleased with
the performance of the UK contractors which have built the first phase of
one of Europe's biggest industrial complexes.
More than 50 separate sub-contractors and 2,500 workers have been employed
on Britain's second-largest private sector building project after the Canary
Wharf office development in London's former docklands.
The plant, covering more than 200,000 sq metres incorporated more than
20,000 tonnes of steel,
The first phase of the Burnaston plant, completed earlier this year within
the original schedule and budget, will allow Toyota to manufacture up to
100,000 cars a year by late 1995. Production of the first Carina E 1600 and
1800 saloons are due to start on December 16.
A second phase of development at the plant, largely investment in more
machinery rather than additional construction, will allow the group to
produce 200,000 cars a year by 1997-98.
Because of the need to get the plant open and running as soon as a possible
designs had to be developed as construction was taking place. This required
a high degree of co-operation between client, designers, project managers
and the large numbers of separate sub-contractors involved in a large
project such as this.
The project, according to builders and engineers who worked on the plant,
provided a lesson in how construction contracts should be organised for a
British industry which in the past has been criticised for failing to
deliver on time and within budget.
Mr Bernard Ainsworth of Laing Management, part of the building and civil
engineering group and project director for the Toyota plant, says: 'It is
helpful when there is a well-organised client which knows clearly what it
wants and is prepared to work closely with contractors to achieve its aims.'
Toyota, which employed Shimizu of Japan as contract administrator, has had a
senior construction team permanently on site with the authority to react
immediately to problems without having to refer continually to higher
management. This removed some of the possible causes for delay, says Mr
Ainsworth.
There was a preference to employ sub-contractors which had previously worked
together harmoniously. Mr Ainsworth says: 'Following the lead of Toyota and
Shimizu, we did not simply accept the lowest tender but looked for the best
price for the job as a whole.
'The aim was to develop a close-knit construction team which, although
employed by separate companies in different professional disciplines, was
able to forge a common purpose to benefit the project as a whole and not
just their individual companies.'
To promote team spirit and ensure that different trades were kept fully
informed of development progress and of any potential delays, there was a
regular and free flow of information. Individual subcontractors met the
project manager and representatives from Toyota and Shimizu at least once a
week. Each meeting lasted between one and two hours and was attended by only
a small number of senior managers so as not to delay construction.
There were also formal weekly co-ordination meetings, attended by all the
sub-contractors working on site, which lasted about 45 minutes. 'The aim was
to make sure everybody knew what was going on and could plan for problems
which might have a knock-on effect on their part of the project,' says Mr
Ainsworth.
The result has been a rate of construction at the Derby plant which has
matched the best times achieved by contractors in Japan. Disputes between
main and sub-contractors have been fewer than would normally be expected on
a project of this size and complexity.
The decision to start construction before designs had been completed meant
that sub-contractors had to be sufficiently flexible to cope with
late-breaking designs and changes to the schedule.
Wetter-than-expected ground conditions, for example, led to an early
decision to double the number of concrete piles from 1,100 to 2,200. This
meant employing an extra contractor at short notice to help with the work.
The extra cost, running into several million pounds, was absorbed into the
original budget by finding savings in other parts of the project.
A temporary ring-main, involving half a kilometre of piping, had to be
installed to help drain the site of the paint shop. Mr Ainsworth says:
'Because we had prepared carefully, we were ready to cope with this sort of
contingency. We could react swiftly to overcome problems. Moreover, we knew
we had the support of our sub-contractors.'
In another case, the lay-out of the assembly shop was changed just before
foundations were due to be dug. This meant bringing forward other works.
This type of last-minute rescheduling can be very costly and could lead to
substantial claims for extra payment from sub-contractors affected.
In this case, the issue was resolved swiftly and no time was lost.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Survey of Derbyshire (2): Fillip for the county - Toyota,
Local economic impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA'S arrival in Derbyshire, the rapid construction of its Pounds 700m
motor manufacturing plant at Burnaston, south of Derby, and the smooth
build-up to the first production of Carina cars next month has given a
fillip to the county economy, especially in the south.
The latest East Midlands business survey by Price Waterhouse, accountants,
and Nottingham Business School indicated that business leaders in Derbyshire
are the most confident in the region about recovery: a confidence which
Price Waterhouse ascribes at least in part to the presence of Toyota.
Earlier surveys from the same source had shown that Derbyshire, again
because of Toyota, went into recession later than other counties in the East
Midlands.
Yet, although Toyota's decision to establish a plant in Derbyshire was one
of the inward investment coups of the 1980s, it promises no instant bonanza.
There had been hopes that component manufacturers might follow the car maker
to the county. But this has not yet happened.
It is true that hope remains that Toyota will be a nodal point for economic
growth. The Derby City Council is expecting some population growth over the
next decade. The County Council is hoping that once the recession ends and
when the Stoke-Derby link road is in place and a supply of nearby serviced
industrial land becomes available, growth will be assured. Over the long
term, noting the surplus land on the Toyota site, the County Council also
hopes that another Toyota plant may be built.
But now, when the question of jobs is paramount, the number of people that
Toyota is employing is less than the number being made redundant, because of
recession, by companies in Derby and the immediate areas. Toyota's presence
may ameliorate the worsening employment situation; it certainly does not
cure it.
Not surprisingly, Toyota has received about 20,000 applications for
production jobs. By March, its labour needs will reach 1,250 people as it
enters the first phase of its production plans to make 100,000 cars a year
by 1995. Although eventually Burnaston is expected to employ 3,000 people as
production moves up to 200,000 units a year, the rate of expansion after the
first phase depends on the state of the market. Few, under present
conditions, would wish to predict that.
Of the 20,000 applications, more than 50 per cent come from within a 15-mile
radius of Burnaston, serving testimony both of the perceived job security at
Toyota and of the increasingly difficult job situation in Derby itself. But
it is clear from the qualifications which Toyota demands of its employees
that it will be competing for the cream of the labour force. Thus, as
recruitment continues, there is likely to be a local reshuffling of the pack
of those employed rather than a dent in the numbers of unemployed.
The average age of the 1,000 employees so far taken on is 32. Toyota said:
'The type of people we look for are flexible and willing to learn and need
not necessarily have a background in the car industry unless of course it is
vital for the job concerned. These characteristics will help them work in an
environment of mutual trust and respect where quality and safety are chief
concerns.'
But the significance of Toyota goes beyond the numbers it directly employs.
Two years ago, Derbyshire County Council produced 'an impact study', the
conclusions of which, it believes, remain valid. This study suggested that,
assuming Toyota builds up to a production of 200,000 units a year, a further
4,000 jobs will be created in addition to the 3,000 employed at Burnaston.
This 4,000 would be made up of 1,000 among local component suppliers, 2,000
from the indirect effect of Toyota's investment - largely those involved in
providing services and materials to the plant - and a further 1,000 would
come as a result of the extra spending resulting from the jobs growth. But
the main effects will come after 1995.
Meanwhile, Toyota has been following a policy of local purchase, largely for
non-technical purposes. Earlier this year it said it had agreed local
contracts worth Pounds 133m related to construction and installation work.
Certainly the local construction and construction supply industries in south
Derbyshire have weathered recession better than most of their peers
elsewhere. Once production reaches 100,000 units a year, Toyota will be
buying in components worth more than Pounds 100m a year from companies
within a radius of 50 miles.
One immediate effect has been a stimulus to the housing sector. Wilson
Bowden, a property group with national interests, and Birch, a growing Derby
construction company, are starting work three miles from Burnaston on a
development which could provide 2,000 new homes over the next 10 years.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Survey of Derbyshire (4): Newcomers needed - Inward
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Toyota's huge investment in a Pounds 700m car plant in Burnaston, south
Derbyshire, has so dominated inward investment in the county that there has
been little examination of other re-locations and start-ups.
Toyota is often assumed to have brought in fresh investment on its coat
tails. There has been some interest among Japanese companies in being close
to Toyota's new venture. But there have been few significant investments, at
least in Derbyshire.
Since it first announced its plans in 1989, Toyota has never fully spelt out
why it chose Burnaston. The availability of a 400-acre airfield which was
effectively a greenfield site - and cheap to buy - was one reason. Another
was the proximity to the traditional automotive heartland of the West
Midlands.
The company made it clear from the start that because of sensitivities in
the European Community - the French tried to insist on at least 70 per cent
locally-manufactured components in Japanese cars built in Britain - it
would, where possible, be using local manufacturers.
This has meant that so far the spin-offs from Toyota have been in Derby
itself and also in neighbouring Staffordshire and Leicestershire. Parts of
these counties are closer to Burnaston than Chesterfield, the second-largest
town in the Derbyshire, and they have a greater concentration of motor
component manufacturers.
Derbyshire has a north-south divide both physically and psychologically. The
Peak District split it and the people of Chesterfield and Buxton tend to
look north to Sheffield and Manchester as main centres rather than south to
Derby and Nottingham.
Moreover, the beneficiaries of Toyota so far have tended to be existing
manufacturers. In these recessionary times, they usually have spare
capacity. There has been little demand for new companies to invade the area,
even in Derby.
Mr Gordon Wilding, economic development manager to the Derbyshire Enterprise
Board, says: 'Leaving aside expansions or contractions in the well-known
companies like Rolls-Royce, British Rail Engineering, Thorntons and Nestle,
and apart from one or two investments in Derby like Scholls the footwear
people, I am bound to say there have been no significant, totally new,
greenfield-type investments in the county, outside of Toyota, in the past
few years.'
This is not to say there has been no new investment at all. Mr Wilding
quickly produces a list which shows that apart from Toyota and its related
companies 11 other Japanese concerns have set up in Derbyshire since 1989.
They are companies such as Japanese Aero Engines Corporation which has
established a presence in Derby and Chiyoda Fire &amp; Marine Insurance (Europe)
 -also in Derby.
A second list produces the names of 20 German companies which have set up in
Derbyshire in recent years .
Local press cuttings give examples of local companies which are expanding.
Dove Valley Poultry has opened a new Pounds 1.5m factory extension in
Ashbourne. Northern Food Transport, which supplies food across the country,
has applied for planning permission for a new Pounds 2m base in South
Normanton, Bolsover. This would employ 200 workers.
None of these cases, however, could be deemed significant new investments
either in capital or employment terms.
Mr Wilding says: 'These figures are notoriously difficult to arrive at but I
would guess that in terms of completely fresh investment you are talking
about a total of tens of millions of pounds rather than hundreds - and
hundreds of new jobs rather than thousands.'
One reason that Derbyshire has not attracted significant new investment,
notwithstanding Toyota, is that it has not been helped by the government to
promote itself as a re-location centre.
Small parts of the north-east of the county are classified as intermediate
area. Businesses there can apply for regional selective assistance, and
regional enterprise grants.
Parts of the county also qualify as Objective 2 regions under the European
Regional Development Fund and can receive infrastructural aid. Within the
Objective 2 region some areas qualify for assistance aimed at helping old
coal mining areas. There is also limited assistance available under the
Rural Development Scheme and from British Coal Enterprise for various parts
of the county.
However, none of this help begins to match the amounts and scope of
assistance thrown at south Wales, the north-east of England, or the former
steel towns such as Consett and Corby. And it does not remotely mirror the
sums channelled through the former new town corporations for economic
regeneration.
Specifically, most of Derbyshire is not an assisted area.
Mr David Stone, of the planning department of the Chesterfield District
Council, says: 'An area like ours needs assisted area status because it is
the key to unlocking private sector investment. Assistance and subsidy are
not the only reasons a company will move to an area. By themselves they
probably would not swing the decision. Others factors are equally, if not
more, important. But assistance certainly helps.'
Derbyshire has some similarities with Lancashire. Both counties suffered
from the decline of textiles and engineering in the recession of the 1980s,
but both counties held up well in employment terms through the rest of the
1980s because single, large employers continued to do comparatively well.
In Lancashire's case, aerospace and defence held up, and in Derbyshire,
mining - despite contraction - continued to supply jobs. Lancashire is now
anxious to gain assisted area status because of the threat hanging over the
aerospace industry; Derbyshire because of the cloud over mining.
Mr Stone says: 'Given the severity of the recession, we have done relatively
well. Unemployment is 11.4 per cent; higher then the national average, but
not greatly so. This is why we have not received assisted area status.'
The situation may now be about to change. The three coal pits in Derbyshire
are not those due for immediate closure. They are among the 21 mines due for
reappraisal in three months' time. Some 3,000 are employed in the Derbyshire
pits. Thousands of others live in the county but work in pits in
Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. Mr Stone says: 'The pit closures, if they
happen, will be devastating for this area of north-east Derbyshire.
Unemployment will immediate shoot up to 17 per cent.'
Derbyshire wants to secure assisted area status as well as any special help
that comes specifically for the mines. But it is also stressing other
factors in its drive to secure new investment.
It is pointing out the good communications, with easy access to the
country's motorways including the M1 and M6. It is stressing that it is
surrounded with former industrial cities so there is an available supply of
cheap, skilled labour. It is trying to bring forward industrial land which
is also cheap at Pounds 100,000 an acre. Chesterfield has a business park of
seven acres, an industrial park of 23 acres and a further 17 acres of
development land on offer.
Derby has just been successful in its 'city challenge' bid for funds to
spend over five years. Some of this will be used to develop 200 acres for
office and industrial use.
It is early days in the renewed attempt to attract inward investment. But Mr
Wilding says a US concern which does not want to be named is close to
finalising a Pounds 20m deal which would provide 600 jobs. This would be a
start in demonstrating that it is not just Toyota which finds Derbyshire the
place to be.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec ministers face some tough
talking in Vienna - Output cuts are necessary if a quickening price slide is
to be averted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS FROM the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries face some
tough talking when they meet later today in Vienna. Tension between Saudi
Arabia and Iran is expected to dominate the meeting where ministers must
agree to cut oil production levels for the first quarter of next year if
they are to stop a price slide.
The organisation will also hear complaints from some smaller members that
membership fees are too high and Ecuador is likely to make moves to leave
its ranks.
'Ministers realise that a crisis is beginning to brew for Opec which is
causing a lot of heart-searching,' said Mr Joe Stanislaw, industry expert at
Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
World oil prices have already slipped as the market has become nervous at
the posturing by rival delegations in advance of the meeting. North Sea
Brent crude oil for delivery in January was steady yesterday at Dollars
19.07 1/2 a barrel after losing 30 cents a barrel on Monday.
Growing political animosity between Saudi Arabia and Iran could make
compromise on oil output difficult to reach. Iran is challenging Saudi
Arabia's leadership of Opec by its efforts to boost production capacity and
secure a bigger share of the market.
Tehran is investing Dollars 14bn to increase its oil capacity to 4.5m
barrels a day by next March. Rather than cutting its output under the terms
of Opec's last agreement in September, the republic has been demonstrating
its peak production capacity, which it says is 4m b/d.
In September, Opec countries agreed to rein in production to 24.2m b/d, with
a special allowance for Kuwait. However, most Opec nations paid only lip
service to the deal and independent estimates put present Opec output at
between 25m and 25.3m b/d.
As a consequence of the higher output, along with fears that sanctions
against Iraq may be lifted by the new US administration, allowing Baghdad to
return to the oil export market, oil prices have dropped by almost Dollars 2
a barrel since October.
Nevertheless, the producers' club remains sanguine about the prospects for
demand in the first quarter and its economists are forecasting a call on
Opec oil of 25m b/d during the first three months. Opec estimates overall
demand at 25.7m to 25.9m b/d with the rest coming from producer stocks.
Mr Ken Miller at Purvin and Gertz, the oil analysis group in Houston, Texas,
agrees with these forecasts, but puts the stock drawdown at about 1m b/d.
'The market is not awash with oil, the fundamentals do not support a Dollars
2 drop in price since October,' he said.
Mr Miller believes the market is reacting to Opec's lack of discipline in
enforcing production cuts as well as perceived disarray in the producers'
club.
For this reason traders need a clear message that producers will cut
production if prices are not to slide further.
'The mood in the market is very bearish - if there is no agreement, prices
could slide Dollars 1 to Dollars 1.50 a barrel,' said Mr Mohammed
Adbeljabbar, economist at Petroleum Finance Company in Washington.
Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister is expected to resist calls to trim
the kingdom's output. He is likely to clash with Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh,
Iran's oil minister, who has in the past called for deeper production cuts
in order to boost prices.
The power struggle between the two is not just based on short-term
production cuts, but centres on the philosophy of the organisation and the
future basis for determining oil output allocations.
Since the Gulf war, Saudi Arabia has called for member nations' production
levels to be more closely based on capacity. This would chiefly benefit the
kingdom which has increased its oil output by 3m b/d in the past couple of
years.
Iran, on the other hand, has pushed for the reinstatement of historical
production quotas while at the same time, boosting its own capacity. These
arguments will come to a head when Iraq returns to the market and other
members will have to cut back deeply to accommodate it.
But these issues are unlikely to be resolved until the sense of crisis is
more urgent than it is now.
This week's meeting could hedge a compromise by agreeing a cut of say
500,000 b/d from current production. This would involve a small cut for most
producers but a rise in September's ceiling.
There is likely to be much wrangling about how the cuts are shared out and
it is doubtful whether a cut of this amount would do much to boost prices.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Greek group suspends bauxite
production
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BAUXITES PARNASSE Mining, Greece's biggest producer of bauxite (aluminium
ore), has suspended production for three months because of a sharp decline
in sales to its traditional markets in the former Soviet Union.
The company used to sell about 400,000 tonnes of bauxite a year, much of
which was used for the manufacture of abrasives, to Razno, a Soviet state
trading company. But since the break-up of the Soviet Union, it has had to
deal directly with individual plants in the independent republics.
Bauxites Parnasse used to account for about 1 per cent of annual world
bauxite producion. But output from its mines in central Greece has slumped
from a record 1.6m tonnes in 1989 to about 1m tonnes this year.
Mr Ulysses Kyriacopoulos, the company's managing director, said: 'We have
shut down production completely until February at least. Though we're used
to keeping a large stockpile, we'd built up a huge inventory of about 2m
tonnes of bauxite, twice the normal level'.
Sales to Russia and the Ukraine will amount to only about 100,000 tonnes
this year, he said.
'Our task now is to put together deals with individual CIS processors,
taking payment in alumina (aluminium oxide), and passing it on to a smelter.
It is a much more complicated business.'
At the same time sales to Romania have fallen. Bauxites Parnasses used to
export up to 300,000 tonnes annually, which was used for producing
aluminium. As a result of Romania's severe energy shortage, however, there
have been big cuts in aluminium output over the past three years. Bauxites
Parnasse expects to sell only 100,000 tonnes of ore to Romania this year.
However, sales to western European bauxite users have not been affected, Mr
Kyriacopoulos said. Aluminium de Grece, part of the French Pechiney group,
buys 450,000 tonnes a year to help feed an aluminium smelter near Distomo in
central Greece.
Greek exporters face problems in finding alternative markets because 'hard'
Greek bauxite cannot be used by western European processors, which are
geared to producing alumina from the 'soft' bauxite mined in Africa or South
America.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zairean company's mining
problems are 'exaggerated'
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GECAMINES, ZAIRE'S state-owned copper and cobalt producer, has told its
agents and customers that reports that its output is at minimal levels and
in danger of being shut down completely are exaggerated.
Traders claim that the group has admitted that it is suffering some
production problems arising from the ethnic battles in the Shaba province,
where it is based. and shortages of foreign currency to buy spare parts and
equipment. However, Gecamines insists that its copper production this year
will be between 150,000 and 180,000 tonnes.
This is well below the target it set in March when Gecamines (Generale des
Carrieres et des Mines), which produces most of Zaire's copper and all the
country's cobalt, said it expected to sell just over 200,000 tonnes of
copper - or about 2 per cent of refined copper production in the world
outside the former eastern bloc countries - and 9,000 tonnes of cobalt this
year.
In the mid-1980s, the group's annual copper output was more than 500,000
tonnes.
Gecamines claims that the radio station that suggested the mining company
was in dire difficulties is controlled by those opposed to President Mobutu
Sese Seko, who has ruled the country with an iron hand for 27 years, and
wants to put the worst possible light on Zaire's problems.
The Reuter news agency quoted the radio station as saying that Gecamines was
threatened with closure because its main furnace was out and other plants
were just ticking over. The radio report said the crisis in Gecamines, which
provides two-thirds of Zaire's export earnings, was caused by 'bad
management' and that it needed a cash injection of Dollars 500m.
Other reports suggested that the 165,000 tonnes-a-year Lubumbashi copper
smelter had been shut down because of a spare parts shortage and that the
Luilu refinery (100,000 tonnes a year) was behind schedule, leaving
Gecamines with spare supplies of copper blister (an intermediate product).
However, a Gecamines director who had just returned from Lubumbashi said
yesterday in Brussels that operations were continuing 'as in the past'. And
traders noted that Gecamines had made recent shipments to MHO (Metallurgie
Hoboken-Overpelt) in Belgium for refining. Nevertheless, some expressed
doubts about Gecamines' copper output reaching 150,000 tonnes this year and
one said: 'These problems appear to be significant and could mean major
declines in the production of copper and cobalt over the next couple of
years'.
Japan will help China to develop mining of base metals such as copper along
the Yangtze River, starting in 1993, an official at the semi-governmental
Metal Mining Agency of Japan said yesterday, reports Reuter from Tokyo.
As a first step, the agency plans to use a satellite to find potential
mining areas. 'China is so large that it is difficult to rely only on
manpower to conduct research,' the official said.
MMAJ will pay the costs of the survey out of its 1992 development assistance
budget.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Green' pound cut lightens
farmers' blues - David Blackwell explains an EC currency move that has
lifted UK support prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEVALUATION of the 'green pound' by 7 1/2 per cent last week, added to
the cut in interest rates and increase in capital allowances announced in
the chancellor of the exchequer's autumn statement, has taken some of the
gloom out of November for UK farmers.
They feel, however, that any extra money coming their way is no more than
their due. The workings of the European Community's common agriculture
policy are such that the prices they have been guaranteed under EC
intervention schemes have remained virtually unchanged since the UK pulled
sterling out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism in September. But, as the
National Farmers' Union has been quick to point out, the price of imported
farm inputs rose immediately sterling was devalued. Regular spending on
imported feeds and fertilisers has risen as well as the cost of tractors and
other farm machinery.
At the same time food suppliers have been sounding warnings of rising
consumer costs. Mr Alan Chandler, of the UK Provision Trade Federation,
predicts 'continuing upward pressure' on food prices.
This arises not only from last week's devaluation, which halved the 14.4 per
cent gap between the green rate and the real exchange rate, but from the
further devaluation of the green pound which must follow on January 1 when
the European Single Market comes into force.
The system of green rates was designed to remove the uncertainties of the
volatile currency markets from the agriculture sector. It is used to convert
EC support prices, which are set in Ecus, to national currencies. In the
past the green rate has usually been set each year by EC farm ministers.
Cross-border, intra-community trade, however, continued at currency market
rates, so a system of 'monetary compensatory amounts' (MCAs) was designed to
iron out the difference between green rates and real exchange rates.
In simple terms, MCAs operate as subsidies or taxes on imports and exports
to eliminate the competitive distortion that would otherwise be caused by
'green' currency gaps. In Britain's case the overvaluation of the 'green
pound' has kept support prices low in real sterling terms, so MCAs have
taken the form of subsidies on imports and taxes on exports in trade with
community members with stronger currencies. But the European Single Market
will abolish border controls at the end of the year, leaving no way of
operating the system.
After last week's devaluation the UK's MCA rate, which was 12.9 per cent, is
down to 5.4 per cent. In the simplest cases this has raised the UK
intervention price (which sets a floor to the market) for common wheat from
Pounds 125.85 a tonne to Pounds 135.32 a tonne, while cutting the MCA for
cheddar cheese from Pounds 263 a tonne to Pounds 118.59.
But the actual rates applied depend on the source of the imports or
destination of the exports. Each EC member has its own MCA (unless its green
currency rate is very close to the real rate) and the MCA tax or subsidy on
a particular trade is determined by consolidating the rates applying in the
exporter's and the importer's countries.
Overall, the agriculture ministry said, the devaluation was expected to
increase food prices by less than 1 per cent. The NFU argued earlier this
month that a full green pound devaluation on January 1 would lift retail
food prices by only 'about 1 per cent.' This was because agricultural
wholesale prices, which make up only about 30 per cent of the retail price
of food, would rise by 3 per cent 'at most'.
Mr Sion Roberts, an NFU economist, also pointed out that there were plenty
of foodstuffs for which EC did not have price support regimes and were
therefore unaffected. He cited potatoes, other fruit and vegetables, and the
pig and poultry sectors.
But Britain's Food &amp; Drink Federation last week stood by its prediction
earlier this month that a full green pound devaluation in January would lift
the price of a loaf of bread by up to 2 pence, a pack of butter by 10 pence
and a bag of sugar by 6 pence. 'Unfortunately these increases are completely
beyond our control and will have some impact on high street prices,' said Mr
Michael Mackenzie, director-general of the FDF.
The NFU welcomed last week's devaluation and said it would continue to press
for the green pound gap to be fully closed by the end of the year. 'The New
Year will herald the introduction of the Single Market so it is essential
that any agrimonetary anomalies should be ironed out by then,' said Mr David
Naish, NFU president.
However, the EC's plan next year to align the green rate and the real
exchange rate at the end of each month will introduce further uncertainty
into the agricultural industry. As Mr Roberts pointed out, if the pound were
to strengthen against other European countries, the resulting revaluation at
the end of the month would be bad for farmers and good for consumers.

NICKEL prices resumed their upward trend at the London Metal Exchange
yesterday, though never challenging the highs reached on Monday. The three
months position, which touched Dollars 5,650 a tonne before selling set in
on Monday, closed yesterday at Dollars 5,557.50 a tonne up Dollars 30 on the
day. ZINC prices, having absorbed early stop-loss selling, found good mixed
buying interest. Three months zinc hit Dollars 1,051 a tonne at one point
before recovering to close at Dollars 1,064.75 a tonne, up Dollars 2.50 on
the day. It moved further ahead in kerb (after hours) trading to Dollars
1,068 a tonne. Three months ALUMINIUM continued Monday's rally to reach
Dollars 1,213 a tonne at one stage, but by the end of the kerb session
hedging sales and profit-taking had pulled it back to Dollars 1,200 a tonne,
down Dollars 6. LEAD prices softened initially in response to a 4,350-tonne
LME stocks rise, believed to represent arrivals of CIS metal. But once the
three months price had dipped to Pounds 312 a tonne, trade buying and
short-covering saw last business at Pounds 315.

FT  25 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Olympus Optical equity warrants issue
well received
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPLY and demand are coming back into line in the Japanese equity warrants
sector of the international bond markets. Yesterday's new issues confirm
that the downward trend in coupons in this niche of the market, which had
been lagging upward movements in short-term US interest rates and affecting
demand, seems to have been reversed.
Coupons are now being set at around 2 3/4 per cent, compared with the levels
of 1.5 per cent seen a month or so ago. Olympus Optical's Dollars 400m
issue, the biggest dollar equity warrants deal for almost two years, went
well according to lead-manager Yamaichi International. Traders said that
while the name and the price were right, the issue size might hit trading
performance.
The pick up in equity warrants activity in November looks like continuing,
according to bankers, who say the market has the capacity to absorb more
issues. Yamaichi International is expected to launch two other dollar equity
warrants issues today, for Matsushita Denko which will be looking for
Dollars 400m, and Nishimatsu Construction, which wants Dollars 100m. Nippon
Express is also expected to tap the market, for Dollars 400m, possibly
through Nomura International.
The Swiss franc sector of the market is also about to see some more big
deals, following those by Daiwa House Industry and Mitsubishi Oil which were
launched in mid-November. Sumitomo Rubber is expected to raise SFr200m
today, while Sharp is lined up for a SFr500m issue at the start of December.
This will equal the biggest previous equity warrants issue by a Japanese
company, which was by Kanebo in March 1989.
Among the day's other new issues, LTCB International leapt to defend the
Inter-American Development Bank's Y50bn five-year bond against widespread
allegations of mispricing. LTCB argued that while the terms looked
aggressive in Europe, this was because the Eurobond market lagged behind a
rally in the domestic yen market after pricing took place. LTCB said it was
keeping the syndicate closed to allow co-lead managers the opportunity to
sell into the far east where it had found demand.
The Nomura International-led Y50bn issue was a done deal targetted at
domestic Japanese institutions. From the issuer's point of view, Euroyen
borrowing is cheaper and the issuing process simpler than for domestic
borrowing.
Half of the FFr2.5bn domestic issue from Societe Nationale des Chemins de
Fer will be syndicated internationally, said Societe Generale, one of the
book runners. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew reopened an existing Dollars 100m 10-year
collared floater for Rabobank Nederland, adding a further Dollars 50m to
meet investor demand.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Investors continue to move money into
D-Mark bloc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY in the European government bond markets was again dominated by
tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism, with investors
continuing to shift money into the D-Mark bloc.
The strong demand for D-Mark assets pushed up German government bond prices
yesterday, despite disappointing money supply figures for October which
served to dash hopes of an imminent easing in German interest rates.
German M3 money supply grew at a seasonally adjusted annualised rate of 10.2
per cent in October - well up on the Bundesbank's target range of 3.5 to 5.5
per cent for 1992, and higher than September's figure of 9.3 per cent and
8.8 per cent for August.
While the market was disappointed with the money supply data, dealers
pointed out that the figures were distorted as a result of heavy
intervention in the foreign exchange markets during September's European
currency crisis.
The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 91.47, traded in a range of
91.37 to 91.65 and ended towards the high of the day. Dealers said interest
in the D-Mark bloc remained healthy as investors switched out of Danish and
(to a lesser extent) French government bonds.
Germany's three coalition parties agreed a package of over DM12bn in extra
public spending in eastern Germany yesterday. Mr Theo Waigel, finance
minister, said that the spending would be financed by cuts elsewhere in the
budget.
While the decision may help to prolong the life of the Treuhand
privatisation agency, it is unlikely to mean heavier-than-forecast bond
issuance, dealers said.
The yield spread of Treuhand's bond issue over 10-year Federal bonds was
unchanged.
Dutch government bonds benefited from the switch to the D-Mark bloc, ending
the day higher. The 8.25 per cent bond due June 2002 was quoted yielding
7.40 per cent, against Monday's close of 7.46 per cent, while the 10-year
Dutch-German yield spread slipped from 13 basis points to 3 basis points.
FRENCH government bonds ended the day firmer or little changed, despite
another difficult day for the French franc in the foreign exchange markets.
Dealers said there was some domestic buying of French government bonds at
the lower price levels, which helped to support the market.
The 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2002 ended with a yield of 8.26 per cent against
its opening of 8.27 per cent. In the futures market, the Matif contract rose
from 109.70 to 110.04.
ACTIVITY in the UK government bond market was dominated by the Bank of
England's gilt auction announcement. The Bank plans to sell Pounds 2.5bn of
a new 8 per cent gilt due 2003 on December 2 and the issue is expected to
take over as the new 10-year benchmark bond.
Gilt prices closed higher across the yield curve with dealers reporting some
limited foreign interest.
JAPANESE government bonds ended firmer in quiet trade, helped by slightly
lower money market rates.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 opened at 4.645 per cent and moved to
4.615 per cent before closing at 4.625 per cent. The key unsecured overnight
call rate was traded at 3 7/8 per cent, down from 3 29/32 per cent on
Friday.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to auction about Y800bn of 10-year bonds
today. Dealers expect a coupon of 4.8 per cent, down from 5 per cent at the
previous auction.
US Treasury prices firmed slightly yesterday after a successful five-year
auction helped the market rebound from early weakness related to two
stronger-than-expected economic reports.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/32 at 101
1/8 , yielding 7.524 per cent.
The two-year note was also firmer, up  1/8 at 99 31/32 , to carry a yield of
4.625 per cent.
Prices eased slightly in early trading after the Commerce Department
reported that durable goods orders jumped 3.9 per cent in October, a much
larger increase than analysts had expected.
The goods orders figures, however, are a notoriously unreliable indicator of
economic conditions and the market held its ground despite the data.
Treasuries also held up well on news that the Conference Board's index of
consumer confidence rose from 54.6 in October to 65.5 in November.
Dealers who had expected prices to drop after the confidence report were
quickly forced to buy securities to cover their short positions.
The market firmed further after the new five-year notes met good demand from
investors in the afternoon Treasury auction.

FT  25 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Greece prepares first issue
of sterling-linked bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Republic of Greece is preparing its first issue of sterling-linked
drachma-bonds for launch in mid-December. The issue is the latest in a
series of foreign currency-linked bonds designed to attract foreign
investors, writes Tracy Corrigan. This week, the Greek government is
launching a second issue of DM and dollar-linked bonds maturing in one,
three and five years. The subscription period runs today and Thursday. The
government is also considering a yen-linked issue in the new year, Mr Peter
Doukas, deputy minister of finance, said.
While the bulk of Greece's debt is concentrated in the domestic market, most
of it is short-dated. The foreign currency-linked structure has allowed the
republic to extend the maturity profile of its debt.
The withholding tax-free, bearer bonds are denominated in drachma, but the
interest and principal payments are indexed to the foreign currency.
Although Greece is a member of the European Community, the drachma is
outside the exchange rate mechanism.
Greece has increased the yields on its three-month Treasury bills by 1 1/4
per cent to 19 1/4 per cent and the yields on its six and 12-month bills by
1 1/2 per cent to 21 1/4 per cent and 23 per cent.

FT  25 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: BIS warns banks over growth
in derivatives trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE growth of trading in derivatives markets has made it impossible even for
experienced financial analysts to gauge a bank's health from its published
accounts, the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements
warned yesterday.
Pointing to the lack of transparency which has resulted from the growth of
derivatives and other off-balance sheet instruments, Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy
said: 'In turn this has rendered the nature and distribution of risks in
financial market operations much more opaque.'
Following hard on the heels of the BIS's Promisel report earlier this month
on banks' involvement in the derivatives markets, Mr Lamfalussy's comments
mark renewed attempts by the central bankers' club to focus regulatory
attention on what has become a major area of many banks' business.
Mr Lamfalussy, who was speaking at a conference in London, called for all
banks to disclose their off-balance sheet risks 'in a reasonably
standardised way.'
He acknowledged, though, that this would need 'very careful thought' over
how risks should be measured. Assumptions about market volatility, for
instance, need to be reassessed, following upheaval in financial markets in
September.
The events of September had also exposed weaknesses in banks' risk
management systems, he said.
'I have the impression that some of the volatilities experienced a couple of
months ago were of a scale which were not incorporated in the models and may
have therefore led to an unexpected erosion of liquidity in some of the
markets.'
Mr Lamfalussy also called for better statistical data on activity in
particular derivative markets.
In an apparent allusion to the possibility of future crises in derivatives
markets, Mr Lamfalussy said that the availability of data on banks'
cross-border exposures in 1982 made the handling of the Mexican debt crisis
easier.
'Data collection, however distasteful for those who would have to supply and
collect the figures, seems to me unavoidable, but only after a careful
definition of what we want to measure,' Mr Lamfalussy said.

FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Coles Myer forced to adjourn its
AGM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in Coles Myer, Australia's biggest retailing group, yesterday
adjourned the annual meeting after a dispute between the board and dissident
shareholders over directors' financial interests.
The move followed a confrontation between Mr Solomon Lew, chairman, and Mr
Laurence Gruzman, a Sydney barrister, who had sought details of transactions
involving Mr Lew's private business interests and those of other directors.
Mr Peter Bartels, chief executive, said the board needed time to prepare an
audited addendum to the group's accounts which would clarify a statement on
directors' interests released to the Australian Stock Exchange.
The statement, which followed a campaign by Mr Gruzman and the Australian
Shareholders' Association, revealed that Coles Myer paid ADollars 176m
(USDollars 120.25m) last year to companies associated with directors. It
said the payments represented less than 1 per cent of the group's
expenditure on goods and services, and were carefully monitored by
independent auditors.
The statement said the 'inference behind the questions' represented 'a
calculated and deliberate slur on the character and integrity' of the
company, its management and its professional advisers.
Mr Bartels said the decision to adjourn the meeting was not an admission
that the board had acted incorrectly.
The group said a special meeting would be scheduled before the end of the
year after the addendum had been distributed.
Before the adjournment, Mr Lew said first-quarter profits were ahead of last
year's results. 'We are confident that . . . we will outperform our previous
year's results,' he said. Coles Myer reported net profits of ADollars 370m
for the year to July 26, compared with ADollars 368m the previous year.

Sagasco

<TEXT>
SANTOS, the Australian energy group, yesterday acquired a 19.9 per cent
stake in Sagasco for ADollars 107m (USDollars 73.1m), confirming its
interest in the company in spite of the withdrawal of a ADollars 560m
takeover offer. Santos bought 41m shares from the South Australian state
government and institutions, and indicated it would seek 'suitable' board
representation.
The sale reduces the state government's holding in Sagasco to just over 51
per cent. The government put its stake up for sale in July, triggering a bid
from Santos which was dropped after legal action by competition authorities.
The case is expected to be heard in March.

FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Macquarie confident after record
first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MACQUARIE Bank, the privately-owned Australian banking and corporate
advisory group, yesterday announced a 13.6 per cent increase in interim net
profits to a record ADollars 26.6m (USDollars 18.2m) for the six months to
the end of September.
The result contrasts sharply with big full-year losses announced last week
by Westpac Banking Corporation and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group,
two of Australia's biggest banks.
Macquarie said the improved result reflected better trading conditions,
innovative products, and a reduction in write-offs against bad and doubtful
debts to ADollars 1.5m from ADollars 2.7m in the comparable period of the
previous year.
Mr Tony Berg, managing director, said the bank was confident the improved
result would be repeated in the second half. 'I am confident the economy is
going through a slow recovery,' he said.
Macquarie said total assets increased by 28.6 per cent to ADollars 3.04bn,
while group shareholders' funds rose to ADollars 299m from ADollars 272m at
the end of the last full year in March. The bank said its emphasis on
service and tailored banking products helped expand the branch-banking
business. The property, capital markets, money market and corporate services
divisions also performed well, although fixed interest profits were hit by
difficult conditions in the government and semi-government bond market.

FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Big Blue recants its mainframe
heresies - Louise Kehoe explains why IBM is placing new emphasis on
'client-server' computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANGE has become the only constant at the 'New International Business
Machines', as the computer giant overhauls its operations, cuts its
workforce and transforms itself into a decentralised 'federation of
autonomous businesses'.
The announcement this week that it is forming a business unit to focus on
'client-server' computing - in which mainframe computers are replaced by
networks of desktop computers and 'servers' providing services, information
and software - is, however, seen by some as the most fundamental shift to
date.
With its new emphasis on client-server computing, IBM has thrown out one of
its most sacred tenets; the belief that the computing world revolves around
the mainframe.
For IBM, known in the industry as 'Big Blue', this is akin to the Catholic
church's recent decision to recognise publicly the work of Galileo.
Like the church, IBM has long privately acknowledged the truth of the
matter: the mainframe is not the centre of the computer universe but merely
one of many planets.
However, by announcing an initiative to promote client-server computing, IBM
has for the first time publicly put the mainframe in its proper place.
'The mainframe may or may not fit in. It does not have a pre-ordained role
in every client-server system,' says Mr Jack Kuehler, IBM president.
The new emphasis on client-server computing does not mean, however, that IBM
has abandoned its mainframe strategy. 'This does not represent a shift away
from the mainframe,' Mr Kuehler is quick to point out.
He does not accept the notion that the 'mainframe is dead', as some of IBM's
competitors would like computer users to believe.
But rather than risk losing customers who decided to swap mainframe
computers for networks of workstations or PCs, IBM will now offer systems
integration services and software to help them move towards the new
computing model.
'We see this as an important growth opportunity,' says Mr Kuehler.
The new IBM division will focus on helping customers to 'migrate' toward
client-server computing - finding ways to link different types of computers
and optimise their performance.
The client-server computing unit will work with IBM's existing business
units, such as those that make PCs, mid-range computers and mainframes, to
design customised client-server systems for clients.
This may involve assembling hardware and software products from several IBM
businesses, or looking outside IBM to third-party suppliers.
As a last resort, the new business unit may develop 'glue' software needed
to put together client-server systems.
Although the new unit is designed to focus IBM's client-server products and
strategies, this does not signal a reversal of the company's move to
decentralise management, Mr Kuehler said.
Putting together a complex client-server system using existing computers as
well as new hardware and software 'transcends what IBM's individual lines of
business can do', he explains.
The new unit will not, however, try to dictate product strategies to IBM's
newly independent product-line business units.
Nor will it attempt to establish standard computing models, as IBM has in
the past.
Instead, IBM views the new unit as a marketing support effort that will help
to boost sales of services and software as well as the hardware provided
primarily by the company's product groups.
IBM's pragmatism reflects the computer giant's renewed efforts to respond
more rapidly to changes in the computer market and improve its financial
performance.
One measure of IBM's determination is that the new business unit was first
proposed only five weeks ago at a bi-annual meeting of executives from all
of IBM's business units.
'That is how fast we move in the 'New IBM',' Mr Kuehler boasts.

FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: TDK slips 34.5% as electronics
markets remain depressed

<TEXT>
TDK, the world's largest manufacturer of magnetic tapes, yesterday reported
a 34.5 per cent drop to Y18.17bn (Dollars 146.53m) in consolidated pre-tax
profits in the half-year to September, reflecting broad weakness in
electronics markets.
Sales at the Tokyo-based company fell 2.1 per cent to Y266.1bn, led by a 5.3
per cent decline in sales of electronic materials and components to
Y182.7bn.
TDK said that overseas demand from the automobile and computer industries
was strong.
However, sales had been hit by declining demand from manufacturers of audio
and video equipment.
The company said it had successfully increased sales to the computer
industry of products such as semiconductors and magnetic heads for hard disc
drives, metal magnets, and chip capacitors.
TDK also managed to increase sales of magnetic recording media, such as
tapes and floppy disks, by 5.7 per cent to Y83.38bn.
Sales outside Japan grew by 1.8 per cent to Y139,977 in spite of the rise in
the value of the yen, accounting for 52.6 per cent of sales.
Net earnings fell by 23.9 per cent to Y10.1bn.
On a parent company basis, TDK's results were much worse, with pre-tax
profits down by 47.6 per cent to Y11.4bn.
The weaker parent company figures reflect the softness of domestic Japanese
demand, as well as a decline in exports to Europe following the start-up of
operations at TDK's magnetic recording media factory in Luxembourg in
October last year.
TDK said it had given up hope for a recovery in the second half of the year.
It added that it had lowered its projection for full-year parent-company
pre-tax profits to Y20bn, compared with Y33.4bn last year.

FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Boeing to reduce its aircraft
production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING, the US aerospace company, plans to reduce the production rate for
the 757 and 767 aircraft, two of its commercial airline models, with the
loss of about 2,500 jobs next year.
The group put the blame on the soft market for new aircraft.
'Our customers' delivery needs are changing as a result of the difficult
time many of them are having,' said Mr Dean Thornton, president of Boeing's
commercial aircraft group.
'We are adjusting our rates to meet their needs,' he added.
Many of the world's airlines have been making losses, and the large US
aircraft industry, battling against overcapacity and severe fare wars, has
lost more than Dollars 7bn during the past three years.
Boeing did not attribute the production cuts to any particular order change,
but said they reflected 'the cumulative recent requests of a number of our
customers for changes in their delivery streams'.
Under the new production programme, Boeing will reduce the 757 production
rate from 8.5 aircraft a month, to seven a month in June 1993, and then cut
this to five a month in November 1993.
The company, which stepped up the production rate of 757s from seven a month
last January, had planned to push the rate back to this level in September
1993.
Meanwhile, the rate for 767s will be trimmed from five a month to four a
month in November 1993.
Boeing said that the changes to the production schedule would probably mean
the loss of 5,000 jobs on the west coast and about 500 in Wichita, Kansas.
Boeing is expected to have reduced its Seattle workforce by about 6,500
people this year. The company currently employs about 84,000 people in its
commercial aircraft division, and some 134,000 people worldwide.
Aerolineas Argentinas, the airline run by Spain's Iberia, plans to cut about
1,300 people from its staff of 7,800, Reuter reports from Buenos Aires.
'The reductions will be made over an indefinite period of time, Aerolineas
said.
'We'll talk everything over with our unions; we won't just dump hundreds of
people out on the street,' the airline added.
Two years ago the Argentine government turned an 85 per cent stake in its
airline over to a consortium led by Iberia in a deal involving Dollars 260m
cash and Dollars 2bn in Argentine debt paper.
Due to a dispute over payments between Argentina and the consortium in July,
the government had to take back part of the airline's shares to save the
privatisation deal from foundering.

FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Bank of Montreal rises 7.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP increase in provisions for sour property and mining loans held Bank
of Montreal to a 7.5 per cent rise in net earnings and a slight drop in
return on equity for the 12 months ended October 1992.
BMO, which is the first of Canada's big banks to report fiscal 1992 results,
posted net income of CDollars 639.6m (USDollars 507.6m), or CDollars 4.76 a
share, up from CDollars 595m, or CDollars 4.63, in fiscal 1991.
Fourth-quarter earnings dipped to CDollars 159.7m, or CDollars 1.17, from
CDollars 175.9m, or CDollars 1.35.
Loan losses for the year are estimated at CDollars 550m, up from CDollars
337m.
Non-performing loans jumped to CDollars 2.2bn on October 31 from CDollars
1.3bn a year earlier, due largely to the classification of what the bank
described as three large real estate accounts, including Olympia &amp; York, as
non-accrual.
The bank said that the higher loan losses were offset by increased market
share and higher productivity. Non-interest expenses rose by 6 per cent, but
this included a 21 per cent rise in various government levies.
BMO has gained a name over the past two years as being the first Canadian
bank to announce cuts in its prime lending rate.
Total assets stood at CDollars 109bn on October 31.

FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Westinghouse bites the bullet -
Problems at the Pittsburgh-based conglomerate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DRASTIC restructuring announced this week by Westinghouse Electric has
softened, but far from eliminated, a chorus of criticism over the running of
this fallen giant of US industry.
Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse, a 106-year-old conglomerate with interests
ranging from electrical power generating equipment to radio and television
stations, has been dogged for the past two years by severe problems in its
financial services arm, mainly the result of poor real estate investments.
On Monday, facing growing pressure from institutional shareholders and
mounting concern about its finances on Wall Street, it finally bit the
bullet and announced plans to get out of financial services, cut its
dividend, take a Dollars 1.13bn after-tax charge and sell off several other
businesses to bolster its balance sheet.
The action, insisted Mr Paul Lego, chairman, would allow Westinghouse to
'put our financial services problems behind us'. That may prove so, yet Mr
Lego still faces the problem of a lacklustre economic environment and
criticism from shareholder groups over management's style and strategies.
Indeed, this week's action was prompted in part by the targetting of
Westinghouse by the US corporate governance movement - activist
institutional investors which want a greater say in the running of poorly
performing companies.
While the restructuring will be welcomed by these groups, it seems unlikely
to stop them pressing their much wider reform agenda.
Ms Nell Minow, of Lens Inc, a small investment group which also includes Mr
Robert Monks, a leading corporate governance activist, describes
Westinghouse's action as a 'real positive step forward', but probably not
enough to make shareholders withdraw their resolutions.
Westinghouse's problems go back to the 1980s when the company, fearing
hostile takeovers, pushed for short-term profits. It sold off dozens of
subsidiaries (some to purchasers who crowed about turning the businesses
around) and let slide its research, development and capital spending.
The result was strong earnings growth through much of the decade, with a key
role played by its fast-growing financial services operation, which invested
heavily in property and leveraged buy-outs.
But, in 1990, the financial services bubble burst as US property prices
collapsed and many of Westinghouse's investments were exposed as highly
speculative.
Over the past two years the company had already taken some Dollars 2.8bn of
write-offs in its financial services arm, and the Westinghouse strategy was
to run the property portfolio down over five years.
But Wall Street concern over its property exposure prompted a crisis of
financial confidence. Credit rating agencies kept down-grading its debt,
which shut it out of the commercial paper market and made it dependent on a
depleting line of bank credit. No longer could Mr Lego tough it out.
The result will be a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge of Dollars 2.65bn for
losses in financial services and the cost of running the division until its
assets can be sold off.
Westinghouse will partly offset this through the sale, for an expected
Dollars 800m, of four businesses: Westinghouse Electric Supply, which
distributes electrical products; Westinghouse Communities, a property
developer; Knoll International, which makes office furniture; and its
distribution and control business, a supplier to the construction industry.
Westinghouse's size will be cut by about one-third, with revenues dropping
from Dollars 12.8bn last year to about Dollars 8.4bn.
Mr Lego says the company will focus on five businesses: electronic control
systems;
environmental systems; electrical generating equipment; cooling equipment
for trucks; and broadcasting.
However, Wall Street analysts and dissident shareholders say this leaves
three large question marks over the future of the company:
How good is management?
Mr Lego been much criticised by some shareholders for an isolated management
style and being too fond of blaming economic circumstances for the company's
problems.
But Ms Minow says: 'Inside Westinghouse I think there is a company Mr Lego
can do a superb job with.'
Mr Lego has now created an eight-man management committee and a four-member
president's office. But critics say there is no fresh blood.
Does the shake-up go far enough ?
With many Westinghouse businesses in sectors which move with the economy,
analysts say more fat must go. How should it improve its corporate
governance?
Some institutions have been gunning for Westinghouse since the company
pushed through fat executive pay increases at the start of 1991, just before
a huge property related write-off.
Proposals for next year's annual meeting include ending the company's
anti-takeover poison pill, tying compensation more to performance, and
splitting the job of chief executive and chairman.
It has not been lost on shareholders that the board is advised by Mr Ira
Millstein, a New York attorney who advised the General Motors board last
April, when it staged a coup. But for now there are no signs of such drastic
action in Pittsburgh.

FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Ottawa props up Canadian
Airlines

<TEXT>
THE Canadian government is providing CDollars 50m (USDollars 39.6m) to prop
up Canadian Airlines International while talks continue on a contentious
alliance between the ailing Calgary-based airline and American Airlines of
Dallas.
The funds fall far short of the CDollars 290m in federal and provincial
government loan guarantees sought by PWA Corp, Canadian's parent company, to
fulfil conditions set by American.
However, the support is likely to be sufficient to keep Canadian flying
until at least Christmas. Canadian is in a furious battle for survival with
its rival, Air Canada. The two carriers are losing about CDollars 2m a day
between them.
Mr Jean Corbeil, transport minister, indicated yesterday that Ottawa was
unhappy with some aspects of American Airlines' proposal, which was
presented to the government earlier this month by Mr Rhys Eyton, PWA's
chairman, and a group of PWA employees.
Mr Corbeil said that conditions set by American 'raise for the government a
number of difficult issues', including federal budget constraints and an
unwillingness to expose taxpayers to imprudent financial risk.
American has proposed investing CDollars 246m in PWA for a 25 per cent
equity stake, the maximum allowed by law. PWA employees would contribute
another CDollars 100m-CDollars 150m.
However, the US carrier has demanded a veto over PWA's business plan, the
appointment of its chief executive and any sizeable capital outlay or
acquisition.
The most contentious issue is American's demand that Canadian join
American's Sabre computerised reservation system, abandoning its links with
the Gemini system which it shares with Air Canada.
The government's dilemma is reinforced by the political overtones of the
airline battle. With its base in Calgary, PWA is a flagship of western
Canadian business. Air Canada's head office is in Quebec. Offending either
region could cost the ruling Conservative party dearly in next year's
general election.

PERU has taken an important step towards settling a series of US lawsuits
filed by international bank creditors more than two years ago, paving the
way for restructuring about Dollars 10bn of outstanding external debt and
interest, writes Alan Friedman in New York.
The lawsuits, launched by more than 200 banks, and seeking to recover more
than Dollars 2bn of debts, were filed to meet a US statute of limitations
deadline.
*****
Citibank, which chairs Peru's debt advisory committee, this week announced
an agreement under which the banks would withdraw their lawsuits if the
Peruvian government dropped its concerns about the statute of limitations on
legal claims by the creditor banks. Both sides said they would try to
resolve the dispute by next April 15.

The Walt Disney Company, the entertainment group, and Nestle, the
Swiss-based foods company, are to enter a long-term alliance for licensing,
sponsorship and marketing purposes. The new accord, which marks the latest
development in an expanding international partnership, calls for Nestle to
sponsor a pavillion at Disney's Epcot Center in Florida as well as a sponsor
at Disneyland Park and the Walt Disney World Resort.

Upjohn, the US drugs group, said it was informed by the US Food and Drug
Administration that after a year-long probe, the agency has determined that
no further action is warranted regarding the Upjohn drug Halcion, Reuter

A SHARP increase in provisions for sour property and mining loans held Bank
of Montreal to a 7.5 per cent rise in net earnings and a slight drop in
return on equity for the year ended October 1992.
BMO, which is the first of Canada's big banks to report fiscal 1992 results,
posted net income of CDollars 639.6m (USDollars 507.6m), or CDollars 4.76 a
share, up from CDollars 595m, or CDollars 4.63, in fiscal 1991.
Fourth-quarter earnings dipped to CDollars 159.7m, or CDollars 1.17, from
CDollars 175.9m, or CDollars 1.35.
Loan losses for the year are estimated at CDollars 550m, up from CDollars
337m.
Non-performing loans jumped to CDollars 2.2bn on October 31 from CDollars
1.3bn a year earlier, due largely to the classification of what the bank
described as three large real estate accounts, including Olympia &amp; York, as
non-accrual.
The bank said that the higher loan losses were offset by increased market
share and higher productivity. Non-interest expenses rose by 6 per cent, but
this included a 21 per cent rise in various government levies.
BMO has gained a name over the past two years as being the first Canadian
bank to announce cuts in its prime lending rate.
Total assets stood at CDollars 109bn on October 31.
DEN Danske Bank, Denmark's largest bank, was downgraded by Standard &amp;
Poor's, the US credit rating agency, because of high loan losses and a large
exposure to Denmark's troubled insurance groups, writes Hilary Barnes in
Copenhagen
The rating on the bank's senior long-term debt and certificates of deposit
went from A plus to A and a Dollars 150m subordinated note issue went from A
minus to BBB plus.

BETHLEHEM Steel, the second biggest US steel group, has signed a letter of
intent to sell most of its bar, rod and wire operations to Ispat Mexicana, a
member of the Calcutta-based Ispat Group.
Under the terms of the deal, Ispat will acquire the entire operations apart
from the Johnstown wire mill, which Bethlehem has agreed to sell to TMB
Industries of Chicago.
Bethlehem said Ispat planned to follow a modernisation programme which would
essentially follow Bethlehem's earlier plans, including installing a
continuous caster and a rod block at the local plant to increase efficiency
and production capability. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
The bar, rod and wire operations bring in less than 10 per cent of
Bethlehem's annual sales of roughly Dollars 4bn.
Bethlehem said most of the bar, rod and wire operations were being sold as a
unit to preserve as many jobs as possible.

PROFIT growth at Nestle, the world's largest foods group, is slowing in the
second half, Mr Helmut Maucher, chairman, said yesterday.
Mr Maucher said the group could not maintain the 16.5 per cent level of
profit growth achieved in the first half as recession deepened in many of
its markets, but the result would still be 'satisfactory'.
Sales would probably grow 9 per cent to SFr55m (Dollars 38.22m) this year.
In the first 10 months, sales were up 8.3 per cent to SFr44.3bn, but volume
growth, which was running at 3 per cent in the first half, slumped to 2.3
per cent in the 10 months, mainly due to a steep decline in sales in Brazil.
The Swiss franc's rise against most other currencies eliminated foreign
exchange gains. Source Perrier, consolidated since July 1, contributed
SFr800m in the four months to October 31.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors, the embattled US carmaker, suffered an embarrassing and
potentially costly financial blow yesterday when Moody's Investors Service,
the credit information agency, lowered its ratings of the company's debt.
The downgrade, which will tend to raise GM's borrowing costs, will be felt
particularly hard by General Motors Acceptance Corporation, GM's huge
financial services arm.
It relies on the short-term commercial paper market as an important source
of cheap funds, which it then uses to offer financing on GM vehicle sales.
Its commercial paper rating has fallen from Prime-1, the very top rating, to
Prime-2, which will push up the interest rates GMAC has to pay to sell its
paper and may make it harder to place the securities.
A dramatic reshuffle of GM's top management at the start of this month was
prompted in part by boardroom concern that the two leading credit
information agencies - Moody's and Standard &amp; Poors - might be about to
lower the company's ratings. Standard &amp; Poors is still considering its
position.
The upheaval included the resignation under pressure of Mr Robert Stempel,
GM's chairman, and the formation of a much younger management team led by Mr
Jack Smith, the new chief executive.
Moody's downgrade also includes GM's senior debt, which is lowered from
Single A-2 status to Baa1 and its preference stock, which falls from Single
A-3 to Baa3.
GM is being forced to cut production at its Belgian car assembly plant in
Antwerp in the face of 'declining prospects' for new car sales in western
Europe, writes Kevin Done.
GM said it would eliminate 13 production days during the first four months
of 1993 at the Antwerp plant, which can produce 407,000 cars a year.

<TEXT>
HACHETTE, the heavily indebted French media group, has revised the terms of
its proposed merger with Matra, the defence electronics company also
controlled by the Lagardere family, and finalised plans for its own FFr900m
(Dollars 165.5m) capital increase.
Under the new merger terms the shareholders in Matra, which has proved more
robust than the loss-making Hachette over the past year, will receive 13 of
the latter's shares for every five of their existing shares.
This represents a marked improvement over the original merger terms in which
Matra's investors would have been given five Hachette shares for two shares
in the defence electronics group. Matra's shareholders will receive a
package of shares in Hachette worth just over FFr1,240 for Matra shares
worth FFr973.50
Since the announcement of the original terms Hachette has continued to
perform poorly. It has also discovered the extent of its exposure to La
Cinq, the French television station that collapsed earlier this year, in
which it was the managing shareholder with 25 per cent of the equity.
A French court on Monday ruled that Hachette had to inject FFr100m into La
Cinq. Hachette has already made provisions of FFr3.54bn to cover its
liabilities on the station. Mr Philippe Camus, chairman of MMB, Hachette's
main shareholder, said yesterday that these provisions were 'more than
adequate'.
Mr Camus also disclosed the final terms of Hachette's proposed capital
increase. The company plans to raise FFr900m by issuing 11.8m shares at
FFr76.30 each. The price of the issue compares with Hachette's suspended
share price of FFr95.40.
Hachette's shares are expected to resume trading on the Paris stock market
today after being suspended on Monday pending yesterday's announcement. The
shares of Matra and MMB were also suspended on Monday at FFr194.70 and FFr82
respectively.

FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Accor sees disposals as key to
reduced gearing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOR, the French hotels-to-luncheon vouchers group, is to slow its pace of
expansion and make up to FFr3bn (Dollars 551m) of disposals by the end of
1994 to reduce its gearing to less than 100 per cent.
Mr Paul Dubrule, co-chairman, said in London yesterday that the group's
profits would fall to FFr800m this year, compared with FFr948.6m in 1991.
Accor - which over the past two years has acquired Wagons-Lits, the Belgian
travel company, and Motel 6, the US hotel chain - puts its current gearing
at 111 per cent.
Mr Dubrule said the group expected to announce within the next 15 days that
it had sold Wagons-Lits' French motorway restaurants business to an unnamed
European buyer for more than FFr500m. The European Commission last April
instructed Accor to sell the restaurants because they would have given the
group too dominant a position.
Mr Dubrule said Accor would sell Europcar, its vehicle rental company, if it
did not achieve profitability by next year. Europcar is a joint venture with
Volkswagen.
He said Accor would seek substantial savings through greater use of its
subsidiaries' joint buying power. As the owner of travel agencies, Accor was
a large customer of carriers such as Air France and British Airways, who in
turn used the group's hotels. It would use this dual position to gain better
deals from airlines.
Sellers of the company's luncheon vouchers were working more closely with
Accor's corporate catering arm. If customers did not want luncheon vouchers,
sales staff were now suggesting they look at the group's catering services.
Mr Dubrule said that although Accor still wanted to expand, the growth of
its hotel network would be considerably slower than in previous years.

FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: VW may cut payout as domestic
market tumbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, western Europe's leading car supplier, yesterday hinted that it
may cut its dividend this year after a sharp downturn in the three months to
September 30.
Group net profit had risen almost 3 per cent in the first half. The fall in
the third quarter, however, left the nine-month profits figure at DM549m
(Dollars 342.69m), 13 per cent lower than in the same period last year.
The main source of the setback was a 27 per cent drop in earnings at the
German parent company, which has suffered, in common with other companies
reporting in the past week, from depression in the domestic market.
VW said prospects for fourth-quarter profits would be 'drastically worsened'
by recent European devaluations against the D-Mark and deteriorating
conditions in almost all markets.
'This development will also have a negative influence on our dividend
payment for 1992,' it added. The group last year paid DM11 on ordinary
shares and DM12 on preference stock.
Last weekend's 6 per cent devaluation of the peseta and escudo - not taken
into account in the report - can be expected to reduce translated profits
from Spain and Portugal, which have recently recorded marked sales
increases, according to the company.
The slump in profits came despite an increase in group turnover for the
period under review of 12 per cent to DM63.6bn and a 7.5 per cent increase
in deliveries. Group output rose more than 9 per cent to 2.6m vehicles.
Seat, VW's Spanish subsidiary, produced 17 per cent more vehicles, and Audi,
the quality car division, increased output by 13 per cent.
The group, which is already implementing a plan to reduce its payroll by
12,500 over the next five years, said two plants, employing around 11 per
cent of the workforce, would work short-time for two weeks around the end of
the year because of falling orders.
Depressed international conditions have also prompted VW to slow its
ambitious investment programme. Spending of DM6.7bn at the nine-month mark
was almost 9 per cent lower than a year earlier and most of that was
invested in Seat.
Separately yesterday, VW's 125,000 German workers accepted a two-stage pay
deal which will give them a 4.9 per cent rise for the 12 months from
November 1, to be followed by a 3.5 per cent increase for the next nine
months.

profit

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL, the German tyre company, yesterday predicted that it would make
a 'significant profit' for the 1992 year.
Continental also said that profits for the first nine months of this year
were considerably ahead of the same period last year, despite a noticeable
slowdown in the third quarter. But the company released no actual profit
figures.
In the first nine months of the year, group sales climbed by 3.9 per cent to
DM7.2bn (Dollars 4.5bn), the company said yesterday. Sales were on course to
reach DM9.7bn for the 12 months, against DM9.38bn last year.
Growth in turnover would have been higher but for currency movements and the
deterioration in the world economy, the Hanover-based company said. The
group had been expecting to achieve turnover of DM10bn this year.
Last year, the group made net losses of DM128.2m, which was turned round to
a profit of DM118m in the first six months of the current year. Yesterday's
letter to shareholders from the company's management board said that
third-quarter results were not up to the level achieved in the first half
because of the economic downturn in Germany and abroad.
Despite the slowdown, Continental said it foresaw no serious business
difficulties in the rest of the year, although the business environment
would become steadily more difficult in 1993. This would slow down the
group's efforts to increase profitability.
It said that General Tire, its loss-making subsidiary in the US, had managed
to halve its losses during the first nine months, as planned. Sales had held
up at the level of the previous year, at Dollars 1bn in local currency
terms, although this represented a fall of 8 per cent to DM1.58bn in D-Mark
terms. General Tire was likely to benefit from the anticipated revival of
the US economy and was on course to make a profit next year, Continental
said.
The group said it would use every opportunity to compensate for an
anticipated downturn in sales to domestic vehicle manufacturers by stepping
up its export business and sales of replacement tyres.

way

<TEXT>
THE FIRST move in a widely-expected restructuring of the troubled Finnish
banking system was made yesterday when Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's
leading commercial bank, announced plans to take over STS-Bank, the
country's sixth-largest bank.
As part of the deal, KOP and the government guarantee fund are to set up a
new company to shoulder STS's problem loan portfolio of some FM2.2bn
(Dollars 430m).
KOP is paying FM75m to take over 67 per cent of STS from the STS Foundation
immediately, and will then make a public offer for the remaining shares.
It will also invest a further FM50m for a 10 per cent stake in the company
taking over STS's problem loans, with the government guarantee fund
injecting FM450m for the balance.
Mr Pertti Voutilainen, chief executive, said KOP would strengthen its
presence in the household sector by acquiring STS. It will take over FM10bn
in loans from STS and FM7.5bn in deposits.
He added: 'The co-operation now agreed is a significant start to the
elimination of excess capacity in the Finnish banking sector. It will not
solve all the problems in this field, but it is a step in the right
direction.'
KOP expects to close all but 10 to 15 of STS's 100 branch network.
Both banks have been badly hit by the severe Finnish recession and high
credit losses. KOP reported a FM2.53bn loss for the first eight months and
STS a FM281m loss.
The government guarantee fund has already announced plans to merge Skopbank,
which had to be rescued by the state last year, and the Savings Bank of
Finland as part of a streamlining of the banking sector.

FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Reorganisation puts Kalamazoo into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KALAMAZOO, the computer services and printed systems group, slipped into the
red during the first half as it reorganised its unprofitable printed product
businesses.
The pre-tax deficit for the six months to September 30 1992 was Pounds
86,000 compared with profits of Pounds 1.54m at the same stage of the
previous year.
The Birmingham-based group has switched its year-end to March so that the
comparable figures for 1991 have been extracted from management accounts and
do not contain the results of US, Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries
sold in the last period for which it announced figures - covering the eight
months to March 1992.
Despite the deficit, an uncovered interim dividend of 0.25p, down from
0.525p, is declared.
The total distribution for the eight months to last March was 1.4p.
Earnings per share fell from 2.7p to nil.
Both the computer services and printed systems divisions kept up turnover,
bringing the overall total to Pounds 27.6m (Pounds 26.5m).
But while computer services saw operating profits decline slightly from
Pounds 1.97m to Pounds 1.78m, printed systems incurred an operating loss of
Pounds 442,000 against profits of Pounds 626,000.
The printed systems side has been weeding out unprofitable businesses - a
rationalisation which cost 70 jobs and led to reorganisation costs of Pounds
800,000.
Kalamazoo has withdrawn from the Polish market after operating losses in the
last six months of Pounds 110,000.
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 850,000 related to a provision against
money due from the buyer of Live Free or Die Software, the group's former US
subsidiary.
The group expects to finish the year in the black, helped by a seasonal
boost for printed systems and an upturn after Christmas in new business for
computer services.
Directors warned, however, of 'the continuing uncertainty that surrounds our
marketplace.'

Mainly as a result of progress made in reducing the cost base, The Guardian
and Manchester Evening News doubled its half time pre-tax profit.
From turnover Pounds 1.67m ahead at Pounds 94.2m, the six months ended
September 26 1992 produced a profit of Pounds 14.7m, against Pounds 7m last
time.
Results for the rest of the year were expected to reflect a continuation of
the severe recessionary conditions.

FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Drayton Cons 0.5p terminal dividend
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Drayton Consolidated, the investment trust which is in the throes of being
reorganised, yesterday announced a terminal dividend of 0.5p.
Invesco MIM, Drayton's fund manager, recently paid the trust's shareholders
Pounds 9.5m compensation. This related to Drayton's exposure in a
near-Pounds 40m loan made by Invesco MIM to Alma Holdings, the Scottish
confectionery company which collapsed earlier this year.
Drayton shareholders never fully knew the extent of exposure, in part
because as new loans were being extended old ones were being written down.
The settlement of 85p cash per share is part of a package which is also
intended to create a new investment trust, Second Consolidated, with net
asset value of 158p per share.

Mounting losses continued to plague BBB Design, the USM-quoted marketing and
media services company, in the year to April 30.
At the pre-tax level the deficit increased from Pounds 246,000 to Pounds
389,000. That was struck after interest payable of Pounds 26,000 (nil) and
an exceptional charge of Pounds 65,000 relating to property write-downs.
Turnover fell by Pounds 866,000 to Pounds 1.65m and after a tax credit of
Pounds 49,000 (Pounds 16,000) losses per share came out at 4.11p (2.78p).
Mr Philip O'Donnell, chairman and chief executive, is to seek shareholder
approval to introduce Pounds 200,000 in instalments between now and March
1993 by way of a loan to the group.

FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Associates behind 38% rise at IAWS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IAWS, the Dublin-based food, fertiliser and agriproducts company, reported a
38 per cent increase to IPounds 7.85m (Pounds 8.47m) in annual pre-tax
profits helped by a near-Pounds 1m increase in the contribution from
associated companies.
The return for the year to July 31 was struck on sales just 5 per cent
higher at IPounds 398.8m.
IAWS said the profits advance confirmed the benefits of the acquisition of
RH Hall, the animal feeds supplier purchased in September 1990 and included
for 11 months in 1991.
The company, owner of well-known Irish names such as Bolands Flour Mills and
Shamrock, boosted the associates' contribution from IPounds 498,000 to
IPounds 1.4m. During the year the company increased its holding in two
associates - Northern Ireland-based John Thompson and Irish Pride Bakeries -
to 50 per cent.
Tight control of working capital helped to cut debt by Pounds 12m to Pounds
19.7m. Gearing was 46 per cent.
The final dividend is held at 1p for a maintained total of 2p. Earnings were
up 33 per cent to 6.5p.

THE WITHDRAWAL of sterling from the ERM, together with a substantial
downturn in activity in the closing quarter, left pre-tax profits of H Young
Holdings 24 per cent lower at Pounds 772,000 for the year to September 30.
The final dividend is cut to 1p (4p) leaving a halved total of 3p. The
shares slipped 5p to 42p.
Sales were marginally down at Pounds 30.9m (Pounds 31.4m) - the group
distributes spectacles and automotive products. Sales for the first nine
months were 7 per cent up on the previous year.
Overall, gross margins were maintained and operating profits showed a 5.5
per cent increase over 1990-91. The directors said sterling's withdrawal
from the ERM caused profits to be lower by Pounds 100,000.
Interest charges rose to Pounds 454,000 (Pounds 152,000). Earnings per share
emerged at 3.5p (4.4p).

FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Racing cars of little help when Dwyer is on
the line - The career of Desmond Bloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RESIGNATION from Dwyer of Mr Desmond Bloom, one of the more colourful
property entrepreneurs of the 1980s, closes a chapter in a remarkable
career.
Dwyer, a former shell company, briefly became the best performing share on
the UK stock market before its value plummeted as the property market
collapsed.
It announced on Monday that Mr Bloom is being replaced as chief executive by
Mr Joey Esfandi, who is one of Dwyer's largest - and most critical -
shareholders. Mr Peter Andrews, who like Mr Esfandi is a director of
Winglaw, a private property company, will also join the Dwyer board. Mr
Anthony Kirwan, a Dwyer director will become the new non-executive chairman.
While the board changes were of little interest to the stock market, which
left Dwyer's share price unchanged, Mr Bloom's departure is illustrative of
a broader trend in the market. Small, financially-stretched property
companies such as Dwyer, which has a market value of less than Pounds 5m,
are under increasing pressure from investors to cut costs. Property
deal-makers, such as Mr Bloom, who prospered in the frothy property market
of a few years ago are struggling to justify their salaries.
Mr Bloom, who resigned at a board meeting on Saturday, was born in
Whitechapel, east London. His early history included stints as a guitarist
in a rock band, a boxer and a minder to Screaming Lord Sutch, leader of the
Monster Raving Loony Party. He became involved in the property industry in
the early 1970s and entered the public arena in the mid-1980s when he took
over Dwyer, a troubled Irish textile group, and turned it into a property
company.
Dwyer expanded rapidly on the back of a rising property market and its share
price rose sharply in the first half of 1987. Since then, however, its
fortunes have deteriorated rapidly.
Its share price has fallen from a peak of 400p in 1987 to 19p. It is on
course for a pre-tax loss of some Pounds 1.4m for the year to September 30.
Its gearing stands at an estimated 200 per cent. In an effort to secure
survival, the convertible preference shares have been converted to ordinary
shares.
Dwyer's change of fortune was not accompanied by a conspicuous scaling-down
of its expenses. The company continued to run a racing car, the chairman
took delivery of a new Bentley and although the directors cut their salaries
by 10 per cent, Mr Bloom's salary exceeded Pounds 250,000.
Mr Bloom is happy to defend this expenditure. The racing car paid its way
and earned goodwill at race meetings, he says.
If the order for the Bentley, which had been ordered in better times, had
been cancelled, a Pounds 50,000 deposit would be forfeited. His salary was,
in part, making up for his forbearance in his early years in the company
when he took no salary.
But in recent weeks, as the figures for the last financial year were
collated, he recognised that his salary and associated expenses - including
a Mayfair office - could no longer be justified while Dwyer had no prospect
of trading profits.
For this reason, Mr Bloom agreed to step down and invited Mr Esfandi to
replace him. Mr Bloom, who says he has no regrets about leaving, says he
will either try to build up a property portfolio on his own account, take
over a shell company or take up an offer to become the chief executive of
another quoted company.
Meanwhile, Mr Esfandi promised stringent cost cutting and active management
of the portfolio. 'We have achieved board representation in order to protect
and enhance our investment in the company.'
'Our goal is to return the company to profitability and to restore the
dividend.'

FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Apollo Metals shows 38% drop to Pounds
1.26m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APOLLO METALS, the Birmingham-based aluminium distribution and processing
group, is maintaining its dividend in spite of a 38 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits in the year to September 30.
On turnover down from a restated Pounds 27m to Pounds 23.4m, profits
declined to Pounds 1.26m (Pounds 2.03m).
The figures, broadly in line with City expectations, translated into
fully-diluted earnings per share of 6p, against 10.3p. The proposed final
dividend of 2.3p maintains the total at 3.45p.
Over the past year Apollo has been hurt by recession in the UK (although the
market appears to have stopped declining in the second half), the general
downturn in aero-space industry demand and the impact of lower metal prices,
largely caused by the stream of aluminium sales from Russia.
On the domestic market the group sought with some success to maintain
margins by offering leading customers such as British Aerospace and Land
Rover a 'just-in-time' service and progress-ively to provide materials
management rather than mere stock delivery. This has involved more metal
pro-cessing.
But, at the same time, it has been expanding into France and Germany, the
costs of which clipped Pounds 200,000 from the pre-tax line.
This expansion added an extra workload to the Birmingham operations, raising
costs through the introduction of two-shift working and demanding
accumulation of extra inventory.
The effect was also to raise gearing from 7 per cent to 19 per cent.
However, the French and German operations are expected to trade profitably
this year and, through the expansion of their opera-tions, take some of the
financial strain off the UK. This would suggest a profits increase in
1992-93 provided the UK market does not decline.
Mr Bob Teare, chairman, is retiring and will be succeeded by Mr Albert
Hargreaves, the deputy chairman.

FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Evans of Leeds 6% higher at Pounds 3.67m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVANS OF Leeds, the family-controlled north of England-based property
company, shrugged off depressed conditions in the property market with a 6.4
per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.67m for the six months
ended September 30.
Turnover rose to Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 9.33m). The rent roll stood at Pounds
19m on an annualised basis compared with Pounds 18m in the year to March.
Mr John Humphries, chairman, said the results were 'very satisfactory' given
the difficult market conditions. In the past, the company has remained
relatively immune from the recession because it has negligible exposure to
property investments in the south of England, and through its focus on
pre-let projects.
The interim dividend is lifted by 10 per cent to 1.43p from earnings per
share of 4.28p (3.95p).
Mr Ian Hartwell, finance controller, said Evans was experiencing good demand
for its industrial property.
The company also announced the launch of a further Pounds 75m offering of
33-year 11 per cent debentures, secured on a portfolio of 66 properties. The
issue, arranged by NatWest Capital Markets, was placed with UK institutional
investors.
The money raised will be used to refinance borrowings and provide funds for
the expansion of the group's property portfolio.

resumed production.
Both Sharps and Strines, the other printing divisions, are working for
Walsden, but there will be some disruption to Walsden deliveries and sales

FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Dawson Intl dips to Pounds 15.5m: Clothing
group sounds cautious note on trading outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAWSON International, one of Britain's biggest clothing manufacturers,
yesterday sounded a cautious note over the trading outlook as it reported a
4 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits, from Pounds 16.2m to Pounds
15.5m.
Mr Ronald Miller, chairman, said: 'I see no easing of recessionary
pressures, which have adversely impacted the half year. Although in time
there should be benefits from lower interest rates and more favourable
foreign exchange rates in the UK, these have to be set against an
international background with more countries experiencing the effects of
recession.'
Turnover in the six months to September 30 fell from Pounds 217m to Pounds
211m.
The profits figure was depressed by a write-down of Pounds 1m on the Pringle
factory in Dumfries, which has been closed with the loss of 205 jobs.
The premier brands division raised operating profits from Pounds 7.4m to
Pounds 9.8m. The group said that against a background of lower cashmere
prices, its Joseph Dawson subsidiary was particularly strong. Todd &amp; Duncan
was also positioned to benefit from the better cashmere market and Laidlaw &amp;
Fairgrieve had increased volumes in both lambswool and shetland yarns.
Sales of international apparel responded well, despite the difficult trading
environment. Ballantyne Cashmere experienced better trading and Pringle of
Scotland increased turnover.
The consumer products division experienced a difficult time, particularly in
the US, with operating profit down Pounds 4m to Pounds 8.5m. Sales of West
Knitting fleecewear fell as retailers cut stocks.
In the US, the JE Morgan heavyweight underwear business continued to perform
well, in spite of slower ordering by retailers. Sales of lightweight
underwear were lower, but margins improved because of better operating
efficiencies.
Earnings per share were 6.5p (6.4p). The interim dividend is held at 2.9p.
COMMENT
Currency movements have crucial significance for a group which makes about
50 per cent of its sales in the US, exports 25 per cent to Europe and Japan
and reckons that about a third of the remaining UK business is
tourist-related. These results would have been Pounds 400,000 higher if the
dollar had remained at last year's levels. However, the pound's devaluation
should spell good news for the group in the longer term. Full-year profits
are forecast to reach Pounds 33m, which would put the shares, down 3p to
224p, on a prospective multiple of about 18. That already anticipates a
profits recovery, which may be delayed by the gloomy international outlook.

<TEXT>
THE BANK of Scotland said yesterday that it will recapitalise Countrywide
Bank next month by taking up a 3-for-2 cash rights issue at a cost of
NZDollars 180m (Pounds 61m).
The Scottish bank gained control of Countrywide late last month after a
four-month battle in which opponents said its offer was far too low.
Countrywide is New Zealand's fifth biggest bank. The Bank of Scotland
formerly controlled Countrywide but was instrumental in seeing it merge with
the United Bank earlier this year. The United Bank was formerly owned by the
financially troubled State Bank of South Australia.
The Bank of Scotland said it would complete the compulsory acquisition of
the outstanding shares, which would see Countrywide delisted from the stock
exchange, by the end of the year.
In addition, a NZDollars 120m subordinated loan extended by the Scottish
bank will provide bridging finance to allow Countrywide to pay for the
purchase of United Bank in May.
The merger of both United and Countrywide was completed last weekend.

FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Vodafone at top of expectations with Pounds
160m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VODAFONE, the mobile communications group, reported a 23 per cent increase
in pre-tax profits for the half year to September 30.
This was largely due to continued growth in its customer base despite the
recession and improved profit margins.
Profits, which were at the high end of expectations, were Pounds 160m
compared with Pounds 130m. They were achieved on turnover ahead from Pounds
286m to Pounds 320m.
The share price rose by 14p to 401p.
Mr Gerry Whent, Vodafone's chief executive, said the results for the full
year 'should be good'.
He also revealed that Vodafone's UK cellular network, which accounts for the
lion's share of group business, signed up 24,000 subscribers to its new
LowCall service aimed at residential customers since it was launched six
weeks ago.
This offers customers cheaper monthly payments in exchange for higher call
charges.
Half the customers were new while the other half had changed from Vodafone's
main business service.
Mr Chris Gent, Vodafone's managing director, said the number of net new
subscribers increased to 20,000 in the three months to the end of September.
The proportion of customers leaving the network fell slightly to an
annualised rate of 20 per cent.
However, Mr Gent said that this 'churn' rate would increase in the next few
months because one of the company's service providers was in the process of
dis-connecting some 7,000 customers.
Mr Whent said that he expected profit margins to decline in the future
because most of the benefits of economies of scale had been achieved while
new services such as LowCall carried lower profit mar-gins.
Next spring, Vodafone will relaunch its pan-European digital service which
currently has only 50 paying customers.
Later next year it plans to launch its micro cellular network which will
offer customers cheaper call rates.
Mr Whent said that other businesses in the Vodafone group, apart from the
main network company, such as its service provider and paging units were
'going well'.
Earnings per share were 23 per cent up at 10.76p (8.76p), while the interim
dividend rises 20 per cent to 3.43p, against 2.86p.
Net cash balance at September 30 was Pounds 158m.

FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Waiting for the realistic opportunities -
Smiths Industries' assessment of the companies being offered in its
diversification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TWO proposals a day

<TEXT>
that is the rate at which offers of companies for sale have been flooding
into Smiths Industries, the engineering group which is trying to diversify
from its core aircraft avionics business.
However, Smiths has so far concluded relatively few deals, in spite of
having more than Pounds 40m in ready cash, strongly cash-generative
businesses and a high reputation in the City. It is anxious to compensate
for the downturn in civilian and military aircraft by building its medical
systems and industrial components businesses.
Mr Roger Hurn, chairman and chief executive, says: 'The market is not
dissimilar to the domestic housing market in Britain. Quite a lot of
companies would like to refocus. They tend to test the market, by
selectively and secretively offering different bits and pieces around.
'Until quite recently they have been disappointed by what the market has
been prepared to pay. So many of those 'sales' have been withdrawn. You'd be
amazed how dreadful businesses become core businesses again, almost
overnight, in the light of reality.'
Smiths sees some evidence, both in the UK and US, that people are deciding
that they ought to lower their sights, take what the market is offering, and
use the money to get on with other things.
Mr Hurn said: 'One of the frustrations of the last 2 1/2 years, of the early
part of recession, has been this unreality because companies like us have
obviously been keen to invest. We have been apparently offered large numbers
of superficially attractive companies at unrealistic prices. That has been
deeply frustrating, because we have been generating cash but have been
unable to re - invest it at sensible prices.'
The group did recently buy a US disposable medical products company,
Intertech Resources, for Dollars 110m, about 20 times earnings. Although
less than the multiple of 30 times earnings which a similar company would
have fetched as recently as a year ago, it was still expensive compared with
Smiths' historic multiple of about 13.5.
Nonetheless Mr Gerry Mortimer, economic adviser to Smiths, believes the
figures can begin to stack up favourably at this level, once account is
taken of the synergies and world markets which the UK group can add to such
a company, which makes 'single-use' anaesthesia and respiratory devices used
in surgery and intensive care.
Mr Hurn said: 'The one thing that US manufacturers of this sort of product
of our sort of size are not good at, and never have been good at, is selling
anything outside the US or Canada. I'm not talking about big groups such as
Johnson &amp; Johnson, but the small and medium-sized players. What we bring is
immediate access to a world distribution network outside North America.'
One useful trend, as far as Smiths is concerned, is the virtual
disappearance of leveraged and management buy-outs. Mr Mortimer said:
'Between three and five years ago we were witnessing auctions - and taking
part in some of them - where the industry participants lost out to strictly
financial buyers.
'We can cite several instances where those properties have come back on the
market again-but not the properties they were. They have had to cut their
research and development to finance their cashflow, and they still fail.'
Smiths believes that engineering companies might offer some of the best buys
at present, both in terms of price and the stage they are at in the economic
cycle.
Mr Hurn said he would like to build up both these medical and industrial
businesses to a size where they are both much more equal legs on the stool,
compared with aerospace. 'If we don't do that as a result of aerospace
shrinking down to their size, I'd rather see them going up to meet
aerospace.'
Although the group was willing to make further acquisitions in the US, Mr
Hurn thought the UK was going to offer some 'jolly good opportunities' for
acquisitions at sensible prices at this point in the recession and for the
next few months.
In spite of his wish to shift the balance of the group away from aerospace,
Mr Hurn does not rule out making acquisitions in that area, and emphasises
that Smiths is currently investing Pounds 40m a year of its own money in
developing aerospace products for customers such as Boeing.
Indeed, Smiths had a very close look at Dowty, the aerospace and information
technology group which TI Group won with a hostile Pounds 510m bid in June.
Mr Hurn said: 'Nobody in their right mind rules out the big quantum jump. It
is of a different order of risk and strategy. There obviously have been
situations in the last two years when we have been talked of as a bidder in
the Pounds 500m category.
'We spend a great deal of time and thought processes in looking at those
large opportunities. You only get one shot at getting that wrong - and,
therefore, you have to be very, very sure you get it right. I don't mean we
wouldn't do it if it was right, but I certainly wouldn't bet the farm on a
less solidly based business than Smiths Industries.'
He concluded: 'What you never know in this game is whether you are going to
pull something off. You pursue perhaps a tenth of the things you look at; of
the 10 you pursue, you get perhaps two to the final stages-and then you can
walk away from both of them. It's a very, very low strike-rate.'

FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: NSM cuts deficit to Pounds 1.16m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER UK interest rates and the sale of non-core businesses helped NSM, the
heavily-indebted international coal mining group, reduce its loss before tax
from Pounds 1.37m to Pounds 1.16m in the half-year to September 30.
Operating profits fell to Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 4.81m) on lower sales of
Pounds 56.8m (Pounds 90.7m) reflecting the sale of its Bison building
materials arm and the closure of the building division.
Further disposals are planned. These include air-conditioning and plastics
companies and property, valued at more than Pounds 20m.
About two thirds of operating profits are generated from the sale of UK
coal, mostly to the two generators, National Power and PowerGen.
Mr John Jermine, chief executive, is lobbying ministers to proceed with the
privatisation of British Coal, which he believes would end the current limit
on private contractors of 250,000 tonnes per site.
He also expects that privatisation will lead to a reduction in the Pounds 5
a tonne royalty payment to British Coal.
NSM currently sells its coal for an average of Pounds 21 per tonne.
Mr Jermine said: 'The government has got to pull its finger out and end the
uncertainty in the industry. We hope it will press on with the privatisation
of British Coal while ending coal imports and the subsidy to the nuclear
industry.'
Interest charges dropped by 23 per cent to Pounds 4.77m (Pounds 6.18m)
despite borrowings rising to Pounds 94m (Pounds 88m) because of Pounds 8m of
capital expenditure on a US deep-mine commissioned in May.
Another Pounds 4m of capital expenditure is earmarked for the next half year
on another US deep-mine.
The company hopes that its US deep-mine operations in Pennsylvania will
match the annual Pounds 1.8m tonnes generated by its US opencast production.
Borrowings are expected to fall to Pounds 85m by the end of March because of
further disposals.
An extraordinary item of Pounds 813,000 reflected the write-off of goodwill
on businesses sold.
Losses per share were reduced from 6.1p to 5.8p.

FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Refinancing planned for HunterPrint as loss
grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNTERPRINT, the troubled specialist printer which ousted Sir Ian MacGregor
as its chairman in August, has called on investors for the second time in
two years to fund a rescue cash injection.
The call came as the group revealed almost doubled pre-tax losses, after
exceptionals, of Pounds 12.2m for the year to September 27.
The group announced a Pounds 20m placing and offer to cut debt and a
financial reorganisation to eliminate its onerous lease obligations dating
from a Pounds 34m investment in a printing factory at Corby,
Northamptonshire, in 1988.
It has also agreed a Pounds 5.2m convertible preference issue to creditors
and a capital reorganisation to allow the payment of dividends. Finally, new
banking facilities of Pounds 14.9m have been agreed with Barclays Bank.
The company yesterday warned shareholders that if the plans were not
approved, HunterPrint's directors believed the group would 'not be able to
continue trading'.
Mr Tony Caplin, chief executive, said the cash call was not a sign that the
management installed two years ago had failed to turn the company round.
'Our order books are extremely strong,' he said. 'Management has done
everything right. They have just run out of cash.'
HunterPrint, which was on the brink of collapse in 1990 when it raised
Pounds 13.6m in a share issue, has now offered investors one for every 10
shares held at a placing price of 50p to raise a net Pounds 18.3m.
The placing follows a proposed capital reorganisation to consolidate every
10 existing shares into one with a nominal value of 50p. The shares will be
split into one ordinary of 15p, which will carry the voting rights, and one
deferred of 35p. Last night the shares closed 1/2 p down at 5 1/2 p.
Out of the placing proceeds, Pounds 15.6m in cash will be used to pay
lessors of printing equipment, which along with the Pounds 5.2m convertible
preferences would eliminate HunterPrint's Pounds 36m lease obligations. The
lessors have also agreed to take up to Pounds 3.9m of the placing shares.
The new shares will represent some 69 per cent of the enlarged equity.
Mr Caplin said the company was expected to return a profit in the current
year and it expected to pay a dividend for the first time since 1989.
The increased losses of Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 6.3m) this time were after a
Pounds 3.8m exceptional charge. The largest element of the charge was a
Pounds 6.1m provision for the write-down of fixed assets and Pounds 1.7m of
costs for the refinancing. This was partially offset by the estimated Pounds
5.8m gain on restructuring the leases.
Sales rose to Pounds 52.2m (Pounds 49.6m), while trading losses were cut to
Pounds 5.1m (Pounds 7.25m). Losses were 6.8p (4.2p).
has HunterPrint has paid Sir Ian MacGregor Pounds 285,000 in compensation
for loss of office and a further Pounds 35,000 for fees and legal expenses.

FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Lower interest rates depress growth at
Lowndes Lambert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER INTEREST rates restricted growth of pre-tax profits at Lowndes
Lambert, the insurance broker, from Pounds 4.01m to Pounds 4.24m in the six
months to September 30.
Interest receivable fell to Pounds 1.81m (Pounds 2.79m), mainly because of
lower rates.
Lowndes, which listed its shares on the Stock Exchange last year, increased
earnings per share to 10.9p (10.4p) and the interim dividend to 4.5p (4.2p),
helping push its shares up 11p to close at 300p.
Mr Richard Shaw, chairman, said good progress was made 'despite the hostile
economic climate, both for UK-based activities and most of our overseas
subsidiaries.'
The group reported an increase in brokerage fees and commissions to Pounds
25m (Pounds 23.6m). Growth was particularly strong in the UK, where
brokerage income expanded by 15 per cent.
Mr David Margrett, managing director, said rises in UK commercial insurance
rates, which averaged between 15 and 20 per cent, over the last six to nine
months had helped.
Although Lowndes saw reduced activity in its speciality business of broking
professional indemnity cover for architects, it had increased its
involvement in other professional areas.
Income from marine and aviation business advanced by 11 per cent on the back
of hardening rates and greater market share.
Expenses rose from Pounds 23.2m to Pounds 24m, amounting to 96.2 per cent of
brokerage compared to 98.5 per cent in the same period last year.
Share of associated companies' profits rose to Pounds 7.25m (Pounds 5.72m),
partially reflecting the disposal of an investment by Lowndes' part-owned
French subsidiary. Associated companies generated profits of Pounds 1.47m
(Pounds 863,000).

FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Export prospects buoy Fairline Boats shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES OF Fairline Boats, the luxury yacht maker, yesterday rose from 175p
to 197p as buoyant export prospects outweighed annual results well short of
expectations.
The Peterborough-based group turned in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 507,000 for
the 12 months to end-September, compared with profits of Pounds 3.02m last
time. BZW, the company's broker, last month forecast a deficit of Pounds
250,000.
Losses per share worked through at 7p against earnings of 55.9p. The total
dividend is halved from 21p to 10.5p with a final of 6.925p.
Mr Sam Newington, chairman, said: 'We are budgeting for increased sales and
a return to profit in the current six months, and if we meet our targets, we
will be well set to restore the dividend'.
The shares are well below their peak of 590p in October last year.
Thereafter, signs that recession in the UK and Europe was catching up with
the luxury boat trade, confirmed by the group's poor interim results in May,
sent investors scuttling.
Sales fell 21 per cent to Pounds 27.7m (Pounds 35m), and although costs were
contained, the company incurred an operating loss of Pounds 672,000 against
a Pounds 2.59m profit.
Mr Newington said that export sales made up 63 per cent of business, but
demand in France, Spain, Germany and Japan was weak.
However, the company had record order deposits of Pounds 1.9m (Pounds
888,000) at the end of October, with the value of the order book standing at
Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 6.1m).
Mr Newington said sterling's devaluation would boost exports this year, but
Fairline would also benefit from the year's 'heavy investment' in new
models: Squadron 62 (which sells for Pounds 620,000) and Squadron 56 (Pounds
414,000).
He said there was good demand from German customers, increased interest from
Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia, and Fairline would exhibit at a boat fair
in Dubai, when it could win back orders lost since the Gulf war.
It was still unclear how VAT would be implemented in Europe. In the past EC
boat-owners could avoid paying VAT by buying in one country and berthing in
another.

FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Sims Food shares fall as profits decline
26% to Pounds 2.48m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Sims Food Group shed 16p to 205p as the meat processor and
supplier revealed a 26 per cent decline, from Pounds 3.35m to Pounds 2.48m,
in pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30.
In July, when the company revealed a 13 per cent advance to Pounds 9.31m for
the year to March 31, Mr John Stone, chairman, warned that 'a disappointing
trend' that had begun at the beginning of 1992 would continue through the
period under review.
Mr David Brady, finance director, explained yesterday that Sims had seen
nine months when there had been 'a unique combination' of a shortage of
supply (especially in beef, but also in lamb), coupled with a slight drop in
demand. Further, there was abattoir over-capacity, which chased livestock
prices up.
However, he added that the company had increased its market share in all its
divisions, although at reduced margins. Group turnover rose 23 per cent to
Pounds 144.2m.
Debt is traditionally high in the build-up to Christmas and was Pounds 19m
at the period-end, giving gearing of 54 per cent. This should reduce to
Pounds 15m and about 35 per cent by the year-end. Earnings shrank to 5.3p
(8.7p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 3p.

FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Argyll shows 15% advance to Pounds 205m -
Plenty of rooom seen for growth in increasingly competitive market place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGYLL GROUP, the Safeway, Presto and Lo-Cost food retailer, raised interim
pre-tax profits by 15 per cent from Pounds 178m to Pounds 205m - at the top
end of analysts' expectations.
The shares fell 8p to 365p as investors took profits.
Sir Alistair Grant, chairman, said there was still a lot of growth left in
the food retail sector, although it was an 'increasingly competitive
marketplace.'
The group expects 'another year of pleasing profit growth,' subject to
satisfactory trading at Christmas.
The interim dividend is increased to 3.55p (3.2p) on earnings per share of
13.3p (12.1p).
Sales in the 28 weeks to October 10 rose 6 per cent to Pounds 2.84bn (Pounds
2.68bn), though the rise was about 8 per cent excluding businesses sold last
year.
Operating profits were 13 per cent higher at Pounds 183m (Pounds 162m), with
the margin on sales excluding VAT rising from 6.4 to 6.9 per cent.
Interest receivable rose by Pounds 6m to Pounds 22.3m. The pre-tax figure
included a loss of Pounds 400,000 on property, compared to a profit of
Pounds 2m.
Safeway accounted for 79 per cent of sales and 85 per cent of operating
profits. These proportions have grown from 37 and 39 per cent respectively
since its acquisition in 1987.
In the half year, Safeway sales rose 10 per cent to Pounds 2.3bn. Of this
increase 7.3 percentage points came from new stores. In comparable stores
2.1 percentage points were accounted for by inflation and the other 1 point
by added volume.
Operating profits from Safeway rose by 21 per cent to Pounds 155m (Pounds
128m), and the margin from 6.6 per cent to 7.3 per cent.
Selling area has increasing from 2m sq ft in 1987 to a projected 7m by next
March. Eight new stores opened in the first half and a further 18 are due in
the second half.
Mr David Webster, deputy chairman, said Safeway stores under 20,000 sq ft
achieved a margin of 6.6 per cent, while the larger ones achieved 7.9 per
cent. The smaller stores were mainly older ones, and were thus making a good
return on capital.
Stores being built would cost an average of Pounds 13.3m each in the current
year, although this would rise to Pounds 16.3m the following year.
These investments are thought to be substantially lower than Safeway's main
rivals. Sir Alistair said the aim was to build a few 'blockbuster' stores
each year, costing substantially more than the average.
Argyll is paying an average of Pounds 3.4m for a site, rising to an expected
Pounds 5.8m in the next financial year. But it recently bought a site in
Edinburgh at a price estimated by some at Pounds 30m.
While expansion of the Safeway chain would continue, investment was being
stepped up in Presto and Lo-Cost stores, Sir Alistair said.
Group capital expenditure was Pounds 226m in the first half and a figure of
Pounds 600m is forecast for the year, rising to Pounds 650m in 1993-94,
likely to be the peak year in real terms.
The balance sheet had net cash of Pounds 179.5m at the half year end, after
an outflow of Pounds 20m. Mr Colin Smith, finance director, said there would
be net debt of about Pounds 50m by the March year end.

FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: National Express share offer price fixed at
165p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Express, Britain's biggest scheduled coach service operator,
yesterday priced its share placing and offer for sale that will take the
company to the stock market with a capitalisation of Pounds 59.4m.
Some 27.8m shares are being sold at 165p each, raising Pounds 45.9m. Of
this, Pounds 25.6m is new money being raised by the company and the
remaining Pounds 20.3m represents stock being sold by existing shareholders,
mainly the company's venture capital backers.
National Express, once part of the state-owned National Bus Company, was
privatised through a management buy-out in 1988.
It changed hands again for just Pounds 10m last year when Mr Ray McEnhill
and Mr Adam Mills, now chief executive and finance director respectively,
took control through a management buy-in.
The increase in the value is based on a turnround from pre-tax losses of
Pounds 1.2m in 1991 to a forecast pre-tax profit of Pounds 6.5m for the 53
weeks to January 2 1993.
The offer price represents 10 times forecast earnings per share. The
notional dividend for the year would have been 7.12p, yielding 5.75 per
cent.
All the shares to be sold are being placed with institutional and other
investors, but a quarter of them will be made available to the public
through an offer for sale.
Mini-prospectuses are being handed out to passengers and the company's
advisers say that more than 7,500 people have dialled a help-line to ask for
information.
Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, is sponsor to the issue and Smith New
Court is broker. The offer closes at 10am on December 1, with dealings
expected to begin on December 10.
COMMENT
A share in National Express could prove a one-way ticket to a not
particularly inviting destination. Coach travel's share of the long-distance
passenger transport market is already small, and the combination of rising
car ownership and worsening road traffic congestion will do little to slow
its further decline. National Express could notionally buck the trend by
expanding within the coach travel market, but that may not be easy with the
Office of Fair Trading breathing down its neck; and with the OFT promising a
visit in any case next year, even making much more money out of existing
operations could have its hazards. Profits have an air of fragility about
them, representing as they do the difference between what the company can
wring out of its low budget passengers and what it must pay the contractors
who run some of its coach services. In the longer term, meanwhile, the
privatisation of British Rail, presented by the company as an opportunity,
could just as easily become a threat if it fulfils the government's
ambitions of introducing entrepreneurialism to the railways. That said, a
healthy subscription to the offer seems likely if enough National Express
passengers mistake the company's share offer for a privatisation, and the
unambitious pricing makes sufficient concessions to the downside to hold out
the prospect of a modestly successful debut.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Corporate body shapes up to a tougher regime: German
industry was caught off guard by the downturn but it is doing more than just
shedding jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN industry has been cutting the fat for the best part of a year. Now it
is trying to tone up the slenderised body corporate.
Workforces and wage bills, bloated by the need to keep up with demand in the
boom that followed reunification, are still being squeezed back into shape.
But as employers face up to the prospect of forced redundancies, they are
also starting to look for economies from restructuring.
The need for further action from companies has become clear in the past few
days with the release of a series of grim third-quarter figures.
Daimler-Benz set the tone with an out-of-the-blue 'background briefing',
forecasting that full-year profits would fall by almost a quarter.
It was preparing the ground for an interim report which showed an 8 per cent
fall at the nine-month mark, caused by unexpected upsets in its main profits
source, Mercedes-Benz. Then came the three big chemicals groups: Hoechst,
down 19 per cent; BASF, down 45 per cent; and Bayer, off a mere 16 per cent.
Metallgesellschaft's full-year result from its mining and industrial
activities was 23 per cent lower.
Engineering giant Mannesmann will shortly enlarge on this week's advance
warning of 'considerably lower' nine-month earnings.
Volkswagen, reporting yesterday, said that, after a 13 per cent drop in
profits in the first nine months, the outlook for the fourth quarter had
worsened 'drastically'. The company hinted that it may cut its dividend.
German industry, as Daimler's interim report suggested, has been caught off
guard by the suddenness and severity of the third quarter downturn. In the
spring the group had promised an 'excellent' result, and profits were ahead
16 per cent after six months.
Part of the problem stems from miscalculations of the timing of
international recovery - an appearance billed for September this year has
now been postponed to some time in 1993.
Part lies with devaluations in important export countries and the consequent
losses in translation of sales and earnings to D-Marks.
According to Mr Manfred Schneider, chairman of Bayer, currency fluctuations
cost his group DM904m (Pounds 373.5m) on its sales figure for the first nine
months and more than DM100m in profits.
But as results from the groups' German-based parent companies showed, the
domestic slowdown has played a considerable role. These ranged from a 73 per
cent slump in the BASF parent, to 28 per cent at Hoechst and 27 per cent at
VW.
Against this background, the leading lights of German industry are doing
more than simply shedding jobs.
Marginal and loss-making operations are being shut or sold. Mergers and
collaborations of every kind are being discussed and even management is
being squeezed.
Accelerated job cuts at Bayer - more than 6,000 will go this year - have so
far kept the increase in the group's wage costs to less than 1 per cent.
But, as Mr Schneider said, there are 'some structural problems' in sectors
where German manufacturers were losing or had already lost the ability to
compete. An unspecified number of production facilities in the dyes and
inorganic chemicals business would have to be closed, he said.
At Hoechst, meanwhile, the PVC business - another area facing murderous
price competition in over-supplied world markets - is to be merged with that
of Wacker-Chemie in an attempt to gain critical mass. According to Hoechst,
the deal would give the combined group a 10 per cent share of west European
production capacity.
BASF, in another consolidation move aimed at making 'considerable savings',
said yesterday that its computer services division was to close 16 of its
centres. The workload, at present spread around 10 European countries, would
be concentrated in three centres: two in Ludwigshafen and one in Antwerp.
Earlier this week the group announced the closure of unprofitable oilfields
and the disbanding of its composite materials division and said it was
considering collaboration with others in the field of magnetic audio and
video tapes.
At Daimler-Benz, where plans were recently unveiled to streamline the
headquarters of its AEG subsidiary, reducing staff from 940 to less than
200, the same subsidiary is talking hard with Siemens on a project possibly
to merge the two groups' railway interests. Siemens seems to have bucked the
downward trend of big German companies.
Difficult, long-term industrial issues, with implications reaching far
beyond the foreseeable limits of the international recession, are being
debated with unusual vigour and acted on with characteristic caution.
Structural measures undertaken so far are minor in comparison with the
radical changes imposed in other industrialised countries.
Industry seems unwilling to cut deeper until it has clearer indicators of
how deep, long and damaging the current downturn will be.
In the meantime, it may hope with some justification that Bonn will at last
respond to its long-running appeals for relief from what it considers the
competitive disadvantages imposed by federal policies. Long-awaited
corporate taxation reforms, for example, are already under way.
There are also signs of growing conviction in government departments outside
the environment ministry that the rigorous rules on nature protection are
undermining investment prospects in both sides of the country.
According to Bayer's Mr Schneider, all industry wanted of Bonn was that it
should ensure that business could operate under the same competitive
conditions as its international rivals.
The conviction that Germany's players already feel fit enough to compete,
and all that remains is for the government to level the playing field, seems
unshakeable.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Amstrad meeting told 'I am your receiver' by Sugar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I AM your receiver, I am your liquidator . . . I'm the one to shrink this
company down and give you an exit at 30p,' Mr Alan Sugar, founder and
chairman of Amstrad, told disgruntled shareholders yesterday.
The four-hour emotionally charged annual general meeting of the troubled
computer and consumer electronics company was dominated by individual
shareholders who focused their anger on Mr Sugar's buy-back plan to pay what
many argued was a meagre 30p per share for the 65 per cent of Amstrad he
does not already own.
Mr Sugar was forced repeatedly to justify his proposals, and to reassure his
critics that 'there is no trick in the cupboard' and no new 'blockbuster'
products 'in the bottom drawer'. He said he was 'pleased to be able to offer
30p' which provided a 'graceful exit', but warned that this was likely to be
'the best shareholders would get'.
He said his buy-back plans represented 'an organised receivership under my
control'. Mr Sugar reiterated his view of the gloomy prospects for Amstrad
and the need to cut overheads and shrink the business - something he
insisted would be easier to achieve in a private company.
But Mr Sugar warned that if shareholders rejected his proposals at an
extraordinary meeting next month it would still be necessary to scale down
the business.
He warned that the share price would probably fall sharply and added that
although he did not expect Amstrad to report a loss this year, 'it will
never be profitable enough to push the share price back up to Pounds 1'.
Several shareholders expressed unhappiness at the high emoluments they
believed Mr Sugar and the directors of Amstrad were receiving when
shareholders had been deprived of a final dividend.
'I can't see any reason why the final dividend was cancelled. Many people
rely on the dividend. Wouldn't it have been a nice gesture to announce the
dividend and forego your own?' one shareholder asked. Some shareholders
wanted Amstrad to pay a special dividend out of its 'core' cash reserves
which Mr Sugar acknowledged were about Pounds 60m.
Another of the 100 shareholders at the meeting demanded to know what each
director was paid and what they did to justify that payment. Mr Sugar did
promise that if his buy-back plan was rejected he would search for a
non-executive director to represent shareholders' interests on the board.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Sara Lee in talks with BP over food group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SARA LEE, the US textiles, food and consumer products company, is in
advanced negotiations to buy British Petroleum's consumer food group, which
produces and sells packaged meats in several European countries.
The value of the planned deal has not been disclosed but is thought to be
between Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m) and Dollars 120m. The two companies said
yesterday that they expected to reach final agreement by the end of the
year.
The consumer products group, which had sales last year of about Pounds 190m
and employs 2,300 people, is part of BP Nutrition.
BP indicated in February it would entertain offers for Nutrition to help pay
down its Dollars 16bn of debt. The pace of disposals was accelerated and the
dividend cut this summer after Mr David Simon took over as chief executive.
His predecessor, Mr Robert Horton, was ousted as chairman and chief
executive in a boardroom coup.
BP is on target for raising Dollars 1.5bn from disposals this year and is
confident of generating Dollars 2bn next year, it said earlier this month
when it published better than expected third-quarter results. The Sara Lee
deal would be the first disposal of part of BP Nutrition, which has annual
sales of about Pounds 3bn. These also include the supply of animal feed,
seafood and household products.
Sara Lee, which was selected from several rival bidders, is a leader in the
US packaged meats business, where it owns national brands including Jimmy
Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park.
The company has been seeking to enter the business in Europe, where it
already markets brands including Playtex bras, Dim and L'Eggs tights, Kiwi
shoe polishes and Douwe Egberts coffee.
BP's consumer food group sells cooked sausage, salami, ham and other
processed meats mainly in Spain, Portugal, the Benelux countries and
Britain. The group is headquartered in the Netherlands.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Record at EMI helps Thorn advance 11%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECORD profits from EMI Music, combined with the benefits of cost-cutting
operations, supported an 11 per cent rise in pre-tax profits at Thorn EMI,
the music and electrical rentals group, from Pounds 94.9m to Pounds 105.2 in
the first half.
Thorn also announced a higher than expected dividend increase of 4.7 per
cent to 9.0p (from 8.6p).
The firm performance, which comes at a time when the worldwide music
industry is suffering from the effects of economic slowdown, and which
included a four-month contribution of Pounds 5m from Virgin Music, was
higher than expected in the City.
Thorn's share price rose yesterday, closing up 21p at 796p and offsetting
recent losses brought on by speculation that the company was having trouble
integrating Virgin Music.
Sir Colin Southgate, chairman, said that while the rest of the financial
year would continue to be difficult, he expected the full year to show
improvement over the last two with the greater contribution from Virgin.
'The UK markets continue to be worse than expected and Rumbelows will
continue to suffer,' he said.
However, the rationalisation measures undertaken early on in the recession
have had a very beneficial effect and should yield annual savings of about
Pounds 20m. 'We have the business under good control,' Sir Colin noted.
Turnover increased to Pounds 1,945.3m (from Pounds 1,760.5m), helped by a
strong performance from EMI Music, where turnover rose 24.6 per cent to
Pounds 614.0m.
Including the contribution from Virgin, profits at the music division rose
by 16 per cent to Pounds 60.6m, although EMI Music achieved record
first-half results even before taking Virgin Music profits into account.
Contrary to comments made by some industry observers, compact disc sales had
not stalled and the sluggishness in the music industry was 'entirely
recession driven', Sir Colin said.
While unit volumes and revenues from European music markets were sluggish,
both the US and Japanese markets saw unit volume and revenue growth.
Sir Colin also emphasised that the integration of Virgin Music was going
according to plan.
The departure earlier this month of Mr Simon Draper, co-founder of Virgin,
following that of several other executives, had raised concern that Thorn
was facing difficulties integrating the Virgin business, which it purchased
in March for Pounds 560m.
HMV, the record retailer, however, made a loss of Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 5.9m
last time) on increased turnover of Pounds 120.8m (up from Pounds 104.3m).
Fully diluted earnings per share were down by 6.9 per cent to 16.6p (from
17.8p) due to the acquisition of Virgin Music.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Roland Shawto step down as chairman of Premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROLAND Shaw, a founding father of the British independent oil industry,
is stepping down from his executive role as chairman of Premier Consolidated
Oilfields, the company he has dominated for a decade.
At a board meeting last week, Mr Shaw confirmed that he would become a
non-executive chairman after Christmas, according to sources close to the
company.
Mr Shaw has been under some pressure from shareholders to take a less
dominant role in Premier since his 70th birthday last year.
In June he relinquished the chief executive position to Mr Charles Jamieson,
who has been with Premier for a decade since leaving Gulf Oil.
Mr Shaw said yesterday he would not be retiring 'this year or next' from the
company he built up over more than 20 years.
Premier was one of the first of the small UK independent oil companies in
the early 1980s. At its peak in 1989, the stock market valued it at more
than Pounds 500m.
Like many of the other smaller independents, Premier has since fallen out of
favour with the stock market and the company is now valued at less than
Pounds 100m.
Mr Shaw says Premier is also still suffering from the market's indigestion
following the fiasco surrounding a badly handled placing of Burmah Castrol's
29.9 per cent stake two years ago.
Kleinwort Benson, the stockbrokers, took the stake on its books but only
placed the deal, at a loss, with the help of Cazenove.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Danube under threat from toxic flood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS and CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS engineers are racing to prevent millions of tonnes of toxic
mine waste from poisoning the Danube river system after flash floods damaged
a dam in the mountains of Montenegro, a republic of the rump Yugoslavia.
Mr Hans Zimmermann, a senior official with the UN disaster relief
organisation in Geneva, said yesterday that the dam was on the verge of
collapse.
An estimated 7m tons of toxic waste - containing heavy metals such as lead
and zinc as well as pesticide residues - could then slide into the Tara
river and, via the Drina, to the Danube above Belgrade, from where it flows
through Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea.
The effect would be 'absolutely disastrous', Mr Zimmermann said. 'It would
poison everything that lives in the Tara and probably the Danube as well.'
Everyone who drinks water from the Danube system would be in danger, he
said. High concentrations of heavy metals would not only kill fish and other
aquatic life but also overwhelm water treatment facilities along the rivers.
Heavy metals are notoriously difficult to remove from drinking water, and
expensive new plants, using techniques such as ion exchange, might have to
be installed very quickly to make it safe.
The floods, in mid-October, washed away concrete slabs re-inforcing the base
of the 600-700 metre-long earth dam, which was built 20 years ago to hold
poisonous waste from local mines.
The full danger was not recognised until last week when UN experts visited
the site, in a mountainous gorge at Mojkovac on the river Tara. The Tara is
a Unesco-protected waterway.
The UN is preparing to fly in materials for building three jetties upstream
to direct water away from the dam and prevent further erosion of its base.
Officials hope to have the break-waters in place within a week and to build
a new retaining dam to shore up the old one by Christmas.
Although the floods have receded, Mr Zimmermann said the dam could topple at
any time. 'We cannot predict it; we can only work as fast as we can,' he
said.
The European Community has put up Ecu110,000 (Pounds 90,000) for the airlift
of urgently needed equipment and materials. A Belgian air force transport
has been chartered to fly tomorrow to Podgorica, the Montenegrin capital,
from where its load will be transported 30 miles by road to the dam.
Mr Zimmermann said the dam was on a long list of items submitted by
Montenegro to the UN last month, when it asked for sanctions to be lifted on
supplies to repair extensive damage to infrastructure from floods.

FT  25 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England has certainly done its best to make its first gilt
auction since the devaluation attractive. Not only will the sale create a
new 10-year benchmark with liquidity appeal. The partly-paid structure,
under which the last instalment of half the principal is not due until next
April, also creates an unusually large gearing advantage. Both factors speak
for the auction's success. Whether that means worries about funding have
been overdone is another matter.
Overseas investors, who normally like paper of this maturity, are still
hesitant. Sterling is on the sidelines of the latest market turbulence. So
it might make sense for international investors to switch into gilts from
French government paper, where the exchange risk is growing. But gilts are
already trading at a yield premium of only some 125 basis points to German
government bonds. D-Mark paper itself - or other markets in dollars,
perhaps, or Swiss francs - offer a more attractive haven than gilts.
At some stage the Bank will need to find a way of tapping foreign demand if
it is to meet next year's requirement. For the time being, its new paper
will go largely to domestic buyers. It may help that institutions still want
to increase their weighting in gilts, while the market has been
undersupplied since the previous auction in August. Still, the real state of
demand will best be measured by the extent to which successful bidders are
simply switching out of longer-dated paper, depressing yields at that end of
the maturity spectrum.

FT  25 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Vodafone
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the yuppie is dead and buried, someone is still using his phone. Vodafone
produced results which would have been impressive even in the good old days.
The 23 per cent rise in earnings per share underlined how the company is
squeezing the most from all parts of its business. And while the weighting
of capital expenditure and amortisation to the second half flatter the
interim figures somewhat, there is no doubt that Vodafone's management has
done a good job.
However, any company producing an operating profit of Pounds 152m from
Pounds 320m of sales is on to a pretty good thing. The UK cellular duopoly
has served Vodafone well, and the management must be wondering how long its
good fortune can last. The company is certainly doing its best to get its
eggs out of one basket before the mobile phone market becomes more
competitive. It is moving into cellular overseas and is developing digital
systems aimed at both the pan-European business market and the
not-very-mobile consumer.
Still, margins on cellular will fall as extra competition enters the market.
Vodafone still has to manage the transition from running a high-margin,
low-volume operation to a low-margin mass-market range of services. Next
year's proliferation of standards may postpone the day of reckoning if
confused consumers hang back. But then investors with vertigo may feel
nervous about a market value of Pounds 4bn for a company with about Pounds
500m assets.

FT  25 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Argyll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Argyll seems to be moving up a gear. Given the nagging concern that the big
three grocery chains are close to saturating the UK market, shareholders
might be forgiven for wondering whether they are in for a white-knuckle
ride. Capital expenditure will rise by 50 per cent this year, according to
yesterday's interim statement, and climb again next year. More
significantly, a sharp rise in the cost per square foot of new stores
suggests Safeway is starting to confront Sainsbury and Tesco head on. Since
Argyll has in the past trumpeted its advantage as developer of cheap retail
space, it can hardly expect the market not to flinch when this starts to
erode.
The average cost of new space for Safeway is being inflated by the
development of a few expensive stores in prime locations. Argyll
legitimately argues it is protecting positions of market leadership. The
risk, though, is that the company will be drawn into an expensive - and
ultimately fruitless - attempt to keep Sainsbury and Tesco off what it
regards as home turf.
But that point is some way off. The latest flagships are producing a healthy
return on capital. Argyll still prefers, where possible, to concentrate on
cheaper space rather than slug it out for premium sites. Yet sales growth at
Safeway is keeping up with the best of the competition. By increasing its
investment in the discount end of the market through Presto and Lo-Cost,
Argyll is also spreading its risk. With efficiency improvements still to
come, the shares could yet close the substantial rating discount to
Sainsbury.

FT  25 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Thorn strikes a chord
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It may yet be demonstrated that Thorn EMI paid over the odds for Virgin. But
Sir Colin Southgate, Thorn's chairman, did an impressive job yesterday in
persuading the market there is no early cause for concern. Thorn is clearly
getting to grips with its controversial acquisition, has cut out a swathe of
costs duplicated by the EMI music business and even managed to squeeze out a
Pounds 5m first-half profit which few had anticipated. Vindication for the
Pounds 550m price tag, though, will only come in 1993-94 if Virgin is seen
to have contributed the Pounds 80m-Pounds 85m being muttered about today.
That said, there was plenty in the interim statement to justify a 20p bounce
in the shares. The music industry may be sluggish, but at least the evidence
is that it is still growing. EMI, excluding Virgin, should widen its margins
for the year as a whole. Meanwhile, the rental division's UK performance may
have been predictably drab and continuing losses from Rumbelows
disappointing in the wake of last year's provisions. But the growth rate of
Rent-A-Center in the US is in the high teens. Group cash flow remains
formidably strong and gross interest cover is a comfortable 4 1/2 times.
One uncertainty is whether the market will value Thorn primarily as a
defensive or as a cyclical stock. That it has both qualities at the same
time may be an advantage at this uncertain stage in the cycle. In the longer
term there are risks, but these would be offset if the sale of lighting and
security - and thereafter demerger of the two main businesses - eventually
went ahead.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Government launches debate on BBC's future: Corporation told
to become more efficient
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday launched a fundamental debate on the future of the
BBC with a commitment to public service broadcasting coupled with a warning
that the corporation would have to become more efficient.
The consultation document on the corporation's future is the first stage in
the renewal of the BBC's royal charter which runs out at the end of 1996 -
with a 15-year renewal in prospect.
Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, introducing the document,
which seems more intent on modernising the BBC than radically altering it,
said that in many ways 'the BBC had both embodied and communicated our
national heritage'.
Yet the corporation could not continue as if nothing had changed since it
was granted its present royal charter in 1981. With more television channels
and more choice, 'the role, function and organisation of the BBC was bound
to change'.
In contrast to government reform of the ITV systems, yesterday's document
raised many more questions than answers and set out a range of options.
The options for debate include:
A smaller BBC concentrating on providing what the market does not supply.
This option could lead to a loss of Radios 1 and 2 and only one national BBC
Television channel.
Privatisation or contracting out of many of the services supporting
programme makers.
Creation of a Public Service Broadcasting Council which could handle licence
fee money but distribute it to a variety of public service broadcasters.
Hiving off BBC Enterprises to an outside body for a fee.
Mr Brooke's support for the more radical options seemed lukewarm at best.
The licence fee is likely to survive, the green paper suggests, if only
because an obviously better system has not yet been put forward.
But however the BBC is financed in future, the government made it clear the
corporation not only had to give value for money but demonstrate that it was
doing so while maintaining programme quality.
The BBC needed to develop performance indicators to cover the efficiency of
its activities. Sir Michael Checkland, director general of the BBC, which
will reveal its response tomorrow, said the expiry of its charter gave the
BBC a chance to rethink its role and purpose.
He said: 'It is a chance that should not be missed. I look forward to an
informed public debate, based on a proper understanding of the issues. The
green paper lays the ground for such a debate.'
Earlier, Mr David Mellor, the former heritage secretary, attacked the idea
of a Public Service Broadcasting Council as 'a stake in the heart of the
BBC'.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Observer: Classical cat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Danny Chapchal's publicity handouts are to be believed then he is a
company doctor with a fearsome reputation in making the high-tech end of the
printing equipment business hum. However, the new proprietor of Atex, which
supplies the computer pre-press systems to many of the world's leading
newspapers, is also a classical music nut who is very proud of his cat
called Herbie, named after von Karajan.
Chapchal, who cannot function without high-brow music playing in the
background, has a thing about conductors. 'A good conductor can turn the
village band into the Philharmonic but a bad one can turn the Philharmonic
into the village band,' says Chapchal, quoting Furtwangler, late of the
Berlin Philharmonic.
There are nothing like enough good conductors within the ranks of Britain's
smaller businesses, according to Chapchal, who sees himself as one of the
leading performers in his own field. Having qualified as an accountant, he
joined Linotype in the UK in 1975 and has criss-crossed the printing
equipment world reputedly turning round one company after another. He even
managed to conduct business with the late Robert Maxwell without a cross
word.
But even he admits Atex is a far more difficult score. It is a multinational
employing more than seven times as many staff as his own company, and it is
losing money. If a blue chip like Kodak couldn't make a go of Atex, how can
47-year-old Chapchal?
The fact that he and his consortium of venture capitalist backers are buying
Atex minus its potentially costly legal problems is a big plus. But Atex has
to hold on to its big proprietary customer base as it moves to new standard
platform-based systems. If Chapchal can orchestrate this elusive opus, then
he will be deservedly called Maestro of the pre-press.

Prep-school behaviour among members of parliament is not confined just to

rushing across the road to No 1 Parliament Street, where MPs and their staff
take their coffee breaks.
It seems that the Henry Mee portrait of Lady Thatcher which hangs over a
fireplace there has been disfigured by the addition of a small dark
toothbrush moustache. Lord Wilson, who adorns the facing wall of the

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Still on the subject of the Shaw clan, it's nice to see an old salt like Sir
Brian Shaw (no relation to Roland) being put in charge of the Port of London
Authority. More worrying is the fact that Sir Brian, who used to run Furness
Withy, is also chairman of ANZ Grindlays Bank. The last person to double up
as chairman of the PLA and Grindlays didn't have an easy time.
Lord Aldington stepped down from Grindlays in 1976 after two years of heavy
losses, and a year later he handed over a near-insolvent PLA to government
trouble-shooter, Sir John Cuckney. In Lord Aldington's day Grindlays'
problems were in its merchant bank - Brandts. Today they are in India where
ANZ Grindlays is arguing with the Reserve Bank of India over a Rs5bn (Pounds
117m) claim.
But Sir Brian has two big advantages over Lord Aldington. Now that the port
of Tilbury has been privatised, the chairman of the PLA doesn't have to deal
with bolshie dockers any longer. What's more he has a big portrait of Lord A
hanging behind his desk to remind him of what can go wrong.

<TEXT>
Forget any suggestion that tonight's annual dinner of the Association of
Independent Exploration Companies will be a dull affair because Board of
Trade president Michael Heseltine is not putting in an appearance. The news
that Roland Shaw, one of the few real characters left in the industry, is
finally quitting the executive suite should cause a stir.
The 71-year-old American-born oilman has defied gravity for so long that it
is hard to imagine the industry without him. A big man in all senses of the
word, he has dominated Premier and championed the once-flourishing
independent sector since the early 1970s.
His presence at Premier, which is now a minnow compared with the likes of
Enterprise and Lasmo, is often cited as one of the reasons why Premier did
not fall prey to predators - like so many of its rivals. Even the most
ruthless shied away from tangling with Shaw.
When he retires for good - he will remain non-executive chairman for the
moment - the sector will be a much duller place. Men in grey suits are far
less exciting than big men with big ideas.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Letter: Housing where it is most needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON RANDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'A new policy for housing' (November 23), raises a number
of points. The provision of Pounds 750m will undoubtedly help a good many
homeless families, while at the same time removing 20,000 empty properties
from the saturated housing market. Although it might not be enough, it is at
least a start and is evidence that the government is taking the problems
seriously. But, if the Pounds 750m is to be used effectively, it must be
channelled to the areas which need it most - that is, those with the highest
levels of repossessions and households with negative equity.
The relaxation of the restrictions on council spending of their capital
receipts, while welcome in principle, would have produced quicker results if
selected areas had been allowed to spend part of their existing receipts. As
things stand, it is difficult to see local authorities being able to raise
much revenue through council house sales between now and December 1993.
While not all council housing is as poor as your leader implies, you are
right to suggest that people who cannot afford (or do not wish) to buy
should be able to turn to the private rented sector as a realistic
alternative.
What is needed is all-party political support for measures to encourage
banks, building societies and other institutions to take on the role of
landlords. An end to the current tax discrimination and the introduction of
worthwhile financial incentives would work wonders in this respect.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Letter: Royals would improve their lot if they treated
public with respect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PIOTR NEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While in Britain recently, I had the opportunity of visiting Windsor
Castle, now sadly damaged by the fire. While I appreciate that it is a
residence of members of the royal family, I was not impressed by the very
high admission charges and the general feeling that public visitors were
treated largely as an unavoidable nuisance.
Two days beforehand, I had the pleasure of visiting the White House in
Washington, where I paid no admission charge and was told proudly by the
official guides that 'this building belongs to the people of the United
States, and we are honoured to be able to share it with our citizens and
guests from abroad'.
I suspect that if a similar attitude were displayed by your royal family and
those who represent them, they may receive much more sympathy from the
public both in Britain and abroad. Furthermore, as I understand that the
majority of the damage was inflicted on areas not even accessible to the
general public, it seems rather presumptuous to ask British taxpayers to
foot the damage bill.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Letter: Attractions of Greek stock market, despite recent
slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr N A NIARCHOS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Referring to Kerin Hope's article, 'Athens sinks in spite of government
reassurance' (October 10), I would like to make the following comments.
Indeed the Greek stock market experienced a significant slide in equity
prices which brought the ASE composite index to lows not seen for the last
30 months. The problems outlined in the article, namely unrest and fears of
war in the former Yugoslavia, the prospect of a harsh 1993 budget and high
real interest rates have had an impact on the stock market.
As a matter of fact, the prevailing high level of short-term interest rates
causes a flow of funds off the stock market into more attractive short-term
money instruments and alternative investments.
Moreover, the underlying economic conditions (high public-sector borrowing
requirements, inflation three times the EC average) make a quick fall in
interest rates impossible for the next few months. In spite of the
unfavourable business environment the overwhelming majority of listed
companies has announced enhanced 1992 half-year results compared with last
year.
Even if one looks further, an eruption in Serbia's Kosovo region in no way
implies that Greece would get involved in the turmoil. The government has
given repeated reassurances that Greece has neither any territorial claims
against its northern neighbours nor any ambitions to interfere in the civil
war in the former Yugoslavia.
The government's austerity programme is expected to exhibit positive results
by mid-1993. The budget for the 1993 fiscal year foresees a primary surplus
of around 5 per cent of the GDP, whereas inflation will fall to single
figures by the last quarter of 1993. These positive developments will enable
interest rates gradually to come down to reasonable levels, thus encouraging
investment and fuelling economic recovery.
Bearing all this in mind, the recent decline of the stock market has brought
stock prices to very attractive levels, with most companies trading at four
to six times their expected 1992 earnings. Like every stock market, the
Athens Stock Exchange is vulnerable to cyclical trends. Hence, it is in my
belief that the Athens Stock Exchange will rebound sooner rather than later.

Sir, Your editorial, 'Cars, congestion and pollution' (November 20), fails

   From Mr WILLIAM DAVIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Nicholas Lander was right to draw attention to the importance of
Britain's tourism industry ('British tourism and the faulty towers of
policy', November 24).
The devaluation of sterling against other currencies has created new
opportunities by making this country a more affordable destination. We
believe that 1993 could be a record year for overseas visits, earning us
some Pounds 8bn in foreign exchange.
It has also helped us in the domestic market by making many foreign holidays
more expensive for UK citizens.
The British Tourist Authority is running vigorous promotional campaigns in
key markets such as the US, Germany, France, and Japan. We would like to do
more, but it would be wrong to rely on government funding alone.
The industry, which stands to reap the direct financial benefits, must also
play an active role. We have developed a strong partnership with the private
sector and I hope that we can persuade many more companies to join forces
with us.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Letter: Accountability of regulators is lacking in
privatisation strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TONY YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Tony Jackson is correct to assert that 'privatisation has its natural
limits', but a little late to worry that 'even such matters as the
modernisation of the UK's telephone network could become issues of public
policy' ('The pendulum swings', November 10).
One cannot really compare privatisation in eastern Europe, where typically
some 90 per cent of the economy is state owned, with Britain where public
ownership is now confined to certain fundamental services. I would assert
that the Post Office for one is a public service where privatisation has no
part to play and any disposal here would be 'a sale too far'.
The problem with privatising public utilities, such as British Telecom with
its universal service obligation, is that the regulator rather than
parliament finishes up determining crucial issues of public policy. Oftel's
prohibition on BT carrying broadcasting services on its telecommunications
network is a constraint on the company providing the kind of national
optical fibre broadband network that would stimulate economic growth and
expand the range of services available to customers.
The regulation of the regulators is the 'black hole' of the government's
privatisation strategy. As the National Communications Union unsuccessfully
proposed to this year's Trades Union Congress, the regulatory agencies must
become more accountable to parliament and the public.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Foreign Affairs: Big bang but deaf ears - A 'social atomic
bomb' has exploded over Sarajevo but the EC's response is inadequate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The grim truth has begun to dawn on western Europe. The disaster of the
former Yugoslavia is not just one of those awful things that happen in other
continents, about which one can ease one's conscience with a donation to
Oxfam or Unicef. It is going to affect us, disturbing the humdrum comforts
and discomforts of our ordinary lives. We are confronting a 'social atomic
bomb' in Europe.
The phrase is that of Tony Smythe, a man who knows something about human
misery and inhuman behaviour and does not speak of atomic bombs lightly. He
has been director successively of the National Council for Civil Liberties,
the mental health charity Mind, and most recently MedAct (Medical Action for
Global Security), a branch of International Physicians for Prevention of
Nuclear War. Earlier this month he went to Macedonia for a pan-European
'citizens' and municipal peace conference', organised by the Helsinki
Citizens' Assembly and the Conference of Local and Regional Authorities in
Europe.
It is easy to make fun of all these small non-governmental organisations
(NGOs) with long-winded titles which hold meetings up and down the
continent. Their efforts to keep dialogue going across national or ethnic
boundaries may seem Lilliputian in relation to the scale of the problems
involved, but that is surely better than the Brobdingnagian impotence of
governments and intergovernmental bodies which are infinitely better
endowed. In fact the latter often find they get good value for money by
subsidising the activities of the former.
By 'social atomic bomb', Mr Smythe means that the effects of what is
happening in the former Yugoslavia are as devastating to life, health and
property as an atomic bomb if one had been dropped there, and that they also
spread gradually, if in attenuated form, over a very wide area. But while
many of the effects are painfully physical, the process itself is social.
One cannot pinpoint a precise place and time at which the bomb exploded, and
while in broad terms its effects are all too predictable, in detail they are
much less so. That means that the effectiveness of any given remedial or
protective measure is also very hard to predict. Which perhaps explains why,
in contrast to the elaborate plans that governments made to deal with the
aftermath of a nuclear attack, there seems to have been no planning at all
for dealing with a disaster such as this.
Even now, after it has happened, there is no consensus about what needs to
be done, or even about how bad the disaster is. The figure of '2m or 3m'
displaced persons has, Mr Smythe points out, been 'trotted around for the
last few months', while the process of displacement is going on all the
time. Perhaps, if 2m was right when first quoted, 3m is right now. More
probably, no one really knows. What is certain is that, however bad it is
now, it will be worse in a week's time, and probably a great deal worse in
six months.
Equally certainly, it is by far the worst refugee problem in Europe since
the immediate aftermath of the second world war. It is happening on the
fringes of the European Community. So far the great majority of the
displaced are still within the borders of the former Yugoslavia, but an
estimated half million are outside and roughly half of those are in Germany.
Austria and Switzerland, not yet EC members but about to form the European
Economic Area with it, have well over 100,000 between them. Not surprisingly
all three of those countries are agitating desperately for the burden to be
shared, and for the adoption of a co-ordinated European response.
Yet, says Mr Smythe, the most striking feature of the situation is 'a
diabolical lack of any kind of co-ordination across Europe and within
ex-Yugoslavia'. How can this be? It is hard to blame the European
Commission, since national governments have been very careful to prevent it
getting its sticky fingers on the immigration and asylum issues, which they
regard as part of the holy of holies of national sovereignty. There is an ad
hoc group on immigration, set up in 1986, but it is strictly
intergovernmental. It meets sometimes at ministerial, sometimes at official
level, and the chair is taken by the state holding the EC presidency at the
time.
That business of the rotating presidency is often cited as a weakness in the
EC's constitution. It puts, one is told, an excessive burden on the
bureaucracies of small states, such as Luxembourg, that are not really up to
the task.
How lucky then, you may think, that this acute phase of the Yugoslav crisis
coincides with the presidency of a large state whose bureaucracy is the envy
of the world. Presumably the UK has taken advantage of this circumstance to
get a hold on all the issues involved and hammer out a co-ordinated European
response.
Alas, that is not the impression gained by people working in other EC
governments, or in NGOs, or in intergovernmental organisations. Nor do
British civil servants themselves seem unduly proud of their achievements in
this respect.
My own attempt to find out what they were doing revealed, mainly, that there
is little co-ordination even within the British government. In fact, their
response was rather similar to that of their political masters when
confronted with the 'Iraqgate' scandal: they start by explaining that,
whatever your particular question is, it should properly be answered by a
different department.
The east European department of the Foreign Office has relinquished all
responsibility for Yugoslavia to a special unit set up for the duration of
the British presidency. There is some sense in that. But the unit in
question doesn't deal with the refugee issue. In fact that issue itself is
split in two. There is aid to the refugees still in the area, which is
handled by the Overseas Development Administration and the UN department of
the Foreign Office; and there is admission (or non-admission) of refugees
into EC countries, which is handled by the Home Office.
It would be unfair to suggest that the various officials involved never
speak to each other. In fact it seems there is a daily meeting on Yugoslavia
at the Foreign Office, and that as often as two or three days a week it is
chaired by a minister, Mr Douglas Hogg. But the least one can say is that Mr
Hogg has not yet instilled into those working under him a strong sense of
urgency or common purpose.
Foreign Office officials complain that the Home Office makes the agreed
asylum policy sound even less generous than it is, by quoting only the
figure of 150 families whom Britain has agreed to take 'in the first
instance'. Certainly it is clear enough that the Home Office's main concern
remains, as always, to limit to the minimum the number of foreigners allowed
into Britain on any pretext whatsoever. But why does the Home Office always
win in any argument with the Foreign Office?
More important, why is this whole crisis being dealt with as an argument
between EC member governments, and between departments within those
governments? Why are political leaders not getting together to work out an
answer to it, as a matter of urgency, as they surely would if a real atomic
bomb had been dropped on Sarajevo?

Monetary policy, Maastricht, Miners, Matrix Churchill, Mellor's Mistress,

The theatrical world gathered in strength yesterday at the actors' church,

Hobson, long the drama critic of the Sunday Times, and the man who helped
build the reputations of such writers as Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter.
It is not only for his enthusiasm that Hobson is remembered; he also knew
about seat prices. 'If you have only 17 shillings and sixpence left in the
world,' he once wrote, 'go and see Waiting for Godot. If you have 35
shillings, see it twice.' Beckett's play was thus saved from being
prematurely withdrawn from the London stage.

Many viewers and listeners must be wondering why the BBC's future is yet

public discontent with the radio and television services provided by the
corporation.
But with its 15-year royal charter due to expire on December 31 1996, action
is inevitable. The question is: should the new charter involve radical
change or comfortable continuity? Will Britain be best served for another 15
years by a vertically integrated corporation with more than 20,000
employees, two TV channels, five or six national radio services and a thick
network of local radio stations, all of it funded by a licence fee on TV set
ownership.
The fundamental case in favour of continuity is that the market cannot
provide a service of BBC range and quality anywhere near so efficiently. The
BBC, its defenders argue, is a worldwide success story and one of the
glories of British popular culture; it is also a bulwark against the
domination of the UK media by global barons, whose motivation is commercial
and whose political centre of gravity may not, collectively, be that of the
nation's. Also, the BBC remains popular - it is used by more than 90 per
cent of households at least once a week - and relatively cheap. For Pounds
80 a year or 22p a day, it costs less than a first-class stamp or a copy of
the Daily Mirror.
Its stability is also valued by its competitors. With the new ITV franchise
holders about to commence operations in January, some burdened with
over-optimistic revenue projections, many ITV bosses think the BBC should be
left alone, to supply quality competition as a benchmark for ITV and, of
course, to keep the BBC's fingers out of the advertising pie. Even the
satellite broadcasters, led by Rupert Murdoch, have softened their attacks
on the BBC, perhaps fearing a new broadcasting regime which might free the
BBC to compete more effectively in satellite and subscription services.
These conservative sentiments in the BBC debate are also, more or less, in
political vogue. Mrs Thatcher, who alternately terrorised and disdained the
corporation, is gone. Mr Major and his senior colleagues are open in their
admiration and, already well endowed with controversies, unlikely to seek
another one by dismantling the BBC. That is why the green paper published
yesterday is such a cautious document.
Unlike, for example, the study of the BBC by the Peacock Committee in 1986
and the Broadcasting White Paper which followed it in 1988, the green paper
does not take seriously the idea of a change in the way the BBC is funded.
Broadcasting House's response, which is due tomorrow, is expected to accept
the paper's proposed terms of engagement and confines itself to proposing
reforms of limited scope, such as improving efficiency and amending the
corporation's governance.
The upshot seems certain to be a continuation of the licence fee, rising at
slightly less than the rate of inflation, supporting a more or less
unchanged range of services, albeit with a slightly more upmarket and
distinctive flavour. To fill the small gap created by an RPI minus X annual
uprating of the licence fee, the BBC will need to raise more money from
other activities, such as selling its programmes to other broadcasters, and
to make itself more efficient. It is a perfectly workable plan.
But those who admire the BBC and want its sort of programmes to continue to
be made and broadcast well into the next century ought to question this new
consensus, which is in danger of fixing the BBC on a path of genteel
decline. The root of the trouble is the licence fee, to which the BBC has a
fatal addiction.
The problem is that consumers want additional broadcasting services, by
cable and satellite. Already 3m homes are connected to these new
broadcasters and if you add to these 'subscription services' other forms of
television, such as video, the licence fee starts to appear a fragile figure
in the broadcasting landscape.
According to projections carried out for the BBC (see chart), subscription
revenues for the industry will this year surpass those raised by the licence
fee for the first time; by 2000, they will be double licence fee revenues.
In households which have cable and satellite TV, the BBC is today winning a
viewing share of less than 30 per cent, compared with the 47 to 48 per cent
it has traditionally taken of the ITV-BBC duopoly market.
With commendable frankness, these same BBC studies project that even with a
fully RPI-linked licence fee, the BBC's share of the national TV audience
will have fallen from the 48 per cent in the late 1980s to 30 per cent in
2000 and about 20 per cent by 2010. It is impossible to imagine those who
draft the next charter for the BBC at about that time supporting a poll tax
of the airwaves to pay for services of such minority appeal.
The market economist's response to this scenario might well be: fine, by
then Britain will have a profusion of channels and the licence fee and the
BBC can happily be allowed to wither away. Britain would then have US-style
TV; if it wanted a tax-funded broadcaster at all, it should only be a
US-style operation, meeting minority, mainly highbrow needs.
At the other end of the spectrum, there are those who argue that the correct
response to this dilemma is simply to give the BBC more money - RPI plus X,
rather than minus. But this hardly seems politically credible, even if it
were desirable: one legitimate aim of broadcasting policy is to widen the
creative base of British broadcasting. This is at least as strong an
argument as its direct opposite: that Britain needs a strong BBC as a kind
of cultural hearthrug where the country can receive entertainment and
information in a way that binds and stimulates the nation.
A more plausible response is to say that the American-style broadcasting
scene is not for Britain: given that even the huge economic resources of the
US have been able to support, in TV terms, a great deal more mediocrity than
excellence. For its size, Britain's broadcasting industry has sustained a
high and acknowledged level of quality.
But how could this broadcasting service be funded, if not by a licence fee?
The short answer is from a mixture of sources, as public broadcasting
services are in many other countries, so that all its financial (and
therefore political) eggs are not in one basket. Of course, this is not a
straightforward matter, since attention must be paid to the effect of
limited access to advertising for, say BBC 1, Radio 1 (pop music) and Radio
2 (light music) on their commercial competitors.
The same is true of subscription. It may well be that BBC 2 in something
like its present form could be funded directly by a mix of subscription and
advertising in the next decade. Or it may be that the BBC has a contribution
to make by launching new services on satellite, making fuller use of its
expertise and large resource base in certain areas: perhaps an arts channel,
a children's channel or a news channel, perhaps involving the kind of
alliances with other UK broadcasters from which the BBC is currently barred.
There is also no reason why BBC TV, which must now take a quarter of its
programmes from independents, should not itself sell programmes to other
terrestrial broadcasters.
The point is that the BBC needs to be as creatively free and strong as
possible. An institution doomed to genteel decline, with continuously
shrinking resources, is unlikely to be brimming with self-confidence or able
to attract the best talent. Likewise, the BBC needs managerial freedom, not
only to deal with its notorious overmanning and top-heavy bureaucracy, but
to chase new markets, to seek new horizons.
The obvious way forward is some form of privatisation, within an appropriate
framework of regulation and accountability. It will be objected that a
privatised BBC would be compelled to become exactly like ITV - driven by
ratings to make only safe, bankable programmes. This would be true only if
the BBC followed ITV into total reliance upon advertising, something as
impractical as it is undesirable.
If the BBC were to be funded partly by advertising, partly by subscription
and partly by subsidy, perhaps delivered by a public service broadcasting
council also empowered to support worthwhile public service broadcasting
activities on other channels, it would acquire an autonomy it has sometimes
lacked. It would also have the chance to make as important a contribution in
broadcasting's second century as it did in its first.
There is another point. Since the National Freight Corporation was
privatised with great success in 1982, hardly any serious thought has been
given to the place of employee share-ownership in the privatisation process.
If an employee-driven privatisation scheme can work well in road haulage,
then why not for the BBC, where a decisive asset will always be the quality
of its management and its staff. Such a change would need careful planning
and timing and could even be applied selectively; what is right for Radio
One is not necessarily best for Radio Three.
By 2005, Britain might have a thriving terrestrial commercial television
service, an enlarged satellite and cable sector and a BBC, still partly
funded from the public purse, vigorously playing its part in all these
areas, as well as in domestic and global radio. This BBC would take its
place within a single regulatory framework for the whole of broadcasting.
There would, of course, be a risk that a new BBC would make mistakes,
perform badly, lose money and decline. That would be the risk, but at least
it would be a risk placed squarely on the shoulders of BBC staff and
shareholders. One thing is certain: the corporation's staff would no longer
resist efficient working practices or tolerate a superfluous bureaucracy.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Restructuring Europe's steel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been a good week for the EC steel industry. After yesterday's
inconclusive meeting of industry ministers, the European Commission still
proposes spending more than Pounds 700m on helping steelmakers shut down
their surplus capacity. It also aims to impose duties on steel imports from
eastern Europe. A central myth of the Community is thus perpetuated: that
steel, like agriculture, is different. Other humdrum industries such as
brickmaking or engineering can fend for themselves. Steel has a special and
mysterious call upon the public purse.
The use of taxpayers' money to make good the steel industry's planning
errors seems particularly objectionable at a time when individual EC states
are already faced with ballooning deficits. The vexing thing is that the
alternative could be worse. Nearly half the EC's steel capacity is state
owned. In several member states, closing steel plants risks antagonising
regional minorities. In the absence of an EC-wide deal, individual states
might respond by stepping up their subsidies. If - as seems not impossible -
the most heavily subsidised plants were also the least economic, bad
capacity could end up driving out good.
But if public money is to be spent, the taxpayer is entitled to certain
things in return. When the European economy finally revives, the pressure to
cut capacity should be maintained. The forecast for underlying steel demand
in the mature economies of the EC is flat. There is also less scope for
export to developing countries, which are busy building steel mills of their
own.
It thus cannot be assumed that the industry, if left to itself, will return
to prosperity in the next upturn. Indeed, its brief burst of profitability
in the late 1980s may well prove an anomaly, based as it was on a quite
abnormal boom in the building industry. The main thing is that EC taxpayers
should not find themselves footing the bill yet again in the next recession.
The other important quid pro quo for taxpayers is that they should not be
denied access to steel from eastern Europe. EC steelmakers claim that
dumping from Czechoslovakia and Poland is ruining their market. But the
eastern share of the EC market is now running at about 5 per cent, which
scarcely seems material in the context of EC overcapacity of 30 per cent. As
for dumping, the charge is hard to prove when there is no real means of
measuring the true cost of eastern European production. And if, as is
sometimes alleged, eastern producers are spoiling the market inadvertently
by selling their output more cheaply than they need to, the answer is for
the western producers to educate them in marketing.
The more fundamental point is that eastern Europe needs hard currency if it
is to import the equipment necessary to modernise its economies. Steel,
along with textiles and agricultural produce, is one of the few things it
can export. Part of the strain this imposes on the market is transitory,
since a good half of eastern capacity is reckoned to be obsolete. And after
all, the most important single way to stave off disaster in the eastern
economies is to boost bilateral trade. Steel seems as good a place to start
as any.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Personal View: Boards with backbone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN LIPTON and JAY LORSCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate governance in the US is not working the way it should. The problem
is not the system of laws, regulations and judicial decisions which are the
framework of corporate governance, but the failure by too many boards of
directors to make the system work properly.
Chancellor William Allen of the Delaware Court of Chancery, a leading
judicial scholar on corporate law, argues that boards too often ignore a
basic responsibility: 'the duty to monitor the performance of senior
management in an informed way'. To do this, he says, board members should
play an active role in formulating the company's long-term goals. 'They
should as well engage in the periodic review of short and long-term
performance according to plan and be prepared to press for correction when
in their judgment there is need.'
Our proposal, along similar lines, does not require big changes in what
well-advised companies are already doing. It would not require any changes
in laws or regulations. Nor does it require institutional investors to
become patient, long-term shareholders, participating in corporate
governance - however desirable that might be.
The key elements are:
Board size and composition. We recommend a smaller board - no more than 10
directors - with a ratio of at least two independent directors to each
management director. An independent director is someone who does not have a
substantial business connection with the company and is not an executive of
another company which has an executive of the first company serving on its
board. There should be term limits and a mandatory retirement age for
independent directors. Audit, compensation and nominating committees should
consist only of independent directors.
Meetings. Boards should meet at least every two months, with one meeting
each year being a two or three-day strategy session. Directors should
undertake a day of additional preparation for each meeting. Directors'
compensation should be increased and most should serve on no more than three
boards.
Lead director. Where one person is chief executive and chairman, the
independent directors should choose a lead director from their ranks. The
lead director should consult with the chief executive on the selection of
board committee members, setting agendas, the adequacy of information
furnished to directors and the board meeting process. The lead director
should also co-ordinate an annual assessment of corporate performance and an
evaluation of the chief executive. The lead director would chair the board
if the chief executive were absent or if the independent directors were
meeting alone.
Information. To monitor the company's performance in relation to its
long-term strategic, financial and organisational goals, directors need a
broader array of data than the financial reports they typically receive. We
recommend that boards consider a range of measures of performance such as
profitability, market position, productivity, product leadership, personnel
development, employee attitudes, public response and balance between
short-term and long-term goals.
Performance evaluation. This falls into three parts. First, there should be
an annual assessment of the company's long-term financial, strategic and
organisational performance in relation to the goals established by
management and the board. Second, there should be an annual evaluation of
chief executive performance, which might include extraordinary initiatives
such as: developing and selecting a successor; international expansion;
acquisitions; and joint ventures.
The assessment and evaluation would be done by the independent directors and
co-ordinated by the lead director. Third, there should be an annual
evaluation by the board of its own performance. The board and shareholders.
Companies should provide an annual informal setting in which the larger
shareholders can meet directly with the board of directors. This meeting is
intended to improve understanding between institutional shareholders and
directors.
We also recommend that, if in three of the past five years a company failed
to meet its plans or goals, suffered losses or underperformed the market or
its peer group, a special section of the annual report describing the causes
of the problems and the actions taken to deal with them should be prepared
under the supervision of the independent directors. When a company's
underperformance triggers such a special report, we would permit big
shareholders to communicate to other shareholders their views through the
proxy statement.
All of our proposals can be adopted by individual boards of directors with
no more than changes in bylaws and boardroom procedures. We believe they
provide an effective means for improving corporate governance, and
strengthening the performance and the competitive position of US companies.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Polish deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL Monetary Fund has tacitly passed over Poland's inability
to cut its budget deficit this year and agreed a new letter of intent, thus
showing its faith in the government's ability to restrain spending and raise
tax revenues in 1993. The deal is excellent news for Poland.
At the same time, it places a good deal of responsibility on the Polish
parliament, which has previously rejected government demands for a cut in
pensions and other social payments. These cuts will be essential, however,
if Poland is to honour next year's agreed budget deficit limit of 5.1 per
cent of GDP. Simultaneously, the Polish government, just like the
governments of other 'fast-track' reforming countries of central Europe,
must put high priority on the introduction of modern income and value-added
tax systems, in order to replace the primitive turnover and profit tax
systems inherited from the communist past.
Given progress on both fronts, Poland should be able to cut spending and
raise tax revenue sufficiently to meet the new IMF target, particularly
against the background of a recovery in industrial output and a strong
balance of payments. But hopes of recovery also depend on the state of the
German and other EC economies next year. EC governments must allow east and
central European countries such as Poland to increase their exports, without
the sort of anti-dumping action invoked recently in the case of steel pipe
imports.
Agreement on the new Dollars 660m IMF loan arrangement for Poland is
important to Polish recovery in several ways. Warsaw needs the IMF seal of
approval before Poland's official creditors can proceed with the second
stage of the overall 50 per cent reduction in official debt agreed in March
1991. Just as important, an IMF agreement should pave the way for a
resumption of negotiations with Poland's private bank creditors, to whom it
owes around Dollars 12bn.
Many commercial banks, who have received only Dollars 100m in interest since
the autumn of 1989, were unhappy with the terms of the official debt
reduction. In particular, they will be seeking to recoup as much as possible
of the Dollars 3bn unpaid interest which has accumulated over the years.
Poland's inability to settle with its bank creditors remains a big obstacle
to the foreign equity investment that Poland needs. Once the IMF deal is
finalised, Warsaw should waste no time in seeking a reasonable deal from the
banks.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Terror uninsured
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE THE bombing of the Commercial Union building in the City of London in
April, it has become clear that the insurance industry is reluctant to
provide cover against acts of terrorism in mainland Britain. The large
continental reinsurance groups, which underwrote much of the estimated
Pounds 800m cost of the CU bombing, have little remaining appetite for such
business. British insurers lack the capital to take the full risk onto their
own books. The question is whether the government will have to act as an
underwriter of last resort.
The insurance problems arising from terrorism in mainland Britain are a
direct concern chiefly for a small number of high-profile companies and
institutions. These companies bear a disproportionate share of the cost of
maintaining stable business conditions for the community as a whole. Yet
less vulnerable businesses, which derive benefits from a stable trading
environment, are understandably reluctant to pay higher premiums after the
bombing of a giant City office block. The case for government involvement is
that the private sector cannot achieve an equitable sharing of the costs of
maintaining stability in conditions that occasionally border on war.
The government has been obliged to accept the logic of this argument in
Northern Ireland, where criminal damage compensation arrangements have
existed since the late 1960s. But it is not inclined to extend it to the
mainland for understandable reasons. One is that ministers might be accused
of 'giving in to terrorism'. Another is cost. Yet terrorism wins a far
bigger victory if Britain's leading companies are forced to constrain their
operations to cope with the terrorist threat; if large office blocks sustain
falls in value because they cannot be insured against terrorist acts; and if
foreign financial institutions are tempted to take their operations to other
financial centres in the European time zone where insurance is more readily
obtainable. The point of compensation is that it neuters the economic impact
of terrorist violence - a case not of acquiescence but of countering
terrorism by other means.
The government cannot be blamed for seeking to minimise the bill: the
potential liability in mainland Britain is palpably greater than in Northern
Ireland. Meanwhile, lengthy discussions drag on between representatives of
British industry, insurance providers and the government to look for a
middle way whereby public-sector financial support could be harnessed to a
market framework, so reducing the cost to the state.
The problem is that the market has already fought shy, because no actuary
can assess the risk of how often further bombings may occur and to what
effect. That suggests that a halfway house will be difficult to achieve: if
the risk is uncommercial, establishing a basis for sharing it between public
and private sector will be a nightmare. Whether or not the government falls
back on the approach adopted in Northern Ireland, there can be no escape
from some form of state involvement. It may be an uncomfortable role, but it
is a proper one for government.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Arts: The spirit of Windsor is lost - William Packer puts
forward a personal view of the damage wreaked by the fire at the castle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The loss from the fire at Windsor castle has nothing to do with Heritage,
that now hateful, vulgar, sentimental word. Nor is it about the cost of
repairs, nor the loss of objects and artefacts, however wonderful. The loss
I feel as one who spent his boyhood in the shadow of that great tower is
harder to explain: an enormous, possibly irreparable, damage to the spirit
of the place and what it represents to Englishmen.
Samuel Pepys called Windsor: 'The most romantic castle that is in the
world'. It is also the largest inhabited castle in the world, and has been
in continuous habitation, since the time of the William the Conqueror. It
is, by any measure, extraordinary and wonderful.
Even as the flames swept through the great hall on Friday night, television
announcers were meanly asking how much it would all cost; and the row about
who will pay continues in Parliament and elsewhere. Good God: could they not
see that some 900 years of our common history has gone up in smoke. Yes, I
admit, I take the disaster personally. For those of us who lived in the
town, that familiar towering silhouette was always present, as constant as
Fuji-san is to a Japanese or the Eiffel Tower to a Parisian. I saw it from
my bedroom window, on my way to school, from the Great Park, from the forest
at Dedworth, or away across the Brocas and along the river from Boveney
Lock. There it would be, through the trees, around every corner.
But it would change, too, with every shift of the clouds and mood of the
weather. I remember it in the long damp week between the death of the King
and his funeral, so quiet and still, shrouded in the mists of early
February. Most of all I remember the funeral itself, we children standing at
the top of the Long Walk inside the Park gates, the crunch of wheels and
feet on the gravel, the shadowy, veiled figures in the closed coach, the
bands, the shouted orders coming towards us through the mist, past us and
away, the minute guns, boom, boom, in the Park: and all the while the white
looming walls of the Castle just barely visible through the fog.
I would often go into the Castle, a marvellously safe place for a schoolboy
to be when he shouldn't be, with nothing better to do than slope off for a
smoke and to admire the view. I would go up the Round Tower, or pay my
sixpence to go into the Curfew Tower with its clock and dungeons, or
perhaps, late in the afternoon, slip into St George's to hear sung Evensong.
One special game, at the height of the tourist season, was to go out along
the North Terrace, just where the fire has destroyed St George's Hall, to
where one long queue was waiting to go into the State Apartments, and
another, even longer, was waiting to see The Queen's Dolls' House. I would
walk alone between the two lines and up to the barrier, which, after a low,
brief exchange, would be unhooked to let me pass. 'Yes sir? You wish to see
the drawings, sir? Of course. This way, sir.' Insufferable.
I felt, as many others did, intensely proprietorial about the place. I too
had - still have - a Windsor Castle of my very own - ancient, familiar,
comfortable, romantic, fixing the present so very firmly in the continuous
historic past. And it is a feeling about the place itself, and the town
which grew up around it, and the countryside of river and park beyond, and
the people who made it what it is.

Thriller writer PD James is the subject of Bookmark (8.10 BBC2). After a

out to work when her husband's schizophrenia worsened, and rose from
hospital administrator to the Home Office. Only at the age of 40 did she
create Det. Chief Insp. Adam Dalgliesh who subsequently became a television

For years there have been hints in Private Eye of the possible involvement
of Margaret Thatcher's son Mark in armament deals. Today Dispatches looks at
what part he 'may' have played in the sale of equipment to Iraq (9.00 C4).
There were lots of sniffy reactions to Episode 1 of Guy Hibbert's serial
Nice Town because it's all about sex. It opened with a wet nurse being
relieved of her burden by a keenly co-operative chap on a train, and
proceeded via sperm donation, teenage sex in a garden shed, and abortion, to
a black suspender seduction scene in an 'Elizabethan' hotel where the staff
'thee' and 'thou' you.
Perhaps it was the lack of reassuringly familiar violence that offended
people. It is edgy but often funny (9.25 BBC2).

FT  25 NOV 92 / Arts: The Nutcracker - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is going to be a hard winter. There are the brightest berries on my
holly-bush; Santa, damn him, is already lurking in some stores; and I have
sighted the first Nutcracker of the season in Wimbledon. As any observer
will tell you, the earlier you see that harbinger of doom, the worse the
season is going to be. This particular manifestation of Yuletide merriment
is owed to the Moscow City Ballet, returned to our shores with yet another
quaint recension of a ballet classic, thanks to the ingenuities of its
director, Victor Smirnov-Golovanov.
The programme book states, with unwavering gaze, that Mr Smirnov-Golovanov
aims 'to teach his young company the original ideas of the great 19th
century choreographers, with none of the later additions and changes. He
encourages his dancers to use their own character delineations whilst
adhering faithfully to the original choreography'. If only] The most
original idea about this Nutcracker is that Smirnov-Golovanov's choreography
is 'after the original by Marius Petipa'. Since the original choreography -
as the Royal Ballet has largely reproduced it from contemporary notation -
is by Lev Ivanov, we are immediately faced with problems of credibility.
Since what Smirnov-Golovanov provides is, at best, dull stuff, dully danced,
belief is further strained. Petipa it ain't - nor yet Ivanov.
The evidence would suggest, as on the troupe's last two visits, that this is
a minor company whose existence is owed to its ability to tour, efficiently
if not especially creditably, shrunken versions of the classics that will
appeal to audiences who do not have much occasion to see more gifted
ensembles. Smirnov-Golovanov has a well-drilled female corps de ballet, some
weedy chaps, and performances are made interesting for aficionados when he
acquires an important guest artist: Semenyaka in 1991; Yury Posokhov earlier
this year. Both dancers were beings from another planet in the context of
the company's regular personnel.
In this new production, Smirnov-Golovanov has somewhat complicated
Nutcracker's dramatic argument. The magician, Drosselmeyer, obtrudes
confusingly through the action, and at one moment seems about to embark upon
a menage a trois with Clara and her Nutcracker Prince. The second act is now
a Kingdom of Flowers rather than of sweets - an unexceptionable change were
it not for the fact that Drosselmeyer is given a mimsy solo to the Mirlitons
music, which introduces a wild element of farce into the proceedings. (It
was danced with effulgent winsomeness by Dmitri Romanov, who is not my ideal
as a Drosselmeyer anyway).
Other performances are dutiful: on Monday night I saw Elvira Rikova as Clara
and Yevgeny Mamrenko as her prince. The dancing which I most enjoyed came
from Natalia Yakovleva as the Flower Fairy, suggesting wider artistic
horizons, and a more elegant technique, than was generally on view. The
'character delineations', mentioned in the programme, looked pretty odd
during the opening scene: for part of the time we might have been at a
meeting of Cross-dressers Anonymous instead of a Christmas party. Design by
Natalia Povago is the triumph of nylon - though the Flower Fairy has a
beautiful tutu. The score is adequately played. Stylistically, the whole
affair is dismal.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Arts: It's a funny thing, comedy - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may seem like a fool's game to try to provide an over-view of comedy in a
week when a comedian as renowned as Rowan Atkinson has come such a cropper
attempting something similar. In the first of his six-part BBC2 series Funny
Business Atkinson tried to have things both ways. On the one hand he sought
to send up the idea of solemnly analysing comedy by adopting the role of an
owlish Oxford don giving a lecture on the subject. Nigel Planer has proved
exhaustively that this sort of gag works in small quantities: two minutes,
OK; five minutes, maybe; 55 minutes, disaster.
On the other hand Atkinson seems to have genuine ambitions to teach us all
about comedy. He told us that it was to do with mimicry, parody, things
being unnaturally big, unnaturally fast, spooky, appearing suddenly,
disappearing suddenly, exaggeration, humiliating surprises, causing offence,
spreading confusion, role reversal, embarrassment, and much more. The
absurdity of this catalogue, which merely proved that you could find comedy
in anything, never seems to have occured to him. (No, it was not the silly
don who was so blind, it was Atkinson - or his script writers). Worse,
Atkinson seems to believe that his own physical comedy style bears
comparison with those of Chaplin, Tati, Cleese and even the master, Keaton.
It does not. Though I have smiled occasionally at his silent sketches, far
more often when I see Mr Bean I feel embarrassed for Mr Atkinson.
However, it is not the purpose of this column to puzzle out why we laugh at
the pratfall (the best in Funny Business was from David Jason, leaning
nonchalantly on a non-existent bar in Only Fools And Horses). The question
people are always asking television critics is 'Why aren't there any really
funny series around any more, you know, like Fawlty Towers and Dad's Army
and Steptoe And Son?'
The first answer is that all those series are still with us and are being
re-run either on the new repeats channel, UK Gold (now available to dish
owners free from the Astra satellite, though eventually we shall have to
pay; at midnight on Saturday I bumped into The Young Ones and stayed for
Three Of A Kind, the series which really established Lenny Henry and where
Tracey Ullman last did consistently good work) or they are being repeated on
one of the terrestrial channels, or they are available for a pittance from
your local video shop.
The second answer is that if only we would take off our rose tinted
spectacles and look carefully at today's television we would find that there
is much more comedy than in the days of Harold Steptoe or even Basil Fawlty;
that it is more varied in form, length and style; and that the best of it
does stand comparison with the greats of old. No doubt 20 years from now our
children will be saying to their children 'Of course you don't remember TV
comedy in the good old days. Do you know, there was a time when new series
of Drop The Dead Donkey, Red Dwarf, Waiting For God and The Golden Girls all
began in the same year'.
If we do limit ourselves to sitcoms there are some splendid examples around.
Waiting For God is not only top of the present heap but one of the best
ever: writer Michael Aitkens will brave any subject from euthanasia to
childbirth, forcing himself into superb displays of knife-edge balancing,
avoiding both pathos and bathos; the acting from Stephanie Cole and Graham
Crowden is as good as you will find anywhere in British drama; and you know
you are onto something special when supposedly subordinate characters such
as those played by Daniel Hill and Janine Duvitski are given lines like
these: 'Tom Bower, what was he doing throwing a boomerang from a moving
train?' 'Testing Einstein's theory of relativity'. 'Einstein? Who's he,
another troublemaker?' 'A scientist and philosopher who theorised that the
space-time continuum was probably a curve'. 'Oh that Einstein'. 'Tom, by
throwing an object that curves naturally in flight, was trying to show that
it would return to the same place a second before it left'. 'And what
happened?' 'It broke the window of the buffet car'.
Jennifer Saunders' new BBC2 series, Absolutely Fabulous, about a couple of
1960s freaks working in the fashion business has been rolling-about funny so
far, though it may be showing its limitations after only two episodes. As
the sloshed Sloane, Joanna Lumley steals every scene she appears in. The New
Statesman, just returned to ITV with Rik Mayall as Alan B'Stard, a greedy,
callous, randy, power-mad Tory politician, would never have got near the
public airwaves in the days before Spitting Image, a series which is a prime
example of how television comedy has diversified. Even further over the
edge, dealing almost entirely in the currency of outrage, is the other
Mayall series, Bottom, which he shares with his old partner Adrian Edmondson
 -the second batch was a huge improvement on the first, being on a par with
the best of The Young Ones - and also Channel 4's Australian import, Let The
Blood Run Free, most of which is spoiled by being too studiously
preposterous.
But why limit our consideration to sitcoms, or indeed the other conventional
forms? True, we still have double-acts reminding us of the days of Morecambe
and Wise: Hale and Pace who cause me to cringe as much as cackle, and Smith
And Jones who, not yet 40, are beginning to feel like elder statesmen. But
some of the funniest material on television today occurs in forms which did
not exist in the days of Morecambe and Wise. If there were an award for
television's fastest ad-libber it would be contested between Paul Merton on
BBC2's news quiz Have I Got News For You, which is not only one of the
funniest but surely the most legally risky series currently on air, and
Clive Anderson, whose Channel 4 series has taken the drift in chat shows to
its logical conclusion (Dame Edna showed the way) and turned the guests into
a sequence of - seemingly - unscripted feeds.
Laughter is the most straightforward yardstick and I laugh more in front of
series such as Clive Anderson Talks Back, Whose Line Is It Anyway? and Have
I Got News For You than I do in front of BBC1's 'recession sitcom' Get Back,
ITV's 'house husband' sitcom The Upper Hand or Channel 4's cloying American
sitcom The Cosby Show, which between them do not seem to have a single
original thought about the human relationships upon which they concentrate.
The rate of stomach-heaving guffaws is not the only criterion, anyway. One
of the most heartening aspects of current British television is the
development of the comedy drama series where the humour is often more subtle
and subdued and there is no audience bursting with laughter out of a blue
sky as there is in series such as Last Of The Summer Wine. In ITV's Gone To
Seed, a sort of sequel to Gone To The Dogs, Jim Broadbent, Warren Clarke and
Alison Steadman play cockney triplets who are done out of their inheritance
by the evil Wesley (Peter Cook having rather too much of a good time). Nice
Town on BBC2 dares to take sex as its central theme and, despite immaculate
production values and some delicious tongue-in-cheek humour, has
consequently already taken something of a drubbing from the more tender
flowers among television critics.
Best of all, however, is BBC1's Look At It This Way which is like a cross
between Old Men At The Zoo and Capital City with the quirks and expert
dialogue of the first combined with the post modernist feel (Docklands
locations, fading yuppy attitudes, brittleness, knowingness) of the second.
It is rare to find a drama which paints a truly accurate picture of even
some aspects of the world you live in. To find one which manages so many of
them and is also very funny is quite extraordinary . . . and nothing
unnaturally big or unnaturally fast in sight, let alone a pratfall.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Arts: Elisabeth II - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Gate Theatre in Notting Hill has achieved the distinction of being
heavily oversubscribed on a wet Monday night even for such an unpromising
play as Thomas Bernhard's Elisabeth II. The first half consists of a
seemingly endless monologue in the style of an ageing Austrian Jimmy Porter
without the jokes, but it is necessary to sit through it in order to
appreciate the second.
What Austria in general and Vienna in particular did to Bernhard to deserve
such spleen is never clear. He was born, the illegitimate son of an Austrian
mother, in Holland in 1931. Most of his education took place in Austria. He
died in 1989, having written about 20 plays, but is scarcely known in
Britain.
This is psychological guesswork, but I suspect that the underlying theme of
Elisabeth II is a lament that Austria is not what it used to be. Bernhard
would have preferred the old imperial splendour and the intellectual life
that sometimes went with it. The Elisabeth in question is not Elisabeth of
Austria but the Queen of England paying a state visit to Vienna in the late
1950s. All Viennese society turns out to see her.
The Queen does not appear. Instead we have the rich, disabled Herr
Herrenstein whose apartment is being used to view the Queen from the
balcony. He is a cantankerous old man who lost his lower legs in a driving
accident. In the first act he rants about the decline of Austria and the old
civilisation. From his references to Schopenauer, Hegel and Kant, he is very
well-educated. He is also intolerably rude to his servants and professes
near-total misanthropy.
The part is played with immense self-confidence by Julian Curry, yet the
monologue is heavy going by any standards. Then suddenly it turns out that
the old man has life, even affection, in him after all. He is concerned that
his long-standing manservant Richard (Ian Gelder) is about to desert him.
Although he is on stage throughout, Richard has barely a dozen lines:
Gelder's performance, showing his white gloves and the occasional movement
of the eyebrows, is a gem.
There is also a philosopher friend called Guggenheim, played by Barry
Wallman, who has spent his most creative years in Oxford. In his presence
Herrenstein becomes a different man, capable of kindness and friendship. It
looks remarkably like hero worship of the civilising influence of an English
university.
As the Queen's approach nears, the stage fills up with a cocktail party to
see her. Here is the Austrian society which Herrenstein despises, though
again there is an exception in Countess Gudenus (Eileen Page) who is not
only beautiful, but appreciates Guggenheim's writing.
The end is startling, yet ambiguous. The balcony collapses with nearly all
the people on it. a Herrenstein might have plotted this all along, or
equally Richard might have finally push his master over the edge. At any
rate the last half hour or so has been worth waiting for. The direction and
designs are by David Fielding and the translation by Meredith Oakes. About
half of act one should be cut.
Gate Theatre, London W11 until December 12 (071) 229 0706

FT  25 NOV 92 / Management: Better safe than sorry when you go to work / A
look at a series of new regulations that will soon be affecting UK employers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers will wake up to seven new sets of safety regulations on January 1
next year, governing a range of workplace issues from lifting loads to
visual display units.
Latest figures show that an average of nine workers are killed each week in
Britain and there are about 1.4m work-related injuries every year, the
Health and Safety Commission (HSC) announced at the launch of Workplace
Health and Safety Week - the biggest ever drive to improve workplace safety
in the UK which began on Monday.
The regulations have been criticised by the GMB general union which
yesterday said a leaked document showed the Health and Safety Executive had
'looked for ways to water down and block' UK obligations under European law
which the regulations are designed to implement.
The HSC estimates that industry may face costs of Pounds 300m in the first
year of implementing the new laws, although it says that employers that
already meet existing obligations should not find the regulations onerous.
In all cases employers are required to reduce risks 'as far as is reasonably
practicable', which means to the point where the cost of further measures
would be disproportionate to benefits.
Four sets of regulations have already been published for which Health and
Safety Executive guidance is available:
Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations. The main duties for
employers are to assess the health and safety risks to employees and others
who may be affected by their work and act on that assessment; appoint
'competent people' - employees or outsiders - to implement measures; set up
emergency procedures; inform and train employees to avoid risks; monitor
employees' health where necessary and consult employee representatives.
Health and Safety (Display Screen Equipment) Regulations are the first for
VDU screen work and affect all those who habitually use display screen
equipment as a significant part of their normal work.
Employers must assess the risks posed by workstations and reduce them;
ensure that workstations comply with requirements for screens, keyboards,
working environments, task design and software. New workstations will have
to comply immediately; those operating before December 31 1992 have until 31
December 1996.
For direct employees only, employers will have to plan periodic breaks from
screen work, provide eye-tests, special glasses and provide adequate
training. Those who use screens intermittently may not be covered at all.
Manual Handling Operations Regulations will apply to all industries and
services, replacing earlier legislation which applied only to some sectors.
They abandon old weight limits and adopt broad guidelines and an ergonomic
approach.
The main duties on employers are to avoid the need for manual handling
operations involving a risk of injury; make an assessment of the risk of
injury from manual handling and reduce risks.
An amendment to the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations
1988 emphasises the prevention of exposure to carcinogens at work by using
alternative substances or processes and by means of enclosed systems of
work.
Three further sets of regulations are due later this month or early next.
Exact provisions are not yet known, but the main obligations will reflect
the requirements of their parent European directives.
Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations. Employers in all industries
will have to select equipment according to working conditions and hazards;
ensure equipment is suitable, maintained and properly used; give adequate
information and training.
Personal Protective Equipment at Work. Employers will have to assess risks
and ensure personal protective equipment is suitable according to
requirements laid down.
Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations govern a wide range of
issues in permanent workplaces (not building sites) such as temperature,
space and lighting; safety devices for doors, gates and escalators and
requirements for the construction and maintenance of floors.
The HSE has published a leaflet called New Health and Safety at Work
Regulations available from its Freeleaflet line 0742 892346 or the HSE
Information Centre, Broad Lane, Sheffield S3 7HQ.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Management: The network links up - Europe's largest computer
services company is fast being transformed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The vital step from being a company with many international subsidiaries to
becoming a true multinational group can make or break a business.
One company facing just that challenge today is the FFr10bn (Pounds 1.22bn)
turnover Cap Gemini Sogeti (CGS), Europe's largest computer services
company. It is in the throes of trying to turn itself from a loosely
co-ordinated federation of small autonomous branches in 16 countries into a
single coherent group in the midst of the toughest downturn it has ever
experienced.
What CGS is going through provides a valuable example for other companies
facing the same painful transformation, as they adapt their organisations to
the internationalisation of their markets.
'It is a major cultural change, a huge process,' says Geoff Unwin, one of
CGS's presidents responsible for implementing the change. Branch managers
have been asked to pool much of their cherished independence and learn to
work in partnership with other subsidiaries. The key has been to get the
right balance between the dose of centralisation needed to make this
possible, while not harming the independent spirit which fosters vital
creativity in service businesses, CGS executives explain .
The new organisation, presented at a conference of CGS's top 500 managers
last June, has not been easy to set up. Implementation has only just begun,
three years after Serge Kampf, founder and chairman of the 17-year-old
French group, opened an internal debate. The change came in response to
several problems which will strike echoes with other internationally
expanding groups.
CGS's staff has doubled, mainly through acquisitions, to 21,000 over five
years, outstripping the old, highly decentralised organisation.
Its big customers increasingly demand identical computer services in several
countries at once, such as a recent order from BP Oil to harmonise its
national computer systems across Europe. It also faces growing cut-price
competition from computer producers which are diversifying into CGS's core
business because of the downturn in the hardware market.
'The old organisation, a myriad of 50-person branches, was easy to control,'
says Philippe Gluntz, the former Alcatel executive hired three years ago to
lead the re-think. 'All you had to do was to tell them to make a profit and
give customer satisfaction. We now move to a more complex world, where a
50-person branch cannot supply the range of technologies and services that a
customer requires.'
Unwin, former chairman of Hoskyns, the UK group which is CGS's biggest
acquisition, adds: 'We have been through a period of what you might call
strategic assembly, of buying companies and letting them run themselves. Now
we need to be able to operate transnationally.'
The solution, decided after intense internal debate, was to leave the local
branches intact but to organise them into seven so-called 'strategic
business areas (SBAs)' each employing an average of 3,500 people.
The SBAs, each managed by two vice-presidents, are organised along both
geographical and industry sector lines so that different regions specialise
in the sector where they are naturally strong. France handles
telecommunications, for example, while the US handles oil and gas and the UK
is in charge of finance and 'outsourcing' - where corporate customers asks
contractors to manage their entire data processing departments - a
fast-growing part of CGS's business. Each area is then split into seven
so-called 'market development units', which co-ordinate the old branches.
In this way, explains Unwin, an SBA member branch can take an order from a
local customer which might be outside its usual business sector or
geographical area and sub-contract it within the group. Previously, the
local branch might not even have considered trying to win such a contract.
To help different units across the world work on the same projects
coherently, the group has drawn up what Unwin calls a 'highway code' of
common legal and technical definitions. This is supported by CGS's first
cross-group quality control system, christened Perform, which sets common
standards for the kinds of technical solutions customers will be offered and
the conduct of projects. It also defines the scope of contracts.
'We have tried to take the best practice from each unit and apply it across
the group. You can't afford to spend weeks arguing about which kind of
software to use while the competition walks by,' explains Unwin. Perform is
to be operational across the group by the end of this year.
CGS has turned to its own management consultancy arm, Gemini Consulting, to
help spread the message across the group, employing at one stage 500 people
in a joint CGS-Gemini Consulting team. CGS has always had a consultancy
unit, but expanded it substantially two years ago on the grounds that an
increasing number of clients' computer problems had a human management
dimension as well. Gemini Consulting, formed from the merger of three
acquisitions with the group's own team, has 1,500 consultants. Another tool
to encourage more team behaviour has been to alter the pay bonus system from
rewarding individual performance alone, to rewarding sector performance as
well.
In the end, says Unwin, most branch managers realised they had no choice
because the old organisation simply did not fit with the way the industry
was moving.
'The larger companies are grabbing market share, and gradually moving down
to push out smaller players. So you will see a polarisation between big
multinationals and small niche players, active in one country only. The
branch managers knew they would simply be pushed out of the market by this
process unless they took advantage of CGS's internationalisation,' says
Unwin.
CGS had no inkling that it was about to enter the toughest market conditions
it has ever known when it embarked on the rethink. Last year, CGS's profits
fell for the first time - by 10 per cent - due to a reduction in big
customers' investment in computer services and the increase in competition
from computer suppliers. There have, as a result, been staff reductions in
some areas with 500 job losses in France this year.
Surprisingly, Unwin has no regrets about what might look like unfortunate
timing. 'Perversely, these tough market conditions are helping us change.
They make people question what they are doing. It's the trigger we need.'
Other managers in other industries could well benefit from making the most
of bad times while they last.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Business and the Environment: Surviving under fire - The
chlorine industry is taking a beating, but it's not giving up without a
fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chlorine, one of the chemical industry's main building blocks - it is used
in plastics, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals - would be banned if many
environmental campaigners had their way.
Greenpeace has mounted a strong campaign against its use, as has a smaller
UK organisation, the Women's Environmental Network, which has concentrated
on chlorine. But now, after much dithering, the chlorine industry and
manufacturers of products which use the chemical are fighting back.
It is not that their survival is at stake. Chlorine is too important an
ingredient in many modern products - packaging, paint, and insulating
products also contain it - for this to be severely threatened. But pressure
from public opinion against the use of chlorinated substances, especially
where alternatives exist, is taking its toll.
Bob Hunt, managing director of ICI Chlor Chemicals and chairman of Euro
Chlor, the European industry federation, says the industry's growth
prospects are small. Besides the recession, the environmental threat is one
of the main factors constricting the business. 'We certainly won't see the
growth we have enjoyed over the past years,' he said.
John Elkington, an environmental consultant, also foresees tougher times
ahead for the industry. 'I don't see chlorine being flushed out of the
industrial system. But the campaigners have got a strong grip on some parts
of the chemical industry and they will continue squeezing for some time.'
Chlorine is a gas formed by passing electricity through salt. For every
tonne of chlorine made - output in Europe is about 9m tonnes a year - more
than a tonne of caustic soda is produced. Other big producers include
Solvay, Bayer and Akzo.
Throughout the world, chlorine and its derivatives are used to disinfect
drinking water. But its main importance is in the production of other
products, including industrial chemicals.
Some retain chlorine at the end of the process. Chlorinated products like
DDT, PCB and CFCs have been implicated in global environmental problems. And
dioxins - considered to be one of the world's most dangerous group of
poisons - are created when chlorinated substances, such as PVC and PCB, are
burnt at low temperatures.
Furthermore, the traditional method of making chlorine involves mercury.
Small but sometimes dangerous quantities of the metal are emitted as waste
into rivers and the sea. But - as the chemical industry is keen to point out
 -chlorine is an integral part of daily life.
Only small amounts of chlorine are sold on the open market. Most production
goes straight to associated plants which make other products. About half of
the European production is used to make plastics.
Chief among these is PVC which is made by reacting ethylene - derived from
oil - with chlorine. PVC is used, among other things, as packaging to
insulate electrical equipment, and to make window frames. Other plastics
using chlorine include polyurethanes, polycarbonates and epoxy resins.
Chlorine is also an intermediate in the production of titanium dioxide (the
white pigment in paint and toothpaste) and silicones. Chlorinated solvents,
such as perchloroethylene and methlyl chloroform, are widely used as
cleaning agents in industry. Only a small amount (not more than 6 per cent)
of the world's total chlorine production is used to purify water.
The chlorine industry and businesses using products made with it are under
pressure from two related fronts: environmental campaigners want to force
the industry's closure and politicians are trying to control the build-up of
chlorinated waste.
Campaigners have successfully highlighted possible health risks from the use
and disposal of some chlorinated products. Among these are the creation of
dioxins when PVC is burned in municipal incinerators and the production of
potentially harmful by-products when chlorine reacts with other substances.
The industry has answers for most accusations, but the campaigners' position
is strengthened by chlorine's involvement in pollution incidents where there
is no disagreement about the environmental damage caused. These include
CFCs' role in the depletion of the ozone layer and the harmful effect of DDT
and PCBs.
The industry has also had a poor record of voluntarily withdrawing
potentially harmful products. It is, for example, still making and selling
CFCs while it develops alternatives. And it is likely that this will
continue until it becomes illegal to make the product.
Hunt says this attitude is changing. 'We have always withdrawn products
which were demonstrably harmful to people and the environment. If there are
other products like this, then the industry will phase them out as fast as
possible.
'But we also need to be careful that the substitutes are safe. We are not
doing this purely to protect our income. We do have a number of customers
who simply don't know what to do when there are no ready alternatives.'
This view is backed by Robert Smerko of the Chlorine Institute, the US trade
body. But campaigners remain sceptical and point to the industry's continued
manufacture of CFCs as evidence of its recalcitrance.
'Given that companies are still producing CFCs, we do not hold out much hope
that they will withdraw other products in the future. The industry is
playing Russian roulette with the environment,' says Madeleine Cobbing of
Greenpeace.
Yet while the mass of scientific evidence collected by Greenpeace and other
campaigners is startling, its validity is not overwhelming because much of
it is questioned by other scientists. For example, dioxins are probably the
most studied group of poisons in the world, but it is impossible to get an
unequivocal answer from the scientific community about the threat to humans.
However, the campaigners have been winning the public relations battle and
this is reflected in the market. Some large retail chains like Migros in
Switzerland, Tengelmann in Germany, and Ikea of Sweden, have started to
phase out their use of PVC. Some German and Danish local authorities no
longer use PVC in public buildings and hospitals. The paper and pulp
business is also moving away from chlorine bleaching.
These pressures worry the chlorine industry. 'The threat is of sufficient
concern that it is regularly debated at board level. But we are beginning to
get together a balanced set of views to respond to some of the more extreme
accusations made against us,' says Hunt.
Stephen Harriman of Harriman Chemsult, a chemical consultancy, feels the
industry has to defend a diminishing base. 'The industry is having to
retreat in some areas, notably CFCs and pulp bleaching. It might offer the
best product for the job but it is faced with a negative emotional response
from the consumers. Over the next 15 to 20 years, chlorine will probably
retreat into the areas where it has no parallel on quality, such as PVC,
water treatment and chemical synthesis.'

FT  25 NOV 92 / Business and the Environment: Industry heated over CFC ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International agreement to prevent damage to the ozone layer was hailed as
one of the last decade's environmental successes. A further tightening of
the rules is likely to result from a three-day meeting in Copenhagen, ending
today, of the 93 countries which signed the 1987 Montreal Protocol.
But the chemical industry argues that the new rules may be unrealistically
tight by threatening to ban newly discovered substitutes and so jeopardising
future investment.
The thinning of the earth's protective ozone layer was detected in the late
1970s. The depletion has been linked partly to man-made chemicals -
particularly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are used widely in
refrigeration, and halons, used in firefighting. The Copenhagen conference
is likely to advance the date for their phasing out from 2000 to 1996.
Reaction to the 1987 treaty was fast - the developed countries' consumption
of CFCs and halons fell by some 30 per cent between 1986 and 1990.
Mike Harris, external relations manager of ICI's fluorocarbons operation,
expects that by 2000 half of the original CFC market will have gone to
ammonia, propane and other existing chemicals, a sixth to HCFCs (20 to 50
times less damaging than CFCs but five to seven times more costly) and a
third to HFCs, not implicated in ozone damage but claimed to contribute to
global warming.
The scale of that change in the market demanded rapid development by the
producers. Since 1986, Du Pont has invested Dollars 450m (Pounds 300m) to
develop replacements and expects that to reach Dollars 1bn by the end of
1995, when it plans to stop CFC production. It says CFCs accounted for only
1 per cent of its annual revenue of some Dollars 38bn, but it had to find a
replacement as it could not afford to be out of the air-conditioning market.
Du Pont expects the payback on the investment to take at least 10 years.
ICI has spent some Pounds 260m since 1986, particularly on HFCs for car
air-conditioning. It intends to phase out all Montreal Protocol-controlled
chemicals by the end of 1995. Although Harris will not comment on the
payback on that investment, he says it has made cashflow for the division
negative.
Given the scale of their investment, the companies oppose any control of
HCFCs and HFCs. Tony Vogelsberg, Du Pont's environmental manager, says he
does not expect international action yet against HFCs, but this could occur
nationally through concern over global warming. 'We certainly regard our
investment in CFC substitutes as being at risk. Society needs to be careful
or it could block the solutions it is trying to find.'
These arguments do not impress environmental groups. 'It's nonsense - there
are non-damaging alternatives for all these products,' says Chris Rose of
Greenpeace.
The antagonism between environmental groups and chemical companies is one of
the environmental debates' longest-established features. When chemical
companies are coy about the return they expect on their investments, one
should be sceptical of taking at face value their claims that incentives are
not high enough.
But the success of the five years of the Montreal Protocol has been based on
the easy availability of substitutes; the trickiest points in Copenhagen
have come where further substitutes are not available. The chemical
companies' emphasis on the cost of developing alternatives is a useful
reminder that change costs money.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Recruitment: How to compete with the competitors - The 'cult
of winning' that tends to dominate top managements has costs as well as
benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN it comes to rising to the top of a company,what is the Eleventh
Commandment? The answer, if we're to believe the American psychologist
Albert Bernstein, is: 'No one will tell you the first ten.'
In saying as much, he doesn't mean you'll be starved of advice from bosses
and workmates on how to win promotion to the heights. On the contrary,
they'll be feeding it to you all the time.
What he does mean is that the rules and tips which are so spelt out to you,
will rarely if ever be the ones that really work. The reason is that the
minority of your colleagues who know the effective kind, will be too devious
to tell them to a potential rival.
If readers see that claim as over-cynical, all the Jobs column can say is
that Dr Bernstein's book* is the third to reach me in 12 months which has
shed a less than usually flattering light on the abilities needed to mount
the summits of big organisations. The other two were by Swedish professor of
management Nils Brunsson and his US counterpart *Neanderthals at work, co-
authored by Sydney Craft Rozen. John Wiley, Pounds 12.95.
Jeffrey Pfeffer. Moreover, much the same picture emerged from the research
study by Rob Irving, of the Whitehead Mann head-hunting consultancy, which I
reported early in July.
'Once is accident, twice is happenstance, and three times enemy action,'
runs the old army saying. Four times, however, may be getting nearer the
truth.
Albert Bernstein, for his part, maintains that the only way to learn the
real commandments of organisational advancement is by quietly keeping your
eyes on the behaviour of the people who do get ahead. But that is more
easily said than done, he adds, because a good two thirds of us are hindered
by our temperaments from absorbing the lessons such observations teach. And
to show how, he divides the typical company workforce into three broad types
of people.
The worst of the trio for would-be top managers to take as models are the
Rebels even though they are apt to prove indispensable to their company,
especially when crises strike. The most common example nowadays is the
computer-system wizard who instantly solves problems which reduce everyone
else to despair.
Besides being technically expert, the book says, rebels are often creatively
intelligent at what they regard as their job. The snag is that they tend to
see it as consisting solely of things they enjoy doing, which rarely include
routine but necessary procedures such as paperwork. As a result, the rebel
type hardly ever rise far up an established managerial hierarchy - which,
given their typically still scantier patience with people problems, is no
doubt just as well.
No such flaws are found in the second type, the Believers, who are probably
the most numerous of the three, Since they can be relied on to work hard as
well as skilfully even at tasks they dislike, no organisation could survive
without them. They are essential not only to the everyday working
operations, but also to the running of social activities which foster the
company spirit. Moreover, being fair-minded and straightforward in their
dealings with other people, they tend to make the best managers of the sort
extolled by conventional management theory, at least.
Their weakness lies in being what the book describes as 'the original
corporate innocents' who, come what may, stand firm in the faith that
diligent discharge of their duties is sure to earn its due reward. Hence
believers are prone to blame simple injustice rather than any lack of wit on
their part when, as is usually the case, they are passed over for promotion
to the commanding heights.
The type mostly promoted in their stead are the Competitors, described as
devotees of 'the cult of winning'. Unlike believers and rebels, they are
quick to learn how the company system really works as opposed to the way the
formal rules ordain, and then manipulate it to advance their own cause.
Whether or not they are acting in the true corporate interest is at best a
secondary consideration because the urge to win the game personally tends to
blind them to any further purpose it might have. As the book says, they 'see
their world as a conflict, with the strongest emerging as the most
successful, and success as its own justification.'
They have nonetheless at least as good a claim as either of the other types
to indispensability. Their company would be unlikely to survive if it didn't
have their political skill and ruthlessness to wring profitable deals out of
the counterpart competitors heading suppliers and big customers, let alone
to outsmart those running predatory rival concerns.
The trouble is that they also have ill effects. One of several examples
which are cited in the book is that their deviousness about their
manipulations of company systems is apt to vitiate productive change. 'The
only way to make meaningful change in a corporate culture is to be very
specific about what that culture actually is and how it works. The problem
is that the people who could write the explicit rules don't think it's in
their best interest to do so.'
Accordingly, since human societies have never yet found how to rid
competitors of their Machiavellian habits, Bernstein thinks the only hope is
for the other types to learn to match them at their own political game. That
would enable more believers if not rebels to rise to the top, and moderate
the typical present incumbents' harmful tendencies as well as widening their
vision.
True, learning competitors' tricks is far from easy, he says. Winning ploys
vary with outfit. Even so, there are enough widespread ones to supply the
missing 10 commandments. The first is: Watch the doings of successful
colleagues, especially to discover the things superior management values,
which should be given priority over those that go un-recognised, however
useful.
Of the rest, the next three are linked and fairly self-explanatory.
Face down fear of failure.
Ignore personal limitations - hard work usually compensates
Whatever it is, do it now.
A corollary is: Be prepared to sacrifice family life. One way to ease the
strains of absence, the book says, is to be extra communicative when
present.
Then come two items of purely personal sacrifice.
Abandon the need for praise. 'Competitors don't believe in praise and
especially don't see the need to praise other competitors . . . . They
might, however, find other ways to show their approval.'
Abandon self-importance. 'You will have to accept teasing, defer to other
people's opinions and, most of all, to listen when you feel like speaking.'
Next comes: Avoid martyrdom, particularly by working harder to make up for
incompetent bosses or colleagues.
Ninth is: Ask for permission only when strictly necessary, and finally:
Be decisive, which need not entail being prudently analytical beforehand. As
one of the book's case-study characters observes: 'I've learned that it's
not so much what you decide. It's what you do after you decide that's
important. That's what makes it into the right or wrong decision.'

FT  25 NOV 92 / Licence fee likely to be retained: Tory backbenchers call
for new funding structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TELEVISION licence fee is 'likely' to be the basis on which the BBC's
future is to be secured, Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, told
MPs yesterday.
Replying to questions on yesterday's green paper, Mr Brooke said: 'In terms
of financing the BBC, there is no obvious improvement on the licence fee.'
His remarks followed calls from Tory backbenchers to consider implementing a
fee structure that did not oblige viewers to pay for programmes they did not
watch.
Mr Brooke sought to reassure MPs on the government's commitment to
public-service broadcasting, saying 'we strongly envisage' that the concept
would play a key role in the BBC's activities at the end of the consultation
period.
He declined a request from Mr Roy Hattersley, the former Labour deputy
leader, to 'specifically reject' the notion that the BBC might be limited to
a narrow range of programmes. But Mr Brooke said it was important that
Britain should emerge from the consultation with 'a major production base'.
Mrs Ann Clwyd, shadow heritage secretary, said her party remained
'completely committed' to the concept of public-service broadcasting. Labour
would oppose any attempt to privatise the BBC 'even at its edges'.
Mrs Clywd asked whether the government would support index-linking the
licence fee for a minimum of 10 years, as a means of ensuring stability and
enabling the organisation to be 'free from any attempt at editorial control
by the government or anyone else'.
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Robert Maclennan, home affairs spokesman, said
there was a danger the BBC would be put on 'starvation rations' and its
public-sector role attenuated. The BBC's 'firm financial independence' was
the 'basis of its role as a defender of free speech', he said.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Brooke sees pivotal role for BBC: Green paper lays out
options for redefining status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT ONLY is the cover of the government's consultation document on the
future of the BBC, published yesterday, green but there are elegant green
stripes down the side of every page just to remind readers of its intent.
The Future of the BBC is that rare breed of government green paper - a
document genuinely seeking consultation and debate over the future of an
important national institution.
In the document's 43 pages, there are many 'coulds', few 'shoulds' and a
forest of question marks. Its spirit is best captured by what could almost
be turned into a BBC2 media quiz - in the 20 Questions set out by the
government.
The questions range from the difficult to the tricky - from pondering the
objectives of public-service broadcasting to whether there should be
improved parliamentary scrutiny of the corporation.
One underlying theme can be detected. The green paper leans towards
redefining the status quo - a BBC that may end up trimmed and more efficient
but still recognisably the BBC. There is no hostility towards the
corporation.
There are radical options laid out, such as taking advertising; a much
smaller, cheaper BBC broadcasting largely bought-in programmes; and a Public
Service Broadcasting Council that might distribute licence-fee money to
anyone wanting to make public-service programmes. But the more radical the
suggestions, the more the potential flaws are pointed out.
The tone is set by Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, in the
foreword: 'The government believes the BBC should continue as a major
broadcasting organisation and it should have special responsibilities for
public-service broadcasting', although he emphasises that change is
inevitable.
The changes the government is seeking for the BBC include: Aiming for
sustained improvements in organisation and efficiency whatever its
programming role.
Giving value for money and demonstrating clearly that it is doing so,
however the corporation is eventually financed.
Developing a range of output and performance measures and indicators
covering the efficiency of its activities, quality of service, audience
reactions and financial performance.
Creating a more flexible organisation - the BBC has been criticised for
unnecessary bureaucracy and over-rigid decision-making.
The biggest question of all is what role the BBC should have as a programme
maker in an increasingly competitive broadcasting environment.
With the greater choice available to viewers and listeners, the BBC could
concentrate in future on providing news and current affairs and programmes
unlikely to be broadcast by others.
'The BBC would broadcast few general entertainment programmes but more
programmes for minority audiences,' the document suggests. If the range of
programmes were limited, the number of BBC services could be reduced. No
popular music might mean dropping two out of its five domestic radio
services. No entertainment, and the BBC could be chopped back to one
television channel. Another possibility would be for the BBC to lose its
local radio stations.
On the other hand, if the aim were to encourage people to widen their
interests, that would be less likely to be achieved by narrowing the range
of programmes 'and reducing the number of popular programmes which attract
more people to watch or listen to a service'.
On the second big question - how BBC services are to be financed once the
government decides what BBC services should be - the green paper is
open-minded but not completely so.
It does say that 'so far no one has devised an obviously better system' to
the licence fee, but none of the obvious alternatives such as advertising,
subscription or mixed financing are warmly embraced.
The government sees the BBC not so much as a monopoly, but more as a
conglomerate carrying out a variety of functions. If it were to operate
efficiently in future these strands of activity might have to be
disentangled and decisions taken on whether all should continue to be
carried out by people employed by the BBC.
The BBC could sell its studio services in the marketplace but many of the
functions that support the programme makers could be privatised or put out
to tender. Commercial activities such as publishing and programme sales
could be expanded to generate more money or put in the hands of other
organisations for a fee.
The government is also interested in what the role of the BBC governors
should be. Some believe the governors interfere too much in the running of
the BBC. On the other hand, the governors and the board of management could
be merged. The government wants a clearer remit and leans towards a
supervisory rather than a managerial role.
One clue to the likely outcome of the discussion is a story told by Mr
Brooke yesterday. In his career he has worked abroad four times and as a
result he said he had 'a profound admiration for the services the BBC
provides'.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1)   What should be the objectives of public service broadcasting?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     appealing to all tastes and interests or should it concentrate
     on Information, education and minority interests, and programmes
     unlikely to be provided by other broadcasters?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
3)   Should the BBC broadcast a high proportion of programmes to
     reflect the interests of people throughout the United Kingdom?

     carry out?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
8)   How can its organisation be improved to carry out these activities
     more effectively?

9)   Should the BBC be encouraged to develop or expand its activities,
     and what would be the implications for its struture and
     organisation?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
10)  Should the BBC reduce expenditure  by cutting the range of quality
     of programmes and services?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
11)  Should the BBC continue to be financed by the licence fee?

15)  Should changes be made in the way the BBC keeps in touch with its
     audiences?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
16)  How should the interests of audiences in Scotland, Wales and
     Northern Ireland to represented?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
17)  Should changes to be made in the functions of the governors and
     the BBC Board of Management?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
18)  Should there be a public service broadcasting council either
     to regulate the BBC or to promote, finance and regulate public
     service broadcasting by the BBC and other services?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
19)  Should the BBC have clearly state objectives and publish results
     showing how far it has met them?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
20)  Should there be improved arrangements for regular parliamentary
     scrutiny of the BBC's objectives and how far the BBC has gone
     in meeting them?

FT  25 NOV 92 / People: Lewis - a 'mega-guy' for Gabicci
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Henry Lewis, a former joint managing director of Marks &amp; Spencer, has joined
the board of USM-quoted casual clothing group Gabicci as a non-executive
director; Michael Abrahams has ceased to be managing and finance director.
Gabicci, which was founded in 1973 by current chairman Jack Sofier - whose
wife dreamt up the name - had recently been approached by the considerably
bigger clothing distributor Helene, but talks collapsed at an early stage
after information was leaked to the media.
Sofier, 60, who has known Lewis since they met on Sofier's honeymoon 37
years ago, describes the appointment as 'an incredible coup. We're a tin-pot
little company and he is a mega guy'.
Lewis, 66, was joint managing director of Marks from 1973, alongside Sir
Derek (later Lord) Rayner; Lord Rayner became chairman in 1984 and Lewis
retired in 1985. Since then he was deputy chairman of Berisford for three
years, and is currently a director of Dixons and Porter Chadburn. He
considers Gabicci 'a very well-managed company that has an impressive group
of young and lively people'. But he thinks it has reached maturity and is in
need of 'a little outside experience' to steer its future path.
Sofier, who currently owns 14 per cent of the company, is reluctant to
discuss the 'difference of opinion over strategy' that led to Abrahams'
departure, but will say that 'it is my view we could operate more
efficiently and better if we were part of a large group'. Abrahams had
combined the two roles for the past two years, and was finance director for
the previous eight. He is still on the board in a non-executive capacity:
'It is up to him to resign. I am quite comfortable he will,' says Sofier.
The chairman now takes on the job of managing director as well, and is
looking for a finance director. 'I'm a very young 60. I have no plans to put
my feet up,' says Sofier.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Girls catch up in maths results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOYS have only a slight edge over girls in maths performance at GCSE, while
girls have a significant lead in English, a report said yesterday, Andrew
Adonis writes.
Historically, boys have outperformed girls at maths by a large margin, but
an analysis of this year's GCSE results shows that boys gained only 3 per
cent more higher grades (A to C) than girls, while girls gained 14 per cent
more higher grades in English than boys.
The report says the relative performance of the sexes in maths is
attributable partly to 'the tendency for a higher proportion of girls than
boys to be entered for the safer intermediate examination papers rather than
the more challenging papers which lead to the top grades'.
The report was based on research carried out by the University of London for
the School Examinations and Assessment Council, a government advisory body.

FT  25 NOV 92 / People: Sir Brian Shaw to chair PLA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Brian Shaw's appointment as the next chairman of the Port of London
Authority is a sure sign that Britain's biggest port is no longer regarded
as a lame duck.
It is the first time for many years that the government has recruited a
chairman from the PLA board rather than parachute in an outside
troubleshooter. Sir Brian - a board member since 1987 - takes over from
former TI chairman Sir Brian Kellett on January 1. Before Sir Brian
Kellett's arrival in 1985, the PLA had lost over Pounds 52m in nine years,
and he has overseen its return to profitability and the privatisation of of
Tilbury, its last remaining dock undertaking.
Sir Brian Shaw, a former chairman of Furness Withy and ex-president of the
General Council of British Shipping, admits that he is the first person for
a long time to 'have a clear run at the job' without having to spend his
time worrying about the dock labour problems which dominated the lives of
many of his predecessors.
The PLA still has a lot of debt, and will need to refinance itself at some
stage. But the sale of Tilbury means it can now concentrate on its primary
task of managing the navigation and conservancy of 150 kms of the River
Thames downstream from Teddington.
Like many Londoners, Sir Brian, 59, is keen to promote more use of the
river. 'We have a six-lane highway going through the heart of London and
virtually no one uses it,' he says. Under his chairmanship, he hopes that
the PLA can be a catalyst for change on the river.
The PLA, which still employs 550 staff, is no longer the power in the land
it once was when London was the world's biggest port. However, Sir Brian
still has an important ambassadorial role to play in promoting the interests
of a port which handles 52m tonnes of trade a year. (See Observer)
*****
Richard Packer, 48, is to take over from Sir Derek Andrews as permanent
secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, when the
latter retires next February.
A chemist by training, Packer joined the Inland Revenue as an inspector of
taxes in 1966, and transferred to MAFF in 1967. He was seconded to the
diplomatic service in Brussels during the 1970s and in 1987 was appointed
director of regional management for MAFF. He was promoted to deputy
secretary in 1989.
David Hadley, 56, will take over Packer's responsibility for the ministry's
agricultural commodities, trade and food production directorate. He joined
MAFF after graduating from Oxford University in 1959 and apart from periods
of some three-and-a-half years each in the Treasury and the cabinet office
has spent the bulk of his career with MAFF. Since July 1989 he has been head
of the European secretariat in the cabinet office.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour warns of council job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S national executive committee, the party's ruling body, has warned
all Labour groups in local government that compulsory redundancies 'may be
unavoidable' in some councils.
Next year may be the most difficult for Labour councillors since 1979 when
the Tories came to power, the NEC says.
The advice to councillors was disclosed yesterday as Mr Jack Straw, shadow
environment secretary, launched a pre-emptive attack on the government's
detailed plans for local government finance, which will be announced
tomorrow.
The NEC advises Labour groups to concentrate on protecting 'frontline'
services provided direct to the public. On the education budget, it says
that it is vital to maintain the level of the 'aggregate schools budget'
rather than central services, because that will affect schools' assessment
of whether they should opt out.
Increasing charges or reducing concessions on the basis of an authority-wide
policy, as an alternative to even more unpalatable cuts, is recommended
instead of leaving charges to be set by individual service committees.
The guidance also suggests drawing up the budget on the basis of 'clearly
determined political priorities', and points out that these may not reflect
previous patterns of provision.
Mr Straw said yesterday that with the transfer of further education away
from councils and their new responsibility for community care, the
government's plans for what local councils could spend in total next year
would leave local-authority employees facing a pay freeze rather than
increases of even 1.5 per cent.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Exports strategy to be unveiled
today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD NEEDHAM, the trade minister, will today announce details of a
national strategy for export promotion intended to boost Britain's share of
international trade by Pounds 10bn a year and reverse the decline of capital
exporters in the developing world.
The plan, intended to quell complaints that the government lacks a clear
strategy for economic recovery, aims to bring coherence to an existing array
of national and local policies rather than outline new initiatives.
It comes at a time of rising concern over Britain's export performance,
which in spite of what amounts to a 13 per cent devaluation since Black
Wednesday two months ago continues to lag behind the trend in imports.
Exports in October were Pounds 9.1bn, a record for 1992, and up by 4.6 per
cent on September - but more than matched by a 5 per cent rise in imports to
Pounds 10.2bn.
The 'Needham plan' to be outlined today will involve:
Regeneration of exhibition facilities, starting with support for the 1995
'West Midlands Year of Celebration', based on Birmingham's National
Exhibition Centre.
Corralling leading exporters to 'godfather' smaller companies, showing them
how to make headway in overseas markets.
Using the Department of Trade and Industry's industrial competitiveness
division to 'make sure the government knows what the rest of the world is
doing'.
Ensuring that adequate export credit cover is available to exporters 'with
the maximum gearing from this and the Aid for Trade Provision to bring in
behind capital goods exporters'.
Boosting the 'one-stop shop' operations in the British regions as outlined
by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, enabling exporters to
deal with all procedures in one location.
Mr Needham will acknowledge that 'big industry' exporters have lost ground
in markets in the developing world, from almost Dollars 550m in 1986 (a 7
per cent share of total Dollars 7.8bn trade in capital goods) to Dollars
532m in 1990 (a 5 per cent share of Dollars 10.7bn).
The government's aim - based on projections formulated by the Confederation
of British Industry in March - is to boost Britain's share of international
trade from 5.3 per cent in 1990 to 6.3 per cent by the turn of the century.
That would add Pounds 10bn to exports at current prices and eliminate the
country's visible trade deficit, the CBI said.
Capital goods exporters have complained vehemently over the past year that
the high cost of export credit insurance, and limits to cover in buoyant
markets such as Hong Kong, China and Malaysia, have undermined their
competitiveness in these markets.
The government went part of the way to meeting complaints in its Autumn
Statement two weeks ago when it announced a Pounds 700m increase in export
credit cover available for such markets. But it has resisted pressure to cut
premium rates, partly because of a conviction that the devaluation of
sterling and cuts in interest rates will have provided exporters with the
stimulus they need.
'This is not a strategy for the next fortnight,' Mr Needham said yesterday,
'It's a strategy that is to embed itself throughout the trading base of the
UK, at a local level, within government, between departments of government,
and in their relations with industry and overseas. To get the local
infrastructure in place is going to take a bit of time.'

FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Bankbench move on MPs' salaries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A CROSS-PARTY alliance of senior backbenchers has proposed an amendment to
the treatment of MPs' salaries which is likely to be accepted by the Commons
in spite of the government's plan for a pay freeze.
The proposal, which will be debated by MPs this afternoon, is that for
pension purposes, MPs should be treated as if they had a 1.5 per cent pay
increase from January instead of a freeze.
That would depend on them making extra pension contributions to cover the
cost of the higher pension to which they would then be entitled.
Labour MPs also plan to use the debate to highlight the extent of outside
business interests among Tory backbenchers.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Threat to EFA project alleged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE vital all-party consensus on support for the European Fighter Aircraft
project had been 'endangered' by Mr Malcolm Rifkind's 'intemperate' closing
speech in this week's exports-to-Iraq debate, Labour warned yesterday, David
Owen writes.
Mr George Foulkes, a Labour defence spokesman, said the party's support for
the EFA stemmed not just from the project's beneficial impact on jobs but
from the need to procure the 'best possible' aircraft for the RAF and other
air forces in democratic states.
His remarks came as the government told MPs in defence questions that
prospects for the EFA had 'brightened' very considerably in recent days.
Mr Foulkes also urged the government to join Labour in endorsing a sales
policy that excluded the sale of arms to military dictatorships.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs may see papers on Iraq policy
meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAPERS RELATING to a ministerial meeting at which it was decided to
recommend revising the government's policy on British exports to Iraq may be
made available to MPs after Mr Michael Heseltine's reference to them in
Monday night's Commons debate.
The trade and industry secretary alluded to the papers in connection with a
suggestion made by Labour's Mr Robin Cook that the government may never have
intended to announce such a change to parliament.
He said they showed that Mr Cook was 'diametrically wrong' and that
ministers had concluded that any change should be announced.
Mr Heseltine's use of the papers prompted interventions from Mr Tony Benn,
Labour MP for Chesterfield, who said that where government documents were
quoted 'they must be placed on the table of the House'.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, said yesterday that the whole of the
document from which Mr Heseltine quoted would be 'laid before the House'.
The meeting - on July 19 1990, just two weeks before Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait - recommended that policy be revised without permitting the export of
lethal equipment.
In a separate development, it also emerged that Mr Heseltine asked for
changes to the 'public interest immunity' certificate for which he was
responsible. It referred to papers the government wanted to be kept secret
in the Matrix Churchill trial.
His decision to insist on alterations before he signed has further
encouraged his supporters to believe he will be cleared completely by Lord
Justice Scott's inquiry into the arms-to-Iraq affair.
But the differences between Mr Heseltine's certificate and those signed by
three other government ministers may raise questions about why similar fears
were not raised by his colleagues.
Mr Heseltine made clear that 'whether in fact all or part of any individual
document or documents should be disclosed is a matter for the court'.
He stressed it was up to the court to decide if 'there is a counter-vailing
public interest that the requirements of doing justice in this case require
their (the documents') disclosure'.
He also stressed that he believed he had no choice but to sign.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Nuclear Electric offers coal plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NUCLEAR ELECTRIC, the state-owned utility, yesterday suggested postponing
liberalisation of the electricity market as part of a proposal it said might
increase British Coal's sales in England and Wales by up to 14m tonnes a
year in the next five years.
Independent assessments said the plan - with the government setting aside
its aim of increasing in 1994 the number of industrial consumers able to
shop around for electricity - might save more than 10 of the 31 threatened
pits.
The franchise, or non-competitive market, would continue to supply about 70
per cent of electricity in England and Wales. Minimum market shares would be
established for power from coal, gas, nuclear and renewables sectors.
Coal could have two thirds of the franchise market initially, going down to
about half in five years. That would enable it to make sales to the
generators of 54m tonnes annually initially, falling to 44m in year five.
Under the 'balanced fuel supply pattern', nuclear power would have about 22
per cent, roughly its current market share, at both the start and end of the
five-year period. Gas would increase its share from 8 to 20 per cent.
The proposal, outlined to MPs at the Commons trade and industry committee
yesterday, is bound to be seen as self-serving from a company fighting
suggestions that coal's market share could be improved by closing nuclear
reactors.
It is likely to have significant appeal to the government because it would
upset few vested interests. By lowering the limit from 1994 of the
competitive market to customers above 100kw, rather than the current 1MW, as
currently envisaged, only about 40,000 extra customers, on top of the
current 5,000, would be free to choose their electricity supplier.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Urban underclass is challenge,
Clarke says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE growth of the 'underclass' in decaying inner-city areas was identified
by Mr Kenneth Clarke last night as the most formidable challenge facing
western democracies during the 1990s.
In a speech designed to set out Conservative solutions to poverty,
deprivation and racism, the home secretary said that 'society cannot afford
to alienate and exclude significant numbers of the poor, the black and the
young'.
But he rejected outright the dependency culture offered by 'bleeding heart'
liberals as a solution. He accused 'local leftwing politicians' of seeing
the poor as victims and dependants to be permanently excluded from the
wealth-creating process.
He also dismissed the 'authoritarian' approaches being pioneered in the US
in which substantial numbers of disadvantaged citizens were made, in effect,
'wards of the state'.
Instead the government would seek the extension of the 'free-market
solutions' which were levering up standards across the public sector.
'Public expenditure is not enough. Lateral thinking aimed at changing the
culture of deprived groups and deprived areas towards the enterprise economy
and active citizenship is required.'
Mr Clarke acknowledged in a lecture to the Tory Reform Group that even when
the economy was growing 'it is not automatically the case that it will
trickle down so that the inner-city resident will get a fair share of it'.
Government help was needed but no single policy could solve the problems of
the urban poor. The long-term answer lay in a partnership between statutory
and voluntary agencies and private companies and 'active citizens' that
would allow local communities - with government help - to find their own
solutions: 'It is enormously important that people work out how to do things
for themselves and that they believe that what they get from their own
efforts is really theirs.'
But he acknowledged that legislation designed to empower local citizens  -
by giving them greater control of their schools, housing and environment -
would not produce instant results.
Changing the attitudes of inner-city residents towards enterprise, work,
choice and responsibility would take time, he said, and it would need to be
sustained throughout the 1990s.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Links with unions face fresh
scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE is mounting from Labour's so-called 'moderniser' faction for
wide-ranging revisions to an internal working party's proposals on how to
update its traditional links with the unions.
Leaked copies of the committee's outline final report reveal that it has
stopped short of approving a one-member, one-vote system for the selection
of MPs in spite of firm backing for the reform from Mr John Smith, the party
leader.
Instead, the committee is looking at creating a form of associate membership
for union members who pay the political levy and also express support for
Labour. These would carry voting rights.
Advocates of such a change argue that it will maintain the broad base of the
party among ordinary people and dilute the impact of activists, who are
often unrepresentative of wider public opinion.
They also claim it could lay the foundations for the creation of a mass
party as associates are persuaded to upgrade to full membership.
Opponents of the scheme say it is bureaucratic, costly, creates a divisive
dual-status membership structure and might possibly be open to manipulation
by undemocratic elements within the unions.
They also point out that it might offer the Conservative government a
pretext to change the law to insist that unionists opt in to paying the
political levy rather than opt out of paying it - potentially crippling
Labour's income.
One member of the NEC said yesterday that the plan would be 'disastrous' in
terms of presentation and was substantially worse than existing
arrangements.

   ALL THE Queen's troubles
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
from the row over her tax position and the future of the monarchy to fires
at Windsor Castle, from rumours about Royal marriages to an early winter
cold - provoked a unregal admission of humility yesterday.
She told an audience at Guildhall in the City of London that 1992 had, in
fact, been, an 'annus horribilis'.
In a rare appeal for personal sympathy, the Queen suggested to her critics
that scrutiny 'can be just as effective if it is made with a touch of
gentleness, good humour and understanding'.
But her speech, at a lunch celebrating the 40th anniversary of her reign,
may instead mark a low point in the fortunes of the House of Windsor.
An ITN poll this week showed 76 per cent believe the cost of the royal
family should be cut, while 61 per cent would restrict the publicly-funded
members of the royal family to just the Queen, Prince Charles and the Queen
Mother.
The Queen said that 'there can be no doubt, of course, that criticism is
good for people and institutions that are part of public life. No
institution, City, monarchy, whatever, should expect to be free from the
scrutiny of those who give it their loyalty and support - not to mention
those who don't'
She added: 'This sort of questioning can also act . . . as an effective
engine for change.'
Speaking to an audience that included the prime minister and Mr John Smith,
Labour leader, the Queen said: '1992 is not a year on which I shall look
back with undiluted pleasure. In the words of one of my more sympathetic
correspondents, it has turned out to be an 'annus horribilis'. I suspect
that I am not alone.'
Her short speech had been brought forward from after lunch to before because
her voice was weakened by a cold.
Afterwards, her most vociferous critics showed little more understanding. Mr
Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham North West and a noted republican, said: 'I
know people in my constituency who can genuinely say it has been a bad year.
I don't believe she has had her house repossessed.'
But Mr Toby Jessel, Tory MP for Twickenham, said that there was 'far too
much malice and envy around'.
And, proving that the Queen still commands a majority among Her Majesty's
opposition as well as her government, Mr John Smith said: 'She is entitled
to defend herself and she did it rather wittily and rather charmingly - it
is probably true that she has had a horrible year.'

FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd lauds victories won in EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADICAL changes in the operation of the European Community would flow from
the British presidency which will end next month, Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary, claimed in the Commons last night. More decisions would
be taken at national level, he explained.
He insisted that the part played by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in
opening the way for a wider agreement on liberalising world trade - and the
steps taken to ensure a single European market by the start of next year -
would be seen as 'massive achievements'.
Mr Hurd dismissed remarks by 'flustered' French politicians attacking the
ineffectiveness of the British presidency and urged Labour MPs to be more
careful in expressing similar sentiments.
That did not deter Mr John Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, from
arguing that the humiliating and total collapse of government policies in
the wake of sterling's forced withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism
had put Britain on the 'sideline in Europe'.
He ended an appraisal of the achievements of the British presidency, based
on the benchmarks set by the government itself, by awarding one mark out of
10.
Labour MPs encouraged Mr Nick Budgen, MP for Wolverhampton South-West when
he complained that the whips had used a 'hard ball' when seeking to contain
the recent revolt by Tory backbenchers over the Maastricht treaty when the
government survived by just three votes.
Tory backbench supporters of the prime minister's stance accused Mr Budgen
of 'whingeing' when he complained that because of his decision to vote
against the government Conservative party officials had sought to cause
trouble for him in his constituency party.
Mr Hurd welcomed the support given by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany for
the British initiative to ensure that more decisions were taken at national
level through the so-called 'subsidiarity' procedure.
He looked forward to decisions being taken at next month's EC summit in
Edinburgh on the criteria and procedures for applying the subsidiarity test.
Mr Hurd told those who feared the development of a federal Europe that, far
from Britain being beleaguered in resisting an inexorable movement towards a
European super-state, the tide was flowing in the opposite direction.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Sex discrimination reported at Bar
</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOMEN barristers face substantial discrimination affecting their chances of
becoming a Queen's counsel or a judge, according to an independent survey of
sex equality in the profession.
The survey, commissioned jointly by the Bar Council and the Lord
Chancellor's Department, is the first large-scale study of sex
discrimination in an important profession in this country.
It found 'substantial evidence of early and continuing unequal treatment
between the sexes'; 'a discrepancy between male and female perceptions of
equality issues'; and 'a marked tendency of failure to recognise this as a
problem by those who occupy the higher levels - heads of chambers
(barristers' offices) and judges.'
Sixty per cent of women respondents reported disadvantage on the ground of
their sex. More than 70 per cent felt under pressure to perform better than
men and that their performance was watched more closely.
Women felt sex discrimination was the second-most prevalent source of
discrimination and men ranked it fifth. Race discrimination was ranked first
by both groups. Women face particular obstacles in being selected for
traineeships.
The report recommends action by both the Bar and the Lord Chancellor's
Department, which has overall responsibility for the appointment of QCs and
judges.
Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, welcomed the study yesterday.

   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR LEON BRITTAN, EC competition commissioner, told the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders in London last night that manufacturers might be
prepared to publish lists indicating prices of certain models and options in
different national markets.
Brussels and the producers have agreed that it would be both difficult and
confusing to publish detailed lists covering all models and options.
Sir Leon said manufacturers were also prepared to write to dealers urging
them not to discriminate against buyers ordering cars for export to other EC
countries.
Brussels wrote to manufacturers in May urging them to make their pricing
more transparent.
But a consumer group claimed yesterday that Commission efforts to open up
the car market were still not working. The consumer report, by the Bureau
Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs (Beuc), says long-winded import
procedures and unhelpful dealers continue to stop car buyers in some EC
states taking advantage of low prices in others.
It says the situation has not improved since 1989, and price differentials
across Europe are in many cases still much wider than the 12 per cent
recommended by the EC.
The Commission and car manufacturers said yesterday they were moving towards
agreement on how to make it easier for consumers to compare cross-border
prices.
The Association des Constructeurs Europeens d'Automobiles the EC
manufacturers' federation, said yesterday: 'Beuc seems to suggest we are
trying to avoid the issue and trying to hide information. We're not hiding
anything.'
The manufacturers have until 1995 to demonstrate that the 'selective
distribution' system of exclusive car dealerships is not hampering the
single market for car buyers.
The Beuc study details wide differences in price across the Community, with
Britain the most expensive country for car buyers and Denmark the cheapest.
The organisation was also sharply critical of national authorities and
dealers which, it said, hampered consumers' attempts to take advantage of
price differences.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Charter poised to include GPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is about to extend the National Health Service Patient's
Charter to family doctors and other areas of primary care.
So far, the Department of Health's contribution to the Citizen's Charter has
concentrated on hospital services. But 90 per cent of medical consultations
begin and end with general practitioners, and the decision to involve them
in the charter has a number of significant implications.
In 1990 the government introduced a new performance-related contract for
family doctors which, among other things, was intended to improve patient
choice and make it easier for people to change GPs. One of the difficulties
of extending choice has been the absence of clearly understood common
criteria to help patients assess whether the services provided by a
particular GP are reasonable.
The charter proposals will set out a range of standards including maximum
waiting times for urgent consultations with GPs; waiting times for routine
consultations and waiting times to see a chosen doctor in a group practice.
Other factors, such as availability of health education services and
facilities for children in GPs' surgeries, will be included.
The primary-care proposals will break new ground for the charter concept
because GPs are independent contractors rather than NHS employees.
That means that their involvement in the charter programme must be
voluntary.
The charter arrangements will be fortified by a set of national standards
for family health services authorities, the statutory bodies responsible for
administering primary care.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Passengers say new trains create strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL'S new Networker trains, intended to bring relief to the 130,000
commuters using Network SouthEast's poorly performing Kent Link suburban
services, look in danger of running into ingratitude.
Many who have sampled the 'state-of-the-art' trains on trial runs say they
are cramped and some say they are worse than the 40-year-old 'slam-door'
trains they are due to replace.
The Networker, regarded by BR as the flagship of a new generation of
commuter trains, is to be launched today by Mr John MacGregor, transport
secretary, and Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman.
A Pounds 600m fleet of the trains will gradually replace the slam-door
rolling stock on routes from Dartford and Sevenoaks to London Bridge, Cannon
Street and Charing Cross.
The trains, which have automatic doors, are much cheaper to run and maintain
than existing ones, but some passengers say the seats are too close together
and dislike the interior layout.
Mrs Maureen Collins and her daughter Joanna, passengers on a trial run from
Charing Cross to Gravesend, said luggage racks were out of reach and there
was nowhere to put briefcases or shopping.
'I'd hate to be on one of these trains in the rush hour,' said Mrs Collins.
'There's not enough standing room and nothing for people to hang on to. The
old trains were better.'
Ms Jane McGrath, a bank clerk, disliked the airline-style seating
arrangement which left many passengers facing the back of the seat in front.
'And I'm worried about the automatic doors,' she said. 'What happens if
someone gets stuck in them? It'll happen all the time in the rush hour, with
people rushing to catch trains.'
Other passengers thought the seats were too hard or too close to each other.
Passengers also criticised the lack of legroom and disliked the fact that
the new trains have many fewer doors than the old ones.
But there was praise for the smoothness of the ride, and many liked the
brightness and airiness of the interior design.
'Let's face it, anything has to be better than the old trains,' said Mr Alan
Weir, a retired teacher. 'And I think we can look the French in the face
with these.'

FT  25 NOV 92 / Industry's financial health 'on the mend'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE financial health of industry is on the mend, a leading group of risk
assessors said yesterday. It reported that the proportion of quoted
companies at risk of failure was falling for the first time since 1988.
Syspas, the London-based consultants, said industrial companies showing a
decreasing risk of failure in the past three months outnumber those showing
higher risk by 50 per cent, a reversal of past trends.
The Syspas method involves defining the financial characteristics of
companies that have failed in the past and finding how far existing
companies conform to that pattern. Syspas claims to have predicted the
present recession at the beginning of 1989, based on the rising number of
companies shown to be at risk. It also identified Maxwell Communication
Corporation as 'beyond saving in its present form' some time before the
death of Robert Maxwell in November last year.
At the peak of the boom in 1988, the Syspas model suggested that 11 per cent
of all quoted industrial companies showed at least some risk of failure. The
figure then rose to a peak of 26 per cent in May of this year. The present
figure is put at 25 per cent.

FT  25 NOV 92 / City finds it tough to take cover: Terrorist fall-out hits
insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER, VANESSA HOULDER and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY EIGHT MONTHS after the IRA bomb blasts in London last April, the
reverberations are still being felt by British business and its insurers.
The announcement two weeks ago that insurers would drastically reduce the
amount of cover for terrorism from next year is the most recent aftershock.
The Association of British Insurers advised its member companies to exclude
coverage for terrorism from commercial insurance policies, leaving many of
the country's leading companies facing potentially crippling unprotected
exposures.
While insurers and business alike are pressing the government to help out,
many companies, especially those based in London who believe their
properties could be terrorist targets, are hastily re-examining their
security arrangements.
Brokers say they are most concerned about clients who have expensive London
headquarters or those - such as life insurers - who own commercial
properties as part of their investment portfolios.
Property owners are examining alternative methods of insuring against
terrorism damage, as they cannot individually shoulder the risks of
terrorist action. Mr James Tuckey, vice-president of the British Property
Federation, says: 'No individual property owner would have a sufficient
capital base to take that risk.'
'It is a matter of great concern,' says Mr Richard Lay, a spokesman for the
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. 'The government should take a
serious interest in the subject.' The implications of withdrawal of cover
would extend beyond the targets of terrorism, as it would affect property
values and the ease of raising finance.
Property owners have already faced big increases in the cost of their
property insurance, which have traditionally included terrorism cover.
Average rates for all-risks property policies amount to between 0.04 and
0.07 per cent of the rebuilding cost, an average rise of over 20 per cent on
rates charged a year ago. One property owner insuring a modern purpose built
office block in London this week paid a premium of more than Pounds 20,000
to insure a property whose rebuilding cost could cost more than Pounds 30m,
a rate of over 0.067 per cent.
The rate increases partially reflect the increase in incidents of arson,
crime and other recession-related claims.
In addition, there have been a number of significant heavy losses to
commercial property in the City itself, reflecting the introduction of more
sophisticated construction techniques, the greater use of computer equipment
and the increasing cost of claims from business interruption losses and lost
rental income.
For example, a fire last year at the London Underwriting Centre in the City,
which caused losses in excess of Pounds 100m, woke up insurers to the risks
of buildings with atriums, which can allow fires to spread more rapidly.
This year's bomb blasts have served to underline the extent of the
increasing exposures. The losses are large - insurers and their reinsurers
face a bill for an estimated Pounds 800m for the damage to buildings in the
City and at Staples Corner in north London.
Moreover the loss could have been bigger still. For example, the Commercial
Union tower, near the heart of the blast, sustained losses of between Pounds
80m and Pounds 100m even though it was not totally destroyed. 'The bomb
showed that the exposures involved were much greater than anyone had ever
appreciated before,' said one reinsurer.
Next year much will depend on lobbying by insurers and business groups
seeking to win government support. Mr John Greenway, Conservative MP for
Ryedale and chairman of the Commons insurance and financial services
committee, who is working with the ABI and Airmic, says an extension of the
Northern Ireland compensation scheme - whereby the government meets the
costs of terrorist damage - to the British mainland would not be 'viable'.
Mr Greenway is more hopeful that the government may be receptive to an idea
in which it would share the burden of reinsuring with insurance and other
companies.
If the campaigns fails, prospects are gloomy. Insurers will make some
coverage available on a 'buy-back' basis. But the amount will be limited.
One broker yesterday suggested that the industry could afford to offer no
more than Pounds 10m of coverage per customer.
Premiums could be punitively expensive - one broker yesterday reported that
a leading UK insurer was offering to insure terrorism at a rate of 25 per
cent, over 1,000 times higher than current rates.
Insurers are also likely to insist that insurance would be underwritten on a
'per risk' basis, which would involve buyers listing each of the buildings
they wanted to have included on the policy.
Whether City companies can find insurance or not they will be forced to
re-examine their own security arrangements.
Mr John Wyatt, a security adviser and anti-terrorist expert, says that he
has been approached by an increasing number of companies.
Editorial Comment, Page 18
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                       THE GROWING COST TO INSURERS
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Calculating the costs involved in meeting an insurance claim on
a building damaged by a terrorist bomb is complex and subject to
considerable variations.
This is a hypothetical example in which the London HQ of a company suffers
considerable bomb damage.
The building covers 30,000 sq ft and has 100 employees.  It is badly damaged
externally, (windows, walls etc) and the damage internally (furniture,
fittings and computers) requires employees to move to another building
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Repair to basic fabric of the building is calculated on Pounds 100
    per sq ft                                                Pounds 3m
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Furniture (desks, chairs etc) calculated on the basis of Pound
    1,000 per employee                                  Pounds 100,000
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Systems (software, hardware)                        Pounds 3m plus
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Recreating the company's records.  Calculated on 1 per cent to
    5  per cent of turnover.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Increased cost of temporary relocation.  This includes cost of
    temporarily moving offices, setting up systems, and telephones,
    and moving furniture etc                          Pounds 0.5m plus
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Premiums: These are calculated on the basis of 0.04 per cent to 0.07
          per cent of the rebuilding costs.  Premiums have risen by
          an average of 20 per cent in 1992.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Latin American market still strong: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ONE sector of the art world continues to go from strength to strength -
Latin American paintings. At Sotheby's in New York on Monday there were
eight artist records including Dollars 1.54m (Pounds 1m) for La Casa de las
Gemelas Arias by Fernando Botero, showing a group of girls and clients in a
Colombian brothel.
Another record was the Dollars 1.485m which secured Mujer en Extasis by
Rufino Tamayo. It depicts a reclining woman who is almost transformed into a
Mexican landscape. The evening sale totalled Dollars 10.46m and was over 90
per cent sold by value.
The Russian cellist Rostropovich paid the top price of Pounds 49,500 in a
Russian picture sale at Sotheby's in London yesterday. He bought Faces of
Russia, painted by Grigoriev in 1917. The price was below estimate but the
auction did quite well, totalling Pounds 514,217 with 17 per cent unsold in
the morning session. Russian art has been in deep recession for the last two
years.
Christie's experienced mixed fortunes with its sale of clocks and watches.
It totalled Pounds 649,385 but was 33 per cent unsold.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Mark Thatcher 'link' to arms deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN, JIMMY BURNS and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER senior White House official yesterday said US intelligence reports
suggested that Mr Mark Thatcher was connected to 'the organisation and
negotiation of arms transactions to Saudi Arabia' during the 1980s.
Mr Howard Teicher, who served on the National Security Council as director
of Middle Eastern affairs between 1982 and 1986, said that references to Mr
Thatcher were made in intelligence reports and State Department cables from
US embassies in Europe and in Saudi Arabia over several years.
Mr Teicher, who resigned from the Reagan Administration in early 1987, said
the documents had aroused his concern because Mr Thatcher was the son of the
then British prime minister.
The reports, including a suggestion of a possible link with the Pounds 20bn
British arms sale to Saudi Arabia known as the Al-Yamamah deal, were
discussed by Mr Teicher and his White House colleagues.
Mr Teicher's remarks are also to be featured in a Channel Four programme
tonight about British defence deals with Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
Last night Lady Thatcher's office in London said she would not comment. A
spokesman for Mr Thatcher said Mr Thatcher was aware of the Channel 4
programme and would watch it. He added: 'He never discusses his business
affairs.'

FT  25 NOV 92 / Former editor of Financial Times dies at 90
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ARCHIBALD HUGH Tennent Chisholm, editor of the Financial Times from 1937 to
1940, has died at the age of 90.
Although originally a writer in the London office of the Wall Street
Journal, he spent most of his working life in the oil business. When he took
over at the Financial Times the paper was still competing with the Financial
News.
According to Lord Camrose, then the FT's proprietor, Chisholm was picked in
preference to more established journalists partly because of his academic
record but chiefly because it was judged that his manner and bearing would
be likely to make a good impression in the City. So it proved.
Chisholm, whose father had been City editor of The Times, was tall with
impeccable manners and wore a monocle. While the circulation in 1938 fell to
less than 25,000 and profits to less than Pounds 10,000, the FT was still
becoming the main City paper.
One of Chisholm's contributions was to introduce a column called City Men
and Matters, subsequently renamed Men and Matters and today Observer. He
wrote much of it himself. Although the idea was modelled on Peterbor-ough in
The Daily Telegraph, it was the first purely City gossip column. Chisholm
became the first national editor to appear on television on the FT's 50th
anniversary.
A more dubious contribution was to try to turn the paper from pink to white,
but that was firmly resisted by Camrose.
In 1940 the editor left for the war, working for Army Intelligence, mainly
in the Middle East. He was twice mentioned in despatches, became a colonel
and was awarded the CBE (military). When he returned to London in 1945 the
paper was merging with the Financial News and Chisholm chose to go back to
oil.
He was educated at Westminster School in London and Christ Church, Oxford,
where he captained the college soccer team that included Sir Alec
Douglas-Home. After a spell at the Wall Street Journal from 1925 to 1927, he
joined the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which later became British Petroleum.
He served in Persia for four years, chiefly in Abadan, and learned Persian.
In 1932 he moved to Kuwait, where he was APOC's principal negotiator in the
deal that led to the first Kuwait oil concession agreement. At the time, few
people were confident that oil would be found there in commercial
quantities. Chisholm disagreed. Four years after the deal was signed, one of
the biggest oilfields in the world - about 100 sq miles - was discovered at
Burgan, about 28 miles south of Kuwait town.
After the war the former journalist spent the rest of his career, until his
retirement in 1972, with BP. When Mossadeq of Iran abruptly nationalised all
foreign oil interests in 1951, Chisholm was part of the BP team that argued
the company's case before the International Court of Justice at The Hague.
He subsequently played a shadowy part, which he would never fully discuss,
in the ousting of Mossadeq, masterminded by the US intelligence services. In
1975 he published The First Kuwait Oil Concession Agreement, a scholarly
record of the negotiations of which he was the sole survivor.
He married, in 1939, Josephine Goudge, who was his secretary at the
Financial Times. She died in 1983. They had three children: Anne, co-author
of a recent biography of the late Lord Beaverbrook; Clare, who died in 1975;
and Colin, director of BSI-Thornhill Investment Management.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Clearer statements urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSED regulations on the contents of summary financial statements are too
prescriptive, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
has warned.
In a letter to the Department of Trade and Industry, the institute's company
law committee argues that summary statements should be able to improve
communication by using simpler language than required in full accounts.
It also says there should be separate disclosure of securities and
investments such as loans and advances to banks and to customers in the
proposed summary balance sheet.
The submission follows a consultative document issued by the DTI last month
on summary financial statements which proposed extending the guidelines to
debenture and loan stock holders and partial owners of shares.
The statements - permitted since April 1990 - must cover basic
profit-and-loss accounts, directors' remuneration and an outline balance
sheet with contingent liabilities.
In a letter to Companies House, the government's corporate information
depository based in Wales, the company law committee calls for clearer
guidance on filing accounts for EC member-state companies with UK branches
and also non-EC companies which have a 'place of business' in the UK.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Shell to cut 500 jobs at refinery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHELL UK is to shed 500 of the 1,850 jobs at its Stanlow refinery in
Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, the fifth-largest of Shell's 53 oil refineries
worldwide.
The company said an efficiency study had found overstaffing and inefficient
working patterns. The cuts were necessary to secure a viable future for the
plant, which was built in 1922.
Shell said the financial and trading climate for its refinery operations was
'extremely difficult'. Stanlow was making only a 2 per cent return on
capital invested.
Europe is suffering widespread overcapacity in oil refining and
petrochemicals production and the recession has damped demand.
The Stanlow management is looking to improve efficiency by broadening skills
in key jobs and giving more responsibility to individuals.
Shell is meeting union representatives today to explain the job cuts and the
plans for new working patterns.
The company said it would offer substantial redundancy packages, but some
compulsory redundancies would be inevitable. The jobs will be cut by the
middle of next year from all sections of employees.
In addition to job cuts, Stanlow faces the high cost of modernising some of
its older plant. The refinery has recently announced spending of Pounds 35m
on environmental equipment.
Shell is conducting a strategic review of its downstream operations as the
market remains severely depressed.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Safety body 'undermined' EC health directive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Health and Safety Executive never intended to implement fully a European
Community safety directive and 'actively undermined' measures intended to
protect people at work, a union claimed yesterday.
A confidential policy paper, prepared by the executive's management board
for the implementation of the main directive, shows how EC attempts to
protect workers have been 'watered down', the GMB general union said.
The framework directive spells out the general principles of health and
safety regulations, many of which are implicit in the UK's Health and Safety
at Work Act. It establishes five 'daughter' directives that would deal with,
for example, regulations covering work with VDUs and manual handling of
loads.
The executive said the leaked document was 'old hat'. It said it was part of
the 'normal thinking process' at an early stage in implementing directives.
The union said the document was 'deeply disturbing'.
The document says: 'We agree that we should not seek a 100 per cent
cast-iron conformity with the directive and would indeed be unable to claim
that the proposals to be put to the HSE would achieve this.'
Mr Nigel Bryson, GMB health and safety officer, said he believed that was
not adequate implementation.
The document goes on: 'Thus we are proposing regulations only where they
appear to be unavoidable. We are prepared to take a risk over several parts
of the directive.'
Apparently weighing the arguments against such a 'minimalist' role, the
document adds: 'Ministers like to counterbalance the UK's poor image in the
social field with our good reputation on health and safety. Furthermore,
losing at the European Court of Justice may lead to changes more drastic
than we can get away with now . . . '
The document indicates the executive's intention to rely on UK legislation
in some areas where the 'directive appears to go further than existing law',
including fire safety obligations.

PARTNERSHIPS will be able to admit new members more easily under rules
announced this week.
An extra-statutory concession from the Inland Revenue makes it simpler to
waive the general requirement that, if membership changes, a new partnership
must be created for tax purposes, under the 1988 Income and Corporation
Taxes Act. Under existing regulations, partners can waive that requirement
only if every partner approves within two years.
Under the concession, which applies to partnerships with at least 50 members
or at least 20 not resident in the UK, a partnership can simply ask the
Revenue to treat it as continuing until notified otherwise.

THE US Agriculture Department yesterday suspended grain credits to Russia
for failing to repay Dollars 10.9m (Pounds 7.2m) on time to four of its
private lenders, clouding the future of the US-Russian grain trade
relationship, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington.
Mr Roger Runningen, the department spokesman, said Russia would be
reinstated in the two-year-old credit programme as soon as its payments were
up to date. Vnesheconombank, the Russian foreign exchange bank, sent in a
partial payment yesterday after promising to pay in full, but failed to lift
the suspension.
The Agriculture Department has extended Dollars 5.7bn in export guarantees
to the former Soviet Union since January 1991. But Congress, which lobbied
for the programme, also worried about the credit record of the former Soviet
Union and required the department to monitor repayments strictly. The banks
are required to notify the department once repayment is 10 days overdue.

THE United Nations general assembly last night called for an end to the US
embargo against Cuba, imposed some three decades ago when the government of
Fidel Castro seized billions of dollars' worth of US assets, Michael
Littlejohns, UN Correspondent in New York, and Agencies report.
Canada and Mexico, parties to the new free-trade agreement with the US, were
among 59 states voting for the measure, which Cuba drafted. The US
vigorously canvassed against the resolution but was rebuffed largely because
of new legislation signed by US President George Bush last month which
extended the embargo to foreign sub-sidiaries of US corporations and foreign
commercial shipping.
Many countries that might otherwise have sided with the US moved to the
sidelines, including EC members. There were 71 abstentions and only Israel
and Romania sided with the US.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, has been asked to prepare a
report on implementation of the resolution in time for next year's assembly
session. Unlike mandatory Security Council resolutions, assembly decisions
are not binding.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Surge in US orders points to steady recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORE signs emerged yesterday that the US economy has embarked on a steady,
if not yet ebullient, recovery, with the announcement of a surge last month
in durable goods orders.
The Commerce Department said new orders for durable goods rose by 3.9 per
cent in October, to total Dollars 124.4bn (Pounds 82.3bn) after seasonal
adjustment. Excluding defence equipment, new orders rose 2.2 per cent.
Republican politicians have complained that economists and journalists have
been willing to proclaim a recovery on the basis of buoyant economic
statistics since Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate, won the
presidential election last month, after turning a deaf ear to President
George Bush's claims that a recovery was under way.
Governor Clinton is working on an economic stimulus package, to be put into
place soon after his inauguration on January 20. He is expected to invite
businessmen, economists and politicians to his Arkansas state capital of
Little Rock on December 14-15 for an economic summit.
Economists and financial markets were yesterday cautious in their reaction
to the durable goods announcement, although it outstripped the average
market forecast of a 1 per cent gain. Most of the increase stemmed from a 20
per cent rebound to Dollars 32.2bn in orders for vehicles and aircraft.
Adding to caution was a 4.5 per cent decline in new orders for industrial
machinery and equipment, although orders for non-defence capital goods
showed a solid advance of 2.5 per cent, cementing an 8.5 per cent increase
in September.
'The gains weren't widespread. October's report reflects an industrial
sector that's growing, slowly,' said Mr Ed Yardeni, economist at brokers C J
Lawrence in New York.
Other indicators, however, showed that both consumers and businesses are
starting to show more confidence.
The Conference Board, a New York-based business grouping, yesterday
announced a revival in its consumer confidence index for November, although
optimism only returned to the level of early last summer.
But Mr Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's consumer research
centre, said the 11 point increase in November took the index only to a
level that has historically been linked with a lacklustre economy. 'We have
a long way to go before we are in a full recovery mode,' he said.
A business confidence index compiled by Cahners Economics, a Massachusetts
economic research group, also showed an increase in optimism in November,
although the upturn was modest. Cahners found a sharp increase in the number
of businesses which planned to increase production over the next three
months but, for the longer term, relatively few businesses planning to
invest more heavily in capital equipment.

FT  25 NOV 92 / World Bank debates its role as lender / Assessing a damning
report on the bank's portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank's executive board yesterday began discussion on one of the
most comprehensive reviews of its portfolio management, based on a study
that has opened up a fierce debate over how well the Washington-based
multilateral institution is fulfilling its role of development lending.
The report, produced by a taskforce under the chairmanship of Mr Willi
Wapenhans, a World Bank veteran, paints a stark picture of the deteriorating
quality of the bank's portfolio of projects in the 1980s.
World Bank staff are used to being criticised for clumsy bureaucracy,
tax-free salaries and lending to environmentally damaging projects, but the
Wapenhans report suggests the bank is failing even on its own terms. The
proportion of projects showing major problems in the World Bank's Dollars
138bn (Pounds 91bn) loan portfolio rose from 11 per cent in 1981 to 20 per
cent a decade later. Of projects in their fourth or fifth year of
implementation in 1991, 30 per cent had substantial problems, with project
categories such as water supply, sanitation and agriculture demonstrating
particularly severe difficulties.
In addition, the bank is finding that it takes an average of two-and-a-half
years longer to complete a project than its staff estimates.
Much of this deterioration can be attributed to factors outside the control
of any institution, such as the oil shock, debt crisis and steady worsening
terms of trade for developing nations. The taskforce suggested it may also
reflect more realistic assessments of performance by bank staff.
But the report points to severe shortcomings in the conception and appraisal
of projects, shortcomings deeply rooted in the bank's corporate attitudes -
a culture that promotes loan volume as the measurement of success - and an
arrogance that leads the bank to impose its own projects on borrowers,
rather than responding to their needs.
'Bank staff take a negotiating, not a consulting position - they know what
they want from the outset and aren't open to hearing what the country has to
say,' the taskforce concluded after consulting representatives from
borrowing countries.
In fact, the Wapenhans report finds, the more time bank staff spend on the
preparation of a project, the less likely it is to succeed - perhaps because
these are the projects to which the borrower is least committed.
Borrowers complain staff may make matters still worse by imposing endless
and unhelpful conditions to ensure the bank board will approve the loan, and
by adding in elements of the 'policy du jour' - be it import substitution,
export promotion, women's programmes or environmental concerns.
Other critics say one of the reasons why portfolio supervision has
deteriorated is that many of the bank's engineers, who revelled in getting
their boots dirty in on-site inspections, have been replaced by economists
who stay in their hotels reading reports.
Yet, say some World Bank insiders, those hands-on engineers tended to
promote their own specialities, whereas the economists take a broader view
of a country's needs.
'If you had a port engineer in south Asia, you could be pretty sure you
would get one or two port projects a year in south Asia,' said one bank
director.
The Wapenhans report comes on the heels of a fiery debate inside and outside
the bank over its handling of the Dollars 3bn Sardar Sarovar dam and
irrigation projects on the Narmada river in western India.
Environmentalist groups have for years complained that the bank ignored all
the warning signs about the Narmada dam's impact on the environment and on
peasant farmers.
Despite a damning independent report from a commission headed by Mr Bradford
Morse, a former administrator of the United Nations Development Project, the
World Bank board decided last month to allow the project to go ahead,
although the executive directors, who represent member countries, set strict
benchmarks to be met by April.
'The problem is that institutionally there is no incentive to slow down
projects for environmental or social quality reasons. Your career incentives
are to push projects through,' says Ms Lori Udall of the Washington-based
Environmental Defence Fund.
'If they cannot suspend a project when the evidence is so overwhelming, when
are they going to?' she asks.
It is nothing new for the World Bank to be scratching its head over its
missions and its corporate culture. Former presidents Tom Clausen and Barber
Conable each implemented his own management overhaul. Mr Lewis Preston, the
former chairman of Morgan Guaranty who took over as president last year, has
made his own reforms, and hundreds of bank employees are now waiting for
reassignment.
However, by commissioning the Wapenhans taskforce in February, Mr Preston
had in a way answered a central criticism of the report it was to produce.
'Successful implementation of approved operations outweighs new annual
commitments as an indicator of the bank's development effectiveness,' he
wrote.
Already the bank's traditional emphasis on global loan volume as a measure
of its success in transferring resources to third world customers has been
somewhat muted. The latest annual report shows signs of fewer loans rushed
through before the end of the fiscal year to burnish the statistics.
Many non-governmental organisations, however, complain that the entire
career structure has been unchanged by top-down reforms, and continues to
reward employees largely on the basis of their loan volume.
But some are encouraged by Mr Preston's recognition of his organisation's
problems; perhaps he will be able to change its culture in a way that has
eluded his predecessors.

FT  25 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Fast-growth Malaysia running out of steam
 -A massive power expansion programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the lights went out in Malaysia recently the message struck home. The
country, now in its fifth successive year of 8 per cent-plus growth, is
running out of power.
The blackout, blamed on a freak lightning strike and described officially as
an act of God, left many parts of peninsular Malaysia without power for
several days.
Now the government is stepping up efforts to put in place one of the world's
more ambitious power expansion programmes with the private sector, both
domestic and foreign, playing a central role. The power companies are
rushing to Kuala Lumpur to grab a piece of the action.
Malaysia has an installed electricity capacity of about 5,000MW. To keep
pace with economic growth over the next 25 years - projected at an average
of 7 per cent annually - power output has to grow five times.
Mr Samy Vellu, minister of energy, estimates that the cost of new power
projects over the next 25 years will be MDollars 100bn (Pounds 26bn). In the
next 10 years alone Malaysia needs to invest MDollars 40bn to cope with
increasing electricity requirements.
Malaysia is the front runner in Asia in encouraging private sector
participation in energy generation. Earlier this year, Tenaga Nasional, the
country's electricity utility, was partly privatised and is now the largest
company listed on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange.
The government is studying proposals from the private sector for building,
operating and owning a number of power stations round the country.
Preliminary agreement has been announced for Malaysia's first independent
power producer. A local construction group, YTL, has teamed up with National
Power of Britain to build two power stations with a combined capacity of
1,000MW costing about Dollars 700m. National Power will have a 10 per cent
stake plus a separate operation and management contract.
While the authorities have not disclosed how much of the industry will be
given over to independent producers, the eventual outcome could be a 50/50
split with Tenaga. Other projects are likely to be announced soon, involving
the participation of some of the big names in power generation. Foreign
companies are allowed to hold up to 25 per cent.
The independent producers are likely to concentrate on gas-fuelled power
stations - buying gas from Petronas, the state oil company, and selling
power to Tenaga, which will have control of the national grid.
The price at which Tenaga will buy power from the independent producers is
the most important element in any contract. According to Mr Richard Hall of
Schroders - who along with the World Bank's International Finance
Corporation is acting as financial adviser on the YTL deal - the power
purchase agreement should guarantee adequate returns to the independent
producer.
'Once we have a decent power purchase agreement we can then go to the banks
and raise the necessary finance,' says Mr Hall. 'Without that guarantee the
banks won't be interested in putting up the funds.'
Mr Martin Locke, a project finance specialist with Morgan Grenfell in
Singapore, says the risks of taking on such projects can be handled only by
the big power companies. 'A power project is a long-term proposition. It's
also very complex contractually, particularly on setting pricing over long
periods. Only the big power companies will be able to get the banks behind
them.'
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, upset by blackouts and power
shortages which could deter much-needed investment, has made clear he wants
these projects to come on stream as soon as possible.
The YTL power stations are due to be up and running by early 1995.
Mr Locke feels Malaysia might deter some potential independent producers by
trying to rush negotiations through while not giving adequate guarantees on
financial returns.
Other countries in the region, in particular Indonesia, the Philippines and
Thailand, are also competing for power related funding.
'But Malaysia does have advantages,' says Mr Locke. 'It is seen as a more
bankable country than most others in the region. The Malaysian dollar is
strong and the local market could be tapped for funding. Most of all
Malaysia is ahead of the hunt and it's likely the independent producers
there will set the framework for other countries to follow.'

A WORLD-WIDE treaty to protect the ozone layer of the atmosphere looked set
early today to be tightened for the third time in its five-year life, writes
Bronwen Maddox in Copenhagen. This follows negotiations by ministers and
officials at a three-day United Nations conference.
Mr David Maclean, UK environment minister, said: 'We think we have agreed a
package that has something for everyone.' The main part of the new version
of the 1987 Montreal protocol, to be formally agreed today, is a commitment
by industrialised countries to phase out certain damaging chemicals by 1996
instead of the previous date of 2000.
The turning point came when industrialised countries pledged up to Dollars
500m (Pounds 330m) on top of Dollars 240m already committed to help
developing countries phase out chemicals that harm the ozone layer. In
return, developing countries look set to phase out some chemicals by 2006,
four years earlier than previously agreed.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Japan's money supply drops further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN is in the midst of an unprecedentedly severe monetary contraction,
according to figures published yesterday which show the broad money supply
fell last month for the second month in a row.
The 0.6 per cent contraction in the broad money supply in October, the
largest drop on record, is a sign that the economic slowdown is tightening
its grip upon Japan. The fall follows a 0.5 per cent drop in September, the
first annual fall ever recorded.
The sharp contraction in the broad money supply measure, which was growing
at more than 2 per cent a year at this time last year, is a reflection of
how swiftly the downturn has accelerated in the autumn.
Concerns that the decline in the broad money supply may herald a further
fall in economic activity were reinforced by declines in several other
indicators of monetary growth. Previously the Bank of Japan, the central
bank, had argued that the slowing growth rate of broad money was caused by
savers switching their funds into the postal savings system.
However, the figures issued by the Bank of Japan show the growth rate of
narrow money fell to 2.5 per cent a year from 2.9 per cent in September,
while the growth of broad liquidity, which includes deposits in the postal
savings system, has fallen to about 2.8 per cent from about 4.4 per cent in
the first half of the year.
The money supply contraction is largely a reflection of depressed demand for
funds from consumers and companies. The Bank of Japan says there is no
evidence that Japanese companies are facing a credit crunch because the
banks are cutting back on lending. However, small business leaders have
become increasingly vociferous in their complaints that the commercial banks
are pursuing excessively restrictive lending policies.
The depth of the downturn was confirmed by a survey by the Economic Planning
Agency based on consultations with 10 trade associations suggesting the
economy may not show signs of a recovery until late next year. Most official
forecasters believe recovery should start in the spring.

FT  25 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Japan hints at move on rice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government has started the painful debate over the opening of
the rice market, as three cabinet ministers yesterday hinted the country
would need to make a concession to ensure the success of multilateral trade
talks.
Ministers of finance, trade and foreign affairs said Japan would continue to
argue that an exception be made for rice on the grounds of 'food security',
but they also indicated that pressure from the international community would
probably force a market opening.
However, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, and the agriculture
ministry insist the market will remain closed to imports, regardless of the
agreement between the US and the European Community on farm trade under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
Like the French government, Tokyo is under intense pressure from farmers to
defend the rice market, but there is a general recognition within the
government that a concession must be made.
Mr Kozo Watanabe, minister for international trade and industry, hinted
Japan would be willing to compromise, as did Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance
minister, who suggested that rice may not be suitable for tariffication (the
replacement of existing trade barriers by a tariff schedule).
Mr Hata and other ministers are concerned that tariffication would lead to a
gradual and inevitable increase in the foreign share of the Japanese rice
market.
They would prefer to make a single, symbolic opening, for example, by
allowing a foreign share of 3-5 per cent.
Meanwhile, Mr Watanabe said other countries must recognise that rice is a
'difficult issue' for Japan, but a conclusion to the Gatt Uruguay Round
'will benefit all free-trade nations'.
A Japanese concession is likely to come after prodding by other nations,
though the ministers' comments yesterday suggest the agreement between the
US and EC has ended most hopes that a market opening may be avoided.
The strongest indication of a political willingness to open the market came
from Mr Michio Watanabe, foreign minister, who said discussions must start
immediately at the highest levels.
The agriculture ministry is responsible for the rice issue, and it must
agree on compensation with Japanese farmers before a decision can be
announced by the government.

FT  25 NOV 92 / World Trade News: French MPs vote on farm deal veto today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A French parliamentary vote late today against the US-EC deal on farm trade
became a certainty yesterday as the three main opposition parties laid down
a resolution, calling on the government to veto, if necessary, the Gatt
agreement.
Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, the agriculture minister, has cautioned that to
brandish a possible veto at this stage would be to advertise France's
weakness and isolation within the EC. But the government cannot afford to
put a less anti-Gatt motion to the National Assembly, if it wants to avoid
being outflanked on such a sensitive issue in the run-up to next March's
elections.
The neo-Gaullist RPR and the UDF and UDC centrist parties are manoeuvring to
try to prevent the government turning the near-total consensus on the Gatt
issue into a confidence vote in the shaky Socialist government. But, in
substance, the government and opposition positions will not be far apart,
because both sides want a show of unity to impress EC partners with the
depth and breadth of French hostility to the draft Gatt accord, which would
cut subsidised EC exports by 21 per cent over the next six years.
Today's crucial cabinet meeting, at which the government will decide what
motion to put to Parliament, and the subsequent National Assembly debate,
will come under pressure from some of farm unions gathered in Paris to
protest.
The opposition motion says the draft agreement is:
'Contrary to the fundamental interests of France as well as of the EC';
Insists a Gatt deal must be compatible with reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP) and be balanced in its scope;
Asks the government to request a special EC council 'to inform its partners
immediately of the impossibility of France giving its agreement to this
text';
Presses the government to 'use all means at its disposal, including its
right of veto, to obtain these fundamental guarantees before pursuing Gatt
negotiations and before putting CAP reform into effect'.
Protesting French farmers yesterday saw their case strengthened by an
estimate from Insee, the government statistics service, that their average
income will fall 5.9 per cent this year, after rises in the past two years.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TEXAS Instruments (TI), the US semiconductor maker, and Sanyo Electric of
Japan have dropped legal action against each other in the US courts, they
said yesterday. The move came after they signed a semiconductor patent
cross-licence agreement, but left unresolved a key dispute over a TI patent
covering basic chip technology in Japan.
The unresolved dispute leaves open the possibility of renewed legal action
in the Japanese courts; both companies said they retained the ability to
pursue their rights in Japan.
The cross-licence agreement, running until November 1996, brings
part-resolution to one of the most bitter patent rights disputes between US
and Japanese companies. TI and other US companies have been increasingly
aggressive in recent years in seeking to obtain royalty payments for
intellectual property.
In June, TI filed a patent infringement suit against Sanyo in the US and
sought a judgment that the conduct of its talks with Sanyo did not
constitute a misuse of patents or anti-trust violation. In July, Sanyo filed
anti-trust and breach of contract suits against TI in the US courts.
Sanyo said then that TI was trying to force it to sign an agreement for TI's
Kilby semiconductor patent which Sanyo said it did not use. TI believes the
patent applies to all semiconductor devices made in Japan. The agreement
between the two companies establishes royalty payments which Sanyo will make
to TI for semiconductor technology, but excludes the Kilby patent.
Neither company said how the Kilby patent dispute would be resolved, but it
is likely they will wait for the outcome of a current legal action in Japan
between TI and Fujitsu. Fujitsu and TI were also unable to reach agreement
over applicability of the Kilby patent and sought a determination from the
court on whether the patent applied to semiconductor devices made by
Fujitsu.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Mitterrand to rebuild Mideast relations
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand and four senior government ministers today
begin a four-day tour of Israel and Jordan, in an attempt to rebuild
France's weakened influence in the Middle East.
He will visit Israel for the first time since 1982, when Mr Mitterrand was
the first serving French president to do so, thus opening a reconciliation
between the two countries. Paris has been eager to forge closer ties since
the June election victory of an Israeli Labour administration, committed to
progress in peace talks with the Arabs.
However, the tour comes at a sensitive moment in relations with Israel,
because of Mr Mitterrand's recent refusal to apologise for the wartime Vichy
regime's persecution of French Jews and his decision to send a wreath to the
tomb of Marshal Philippe Petain, the Vichy leader.
French influence in the Middle East has dwindled since the Gulf war, because
of its arms sales to Iraq, and the country has played only a minor role in
the Arab-Israeli peace talks.
France has accordingly started to play an important part in encouraging
talks on economic matters between the two sides, having hosted last month an
economic conference of Israelis and Palestinians in Paris. The French
government tabled a plan to rebuild the regional rail network and plans to
promote this idea on the coming tour.
The 150-strong delegation, which includes senior industrialists, will focus
on immediate rail projects, such as for a link to the Red Sea port of Eilat
and the electrification of a line from Haifa to Tel Aviv.
Mr Mitterrand, who last week called for an end to the 'unacceptable,
immoral' Arab boycott of Israel, will meet Palestinian leaders tomorrow. He
will then move on to Jordan, a long-standing French ally. He is due to
discuss the progress of the peace talks with King Hussein.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Bhutto keeps heat on a besieged Sharif: Law and order
central to Pakistan investment hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEEK after the biggest political challenge by Ms Benazir Bhutto, the
Pakistani opposition leader, to the government of Mr Nawaz Sharif, the
capital Islamabad looks like a city under siege.
Riot control policemen wearing protective gear and armed with batons and
tear gas shells remain on standby. Small enclosures built with sandbags have
just been dismantled and loops of razor wire pushed to the roadside. They
were among the remaining signs of the crackdown last Wednesday, which
involved police and soldiers, to stop Ms Bhutto from leading a public
demonstration demanding Mr Sharif's dismissal on charges of corruption.
More riot police were on alert last night as she arrived at the railway
station in Lahore aboard a train from Karachi in an attempt to reach the
outskirts of the capital.
The confrontation is becoming Mr Sharif's most difficult political test
since he came to office two years ago. There are few signs of a compromise.
The clash grew from a call by Ms Bhutto for a march on parliament to protest
against alleged government corruption and demand fresh elections. The
demonstration was banned and she was barred from Islamabad for a month.
While Ms Bhutto has vowed to continue her struggle, Mr Sharif maintains that
the opposition is trying to destabilise democracy.
Ms Bhutto has widened her coalition by seeking fresh alliances with such
prominent politicians as Mr Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, former prime minister. Mr
Jatoi, a former Sharif ally, ruled over an interim government after Ms
Bhutto's dismissal in August 1990, but broke ranks from the ruling party
earlier this year.
Mr Sharif commands a parliamentary majority despite cracks in his ruling
alliance and there are few signs of large-scale public unrest to unseat him.
However, he is regarded by many observers as more vulnerable.
Earlier this year, the government sent troops to curb growing lawlessness in
the southern province of Sindh, a stronghold of the opposition where a
Sharif-backed government rules. Some order has been restored, but many
businessmen and politicians say the ultimate solution lies in improving
economic factors such as employment and better prospects for landless
peasants, some of whom have turned highway robbers. In addition, there is a
need for compromise with the opposition to curb political discontent.
The Sindh army action also led to a crackdown against a government ally, the
Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM), a powerful regional party based in Karachi,
the heart of Pakistan's business activity. Mr Sharif was forced to break
ranks with the MQM which has exposed his alliance to the possibility of
fresh opposition from Karachi once troops return to their barracks.
There have also been growing differences with the Jamaat-i-Islami, a
religious party which supported Mr Sharif in his election campaign. Most
recently, the government has faced resistance from human rights activists
and religious minorities who are opposing plans to require non-Moslems to
identify their religion on national identity cards. Every Pakistani is
required to hold such a card for identification by police and other
officials.
New economic constraints are also expected to put pressure on the
government. The country's privatisation programme, one of the pillars of
economic policy, is proceeding on track, and the government argues that
efforts towards liberalisation of the economy will continue. But recent
floods are estimated to have damaged roads, bridges and other infrastructure
at a cost of between Dollars 1.6bn and Dollars 2bn.
There is now concern that businessmen will be discouraged from investing in
new projects. 'This sort of thing gets bad press. It discourages investors
from coming here,' says one western diplomat.
Mr Sartaj Aziz, the finance minister, acknowledged in an interview:
'Political instability is not good for investment or economic growth,'
adding that if government-opposition confrontation 'lasts for several weeks
or months, then obviously it will affect the investment climate'.
However, Mr Aziz argues that the confrontation has so far not had an effect
on the economy, adding that neither has the stock market index fallen nor
has there been a large outflow from the country's foreign exchange bank
accounts - two of the most visible signs of nervousness.
There remain few signs suggesting Mr Sharif's imminent downfall. Neither of
the two most important institutions in Pakistani affairs, the president and
the army, is likely to intervene either to change the government
constitutionally or through the use of force - unless there is a further
breakdown of order. But the government-opposition rift will have to end
before Pakistan can again seek to build an image of political stability.

The Indian government was yesterday urged to scrap a Dollars 190m (Pounds
125.8m) contract to import high-technology railway locomotives from Asea
Brown Boveri (ABB), writes Stefan Wagstyl in New Delhi. India's railway
advisory panel said it should develop its own advanced locomotives instead
of buying foreign imports. The Dollars 4m spent on commitment payments to
ABB should not inhibit reconsidering the contract. ABB declined comment
before studying the report.

INDUSTRIALISED nations have pledged up to Dollars 500m (Pounds 330m) on top
of Dollars 240m already committed to help developing countries phase out
chemicals which damage the ozone layer of the atmosphere, writes Bronwen
Maddox in Copenhagen.
Ministers and officials at a three-day United Nations conference in
Copenhagen, who are trying to tighten the terms of the 1987 Montreal
protocol on ozone-depleting chemicals, have agreed to put between Dollars
340m and Dollars 500m into a fund for developing countries between 1994 and
1996. In return, developing countries look set to agree to phase out some
chemicals by 2006, four years earlier than under the existing treaty. They
are also likely to agree to controls on methyl bromide, a previously
unregulated fumigant used in preserving fruit and grain.
Countries including the UK and France have been criticised for not paying
their full contribution to the fund.

<TEXT>
IRISH people vote today on a 'substantive issue' - not jobs or the currency
crisis or even Northern Ireland - but the curious euphemism coined by the
political establishment to describe the most controversial of three
referendums on abortion being held alongside today's general election. The
word 'abortion' does not appear once in any of the referendum texts.
Mercifully for the politicians battling to hold on to their seats in
conservative rural constituencies, abortion has figured only marginally in
the election campaign. But the outcome of the three referendums could become
one of the first battlegrounds for the incoming government.
Judging by the opinion polls, two of the referendums are expected to be
passed by a comfortable majority.
The first concerns whether women should have the right to travel to obtain
an abortion abroad. The second is whether women should be entitled to
receive information in Ireland on how to obtain an abortion.
The third referendum question - the so-called 'substantive issue' - is
whether limited abortion should be available in Ireland in circumstances
where 'termination is necessary to save the life, as distinct from the
health, of the mother. . .'
However, the threat of suicide - which was made in the controversial case of
the 14-year-old rape victim refused leave by the High Court to travel to
Britain last February for an abortion - is ruled out as grounds for a
termination.
The High Court argued that a 1983 right-to-life amendment to the
constitution would be violated. The Supreme Court overturned the decision,
ruling that suicide was a life-threating risk for the mother, but that in
non-life threatening circumstances, injunctions could be sought to prevent
women travelling abroad for an abortion.
This last referendum has upset lobbies on both sides of the abortion debate
 -the self-styled 'pro-life' campaigners who will vote 'no' to all three
referendums, as well as the 'pro-choice' lobby that favours liberalisation
of legislation but feels the distinction made between the mother's health
and her life is offensive and lays a legal minefield.
Mr Padraig Flynn, the justice minister, justified the distinction by saying
that 'the experience in other countries has been that grounds for abortion
related to health, physical or mental, led to abortion on demand'.
All the opposition parties, as well as the main women's groups and the Irish
Congress of Trade Unions, are recommending a No vote on this because they
favour a legislative solution, rather than a constitutional amendment, to
resolve the dilemma created by the Supreme Court ruling.
The Catholic Church has been ambiguous, fearing that a No vote would leave
the Supreme Court ruling as the only basis for abortion legislation.
The opinion polls now indicate a narrow vote against. So it looks as though
the problem will go back once again to the politicians.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNAL EC border controls will not be removed by next January 1, Mr
Kenneth Clarke, British home secretary, said yesterday.
In the first outright admission by a senior minister that the EC will miss
one of its fundamental single market objectives, he told the European
parliament there was ' no prospect of any general removal of frontier
controls on January 1. . . . there is difficulty in reconciling the position
of all the (EC) countries.'
His frank comments will set the tone for next week's two-day meeting of EC
interior ministers in London, where immigration policy and border controls
will be under discussion for the last time before the symbolic opening of
the barrier-free European market.
Britain itself is still adamant that controls on people are essential if
non-EC travellers are to be properly monitored. That stance has put the UK
in dispute with the European Commission and the nine continental European
members of the Schengen free-travel zone.
But in an attempt to take the heat off the UK, Mr Clarke indicated yesterday
that the nine Schengen members might also want to impose stricter checks on
travellers from the non-Schengen countries. He later picked out the
Netherlands, but Dutch officials denied the allegations.
Schengen countries are uneasy with a compromise solution to the British
problem which would allow EC visitors to Britain simply to wave passports at
immigration controls from next year. They believe that compromise would
undermine the barrier-free internal market - and weakens the EC's external
frontiers, where checks are supposed to be more rigorous.

economy

<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund is likely to be persuaded to back a
stronger, more interventionist economic strategy for Russia, officials close
to negotiations for a new coalition government said yesterday.
They believe the IMF will realise the free market policies it initially
supported were necessary to jolt the economy out of its torpor, but are no
longer appropriate as companies fail to respond to price and other market
stimulus.
The more sympathetic response follows informal contacts between fund
officials and the Civic Union bloc centrist parties and movements, and
near-agreement on a new economic strategy under which the government will
take an active role in creating a new class of managers. It will also
subsidise - from the budget - leading enterprises seen as capable of
restructuring and producing efficiently.
There will be temporary price control, and privatisation through the
distribution of vouchers - dismissed by the Civic Union to fail in its
present form - will be allowed to continue but is expected to flounder. The
key is the choice and promotion of the successful companies.
The IMF and government have postponed until next year any attempt to
conclude a standby agreement - privately seen as impossible as inflation
rises above 30 per cent and the government has no effective control of the
financial levers, particularly the Central Bank.
However, the joint government-Civic Union strategy now under discussion is
viewed as supportable, providing it recognises inflation must be curbed and
the budget deficit kept within reasonable bounds.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president and Mr Arkady Volsky, the Civic
Union leader, have merged in their thinking in the past two weeks, after a
period marked by insults. The two men travelled together to South Korea last
week - saying their airborne conversation was critical in reaching
understanding.
As well as the IMF, the leading industrialised countries are likely to
support a government-Civic Union coalition - especially if it offers, as it
promises, a support base to the Russian president. Work remains to be done
within the Russian government in striking agreement on a deal which goes
against much of the free-market purity of the initial programme and also
within the IMF and other western institutions, where the accent is on
fighting inflation and containing the budget deficit.
The World Bank approved a Dollars 70m loan yesterday to help Russia tackle
rising unemployment during transition to a market economy, Reuter reports
from Washington. Among other purposes the loan is intended to develop
employment offices and programmes to deal with mass layoffs, improve labour
monitoring and retrain workers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND and the International Monetary Fund yesterday completed negotiations
on a letter of intent which should pave the way for a new Dollars 660m IMF
standby agreement.
The letter still has to be approved by the Polish government and by the IMF
board at its next meeting in January. Once finalised the new 14-month
standby accord should open the way to a resumption of debt reduction talks
with western commercial banks stalled since June 1991.
Agreement with the fund is crucial to Poland receiving a further 20 per cent
reduction of its Dollars 35bn official debt to western governments in 1994.
In March 1991 government creditors agreed to cut Poland's official debts by
30 per cent in that year and made a further cut contingent on Poland
obtaining the IMF's seal of approval for its economic policies. Its overall
foreign debt was Dollars 50.9bn at the end of August.
The letter of intent was worked out by an IMF team led by Mr Michael
Deppler, head of the European Department, and Mr Jerzy Osiatynski, the
finance minister. It concentrates on next year's budget proposals which
foresee an 81,000bn zlotys deficit or 5.1 per cent of GDP compared to this
year's deficit which will reach 7.5 per cent of GDP.
The budget still has to be approved by parliament, which until now has
resisted government demands for a reduction in pension and other social
payments which will be needed to honour the IMF limits. The budget forecasts
were based on the assumption that the Polish economy will grow by 2 per cent
next year.
Real incomes are to stay at this year's levels while prices are expected to
grow by 39 per cent. This is below this year's 46 per cent increase, in
spite of big rises in the cost of gas, electricity and central heating
planned for 1993. The government's budget documents foresee inflation
falling gradually to reach 10 per cent in 1997.

European Community industry ministers yesterday deferred until next year a
politically sensitive decision on Spanish government plans for restructuring
the Spanish steel industry, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. The ministers
urged Madrid to continue bilateral discussions with individual member states
about the controversial proposals, which would maintain steelmaking in the
volatile Basque country.
Several hundred steelworkers from northern Spain demonstrated outside the
council headquarters in Brussels (picture above) as Mr Claudio Aranzadi,
Spanish industry minister, attempted to convince his colleagues that the
plan was acceptable. But, according to diplomats, only Italy gave tentative
backing. British officials said there had been a consensus among other
states that the promised capacity cuts were too low. Greater cuts might
threaten the core proposal to build a new steel-mill at Bilbao.
Any decision on the plan would have to be unanimous and ministers were not
expected to take such a drastic step yesterday. But Commission officials
believe that if the issue is not resolved soon, Madrid may try to go ahead
with the restructuring without EC approval.
Ministers were also unable to take a formal position on Commission proposals
to grant financial and commercial support to the whole EC steel industry
under the European coal and steel treaty.

western Europe's rising tide of neo-Nazi violence
</HEADLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT FIRST Mr Huseyn Ozdemir did not want to give his name. 'Times have
changed. We are not liked any more,' he said, sipping his tea and smoking
Turkish cigarettes, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin.
Mr Ozdemir is a former chairman of the Turkish Cultural Centre of Berlin in
the working class district of Wedding in what was West Berlin. After
Kreuzberg, it has the second largest Turkish community in the capital.
The community has been deeply shaken by the killing of three Turks in a
firebombing attack in Molln, near Hamburg, on Sunday night.
'I came here 30 years ago,' he said in halting German. 'The German
government invited us here because there was a labour shortage. But what can
I show for it? We have no political rights. It is almost impossible to
obtain German citizenship. And in any case, it's what the Germans feel in
their heart that matters. It's the colour of your hair and the shape of your
face which they look at. Once a foreigner, always a foreigner.' he said.
A Turkish television channel was humming away in the background of the
large, cold room, home to the cultural centre set up 17 years ago to provide
Berlin's 150,000-strong Turkish community with access to Turkish literature,
music and newspapers.
Over the past year, the centre has served as a legal advice forum for Turks
who say they have suffered intimidation.
On a table were scores of letters, many accompanied by police or court
summonses. 'The people who write these letters all speak about
discrimination, racism, a sense of uncertainty,' explained Mr Selim
Inceismail, chairman of the centre. 'Everything has changed since the
collapse of the Berlin Wall,' he said.
The seven young Turkish men in the centre - only one had German citizenship
 -said the Turks in Germany were paying the price for German unification.
'Because of growing unemployment in eastern Germany, we are blamed for
taking jobs,' said Rusmir, a 32-year-old gardener, who has been out of work
for the past three years.
'This is ridiculous because in the past it was the Turks who did all the
menial jobs. Don't tell me that the Germans wanted to do all that dirty
work.
'Yet now, when we apply for jobs, we are turned down. It's hard to say if
it's because of our nationality. But it's hard not to believe it,' he said.
His colleagues believe that growing unemployment is fuelling right-wing
extremism, even among the police. 'This attack on the Turkish family near
Hamburg is not an isolated incident,' said Mr Ozdemir. Since the beginning
of the year, 14 people have died following attacks on foreigners.
'My friend was attacked last week,' said Mr Ozdemir. 'We tell the police,
sometimes. They say they will take action. But they are not tough enough
with the neo-Nazis.'
One of his friends interrupted: 'Sometimes I think they sympathise with
them. Sometimes I think they want us to go home. I will live here as long as
I feel safe. But this feeling decreases every day,' he said.
The sense of pessimism is not as deep, but it certainly exists in some of
the small, smoke-filled cafes in the colourful district of Kreuzberg, which
until 1989, skirted the western side of the Berlin Wall.
'I cannot say it's OK for us here now,' said Dugan, a computer engineer and
fluent German speaker who set up his own business five years ago. He says he
is worried about his four young children, who speak German and attend a
German school, because they are being intimidated by older German students.
'I think it has something to do with unification. The East Germans had no
experience of foreigners in the past. Now they are baiting us.'
But when it was pointed out that official figures show most of the attacks
on foreigners have taken place in the wealthy western Lander, he shrugged.
'Unification has reawakened German nationalism. It frightens me. It would
help if the politicians openly condemned xenophobia and racism. But they
always react too slowly,' he said.
On Monday, however, the killings in Molln jolted the political establishment
into virtually unanimous outrage.
Many Turks insist they want to remain in Germany, despite the attacks.
'I have German citizenship, but I feel Turkish. It is my identity. I cannot
deny that. But that does not mean I cannot contribute to life here in
Germany. There is a third generation of Turks who were born here, yet they
have no automatic right to citizenship. They are strangers in this land,'
said Dugan, who is 31 years old.
Strangers or not, many young Berliners are disgusted with the rise of the
far-right, and the growing attacks on foreigners.
'What happened in Molln was really awful,' said Tomas, a 19-year-old student
who lives near the cultural centre. 'Have we learned nothing about our
past?'

FT  25 NOV 92 / Speculators get taste again for ERM blood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) is designed to give governments
and industry a stable and predictable framework for economic
decision-making. However, after three realignments in 10 weeks, the only
predictable characteristic of the ERM now seems to be its instability.
This week's unrest is both ironic and inevitable. Ironic, because several
European countries now have lower inflation rates than Germany, which
provides Europe's 'anchor' currency, the D-Mark. These virtuous countries
include two non-ERM members, Sweden and Finland, which have recently
abandoned 'pegging' arrangements against the European currency unit, as well
as France and Denmark, whose currencies are suffering within the ERM.
Inevitable, because this autumn's round of European currency devaluations
has now built up sufficient steam to become virtually self-perpetuating. In
view of sluggish European growth, it is very difficult for governments to
use tight monetary policies to counter the markets' belief that some
currencies are over-valued.
Germany is much less keen than other countries to see a fall in the
Bundesbank's short-term interest rates. The Bundesbank believes premature
easing would lower its own anti-inflation credibility.
Reflecting this complex environment, much-repeated proclamations by EC
finance ministers that they will do 'everything possible' to defend parities
count for next to nothing. Convincing the markets is almost as difficult for
countries with low inflation rates and healthy current account positions as
for those with less convincing performances.
As Mr Kit Juckes, economist at SG Warburg in London, puts it: 'France may
have a lower inflation rate (than Germany) and stronger economic growth. The
only economic 'fundamental' which counts is that nobody has enough growth.
So no government is going to live with 15 per cent interest rates for too
long. Like this, defending the system becomes unthinkable.'
The size and number of recent exchange rate movements have had two important
consequences, both tending to reinforce currency strains.
First, the changes in key European currency relationships - including those
produced by the decisions by Britain, Italy, Sweden and Finland to float
their currencies - have been large enough (of the order of 10 per cent or
more) to enable currency speculators to reap large rewards. This has fired
traders' desire to make fresh profits by carrying out further assaults on
currencies deemed 'weak'. Just as important, the prevailing fear of fresh
devaluations has made large companies reluctant to hold weaker currencies.
Second, the members of the hard-currency ERM 'core' are facing growing
competitive difficulties vis-a-vis the increasing number of countries which
have devalued or floated. With European exporters' prospects anyway highly
uncertain, the temptation to join the devaluation spiral is growing - above
all, for countries which transact much of their trade with the devaluing
nations.
Within the ERM 'core', the most vulnerable currency is the Irish punt.
Ireland sold 34.4 per cent of its exports last year to other members of the
'core' (Germany, France, the Benelux countries and Denmark), while 41.6 per
cent was sold to Europe's 'soft seven' - Britain, Finland, Greece, Italy,
Portugal, Spain and Sweden. Next in the firing line on competitive grounds
is Denmark, which because of its strong trading links to the UK, Sweden and
Finland sold 31.7 per cent of its exports last year to the 'soft' club -
against 34.8 per cent to the 'core'.
French exporters are also coming under pressure: 33.4 per cent of French
exports go towards the 'core', while 30 per cent last year were sold to the
weaker currency group.
Mr Jonathan Wilmot of Credit Suisse First Boston in London believes the best
solution for the ERM's travails would have been for Germany unilaterally to
have left the system earlier this year. This would have allowed the D-Mark
to float upwards. Now, he says, France can only hope for a repeat
performance of September's intervention by the Bundesbank.

FT  25 NOV 92 / GDP tonic fails to fortify franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French franc yesterday came under renewed pressure on the foreign
exchange markets despite the announcement of unexpectedly robust figures for
third quarter gross domestic product which helped revive the Paris stock
market.
The Bank of France was forced to intervene to support the franc during the
day, according to dealers' reports. The bank, together with Germany's
Bundesbank, has staunchly defended the French currency throughout this
autumn's currency crisis. But yesterday it failed to prevent the franc
breaching the benchmark level of FFr3.4 against the D-Mark. The news that
GDP had grown 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, when most economists had
been expecting zero growth, did not stave off further falls. The franc ended
the day at FFr3.402 against the D-Mark compared with FFr3.394 on Monday.
The assault on the franc reflects the underlying tensions within the
European Monetary System and the unstable political climate in France, where
the unpopular Socialist government is under pressure from the farming lobby
to reject last week's agricultural trade agreement between the US and the
European Community.
The third quarter growth in GDP, which compares with a negligible rise of
0.1 per cent in the preceding three months, was fuelled by a 0.9 per cent
increase in household expenditure and a 0.7 per cent rise in exports.
However it disguised a 0.8 per cent fall in business investment, the eighth
successive quarterly decline.
Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said the increase in household
expenditure was set to continue next year.
Many economists fear that the present relatively high level of the franc
could impede France's export performance. Goldman Sachs anticipates a
slowdown in exports with France returning to GDP growth of 0.1 per cent in
the final quarter of this year.
Despite these gloomy predictions the GDP figures helped to bolster the Paris
stock market after Monday's fall. The CAC 40 Index recovered almost all the
ground lost on Monday by closing 2.7 per cent higher at 1,720,61.

THE European Commission's campaign for a growth package to stimulate
investment in the flagging European economy faces a test of credibility in
the coming weeks, EC officials said yesterday.
The Commission won a political victory on Monday when EC finance ministers
agreed to explore proposals for a package which combines generating capital
investment with closer co-ordination of economic policy by member states.
The proposals are to be considered at next month's EC summit in Edinburgh,
but member states led by Germany are certain to challenge some of the
Commission's assumptions, particularly the contention that no significant
deficit financing by governments will be involved.
Officials at the European Investment Bank (EIB) in Luxembourg also
questioned whether it could do more to encourage investment in transport,
telecommunications and other infrastructure projects along the lines
proposed by the Commission.
The EIB provides long-term fixed-rate interest loans for projects such as
the Channel tunnel.
Despite widespread concern about lower growth in the European economy next
year, member states are divided on the best approach to a growth initiative,
vague on details and reluctant to let the Commission take the political
lead.
Germany, whose support is vital if an EC-wide growth package is to work,
this week dampened expectations. Mr Horst Kohler, Germany's state secretary
for finance, said: 'We will constructively join in the discussions, but this
is not the time for deficit-financed economic programmes.'
The UK position is ambivalent. British ministers do not want to alienate
their EC partners already angry about Britain's delay in ratifying the
Maastricht treaty.
However officials at the finance meeting in Brussels on Monday voiced alarm
after Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, told reporters
that between Ecu50bn (Pounds 40.7bn) and Ecu60bn was needed to 'move' the
community's economy.
Yesterday Britain acted to quash hopes of substantial funding to stimulate
growth in the European Community, stressing instead the need for
co-ordinated economic planning. The British presidency is clearly keen to be
seen by its continental partners as taking positive action.
Addressing the home audience, however, the British government does not wish
to be interpreted as abandoning its long-standing insistence on budgetary
rigour.
In the House of Commons, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, stressed
co-ordinated action by individual governments.
But he said the EIB could provide more by means of loans and guarantees to
support investment spending, 'especially on projects such as trans-European
networks' for transport. Officials stressed later, however, that funding for
such EIB projects was already in place and would not involve extra money.

<TEXT>
ANTI-immigrant sentiment is increasing, according to government opinion
polls, writes Peter Bruce in Madrid.
There have been about 15 serious racist attacks this year, directed mainly
against north African and Latin American immigrants.
Far-right parties in Spain have won little support in elections, although
some political analysts say their support is growing. There are five main
right-wing groupings. Only one, the Falange, has stood in elections, polling
0.12 per cent of the national vote in the last general election in 1989.
Most racist violence is carried out by groups of youths who appear to have
no party political affiliations.
Among recent attacks, masked men shot an unemployed Dominican immigrant in
Madrid earlier this month. This week the home of another Dominican immigrant
was burned down north of Madrid. On November 20 an Egyptian man was thrown
down an embankment in Madrid, breaking both his legs.
About 400,000 immigrants live in Spain legally and and about another 300,000
illegally.

THE rise of Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front (FN) with its aggressive
anti-immigration stance has been a dominant feature of French politics in
recent years, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
There are other extreme right-wing and anti-immigration groups in France but
the FN is the only serious player on the electoral scene.
Its share of the vote in regional elections has risen from 9.8 per cent in
1986 to 13.9 per cent this year.
The FN was founded in 1972, but it was after the mid-1980s, as the
communists lost momentum and the socialists swung to the centre, that it
emerged as a significant force.
If the regional result was translated into a proportional national poll, the
FN would win 77 of the 577 seats in the National Assembly, rather more than
the single seat it presently holds.
This week, the tombstones of French Moslem soldiers were vandalised at a
military cemetery.
In the past year several Jewish cemeteries in France have been desecrated
with neo-Nazi graffiti.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE debate over immigration has become increasingly bitter, with the
right-wing Austrian Freedom Party (FPO) campaigning for legislation against
foreigners, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
The party, led by the populist Mr Jorg Haider, has proposed a halt to all
immigration and a limit on the proportion of foreign children in schools.
The party began campaigning this week to win signatures for a petition on
its proposals.
It says it expects at least 1m signatures, about a fifth of Austria's
electorate. This would put enormous pressure on the government to submit to
some of the FPO's demands.
Austria has absorbed a huge number of refugees from eastern Europe since the
demise of communism and so far without outbursts of violence of the kind
seen in Germany. But the latest campaign has sparked both anti-foreign and
anti-semitic outbursts.
The FPO is the third largest party in parliament. It has increased its share
of the popular vote from single figures in the mid-1980s to a peak of 23 per
cent in the Vienna city elections a year ago.

RACIST attacks have prompted the government to announce plans for tougher
laws against violence by right-wing groups, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
In the latest incident, a 30-year-old Spaniard was beaten and stabbed by
skinheads in Milan at the weekend.
Italy's sole parliamentary party of the extreme right, the Italian National
Right Socialist Movement (MSI-DN), has consistently presented itself as a
neo-fascist party inheriting the mantle of Mussolini's national socialism.
While its share of the national vote has been falling, from a peak of 8.7per
cent in 1983 to 5.4 per cent this year, it has retained a solid core of
electoral support especially in the Naples area and in southern Italy.
The emergent Lombard League in northern Italy contains national front
elements hostile to immigration but it has broader support and does not fall
into a crude right-wing extremist category.
The 'nazi-skin' movement - skin-heads with neo-Nazi sympathies - is
concentrated in cities such as Rome and Milan.

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SYMPATHY for right-wing extremism appears to be increasing in Germany and
more Germans are hostile to foreigners, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin.
Attempts to explain the trend have become entangled with the debate about
amending the constitutional right to asylum, the influx of refugees, and the
government's slow response to rising violence.
At the last general election, in December 1990, the only extreme right-wing
party to campaign was the Republicans, which gained 2.1 per cent of the vote
but no parliamentary seats. This was well below its 7.2 per cent of the vote
in European elections in 1989. The party won 10.9 per cent in
Baden-Wurttemberg's state election last April.
The other significant right-wing movement, the Deutsche Volksunion won state
representation in Bremen last year, with 6.2 per cent and in
Schleswig-Holstein this year with 6.3 per cent.
Neither party has made a real breakthrough in eastern Germany, although more
neo-Nazi groups have been gathering support, especially among unemployed
youths.
Attacks on foreigners are rising: in the first half of this year, 1,443
criminal acts against foreigners were registered, compared with 2,427 for
the whole of last year and 246 in 1990.
This year, 11 people have died in apparently racially motivated attacks.
More than 30 per cent of the registered crimes were arson and bomb attacks.
Most were committed in the wealthy western Lander of North Rhine-Westphalia,
Hesse and Baden-Wurttemberg.
In September, 99 racist attacks were reported on hostels for asylum seekers,
refugee homes, individuals and property. These included firebombings,
attacks with iron chains and pipes, the desecration of Holocaust memorials,
the smashing of windows of Turkish houses, and petrol bombs being thrown
into hostels.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Bundesbank's caution fuelledby M3 growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROWTH in Germany's broad money supply accelerated again last month,
breaching 10 per cent for the first time since the M3 target was introduced
in 1988 and adding to the widespread conviction that the Bundesbank will not
cut interest rates when its policy-making council meets on Thursday.
However, there was speculation yesterday that the Bundesbank could today
make a small symbolic cut in its securities repurchase rate, by which it
provides short-term liquidity to the banks.
Provisional figures showed that M3 money supply climbed by 10.2 per cent in
October, on a seasonally adjusted annualised basis, far higher than the
Bundesbank's target range of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent.
This compares to 9.3 per cent in September and 8.8 per cent in August.
'The latest data will do little to foster the impression that monetary
policy is about to ease, a situation which will undoubtedly put further
pressure on the EMS,' commented Mr Richard Reid, chief economist at
Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft (Deutschland) in Frankfurt.
The Bundesbank said the main reason for the ballooning M3 growth in October
was the especially large inflow of foreign capital during the second half of
September. This reflected central banks' massive currency interventions
during September's crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism.
Economists said it had already been clear that the effects of intervention
in September had not been fully reflected in that month's M3 number.
They were discouraged however by the continuing strong demand for credit,
which has climbed by 9 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis over the last
six months.
The Bundesbank blamed this on demand for short- and long-term credits which
led to a DM21bn (Pounds 8.6bn) increase in bank credits to businesses and
individuals in October, compared to an increase of DM17bn in September.
The Bundesbank has since the late summer sought to play down the temporary
importance of growth in broad money, which includes cash, current accounts
and short-term deposits. For some months now it has been obvious that the M3
target for the year could not be met.
It has argued that it has been distorted by special factors such as currency
market intervention and the effect of the inverse yield curve, where
short-term interest rates have been higher than long-term rates,
discouraging long-term saving and helping to boost short-term deposits.
However on Monday night Mr Johann Gaddum, a member of the Bundesbank
council, argued that the excess growth in money supply could not simply be
'argued away'. He emphasised that inflation, running at 3.7 per cent a year,
was unjustifiably high.

Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, yesterday announced a DM12bn
(Pounds 4.9bn) package of new measures to help revive economic activity in
east Germany, but insisted it would make no difference to his net borrowing
requirement next year, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn. The key element in the
plan is DM10bn to support indigenous east German entrepreneurs, by
increasing the state subsidy for their investments in manufacturing industry
to 20 per cent, up to a maximum DM1m per project. The aim is to promote the
creation of small and medium-sized enterprises.
The package is intended as part of the government's contribution to its
planned 'solidarity pact' with German employers and trade unions.

<TEXT>
OPEL, the German subsidiary of General Motors, yesterday offered a DM100,000
(Pounds 41,000) reward for information leading to the arrest of arsonists
responsible for an attack in which two Turkish girls and their grandmother
died.
The company, which also offered DM50,000 to the family of the victims, said
its action was intended as 'a small symbol of solidarity with all foreign
citizens living in Germany, and with the company's Turkish employees'.
The offer by Opel follows a wave of national revulsion at the weekend
firebombing at Molln, near Lubeck. Underlining the contribution of some 1.8m
Turkish migrant workers and their families to the German economy, the
company said that 'without their help, the achievements of the German
automobile industry over the last several decades would not have been
possible'.
The move coincided with a call from President Richard von Weizsacker for the
destruction of 'rightwing radical cells'.
During a state visit to Mexico, he appealed to all Germans in a TV interview
to 'wake up and help (to combat xenophobia) by paying attention to their
neighbours and their own households'.
There were spontaneous demonstrations against racism in several towns, and a
minute's silence in the German parliament to mourn the victims.
There was also continuing sharp criticism of the lack of official action to
clamp down on violence against foreigners, voiced by leaders of both the
Turkish and Jewish communities.
Action against radical rightwing groups is expected before the end of the
week, as the latest killings appear finally to have galvanised the
government.
Until now, the parties in the ruling coalition have concentrated on how to
curb the soaring numbers of would-be immigrants entering Germany under its
liberal political asylum laws.
As two further attacks by skinheads on Turkish workers were reported, the
Turkish government and Turkish community leaders demanded increased
protection. Some 40 Turks occupied the party offices of Mr Helmut Kohl's
ruling Christian Democratic Union in Hanover, accusing the party of
'co-responsibility for a fascism-related murder'. Turkish businessmen warned
they would withhold tax payments unless Germany improved protection of
foreign residents.
Mr Ignatz Bubis, leader of Germany's 40,000-strong Jewish community, called
for demonstrations against the government.
A German Jewish writer, Mr Ralph Giordano, claimed that Jews were starting
to arm themselves in self-defence.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Economists see GDP rising at half Treasury estimate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC GROWTH next year will be too weak to prevent further rises in
unemployment, which will remain very high for the rest of the decade, the
Society of Business Economists says today.
The society's latest forecast says gross domestic product will grow by only
0.5 per cent next year - half the rate forecast by the Treasury in the
Autumn Statement this month.
As unemployment continues to rise next year, lack of confidence because of
job insecurity, along with the high burden of debt and a subdued housing
market, will dampen the recovery.
The society, which represents many leading private-sector financial
analysts, forecasts that inflation will remain low in the short term, but
will start to rise at the end of next year and during 1994.
Of the 116 economists surveyed, only 7 per cent expected GDP to fall next
year, compared with 78 per cent forecasting growth of between 0 per cent and
2 per cent next year; 15 per cent expect growth of more than 2 per cent.
The society also forecasts that:
GDP will fall sharply this year and grow by 0.5 per cent next year and by
2.2 per cent in 1994.
Consumer expenditure will rise by 0.9 per cent next year and 1.5 per cent in
1994 after a decline of 0.2 per cent this year.
Gross fixed investment will fall by 1 per cent next year, the fourth
successive annual fall. The society forecasts it will rise by 5.3 per cent
in 1994.
Manufacturing investment will rise by 0.4 per cent next year and by 11.6 per
cent in 1994. Stocks will fall a further Pounds 700m in 1993 and remain
unchanged in 1994.
Retail price inflation will average 2.2 per cent in 1993 and 5.8 per cent in
1994.
The current-account deficit will narrow marginally over the next two years
to about Pounds 11bn in 1994. Exports will rise by 4.6 per cent next year
and 5 per cent in 1994, a slightly faster growth rate than that of imports.
In the longer term, the society expects unemployment to average 2.75m for
the rest of the decade while GDP will manage only below-trend growth of 1.9
per cent between next year and 1997.
Inflation and average earnings growth will also be subdued, averaging 3.6
per cent and 5.3 per cent respectively over the next 10 years, the society
says.

FT  25 NOV 92 / German rate cut unlikely after leap in money supply: EC
hopes for boost dealt blow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HOPES that Europe's faltering economies would receive a boost from an early
cut in German interest rates were dealt a blow yesterday with the
publication of figures showing a sharp rise in the growth of the country's
money supply.
There was also scepticism at suggestions that a proposed package by the
European Commission to stimulate growth would attract new capital.
Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor, dismissed reports that he was masterminding a
multi-million pound programme of infrastructural projects as part of an
expansionist 'dash for growth'.
Declaring himself 'quite astonished' at claims that European Community
finance ministers had discussed figures as high as Pounds 50bn to finance
such a scheme, he insisted, in an interview on BBC radio, that no figures
had been mentioned at Monday's meeting.
Officials at the European Investment Bank also questioned the role the
European Commission has proposed for it in funding a European growth
package.
Mr Lamont conceded that there was concern about the possibility of Europe
entering an economic slowdown. But he added: 'The most important thing that
we could actually do for the European economy would be to have lower German
interest rates.'
European leaders have shown increasing impatience with the Bundesbank's
policy of keeping its official interest rates at a ceiling of 9.5 per cent,
a level that makes it difficult for Germany and other governments to
encourage an economic recovery.
The Bundesbank's unwillingness to ease monetary policy also compounded a
gathering storm inside the European exchange rate mechanism.
The Bank of France intervened twice on the foreign exchanges yesterday,
buying the French franc, after the currency fell below the level of FFr3.40
against the D-Mark for the first time since October.
The Irish and Danish central banks were also forced to intervene on the
foreign exchanges for the second day running after their currencies fell to
their ERM floors against the Belgian franc, one of the strongest currencies
in the system.
The Bundesbank's provisional figures yesterday showed that M3 money supply
climbed by 10.2 per cent in October, on a seasonally adjusted annualised
basis, breaching 10 per cent for the first time since the M3 target was
introduced in 1988.
This was far higher than the Bundesbank's target range of 3.5-5.5 per cent,
and compares with a 9.3 per cent rate in September and 8.8 per cent in
August.
Since the currency crisis of the late summer, the Bundesbank has sought to
play down the temporary importance of growth in broad money, which includes
cash, current accounts and short-term deposits. The Bundesbank has argued
that it has been distorted by special factors such as currency market
intervention, and for some months now it has been obvious that the M3 target
for the year could not be met.
However, on Monday night Mr Johann Gaddum, a member of the Bundesbank
council, argued that the excess growth in money supply could not simply be
'argued away'.
Mr Martin Hufner, chief economist at Bayerische Vereinsbank, also said that
it was not the Bundesbank's job to bail the ERM out of its current
difficulties, implying that the German government should lead efforts to
refashion a fixed exchange rate system.
'The council should not act nervously in response to what happens in the
financial markets,' Mr Hufner said. 'The tensions in the EMS cannot be
remedied by a 1 percentage point cut in the discount rate.'
In currency markets, ERM trading was extremely tense yesterday, with markets
gripped by rumours of more devaluations and withdrawals from the ERM.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Pension tax rebates to be altered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has announced plans to encourage personal pension holders to
stay out of the state pension plan.
From 1996 it will offer age-related tax rebates which will be more generous
to older people. The move is widely seen as an admission that the present
system may not reduce the cost of the state earnings related pension scheme
(Serps).
Under the present regime, men in their late 40s receive too little tax
rebate to make a personal pension worthwhile, and those who have them are
advised to give up personal pensions and rejoin Serps.
But the government still intends to reduce tax breaks for the young, a move
which the insurance industry fears will discourage them from buying personal
pensions.
'The government is committed to considering options for a new system of
rebates related to age to come into effect from April 1996 for personal
pension holders,' the Department of Social Security said.
The government, which had rejected all age-related rebates a year ago, will
now consider extending tax incentives to occupational schemes as well.
The move comes as the government's own actuarial department has produced
figures showing that if the government were to maintain its current policy,
tax rebates would be bound to fall over the next 30 years so that only those
in their late 20s would choose personal pensions. The present system offers
the same rebate to all - a structure which encourages people to rejoin the
state pension system as they grow older and which saves the government very
little money.
The National Audit Office has estimated that between 1988 and 1993, personal
pensions rebates cost Pounds 5.9bn more than they saved in potential social
security expense.
Much of the insurance industry has opposed the introduction of age-related
rebates because it is felt they will offer young people tax incentives too
small to encourage them to choose a personal pension.
Because lower contributions to pensions schemes are required from young
people, the current flat rate rebate system allows them to buy a far more
generous personal pension than they could obtain in the state system.
However, some insurance companies support the concept because they believe
it will allow them to retain pension clients longer. 'We will be able to
hang on to our premium-paying clients,' said Mr Ron Spill, head of pensions
at Legal and General, one of Britain's largest providers of personal
pensions.
Currently, personal pension holders who opt out of Serps are entitled to a
rebate of 5.8 per cent of tax of national average earnings. By next April,
the government intends to cut that to 4.8 per cent of earnings and only
those over the age of 30 will be eligible for the maximum tax savings.
The current system has encouraged 4.7m people to take out personal pensions,
but it is expected that a large minority of those will opt back into the
Serps system when the less generous rebates take effect.

FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Finnair losses deepen to FM197m
at six months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINNAIR, the Finnish state airline, said its loss after financial items
deepened to FM197m (Dollars 38.54m) in the six months to September 30 from
FM31.2m a year earlier.
The airline blamed weak domestic demand and adverse exchange rate movements,
following last year's markka devaluation, for the deterioration.
Turnover rose 2.1 per cent to FM2.82bn, but costs climbed 5 per cent to
FM2.64bn despite a cost-cutting drive, which has resulted in 524 job losses
in the past year and 1,014 job losses in two years.
Finnair was gloomy about the immediate outlook because of the continuing
recession in the domestic economy.
It also pointed to further exchange rate uncertainty after Finland's
decision in September to float the markka, saying this had increased its
costs more than its income.

INDUSTRIAL output in Hungary rose 5 per cent in September, the first

gave industry its first year-on-year growth since 1990.
Hungarian industrial production statistics tend to fluctuate from month to

AN Ontario bankruptcy court last night approved a motion by Olympia &amp; York
Developments to extend the period the developer is protected from creditors
in order to allow time for a debt restructuring plan to be negotiated,
Reuter reports.
It ordered the stay of protection to be extended to February 1 from December
30, and the dates creditors will vote on O&amp;Y's proposed plan to between
January 11 and 15 from November 25 to 30.
O&amp;Y and its creditors are still working on developing a plan to restructure
about CDollars 8.6m (USDollars 6.82m) in debts on its Canadian assets. A new
plan is now scheduled to be presented to the court by December 14.
DELL Computer has received an 'informal request' from the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) for information and documents relating to trading
patterns in the company's shares, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco.
The personal computer manufacturer said that the SEC's request was focused
on trading surrounding the company's third-quarter earnings announced last
Thursday and upon 'subsequent events prompted by remarks made by a Kidder
Peabody analyst on the following day'.
AMERICAN Re, the Princeton-based reinsurance company that was bought out
earlier this year from Aetna Life and Casualty by its management and

<TEXT>
HUNGARY is to launch another large public share offering as part of the
government's attempt to revive the fledgling Budapest stock exchange and
raise local interest in privatisation.
Danubius Hotel and Spa, a state-owned hotel chain, will offer Ft2bn (Dollars
24.3m) of shares to domestic shareholders on December 1 . This follows the
announcement last Friday of the plan to sell up to Ft1.36bn of capital in
Pick Szeged, the salami producer.
The Danubius issue, lead-managed by the Hungarian subsidiary of
Creditanstalt, the Austrian bank, represents 25 per cent of the company's
capital. Each share, worth Ft1,000, offers a price-earning ratio of 12.6
based on forecast 1992 results.
The government hopes both offerings will boost the Budapest stock exchange,
where only three of the 21 shares traded attract regular investor interest.
Unprecedented inducements will be offered to small investors to participate
in the latest offerings. Only 10 per cent of the price will be required as
down payment, with a further 40 per cent due after six months and the
remainder financed through cheap credit. Investors will also be entitled to
one bonus share for every two held for a year.

<TEXT>
ADMINISTRATORS to Polly Peck International, the collapsed UK fruit and
electronics group, yesterday completed the sale of the Sheraton Hotel in the
Mediterranean resort of Antalya to a local Turkish group.
The hotel, the largest of PPI's Turkish assets to be disposed of, was sold
for an undisclosed cash sum to Dogus, a local construction group.
The administrators declined to reveal the value of the sale, although it is
believed to be about Dollars 45m (Pounds 29.8m), considerably less than the
Dollars 65m the hotel cost to build.
The administrators are also negotiating with a series of companies,
including Singer, the Hong Kong electronics concern, for Vestel, PPI's brown
and white goods manufacturer.
Three weeks ago negotiations were concluded on the sale of Media print,
PPI's printing operation, to the local Uzan family.
Land near Izmir acquired for the planned joint venture between PPI and
Peugeot, the French car concern, has also been disposed of. Philip Morris
bought the site for its recently agreed cigarette manufacturing investment.
However, the administrators' attempts to recover the PPI assets in northern
Cyprus have been obstructed by a series of law suits filed by the former
lawyer of Mr Asil Nadir, the former PPI chaiman.
The administrators also suffered a blow when the Kyrenia View, one of PPI's
three hotels on the island, was acquired by the north Cypriot government in
lieu of a debt to the island's social security fund.

FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Hoare Govett seeks Pounds 50m for small
companies trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOARE GOVETT is attempting to raise Pounds 50m for an investment trust which
will track its smaller companies index.
A total of 50m shares at 100p each are available via a combined offer for
subscription and placing. Firm commitments to apply for 19.74m shares have
already been received.
The extended Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index (excluding investment
trusts) contained 1,377 companies at the start of 1992 and was capitalised
at about Pounds 45bn. The index then included companies with a market
capitalisation of Pounds 216m or less.
The Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index Investment Trust will own shares in
more than 200 companies, with no individual stock likely to comprise more
than 2 per cent of its portfolio. It will aim to match the performance of
the index in both capital and dividend yield terms. The manager will be
Broadgate Investment Management, a subsidiary of Hoare Govett, which will
charge an annual fee of 1 per cent.
The 'smaller company effect' was widely trumpeted in the 1980s, with Hoare
Govett noting that its index had substantially outperformed the FT-A
All-Share Index over the period since 1955.
However, the recession has hit smaller companies particularly hard and
Hoare's index underperformed the All-Share in each of the years from 1989 to
1991 (and to date in 1992). This has been the first time since 1955 in which
smaller companies underperformed for three successive calendar years.
Expenses of the offer will be 4.6 per cent if the minimum of Pounds 25m is
raised and 4.2 per cent at the maximum of Pounds 50m. Applications for a
minimum of 1,000 shares must be made by December 7, with dealings expected
to start on December 14.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Fresh blow to Crawley as Hughes Rediffusion cuts 600 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER 600 people are to lose their jobs at Hughes Rediffusion Simulation,
the US-owned flight simulator manufacturer based at Crawley, West Sussex.
The announcement deals a fresh blow to the town, which prospered in the
1980s as nearby Gatwick airport expanded but which has now been badly hit by
the recession.
Last year, 800 local jobs were lost with the collapse of Air Europe and now
1,400 jobs are going with the merger of Dan-Air and British Airways.
Hundreds of jobs in related businesses operating locally are under threat.
The recession also claimed another 500 jobs yesterday when Shell UK
announced redundancies at its Stanlow refinery in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire.
Hughes Rediffusion, experiencing lower orders from civilian and military
customers, has already made about 1,000 workers redundant over the past two
years.
The latest job cuts, involving about a third of the remaining workforce,
follows an announcement in April when the company integrated five satellite
factories in the south-east into its Crawley complex.
Mr Peter Quast, managing director of Hughes Rediffusion, said he deeply
regretted further job losses but the company had to emerge from the
recession better organised, more efficient and with a clear strategy for
long-term growth.
The company's simulators, which sell for between Pounds 5m and Pounds 7m
each, are purchased by most of the world's leading airlines, which have
reduced the size of aircraft fleets and training programmes in the face of
the recession.
Military customers, who buy machines simulating high-speed combat
conditions, are also reducing budgets in the wake of the end of the cold
war.
UK-based competitors of Hughes Rediffusion have also been forced to make
cuts in their workforces.
Hughes Rediffusion is part of Los Angeles-based Hughes Aircraft, itself a
subsidiary of General Motors Hughes Electronics.

FT  25 NOV 92 / Business and the Environment: Courts crack down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A damages award made by the appeal court last week is one of the biggest
ever in the UK for environmental pollution. The judgment could redefine the
potential liabilities of businesses and insurers.
Three court of appeal judges awarded Pounds 1,046,866 against a leather
tannery, Eastern Counties Leatherwork, to Cambridge Water Company in
compensation for contaminating a water aquifer.
The water company had sued after it was forced to abandon a borehole at
Sawston, Cambridgeshire, in 1976 after discovering concentrations in ground
water of perchloroethene (PCEs), a dry-cleaning fluid used to degrease
animal pelts which can be carcinogenic in large quantities.
In an original judgment last July, Mr Justice Ian Kennedy found that PCEs
had been accidentally spilled more than 17 years ago, but that the leather
company could not have foreseen the pollution and was therefore not liable.
But in the appeal court ruling, which is binding in all high courts, the
judges found that the fact the pollution was unforeseeable made no
difference to liability.
The court found that ECL was not negligent, but liable 'in nuisance' - an
older legal concept under which it is not necessary to prove any fault to
show liability.
According to Paul Taylor, of Berrymans, the solicitors acting for ECL and
its insurers, the judgment 'changes the goalposts' for environmental
liability cases, and makes companies more vulnerable.
'Hundreds of companies who dumped their goods on waste ground 20 to 30 years
ago could now find themselves strictly liable,' he says.
UK insurers have tended to underplay the dangers of claims arising from
liability in nuisance, often offering the cover at little or no extra cost.
This case could well serve as a warning that UK courts are becoming more
sympathetic to plaintiffs in these kinds of cases.

M-19's withdrawal, which means the resignation of Health Minister Gustavo de

FT  25 NOV 92 / Survey of Derbyshire (1): Recovery will be a long slog -
Derbyshire is affected by many of the pressures bearing down on UK society -
all of which crystallise into the single, crucial question of how to find
jobs. The answer is as elusive in Derbyshire as elsewhere in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK comes together in Derbyshire. This is not just because the county, in
the heart of England, is a linchpin between the Midlands, the north-west and
Yorkshire. It is not just because, within a relatively narrow area,
Derbyshire embraces the main characteristics illustrating the contrasting
geographical facets of picture-postcard rural England and drab urban
landscape.
It is also because Derbyshire is a microcosm of the pressures bearing down
on UK society.
Here there are the classic problems of economic restructuring, the shift
away from old traditional industries to new high-technology light
manufacturing. Here there are the difficulties both of reshaping a sluggish
rural economy and of urban regeneration. Here there have been the tensions
between central and local government.
Here, of pressing immediate importance, are the ravages of recession
compounded by the threat to the remaining coalmines of the county.
All of the pressures crystallise into the single crucial question of how to
find jobs, both for those who have lost them and for those entering the
labour market in the near and medium terms. The question can be no more
clearly answered in Derbyshire than anywhere else in the UK.
The immediate response among public authorities is to start talking of
inward investment with the customary obeisance to the skilled and adaptable
workforce. But there is no measure of this skill and adaptability relative
to any other area in Britain. And it is not clear what will be the source of
this inward investment.
The chances of investment on the scale of Toyota, the Japanese car
manufacturer - shortly to start production at a Pounds 700m plant in
Burnaston, to the south of the county - seems unlikely to be repeated in the
immediate future. There has been no rush of Japanese companies to follow it.
The taste of Japanese companies for overseas investment, in any case, has
been soured by domestic economic problems.
It is true that the strengthening of the UK vehicles and components sector,
within which the Japanese involvement and the growing internationalisation
of domestic producers are significant factors, could spin off more
vigorously into Derbyshire. But, for the moment, the region of attraction
for continental European companies has not been the East Midlands, of which
Derbyshire is a part, but the West Midlands.
To the extent that Derbyshire has actively sought inward investment, it has
concentrated on manufacturing. This seems likely to continue. For the
service sector, the blandishment of lower property costs than the south of
England has lost appeal as a surplus of office space has built up in the
Home Counties. Indeed, the Prison Service, which had planned to relocate to
Derby, found that it could not afford to move.
Beyond that, industry rather than services gives the county its economic
backbone. While there is a case for building up a stronger independent
services sector to provide diversification as a protection against the
economic cycles, Derbyshire in the national context has probably lost that
game to Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire.
Of course, it is not surprising that inward investment should be seen as an
antidote to the difficulties building up in the county economy. The decision
of Toyota to go to the county was not only the investment coup of the 1980s.
It was also, arguably, the single most significant corporate decision to
have affected Derbyshire for a generation. Repetition by other companies,
albeit on a smaller scale, would provide dynamism in an economy which, like
so many others in the recession, has been winding down.
After all, the presence of Toyota gave the economy, especially in the south,
a stimulus that held off the full impact of the recession longer than in
most UK areas. As recent business surveys have shown, it prompted more
confidence about the future among business leaders than has been evident
elsewhere in the East Midlands.
Further, inward investment, were it to take place, would help to offset the
effects of the threatened closure of three collieries, with the loss of
nearly 3,000 mining jobs, in the declining coalfield of north-east
Derbyshire. Hence the plea for the government to give Assisted Area status
to Chesterfield and allow national and European Community subsidies to
assist investment.
But, given the UK recession, the decline of industrial production in Japan,
the hesitant recovery of the US economy and the subdued outlook in
continental Europe, it is unlikely that Derbyshire in the near future will
experience fresh inward investment on a scale that provides sustained
economic impetus.
The county, like so many others, is forced back to the conclusion that the
best hope for growth lies in the expansion of existing companies, the
succouring of smaller companies which will be the Rolls-Royces, Brels and
Courtaulds of tomorrow.
It remains to be seen whether the Autumn Statement earlier this month is the
harbinger of economic recovery and a commercial climate which will turn that
hope to reality. If not, then probably the best which can be expected is
static economic performance accompanied by a build-up of social problems.
Unemployment has been rising steadily across the county although it remains
below the national average in some rural areas. In Derby, the rate has
climbed from 7 per cent to 12.8 per cent in two years, but that average
hides the fact that in one inner city suburb the rate reached 30 per cent.
For the past five years, the unemployment rate in the Chesterfield area has
been running at about 23 per cent above the national average.
More people chasing fewer jobs has led, since the beginning of 1991, to a
rapid build-up in the numbers of the long-term unemployed - those who have
been out of work for more than a year, according to county council analysis
earlier this year.
The worst-affected areas, in terms of totals, are Chesterfield and
north-east Derbyshire. But parts of Derby are exhibiting that painful
British urban phenomenon: a growing concentration of people living outside
the ebb and flow of the economy. Even when the economy is expanding they do
not obtain jobs.
This particular difficulty is being addressed by City Challenge, the
government urban regeneration scheme which, after competitive bidding,
funnels into a specific area Pounds 37.5m over five years.
More generally, the immediate prospects for the unemployed are not
encouraging. Both the North Derbyshire and the Derby &amp; Derbyshire Chambers
of Commerce, in their latest business surveys undertaken before the Autumn
Statement, reported a downturn in orders.
Derby &amp; Derbyshire noted that 40 per cent of the manufacturing companies in
its area employing less than 19 people had experienced during the third
quarter a decrease in home orders. In the second quarter, 40 per cent of
them had found their order books growing.
North Derbyshire observed a deteriorating financial situation for companies
in its area: in September, 38 per cent reported a worsening cashflow,
compared with 31 per cent in June and 20 per cent in March. The number of
manufacturing companies operating at full capacity fell to 15 per cent from
28 per cent over the third quarter.
Even if the Autumn Statement checks the recession, the impact of recovery
will be slow to seep through. In any case the recovery will need to be
sustained and far-reaching to provide an economic panacea for the
north-east: the continuing struggle to shift dependence away from industries
based on coal and steel will enter a new and acute phase in the event of
coalmine closures. The county faces a long slog.

FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Sentrachem agrees Australian
purchase

SENTRACHEM, one of South Africa's largest chemical groups, has agreed the
purchase of Australian chemical group Chemplex, controlled by Mr Kerry
Packer.
The sale, which will only proceed subject to a strict due-diligence
investigation, will be the latest in a series of offshore purchases by South
African companies. These include the purchases of Hannover Papier by Sappi,
the paper and pulp group; Henry Ansbacher by First National Bank; and the
African banking interests of ANZ/Grindlays by the Standard Bank group.
No price has been made public for the deal, but Chemplex had sales last year
in excess of ADollars 200m (USDollars 136.7m).
Mr John Job, Sentrachem's chief executive, said the company needed to
diversify internationally rather than merely defend its high market share as
South Africa opens up to international competition. The Australian base also
provided access to the Pacific Rim market.
Chemplex makes styrene, while Sentrachem is South Africa's biggest user of
the compound, with a significant portion of its sales styrene-based.
If the deal is concluded, less than half of the purchase price will be
settled in financial rands - the volatile investment currency which has
weakened considerably recently - with the balance being funded by loans.

FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Profits at Nippon Shinpan rise
9%

NIPPON Shinpan, the Japanese consumer credit company, reported a 9 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits to Y7.7bn (Dollars 62.1m) for the first half to
end-September, in spite of the continuing rise in personal bankruptcies that
has hurt other credit companies.
Operating revenues rose 3.4 per cent to Y181.5bn, reflecting the recent
downturn in department store sales and the reluctance of consumers to
purchase big ticket items such as cars and domestic appliances.
After-tax profits fell 37 per cent to Y2.2bn, following a Y1.8bn appraisal
loss on securities holdings.
However, pre-tax profits were pushed up by lower interest rates, which
reduced the group's repayment burden.
A telling sign of weak consumer demand was a 7 per cent fall to Y2,842.9bn
in total contracts on credit cards, shopping loans and other items, ending a
run of continuous increases since the company was listed in 1961.
For the full year, Nippon Shinpan expects pre-tax profits to rise 26 per
cent to Y15bn, and operating revenues to advance to Y368bn from Y352bn last
year.
Minolta Camera, the Japanese camera and business machine manufacturer, is to
sell 18,942 square metres of land to Matsushita Electric Works for Y5.68bn
in order to repay loans built up when it paid Y13bn to Honeywell in 1991-92
for infringing patents, Reuter reports from Tokyo.

FT  24 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE fails to hold new trading peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUCCESSFUL progress at the GATT negotiations took the UK stock market to a
new trading peak early in yesterday's session but gains were reversed as new
uncertainties in European currencies undermined confidence in prospects for
another one point cut in domestic base rates before Christmas. Dealers said
there was little selling pressure, however, despite a sudden plunge in share
prices on rumours that a rise in Value Added Tax was in the offing.
The stock market opened lower, unsettled by the devaluation of Spanish and
Portuguese currencies over the weekend and by the expected pressures on the
Irish punt which was countered by a huge rise in interest rates in Dublin.
But share prices quickly turned higher as stock index futures came in firmly
and equities caught up with the better news from the GATT talks, followed by
plans for a meeting on Tuesday of the Uruguay Round members.
The FT-SE Index quickly broke through to a new trading peak of 2,745.2, just
one point above the previous peak reached in May. But, with currency markets
continuing to dominate attention, genuine investment support for equities
proved lacking and the 12.8 gain in the Footsie was first whittled away and
then reversed.
Disclosure that the UK's current account deficit had increased to Pounds
1.1bn in October brought no comfort to the stock market, and share prices
extended their losses in response to similar, but sharper, falls in some
other European bourses. At worst, the Footsie was down by 12.7 points but
still 20 points above the 2,700 benchmark and suffering little more than
intra-market selling as marketmakers sought to pass stock between one
another.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,722.9, for a loss of 9.5 which
left the previous closing high intact at 2,737.8. London was helped at the
close by Wall Street which recovered an early loss during London market
hours.
Seaq volume drifted away to 461.3m shares compared with 546.7m on Friday,
supporting the traders' view that little of consequence had happened in the
market yesterday. However, retail, or customer, business in equities was
worth Pounds 1bn on Friday, maintaining the relative improvement of recent
weeks.
Against the background of currency nervousness, the international blue chip
stocks made little headway, ICI remaining depressed by last week's bearish
reviews of the proposed demerger of the bio-science interests.
Some brewing stocks continued to respond to the likelihood of a settlement
of the GATT negotiations. But a report, from economists at the Manchester
Business School and Cambridge University, that retailers would see improved
consumer spending next year had little effect on store and other retail
issues.
Strategists appeared unperturbed by the equity market's repeated failure to
push convincingly through its previous highs. The market is consolidating
but now showing signs of improving confidence, according to Kleinwort
Benson, the London merchant bank and investment house. Nikko believes that
only renewed corporate earnings growth could drive the market higher.

FT  24 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Payment fears hit BET
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRUCE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOUBTS about next year's dividend hit BET's share price after the board
reported a fall in first half profits figures and a cut in the interim
payout.
The business services group announced a 43 per cent fall in profits to
Pounds 40.5m, in line with market forecasts, and cut the dividend from 4.25p
to 2p. However it was comments from the chief executive that the board,
'will have to consider very carefully the correct level for the following
year' that led to fears of a cut in next year's dividend, sending the shares
tumbling. The comments also led to fears for this year's full dividend
payment although the company said it intends to maintain at 6.5p.
By the close the shares had given up 20 to 93p,in heavy trade of 15m shares,
as several analysts downgraded profit expectations for both the current and
following year to take account of the gloomy trading outlook. BET's broker,
BZW, shaved its current year figure by Pounds 14m to Pounds 84m.
Tobaccos fall
Tobacco groups BAT Industries and Rothmans International lost early gains as
the market became convinced that US broker Salomon Brothers had downgraded
the groups.
Salomons' strategist had removed cigarette and foods group RJR Nabisco from
its recommended list but had not mentioned the two UK companies. However,
tobacco analyst Ms Diana Temple said there was a persistent worry that US
president-elect Mr Bill Clinton might increase federal excise taxes on
tobacco at the second stage of the tax bill at the start of January.
BAT saw its share price swing round from a gain of 24 earlier in the day to
a net fall of 10 at 955p. Rothmans, also overshadowed by the prospect of
disappointing interims tomorrow, fell 11 to 596p after being 3 firmer
earlier.
Wellcome wanted
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome bucked the trend in the market and the sector
with a rise of 12 to 1036p. Lehman Brothers pharmaceuticals analyst Mr
Stewart Adkins discussed the stock at the morning meeting on his return from
a wide ranging US road show. The house has Wellcome as a strong buy and has
recommended it to 300 institutional clients over the past month. Meanwhile,
Glaxo tumbled 18 to 807p in late trading on concerns that a large seller was
moving back into the US market. Dealers said the New York seller offloaded
up to 7m American depositary Receipts last week, equivalent to 14m shares.
Nervousness ahead of the OPEC conference scheduled to open in Vienna
tomorrow took the edge off the oil and gas sector. Earlier, leading oil
stocks had made modest progress, reflecting the initial firmer trend of the
dollar. The latest slide in the oil price triggered a flurry of selling and
the majors were struggling as the market closed. Shell settled 3 off at 542p
on 4.1m traded, while BP only just managed to stay in ahead closing a
fraction harder at 232 1/2 p on 5.6m.
British Gas, helped early in the day by renewed buying thought to have been
carried out by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, tumbled late in the session on the
appearance of a handful of sizeable selling orders and closed 4 off at 262
1/2 p.
A number of chemicals stocks gained at the expense of ICI as concerns grow
over the planned demerger of the group. Sellers of ICI, which closed 15
lower at 1009p, moved into Laporte, up 15 at 633p, BOC, 4 better at 741p,
and Courtaulds, 3 firmer at 512p.
Water shares never recovered from an early bout of weakness and
substantially underperformed the rest of the utilities area. UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew was said to have adopted a more bearish view of the waters although
this was not confirmed.
However, turnover was unremarkable, with only Yorkshire Water and Severn
Trent attracting turnover of over a million shares. The latter slipped 10 to
462p while Yorkshire bucked the overall trend and settled 2 firmer at 531p.
Anglian were 8 down at 483p, Thames the same amount easier at 493p and North
West, reporting interims tomorrow, 9 1/2 off at 490p. The electricity stocks
were moderately easier.
Lloyds Bank shares jumped as the market closed, rallying from 494p to end a
net 4 higher at 501p in thin turnover. Lloyds Abbey Life raced higher to
close 17 up at 390p with dealers pointing out the stock's recent
underperformance against the sector.
Vodafone eased 3 to 387p in front of interim figures due this morning.
Profits are expected to top the Pounds 150m against last year's Pounds 140m,
and the dividend increased by around 12 per cent.
Electronics group Diploma advanced 22 to 344p after the group's preliminary
results eclipsed even the most optimistic of market forecasts.
Security and car auctions group ADT jumped 40 to 500p after posting a rise
in third-quarter profits to Dollars 41.9m from Dollars 23m.
John Mowlem retreated 6 to 73p with the company's broker, Hoare Govett, said
to have downgraded estimates for the group. NSM, which rose 45 per cent last
week, eased 3 to 55p in front of interim results expected this morning.
In a dull property sector, one of the most financially troubled stocks
attracted investor attention. Regalian Property, which is in breach of its
banking covenants, was lifted on a rumour that a buyer had been found for
its prestigious Kensington Palace Gardens. A sale would greatly alleviate
Regalian's dire debt situation. The shares rose 1 1/2 to 13 1/2 p in big
turnover of 2.6m.
Speculation that Vickers would soon announce a one-for-three rights issue
continued to depress the shares, which fell 4 to 81p.
A profits warning from Dagenham Motors about second-half figures caused the
shares to slide 25 to 78p. Lex Service fell 6 to 230p in sympathy.
Tomkins added 3 to 215p after County NatWest issued a note indicating it had
warmed to the company's bid for RHM, unchanged at 257 1/2 p. Brisk trade of
around 14m shares in Tomkins' nil paid shares was seen yesterday though
turnover in the ordinaries amounted to only 2.4m.
Magazine group EMAP improved 7 to 299p after posting raised half-year
results and an improved dividend. However, the headline figure included
Pounds 1m from a disposal and broker SG Warburg shaved its full-year
estimate by Pounds 2m to Pounds 40m.
Television station HTV Group rose 4 to 18p, buoyed by weekend press
speculation of a bid for the company. Traders said the share price strength
followed an article suggesting that TV-AM which is to lose its transmission
licence at the end of December, was stalking the the company.
Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) lost ground in active trade after Sunday press
reports that the group's profits would fall short of analysts' forecasts for
1992 and 1993. MGN was down 4 at one stage but rebounded to close 1 1/2 off
at 79 1/2 p.
Big turnover in Compass Group, normally a tightly-held stock, followed a
1.4m agency cross at 478p. SG Warburg was said to be positive and the shares
edged up a penny to 479p.
Brewer Bass gained, largely at the expense of Whitbread, shares in the
former jumping 10 to 575p as some in the market considered its rating
undemanding. Whitbread was weakened by a flurry of mostly negative
post-results notes. Japanese-owned broker Yamaichi advised clients to take
profits. Whitbread slipped 4 to 445p.
Doubts whether Etam would again become a bid target for Oceana Investment
Corporation circulated among analysts after the Etam chairman sold 120,000
shares on Friday. The shares slipped a penny to 242p.
Kwik Save moved forward 9 to 758p ahead of interim results tomorrow. A
pre-results buy note from County NatWest for Tate and Lyle, which reports
the same day, forecasts that the shares will break 400p within the next
three months. The stock added 2 to 359p.

FT  24 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EARLY squeeze in stock index futures sent the December contract to its
highest level to date, in a session marked for a lack of other features and
poor turnover, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened at 2,747, the December contract on the FT-SE was squeezed
higher by independent traders (locals) and reached 2,769 which not only
proved to be the day's peak but also the highest level reached by the
current contract, within the first hour of trading.
This early momentum helped pull the underlying cash market higher and
briefly through its all time high.
But with trade rather thin as the large institutions remained on the
sidelines, December lost some of the early momentum and traded in a narrow
range of 2,745 and 2,760 for the middle part of the session. The late
morning release of balance of payment figures had no significant impact on
trading.
However, it was the early weakness on Wall Street that caused a change in
sentiment sending the contract into retreat.
December closed at 2,723, the day's low point, and around 5 points below its
estimated fair value premium to cash of about 9. turnover was a poor 5,470.
Traded options were dull with total volume reaching 22,176 lots of which
9,233 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option.

FT  24 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Thanksgiving week starts in
modest style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices were mixed in modest trading yesterday as the Thanksgiving
holiday week opened in subdued fashion, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.32 at 3,233.04,
having spent most of the day only a few points either side of opening
values. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.53 lower at
425.12, while the Amex composite eased 1.45 to 390.74. The Nasdaq composite
index, which rose close to its all-time high last week, ran into
profit-taking and dropped 3.77 to 638.83. Turnover on the New York SE was
light by recent standards at 191m shares, and declines outpaced rises by 949
to 808.
After last Friday, when most of the market's gains were earned from
technical buying related to the monthly expiration of stock index and
individual stock futures contracts, observers predicted that prices would
open lower. They did, with the Dow dropping more than 10 points in the first
30 minutes.
The market gradually recovered, aided by news of a Dollars 3bn merger deal
in the aerospace industry and a major corporate restructuring. Sentiment,
however, was not positive enough to lift shares to strong gains, and in
active two-way trading primarily biased to the sell side, prices fell into a
tight range either side of opening values.
The level of trading activity yesterday was well below recent days, which
was to be expected at the start of what is traditionally one of the year's
slowest weeks. Thanksgiving Day is on Thursday, and many market participants
extend the holiday weekend by taking Wednesday and Friday off.
Among individual stocks, Martin Marietta jumped Dollars 5 5/8 to Dollars 63
1/4 in turnover of 1.2m shares after the company announced it had signed a
definitive pact to merge with General Electric's aerospace business. The
deal, valued at Dollars 3.05bn, will see Martin Marietta's annual revenues
nearly double to about Dollars 11bn. The news left GE Dollars 23 1/8 higher
at Dollars 82 1/8 in turnover of 1.8m shares.
The big restructuring announced yesterday was Westinghouse, which climbed
Dollars 2 3/8 , or 24 per cent, higher at 12 1/8 in turnover of 5m shares
after the company unveiled changes that included a withdrawal from the
financial services business, the divestiture of some non-core units, a
reduction in debt by more than Dollars 5bn over two years, and an after-tax
charge of Dollars 1.13bn.
Eastman Kodak firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 41 1/4 on the news that the
company is selling its Atex subsidiary, which makes computers for the
newspaper industry. ADRs in BET plunged Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 5 7/8 after
the company unveiled a 43 per cent drop six-month profits.
Canada
TORONTO STOCKs ended lower in light volume, shadowing Wall Street and
pressured by steadily rising Canadian credit rates, dealers said. 'We
followed New York for most of today, but volumes up here were fairly
lackluster,' one broker said.
The TSE-300 Index eased 5.56 points or 0.17 per cent to 3,258.3 on volume of
33.4m, compared to Friday's turnover of 37.7m.  Declining shares led those
advancing 329 to 270.

FT  24 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Devaluation pressures lead to different
effects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENEWED currency tension and the possibility of devaluation had different
effects on continental bourses last week. Swedish equities soared after
Sweden abandoned efforts to peg the krona to the European currency unit, but
other markets fell as their currencies came under pressure.
According to FT-A World indices, Stockholm jumped 16.3 per cent in local
currency terms on the week as investors bought the market's international
blue chips in the hope of improved competitiveness and currency translation
effects.
But the market only rose by 2.2 per cent in dollar terms , reflecting the
effective devaluation of the krona against its major trading partners.
Sweden has had plenty of experience in using devaluation, particularly in
the early 1980s; the beneficial effect on the stock market, therefore, is
widely known. Unibors Securities notes that when the krona was devalued by
16 per cent in October 1982, the return on the Affarsvarlden general index
over the next 12 months was 107 per cent, with the forestry index benefiting
the most with a return of 141 per cent, followed by the capital goods index
with 117 per cent.
Mr Henrik Breum at Unibors does not expect the same kind of return following
last week's devaluation, due to the weak position of both the domestic and
the US economies. However, he believes that the Affarsvarlden general index
could reach 950 over the next six months from its current 844.9, and reach
1,000 on a 12-month view.
Equities in neighbouring Norway jumped by 7.3 per cent in local currency
terms (but by a more moderate 6 per cent measured in dollars) on hopes that
Norway would also be forced to devalue its currency.
Spain, up 6 per cent in local currency terms in the wake of
better-than-expected inflation data for October, was also seen as a
candidate for devaluation last week. This duly occured over the weekend when
the peseta was devalued by 6 per cent along with the Portuguese escudo.
Goldman Sachs says that while the gains for Spanish equities in the way of
export or translation effects are relatively small, the realignment would
probably attract foreign investors and trigger a correction in what it
considers to be an undervalued market.
However, fears that their currencies would also come into the firing line
contributed to the 3.6 per cent decline (5.6 per cent in dollars) in France
and the 3.6 per cent local currency fall (6.3 per cent in dollars) in
Denmark.
The fall in France also reflected a belief that interest rates are unlikely
to to fall further for some time, as well as disappointment with the recent
nine-months results season.
Mr Michael Woodcock at Nikko Securities says that investors are preoccupied
with four themes: a cut in rates, the recovery in the dollar, the
parliamentary election next March and a new government's privatisation
candidates. Furthermore, a number of company chairmen have cautioned that
1993 may remain difficult.
By far the greatest faller on the week was Hong Kong which dropped 8.2 per
cent in local currency terms following China's sharp rebuttal of Governor
Chris Patten's call for political reforms in the colony. Hoare Govett does
not expect an early easing in the political friction and adds that
uncertainty remains in the forefront of market sentiment.
However, the broker believes that the resulting volatility may provide some
excellent buying opportunities, since corporate fundamentals remain sound,
with EPS growth forecasts of 24 per cent this year and 19 per cent next.
The fluctuations in Sweden and Hong Kong failed to have much impact on
regional aggregates last week, with Europe up 0.4 per cent and , the Pacific
Basin up by 0.1 per cent. The FT-A World index rose 1.1 per cent.

FT  24 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Australia shows
accelerated recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOKYO was closed yesterday for the Labour Thanksgiving Day holiday.
Attention in the region focused on the accelerated recovery in Australia,
and the relative lack of momentum in Hong Kong, writes Our Markets Staff.
AUSTRALIA notched up its biggest one-day gain since April 10, aided by heavy
bargain-hunting. The All-Ordinaries finished 36.3 higher at 1,446.4.
Turnover reached 95.65m shares worth ADollars 234m and a further 16.4m in
options were traded. Rises outperformed falls by a margin of seven to three.
Brokers said that the market was also aided by option players moving to
cover short positions, strong gains in futures and some positive news from
the sugar producer and building group, CSR.
CSR jumped 16 cents to ADollars 3.63 on a 23 per cent rise in interim
profits and the forecast of further growth in the remainder of this year.
Its joint partners in a new ADollars 325m cement group, announced on Friday,
also made strong gains. Pioneer closed 9 cents nine stronger at ADollars
2.29 and Adelaide Brighton was 5 cents better at ADollars 1.54.
SEOUL finished higher in active trade with financial and bank shares in the
lead. The composite index closed 15.38 higher at 669.46 as 45.3m shares
changed hands against 25.79m in Saturday's half-day session.
The government's move to cut interest rates left most financials and banks
at their limit highs. Kepco, the electricity generator which is the most
heavily weighted share in the market, also hit its daily limit, rising
Won1,000 to Won24,300. Foreign investors will be allowed to invest in Kepco
from today.
NEW ZEALAND saw sharp rises in small rural stocks following the weekend
rescue for the Gatt trade talks. But the gains were selective and the NZSE
40 index closed only 10.2 higher at 1,456.79 in turnover of NZDollars 21m
which moderate for a Monday.
SINGAPORE consolidated and the Straits Times Industrial index rose 5.39 to
1,419.21 in volume of 147.6m shares, up from 138.8m on Friday.
A block deal of 40m United Industrial Corporation shares was completed late
in the day at 98 Singapore cents.
KUALA LUMPUR reflected both bargain-hunting and profit-taking as the
composite index closed 1.19 higher at 643.79. Kelang Container made an
impressive debut, closing at MDollars 8.40 after a high of MDollars 9
compared with its offer price of MDollars 3.10; it was the most active
stock, trading in 20m shares.
BANGKOK's property companies registered a good recovery from heavy losses
recently, but brokers said that investors had not yet regained their full
confidence following the crackdown on share manipulation.
The SET index rose 3.35 to 875.07 in moderate turnover of Bt9.14bn. Bangkok
Land jumped Bt6 to Bt109, Krisda Mahanakorn Bt3 to Bt134, and Tanayong
Bt2.50 to Bt89.50.
MANILA slid in light trading but brokers still said that they expected a
rally led by oversold commercial issues. The composite index shed 4.06 to
1,299.57.
TAIWAN reversed early gains in profit-taking to end slightly lower in
moderate trade, the weighted index closing 13.20 lower at 3,698.51 in
turnover up from TDollars 7.8bn to TDollars 9.4bn.
BOMBAY ended higher with state-owned mutual funds buying up most of the
available stocks in the market. The BSE index rose 50.91 to 2,530.47.

JOHANNESBURG ended mixed in sluggish trade, with the all-share index a point
higher at 3,048. De Beers and Minorco posted gains on the sharp drop in the
financial rand; but industrials lost 11 to 4,067 and golds 4 to 765.

FT  24 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses swayed by latest
currency developments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MADRID offered a muted equity market response to weekend monetary events,
but Lisbon picked up and Stockholm showed further enthusiasm for its own
realignment, writes Our Markets Staff.
MADRID tried to build on last week's strong performance but an early 1 per
cent gain for the equity market disappeared as early impetus from the peseta
and bonds disappeared. Volume eased to Pta19.4bn from last Friday's
Pta22.7bn, and the general index ended 0.71 lower at 212.04.
LISBON rose 0.8 per cent as the weekend devaluation of the escudo prompted
domestic investors to buy, in anticipation of an influx of foreign money.
But the return of the escudo to its pre-devaluation level kept foreigners
away and the BTA index put on 12.9 to 1,661.4 in modest turnover.
STOCKHOLM continued its post-devaluation advance in spite of profit-taking.
The Affarsvarlden General index rose 23.8 or 2.9 per cent to 844.9 in
turnover of SKr1.43bn, down from Friday's record SKr2.66bn.
Ericsson shares were the most heavily traded as its free B shares closed up
SKr8 to SKr173 after recording a 1992 intraday high of SKr176.
The forestry sector, which led Friday's surge, registered more modest gains
yesterday as Stora added SKr13 to SKr269.
OSLO fell 2.1 per cent as pressure against the crown eased and investors
were no longer convinced that Norway would be forced to devalue its
currency. The all-share index dropped 7.52 to 348.75 in moderate trading
worth NKr287.9m.
PARIS dropped 2.9 per cent in gloomy trading on the last day of the account
on worries about the French opposition to the trade deal struck between the
EC and the US. The farmers' demonstration tomorrow, labour unrest in the
transport sector and continued weakness in the franc also upset investors.
The CAC-40 index fell 49.41 to 1,674.77 in turnover of FFr2.3bn.
Euro Disney plunged FFr4.20 or 6.4 per cent to a record closing low of
FFr61.50 on fears that the theme park would be the next target of French
farmers' anger against US interests.
Other losers included Chargeurs, down FFr68 to FFr1,182 on disappointing
third quarter results, and Suez, down FFr14.50 to FFr229.80 as a block of
270,000 shares was crossed. Shares in Hachette, Matra and MMB were suspended
amid speculation that a new share swap parity would be announced today.
FRANKFURT was depressed by disappointing third-quarter figures from Bayer
and by more talk of production cutbacks in the car industry.
Early gains on a firmer dollar and vague hopes that the weekend's ERM
realignment offered the chance for a German interest rate cut were quickly
dissipated and the DAX closed 13.87 lower at 1,530.89.
Turnover fell from DM4.4bn to DM3.8bn. After adjusting Hoechst's figures
last week, Bayer's 32 per cent drop in profits was the best performance in
its group but it was still worse than expected. Bayer dropped DM5.70 to
DM254.80 while BASF and Hoechst lost DM3.60 to DM204.10, and DM3.80 to
DM238.10 respectively.
Among carmakers, talk of further production cutbacks at Daimler and
Volkswagen depressed the sector, BMW falling DM6.40 to DM496.10, Daimler by
DM6.60 to DM530 and VW by DM2 to DM285.50.
AEG rose sharply following a weekend report of cooperation talks with
Siemens on railway systems, but subsided to close DM2.70 higher at DM159.20
after DM164 after an AEG spokesman said talks were still at an early stage.
MILAN came off early highs as a burst of euphoria generated by the state
food group, Sme, petered out. The Comit index closed up 2.92 at 461.99 in
turnover estimated at around Friday's L279bn.
Trading in shares of Sme resumed yesterday after the shares' suspension all
last week, but dealing stopped almost at once because of excessive gains.
News of the government's privatisation plans sent the shares rising to
L6,000 from L5,533 more than one week ago before trading stopped. The shares
closed finally at L5,399, down L134 or 2.5 per cent from its last close on
November 13.
BRUSSELS saw trading resume in Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL) after a
two-day suspension and the shares dropped BFr315 or 9.5 per cent to BFr2,985
on disappointment that the Dutch group, ING, was not going ahead with its
takeover of BBL. The Bel-20 index fell 5.59 to 1,137.23.
HELSINKI recovered in late trade on hopes that a wide labour market conflict
could be avoided this week. The Hex index closed 9.3 or 1.2 per cent lower
at 785.0.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: ERM tensions growing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN exchange rate mechanism again appeared on the verge of a crisis
yesterday after the weekend devaluations of the Spanish peseta and
Portuguese escudo failed to staunch speculation against currencies at the
core of the system, writes James Blitz.
The intention of Sunday's 6 per cent devaluation of the Spanish peseta and
Portuguese escudo was to remove strains that had arisen because of the
linkage of these currencies to the D-Mark at an over-valued rate.
But yesterday, the devaluations threatened to create a 'domino effect'
inside the ERM, triggering uncertainty over the Danish krone, a currency
perceived to be at the core of the system.
Unlike the September crisis, this new bout of ERM turmoil did not have its
roots in D-Mark strength alone. The perception that Germany is entering
recession caused the dollar and the yen to appreciate. The US currency rose
nearly a pfennig against the D-Mark, closing at DM1.6020, while the yen was
at Y77.48 to the D-Mark from a previous Y77.91
Inside the ERM, however, the strains formed a familiar pattern. A rise in
overnight rates to 50 per cent helped the Danish authorities to staunch the
selling of the Danish currency and bonds. By the close of European trading,
the currency was trading at DKK3.8818, close to its ERM floor of DKK3.9016.
But analysts wondered whether interest rates could remain at such high
levels.
The Irish punt closed at IPounds 2.6297 against the D-Mark, and dropped
below its ERM floor against the strongest currency in the system, the
Belgian franc. The Irish currency remained weak, despite overnight rates
rising to 30 per cent and the persistence of capital controls.
The Spanish peseta weakened despite two devaluations and a rise yesterday in
interest rates. It closed at Pta 72.26 against the D-Mark, just above its
new central parity of Pta72.79. The escudo remained strong, while sterling
was mostly unaffected, closing up one pfennig at DM2.4325.
Several analysts said yesterday that the rise in Danish rates to such high
levels was absurd, considering that Denmark has a 2 per cent inflation rate
and a current account surplus.
However, speculators are pushing for an early Danish devaluation because of
the export competitiveness that has been lost following devaluations in
other currencies.
The life or death of the EMS ultimately depends on the French franc.
Yesterday, the French currency weakened sharply to a close of FFr3.394 from
previous FFr3.386.
Mr Christopher Potts, an economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris, said that
the franc may be hindered by the growing premium that speculators put on
growth as a reason for purchasing currencies.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Money Markets: Sharp rate rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST RATES in European money markets rose sharply yesterday after the
weekend devaluations of the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo triggered
serious tensions in world currency markets, writes James Blitz.
Several central banks were forced to raise interest rates and tighten
liquidity in their domestic money markets because of speculative attacks on
their currencies.
The Irish central bank raised the overnight rate on the punt to over 30 per
cent to protect the currency. In Denmark, the overnight rate for the krona
was quoted as high as 50 per cent, as the Danish currency fell close to its
ERM floor against the D-Mark.
The Bank of Spain also raised its key money rate by 0.75 basis points to
13.75 per cent after a 6 per cent devaluation failed to stop a new run on
the Spanish peseta. Outside the ERM, the Bank of Finland set its money
market tender rate at 11.35 per cent from 10.88 per cent.
As far as the future of the ERM is concerned, the most serious changes may
have taken place in French markets, where cash and futures prices reflected
the higher premium that dealers now demand for holding francs.
Given France's strong economic fundamentals, the franc should not be a
candidate for devaluation. However, dealers believe that if the Danish krona
is forced to devalue, there will be a renewed speculative attack on the
franc.
Yesterday, the December franc contract fell 40 basis points to a low of
90.26, and later closed at 90.27. The March contract fell 27 basis points to
a low of 91.50 and later closed at 91.54.
Three month money firmed sharply. A week ago it was being quoted at 9 1/2
per cent, but stood yesterday at 10 1/16 per cent. The overnight rate was
quoted at around 10 per cent, having been at 9 3/8 per cent a week before.
By contrast, German money market rates softened on speculation that the
Bundesbank will ease policy to stall the currency crisis. The December
Euromark contract rose 4 basis points to a high of 91.47, but later eased
back to 91.38. At this level, it prices in a 26 basis point reduction in
3-month money before the end of the year. The prospect of Bundesbank
intervention to support ailing currencies left call money relatively cheap
at 8.75 per cent.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil market slides on Opec
jitters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD OIL prices slid yesterday amid market jitters about this week's
meeting of nations from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in
Vienna.
Reports that Saudi Arabia would resist cutting its oil output when ministers
meet on Wednesday knocked 20 cents a barrel off the price of North Sea Brent
crude oil at the opening of trading. The Brent blend January delivery price
then settled at Dollars 19.07 1/2 a barrel in a slow market.
'The market has finally had a message from Riyadh,' said Mr Peter Gignoux,
manager of Smith Barney's oil trading desk in London. Other traders
dismissed the reports as posturing in the run-up to the Opec meeting but
remained gloomy about the outlook for oil prices.
'The most bullish scenario I can see is that they roll over the September
agreement and prices stay where they are,' said a trading manager from one
international oil company.
Opec agreed to produce 24.2m barrels of oil a day at its last meeting, but
most industry observers estimate that output has been running at between 25m
and 25.3m b/d.
Iran refused to embrace the September agreement and has been publicly
demonstrating the nation's ability to pump 3.8m to 4m b/d. Some commentators
put Iran's sustained output at around 3.6m b/d.
Iran is staking its claim for a bigger share in any allocation based on
output capacity rather than historical quotas.
The traditional political tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia - Opec's
biggest producer - is expected to make agreement more difficult to reach at
this week's meeting. Saudi Arabia says it has stuck to its production
allocation of 8.4m b/d in the last couple of months and is not prepared to
cut back further.
Independent observers estimate that the kingdom has been producing at this
level but selling more into the market from stocks it built up during the
third quarter.
Oil stocks held by consumers threaten to undermine prices if Opec fails to
agree to rein in production. Mr Gary Ross, chief executive of Petroleum
Industry Research Associates in New York, says that the US built its stocks
in October compared with last year when it used up 1m b/d from inventories
during that month.
If demand remains low as colder winter weather fails to materialise those
stocks could flood on to the market and depress prices.
Supply and demand in the oil market are not very far out of line at present
but traders have become nervous in advance of the Opec meeting as increasing
signs of disarray become evident within the producers' club. Opec ministers
must give a clear signal to the market of their intentions to cut production
if they are not to see a further slide in price.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Double
helping of carrots for farm show visitors - Incentives for growers to attend
and to spend will abound at next week's Royal Smithfield Show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ORGANISERS of the Royal Smithfield Show, scheduled to open for its
five-day run at the Earl's Court exhibition halls in London next Sunday,
have been sending carrots to exhibitors - real carrots.
It is not because there is a surplus of the orange-coloured roots, although
there has been a very big crop this year, but to try to persuade
hard-pressed agricultural traders of the potential benefits of showing their
wares to what is claimed to be the biggest specialist farming audience in
Britain.
For although falling incomes and fewer UK farmers (they are going out of
business at the rate of about 100 a week) have reduced attendances at the
event from 70,000-plus in the 1970s to nearer 50,000 in the 1990s, surveys
of those who do attend make impressive reading. The organisers claim that 62
per cent of visitors are directly involved in agriculture and 35 per cent
are trade buyers. They say that 38 per cent of the farmers who attend
control over 500 acres, and are therefore more likely to be buyers than
those on smaller acreages, and that 81 per cent of those working on farms
are involved in decision-making.
It is an interesting irony that a farming show located in the heart of
London seems able to deliver for exhibitors an audience consisting of
'quality' prospects. Even so, to companies which have seen their sales
plummeting in recent years, the high cost of setting up and staffing trade
stands in the metropolis can still be daunting. Indeed some big names in the
farm machinery business have pulled out of exhibiting at Earl's Court for
that reason.
That is where the other type of carrot has come into play. Smithfield
officials have taken advantage of the recession in the travel and hotel
trades to negotiate cut-priced combined train and accommodation deals for
both exhibitors and visitors. Indeed several special incentives have been
launched to try to ensure that not only are the trade stands taken but also
that the avenues between them are busy.
The techniques may be more familiar to those who sold life insurance or
airplane tickets but they appear to have worked. Earl's Court, we are
assured, will be full next week with both the livestock and meat from which
the Smithfield Show derived its name and the farm machinery, albeit from
some new exhibitors, which has dominated the event since it became a vital
ingredient of efficient farming.
But it will also contain elements not seen there before. A whole new area
will be devoted to business advice with land agents, consultants and the
like offering to help farmers to survive CAP reform and the potential
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade settlement - for substantial fees of
course. Ironically, seems highly likely that they will be advising clients
not to spend too much money on the expensive machinery all around them.
For it is a regular criticism of farmers that they buy far more machinery
than they actually or can really afford. Moreover, in the days, 10 or so
years ago, when it was possible to write off 100 per cent of the cost of a
new machine against tax in the year of purchase, farmers, the consultants
allege, bought to save tax and that was the wrong reason.
The machinery trade, predictably, has a different view. It has already
welcomed the chancellor of the exchequer's announcement in his Autumn
Statement that capital allowances will be raised to 40 per cent for the next
12 months. But this does not go far enough, says the Agricultural
Engineering Association.
Furthermore, there is little doubt that, when manufacturers entertain Mr
John Gummer, the minister of agriculture, to lunch at Earl's Court next
Monday, they will press him once again to persuade Mr Norman Lamont to allow
a faster write-down of farm machinery, preferably returning to 100 per cent
in the first year.
For the trade has seen its sales slip yet agin. Only 12 or 15 years ago it
was for instance possible for dealers to budget on total UK tractor sales in
excess of 30,000 units a year. Last year the figure had fallen to 15,280 and
so far this year (to 31 October) sales are down a further 6.1 per cent.
Industry forecasts put the year end figure at about 14,500.
To achieve even that modest target it will be necessary for manufacturers
and dealers to continue to offer large discounts, extended credit and/or
interest-free deals.
But those companies that do exhibit next week may well be approaching the
occasion with a little more optimism than in recent years, for in the short
term in some favoured areas of agriculture there is a little more money
available. In spite of wet harvest weather some UK farmers, but not all by
any means, enjoyed fairly good grain yields and quality this year. When
sterling floated free of the European Community's exchange rate mechanism
and was devalued, the price of that grain increased significantly and some
farmers are now selling their produce at 12 per cent to 15 per cent above
what they had budgeted.
The fall in bank interest rates to a base of 7 per cent (most secure farmers
pay 2 to 3 per cent above that) has relieved at least some of the burden of
borrowed money and the public spending cuts, announced by the chancellor
earlier this month, treated farmers relatively leniently.
All of which will combine to improve the fortunes and the mood of the
fortunate farmers who have so benefited and make them more inclined to renew
old machines, which may well have needed to be replaced for some time. Add
to that the appalling wet autumn which has led to difficult cultivations and
imposed severe strains on men and ageing machines, and there may be
significant numbers of farmers wanting to update and improve their tackle in
order to be able to deal better with bad conditions next time they occur.
But that is the nature of farming. We farmers always plan for next year on
the basis of last year's weather. And if we get it wrong, generally
speaking, in arable farming anyway, the next opportunity to try again is the
year after. That is the price of being part of an industry where there is
only one product per field per year.
Indeed it may be appropriate in this time of dramatic changes to remind the
politicians imposing them of the same message. If the combined result of
cuts in farm prices, quotas on production, virtually compulsory acreage
set-aside and bad weather, is a shortage of food instead of a surplus it
will be another 12 months before anything can be done to rebuild supplies.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Big spenders 'likely' to win
Russian gas contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of Russian companies is reported to be 'likely' to have won a huge
contract to exploit a 3 trillion (million million) cubic metre (105 trillion
cubic feet) gas deposit in the Barents Sea in competition with a consortium
of leading Western companies - because the former could offer more jobs and
spend more money in Russia.
The contract has been said by Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime
minister, to be the harbinger of a 'new government policy in the area of the
development of national industry'.
It seems as though pressures from the powerful industrial lobby have forced
the government to reassign the contract for the exploitation of the
Shtockman gas field 600 km (370 miles) off Murmansk to the Rosshelf
consortium of 19 leading Russian military manufacturers. The leading current
affairs programme 'Itogi' (Results) said that promises on price, orders and
employment were crucial - with the Rosshelf group claiming that the cost of
their tender was 4 per cent lower than that of the Western consortium,
promising to buy equipment worth Dollars 2.5bn and employ 250,000 people. It
claimed the Western group would spend only Dollars 400m and employ 30,000
people.
Itogi reported on Sunday night that Rosshelf would 'most probably' get the
contract - one of the biggest such fields in the world. A final decision on
this and other large projects is expected today or tomorrow.
If the contract does go to Rosshelf, it will dash the long-cherished hopes
of a consortium of Western companies, which includes Norsk Hydro, Conoco and
three Finnish companies united under the title of the Barents Group. The
group had an agreement to exploit the Shtockman Field since 1989: and
although the contract was with the old Soviet Ministry of Oil and Gas, its
successor, the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry, had accepted its validity.
Mr Sven Brevik, Norsk Hydro's vice president in charge of exploration, said
yesterday that 'we have as yet heard nothing from the government. There is a
possibility, whatever the outcome, that we may co-operate with Rosshelf on
the project, though we do not yet know how'.
There is much frustration among the Western companies at the length of time
it has taken to decide on the contract, and at apparent changes of mind on
the part of the Russian authorities. They doubt the ability of Rosshelf to
finance the project, or to establish expertise in offshore gas drilling.
The government has for some time sought to establish 'rules of the game'
favouring Russian companies, or at least foreign companies that pledged to
use Russian products and labour.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ashanti gets the gold bug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASHANTI GOLDFIELDS Corporation of Ghana will employ the proceeds of a
complex USDollars 140m syndicated loan signed yesterday to become the
world's leading user of bacteria to produce gold.
The naturally-occuring bacteria, Thiobacillus ferro-oxidans, will release
300,000 troy ounces of gold a year by munching away at difficult (or
refractory) ore which otherwise would have to be treated by expensive
roasting or pressure oxidation.
The project is part of a USDollars 305m, three-year expansion programme that
will take Ashanti's gold output above 1m ounces a year in 1995 and place it
among the world's top ten producers. Mr Sam Jonah, Ashanti's managing
director, said yesterday in London that his company always had the ability
to innovate and 'now we are at the cutting edge of both gold production
technology and financial engineering'.
Ashanti Ashanti will use a bio-leaching process developed by Gencor of South
Africa. Ore is ground into a powder which is mixed with water in tanks into
which the bacteria are introduced. Mr Jonah said the capital and operating
costs of bio-leaching were much lower than for pressure oxidation, which was
also seriously considered, but just as much gold was recovered. The process
was more environmentally-friendly because it did not release sulphur and
also fixed the arsenic in the ore in a stable form.
Minproc of Australia had been awarded the Dollars 105m engineering contract
and Mr Jonah said it was ahead of schedule.
It took the International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the
World Bank, a year to structure the loan, which may be drawn in either US
dollars or gold. IFC will provide Dollars 40m of the total and the remaining
Dollars 100m is syndicated with nine international banks.
There is also a separate, ten-year facility to enable Ashanti to hedge 30 to
50 per cent of its annual gold output against fluctuations in gold prices.
IFC will execute these transactions directly with Ashanti and hedge itself
with market counterparties.
Ashanti, 55 per cent-owned by the Ghana government and 45 per cent by
Lonrho, the UK-based conglomerate, produced 640,000 ounces of gold in the
year to end-September and aims to produce 700,000 in this financial year.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Electric vehicles 'to boost
copper demand'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER DEMAND will be boosted by increasing numbers of electrically-powered,
non-polluting vehicles being developed at present in North America, Europe
and Japan, according to a new study by Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the
Royal Dutch/Shell natural resources group.
'Not only will such vehicles require considerably more wiring than the
equivalent vehicle driven by an internal combustion engine (reports suggest
they will need nearly twice as much copper) but such a development would
also require a substantial increase in the load-carrying capacity of urban
distribution systems,' the authors, Ms Karen Norton and Mr Angus MacMillan,
point out.
They dismiss the idea that copper is a metal in the mature phase of its many
applications and, compared with an annual demand rate growth in the world
outside the former east European countries of 1.4 per cent in the years
between 1973 and 1990, they suggest demand will increase by 2 per cent or
even 2.5 per cent a year during the present decade.
Growth will be underpinned by the non-mature economies where demand grew at
an annual 7 per cent between 1979 and 1991. By then they accounted for 20.7
per cent of western copper consumption compared with 10.9 per cent at the
end of the 1970s.
The study also points out that copper is price inelastic and says 'the high
prices which have prevailed since 1987 have done little to discourage the
metal's use. In many end-uses substitution is simply not practicable, while
in others the price of copper is a minor consideration in the total cost of
production'.
On the production side of the equation, Billiton does not support the idea
that refined copper output will be constrained by lack of smelting capacity.
The study suggests low-cost, solvent-extraction, electrowinning (SX-EW)
capacity, which does away with the need for a smelter, will account for 18
per cent of copper supply by the year 2000 compared with 10 per cent in
1990.
Looking at the short-term prospects for the metal, Ms Norton and Mr
MacMillan suggest that there will be a copper supply surplus this year of
about 125,000 tonnes compared with a deficit of 132,000 tonnes last year.
The surplus will increase to 350,000 tonnes in 1993 before the market
returns to a deficit - of 100,000 tonnes - in 1994.
They suggest copper is the most 'overvalued' metal but they do not expect
the price to fall anywhere near the 70 cents a lb level that would force
production cuts. Copper's price is forecast to average 90 cents a lb next
year compared with about Dollars 1.04 so far in 1992.

Trading on the London Metal Exchange was dominated by an afternoon surge in
ALUMINIUM prices prompted by news that a 400,000 tonnes-a-year smelter in
Tajikistan was in imminent danger of closing. The three months delivery
price closed at Dollars 1,196.50 a tonne, up Dollars 10 from Friday's close,
and moved on to Dollars 1,206 a tonne in after hours trading. Dealers were
waiting to see if the move above Dollars 1,200 a tonne would attract
overnight US or Far East selling similar to that encountered when the market
tested that level two week's ago. NICKEL prices were also firm in the
morning, continuing the recovery that began in the middle of last week. The
market drifted in the afternoon, however, and the three months price, which
had touched Dollars 5,650 a tonne, closed at Dollars 5,527.50, up Dollars 50
on the day and Dollars 175 above the 5-year low reached last Tuesday. GOLD
fell in the morning on Swiss selling and long liquidation and closed Dollars
2 down on the day at Dollars 334.35 a troy ounce.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Currency worries dominate after ERM
realignment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CURRENCY worries dominated the European government bond markets yesterday in
the wake of the weekend realignment of the European exchange rate mechanism.
Investors flocked to the D-Mark block bond markets in the hope that the
Bundesbank would allow an easing in German interest rates to relieve strains
within the ERM.
Meanwhile, some of the weaker European currencies - including the Irish
punt, Danish krone and the French franc - came under pressure in the foreign
exchange markets. Interest rates in Ireland, Spain and Norway were forced up
and the high-yielding government bond markets fell sharply.
GERMAN government bonds surged at the opening on hopes that the Bundesbank
would lower interest rates to ease the tensions within the ERM.
Economists predict that the weaker European currencies will continue to come
under speculative pressure - despite the weekend 6 per cent devaluation of
the peseta and escudo - unless the German central bank lowers domestic
interest rates.
Dealers said investors focused on the German market because the lira
devaluation in September was accompanied by cuts in key German interest
rates.
'The EMS realignment was seen as good news for bunds, but as it became
apparent that a rate cut was not imminent, there was a sell-off in the bund
market,' said one dealer, and the market closed slightly lower on the day.
The Liffe bund contract traded around 91.50 by late afternoon, having been
at a high of 91.70.
Traders said the market would focus on the Bundesbank's repo operations this
week, watching for an easing in interest rates.
MOST of the high-yielding European government bond markets fell yesterday
following the ERM realignment, reflecting concern that currency strains are
likely to persist without a cut in German rates.
Among the Scandinavian markets, Denmark showed a sharp drop in prices
yesterday, losing over a point as investors switched into German bunds.
Economists believe that Denmark will be able to resist a devaluation, having
raised interest rates on Friday to defend the currency.
Sweden, which severed the link between its currency and the Ecu last
Thursday and allowed the krona to float freely, saw some profit-taking
yesterday. The decision to float the krona prompted a rally in the Swedish
government bond market at the end of last week and the yield curve switched
from negative to positive.
Dealers said investors took some profits yesterday, and the yield on the
bond due 2003 rose to 10.41 per cent at the end of trading, against 10.29
per cent at Friday's close.
Mrs Anne Wibble, the Swedish finance minister, yesterday ruled out rapid
cuts in interest rates because of the high inflation risk.
SPAIN, which devalued by 6 per cent at the weekend and raised interest rates
by 75 basis points yesterday, witnessed a one and a half percentage point
drop in bond prices as the market digested the news.
The Bank of Spain raised its key money rate from 13 per cent to 13.75 per
cent and the 10-year 10.30 per cent bond fell from Friday's close of 88.45
to 87.05.
Dealers said the market would be focusing on this week's auction of Spanish
government debt. The weekend decision to lift capital controls - which came
into force during the September currency crisis - is seen as a means of
attempting to encourage foreign buyers to return to the bond market.
The government has a total financing need of Pta1,900bn for 1992, of which
it has raised an estimated 23 per cent with the sale of treasury bills and
bonds, according to one dealer.
FRENCH government bonds tumbled on fears that the French franc could come
under pressure again in the foreign exchange markets.
Yields on short dated bonds showed a bigger increase than at the long end
with the 8.5 per cent bond due 1994 closing at 8.27 per cent against 7.99
per cent at the opening.
IRISH gilts closed lower, reflecting the sharp rise in interest rates and
concern over whether the Irish punt may be devalued.
The Central Bank of Ireland suspended its short-term facility rate of 13.75
per cent and replaced it with overnight advances initially at 30 per cent
and one-week funds at 25 per cent. The 9 per cent gilt due 2001 fell from
95.25 at Friday's close to 93.50 late yesterday.
UK government bonds closed firmer as the gilt market remained relatively
immune to the turbulence within the European markets due to the fact that
sterling is outside the ERM.
Long-dated gilts ended firmer, but dealers warned that today's announcement
of the details of the Bank of England's gilt auction is likely to put
pressure on the market. The Bank will announce the amount and stock details
today.
US Treasury prices eased slightly at the long end but short-dated maturities
rallied from weakness after demand for the afternoon two-year auction was
stronger than expected.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government was  1/8 lower at 100 31/32
, yielding 7.438 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note
was unchanged at 99 9/32 , to carry a yield of 4.624 per cent.
Prices opened lower, partly in the wake of weaker overseas bond markets and
following newspaper reports suggesting that the Federal Reserve monetary
policy is on hold for the immediate future.
Although the market has been coming to terms with the idea that interest
rates are unlikely to be cut again soon, yesterday's reports, emanating from
senior sources close to the Fed, were regarded as final confirmation that
the monetary authorities are happy to leave policy unchanged as the economic
recovery gradually gathers pace.

FT  24 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: BZW lifts profits from
dealing in sterling bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE sterling bond business of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the securities arm of
the UK clearing bank, last year made profits of Pounds 25.7m (Dollars 39m),
or more than half of total profits reported by gilt-edged market makers for
1991.
BZW's results, up from Pounds 13.4m the year before, were particularly
notable given the decline in profits at several of the other highly
profitable gilts firms.
Most marketmakers contacted yesterday said that results for 1992 would be
significantly better than last year, suggesting that their overall profits
would be well up on the Pounds 49m they made between them in 1991.
The profit figures are not directly comparable: taken from official returns
to Companies House made by Gilt-Edged Market Makers, which operate as
separately capitalised companies, some of the results include activity in
Eurosterling and even marketmaking in Ecu. It is thought that most banks
include Eurosterling in these companies, given the lighter capital regime
under which they operate.
Mr Stephen Rumsey, of BZW's gilts business, said the increase reflected an
upturn in business across the board, and not the effect of substantial
position-taking. 'We're not a house that goes for really big swings in the
market,' he said. Of this year, which has seen greater issuing activity in
sterling, he said: 'We're very happy with 1992.'
Other houses to record an upturn in profits included UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
which returned Pounds 7.5m after a loss of Pounds 0.8m the year before, and
Goldman Sachs, where profits were up from Pounds 0.6m to Pounds 5.3m.
NatWest, meanwhile, turned a loss of Pounds 3.2m into a profit of Pounds
1.7m.
Some of the most profitable houses in 1990, meanwhile, recorded a sharp fall
in profits in the following year. Greenwell Montagu, one of the biggest gilt
marketmakers, recorded a fall in profits from Pounds 8.6m to Pounds 3.5m. Mr
Mike Higgins, head of Greenwell, said: 'Profits fluctuate all the time. We
are marketmakers to a lot of large institutions all day, every day, all
year. That leads to fluctuations in our profits.'
He said that Greenwell had been profitable every year since Big Bang apart
from one, adding: 'Our profit for 1992 is substantially more than 1991.'
Lehman Brothers recorded a fall from Pounds 9.3m to around Pounds 3m in
1991.

FT  24 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Goldman Sachs gets to work on BT debt
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON A DAY which saw the launch of just two new issues, Goldman Sachs'
restructuring of the British Telecom debt it bought last week went under the
microscope. The rationale behind the restructuring is that, with a 12 1/4
per cent coupon, the bonds would trade substantially above par in current
market conditions, deterring many investors.
Goldman put the debt, which matures in 2003, into a special purpose Cayman
Islands vehicle which is issuing depositary receipts giving the holder the
right to the payments arising from the coupon and/or principal.
To make it more marketable, Goldman stripped the coupon from the principal
to create a total of 22 separately-priced smaller zero-coupon issues,
largely made up of 21 semi-annual interest rate payments worth Pounds 11m
each. The one Pounds 180m repayment of principal was priced at 40.74, a
spread of 55 basis points over comparable gilts.
Investors are effectively buying future cash-flows offering a pick up over
gilts and a leveraged exposure to the bond market. A 10-year discounted zero
in a rising market will move as much in price as a full coupon bond.
Goldman, which believes sterling interest rates have further to fall, says
the restructured debt is perfect for investors who are bullish on UK
interest rates but less certain on sterling. Stripping is likely to remain a
pretty specialised technique in the UK, given the difficulty in getting the
right quality paper at the right price in the right amounts.
With the positive yield curve environment today, the zero coupon approach
will give 20 basis points differential in yield, according to one banker.
The beneficiaries of the extra value unlocked are Goldman, the investors,
and the UK Treasury.
By the close of play, Goldman reported it had sold around two-thirds of the
total face value, split equally between the principal and the coupons.
Goldman's pricing highlighted again the difficulties in choosing the right
benchmark to use. Picking the right gilt is made more difficult than usual
in this instance as a 10-year zero-coupon bond has the same effective
duration as a 25-year full coupon gilt and should be priced accordingly, say
traders.
Meanwhile, some French traders were less than enthusiastic about the timing
of the European Investment Bank's FFr1bn reopening of an existing issue.
While there was no criticism of the terms or the amount, the atmosphere in
Paris was not really favourable for new issues, they said, given the
weakening of the French franc against the D-Mark and the widening of spreads
between German and French 10-year government bonds.
Despite the bearish tone, the spread of 20 basis points over the OAT on the
new tranche compares with a launch spread of 34 on the original issue.
Others said they were not afraid of taking a position in a good issue at a
good price for a quality credit while clients rediscovered their buying
appetite. African Development Bank will price today a DM300m five-year bond
at 43 basis points over German government bonds.

FT  24 NOV 92 / International Company News: CSR ahead 14% for the half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CSR, the Australian sugar, aluminium and building products group, yesterday
reported net profit for the six months to the end of September of ADollars
125.4m (USDollars 85.6m), an increase of 14 per cent on the previous
comparable period.
The group also forecast a full-year net profit of ADollars 200m before
abnormal items, compared with ADollars 175m in 1991-92. Revenue increased by
7 per cent to ADollars 2.4bn.
Mr Ian Burgess, managing director, said it was 'pleasing' to report an
improvement in CSR's performance after two difficult years. He said there
were four main reasons for the improved result:
A return to profitability by CSR's timber products businesses after two
years of losses;
Record raw sugar production by the group's mills;
Productivity improvements and cost savings of about ADollars 20m before tax;
and
A cut in net interest costs from ADollars 55m to ADollars 50m.
The gains were offset by lower profit margins for refined sugar in Australia
and New Zealand, and lower prices for many of the group's building and
construction materials.
Mr Burgess said the group remained financially strong in spite of the
'difficult trading environment' caused by slow economic growth in the
group's main markets in Australasia and North America.
Mr Burgess said net profit before abnormal items for the full year should
exceed last year's level. 'From the perspective of today, a profit above
ADollars 200m seems likely.'
CSR reported a net loss of ADollars 385m last year after writing down asset
values by ADollars 558m following a dispute with the Australian Securities
Commission on the accounting treatment of the write-down.
The directors maintained the interim dividend at 10 cents a share, fully
franked.

Astra International, Indonesia's second largest company, which dominates the
country's automotive sector, has a reputation to protect. Brokers have
repeatedly named it Indonesia's best managed company and, as of last June,
foreign banks had afforded it loans and facilities of more than Dollars
900m.
A financial crisis, however, has hit the Soeryadjaya family, Astra's
majority shareholders, with the recent suspension of their privately-owned
Bank Summa carrying bad debts of over Rp1,000bn (Dollars 487m).
To raise new finance, the family have sold 40m of their 178m Astra shares -
or 74 per cent of the company's issued shares - and are expected to sell
more, thereby losing majority control, before the end of the year.
Uncertainty over the company's ownership coincides with depressed car sales
and a slump in profits from Rp210bn in 1991 to, brokers forecast, about
Rp75bn this year. A declining share price has seen Astra's market
capitalisation fall 41 per cent in five months to Rp2,034bn.
Since Astra went public in 1990 - about 13 per cent of the 242m issued
shares are actively traded - it has been regarded as Indonesia's pre-eminent
blue chip stock.
It sells more than half of Indonesia's vehicles and has the distribution
licence for Toyota, the market leader. While the automotive sector accounted
for 80 per cent of the company's Rp4,933bn 1991 sales, Astra also has
agribusiness, financial services, heavy industry and electronics
subsidiaries.
Comprising 10 per cent of the Jakarta stock market's total capitalisation,
for many investors and bankers Astra is synonymous with Indonesia.
The current difficulties of Astra and the Soeryadjayas lie in a rise in
interest rates in 1991 following a tightening of monetary policy in 1991.
For Astra, this led to a sharp fall in car sales as consumer credit
contracted.
Central bank officials say Bank Summa broke banking regulations by
over-lending to private companies owned by the Soeryadjayas. These had
invested heavily in real estate, the value of which subsequently dropped.
High interest rates left the companies unable to service Bank Summa's loans.
Astra has minimal financial exposure to Bank Summa, its officials stress. To
underline the separate nature of the businesses, in September Mr William
Soeryadjaya, the company's founder, stepped down as chairman. He was
replaced by Mr Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, a former finance minister and
father-in-law of Siti Herijadi, daughter of President Suharto.
In the past two weeks, however, it has become clear Bank Summa's financial
crisis will, as the Soeryadjayas attempt to cover its debts, have a direct
effect on Astra's future.
On November 13, the Soeryadjayas sold two blocks of 20m shares to a pension
fund of state-owned Bank Dagang Negara - the bank to which the shares had
previously been pledged against loans - and Newark of Hong Kong.
Brokers say the sale of shares to Newark was financed by Danareksa, an
Indonesian state-owned investment fund. Hong Kong company records show
Newark's two registered directors to be Soeryadjaya family members.
Astra says Newark will hold the 20m shares while negotiations with a foreign
buyer are finalised, Toyota being the preferred party. It is not clear who
now has authority over these shares.
The sale leaves the Soeryadjayas with about 138m Astra shares. Of these,
businessmen close to the family say at least 129m have been pledged against
loans.
They say 100m shares are pledged against a Rp500bn loan from a consortium of
three banks led by state-owned Exim Bank. The other members are Bapindo,
also state-owned, and Bank Danamon, a listed company.
Another 29m shares are pledged, the businessmen say, to Bank Universal, 51
per cent owned by Astra, against loans totalling up to Rp300bn. The
Soeryadjayas declined to comment on these details.
While the family have taken these loans, the central bank say a September
deadline to inject new money into Bank Summa was missed. A Rp150bn rescue
package, backed by a consortium of private banks, last week allowed Bank
Summa's small scale depositors to clear their accounts.
The next key date for Astra and the Soeryadjayas is end-December when,
bankers say, the loan from the Exim Bank consortium matures. Unless this is
repaid, the banks may take up the shares and look to on-sell them, with the
state banks taking political advice.
Brokers say two businessmen have declared an interest in taking a stake: Mr
Liem Sioe Liong, who heads the Salim Group, Indonesia's largest
conglomerate, and is a close associate of President Suharto; and Mr Hashim
Djojohadikusumo, son of Astra's new chairman.
An Astra executive acknowledged a potential conflict of interest for Mr
Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, but said the chairman remained independent. An
executive of the Salim Group, which is a shareholder in Indomobil, Astra's
main competitor, declined to comment.
Bankers to Astra have expressed their concern, for as one European banker
explained, 'We would never have contemplated lending to Astra, if it were a
Salim Group company.'
In June, Astra had long and short-term debt of Rp2,456bn, giving a 1.54 debt
to equity leverage. Bankers consider the choice of new shareholders critical
to Astra's future financing and question whether changes in the company's
ownership may be sufficient to affect the status of their existing loans.
Astra says no foreign loan has a provision requiring the Soeryadjaya family
to maintain a majority holding. Its aim is 'to see that no one party holds a
majority, so Astra can be a fully public company,' explained one Astra
executive.
But he conceded the company has little control over who the new shareholders
will be, and acknowledged Toyota is unlikely to purchase the Newark-held
stake until other shareholders are finalised.
The choice of shareholders is now 'a national matter' and 'in the
government's hands,' the executive noted. Those looking for part of the
Soeryadjaya stake will be knocking on the doors of government ministers.

FT  24 NOV 92 / International Company News: Arnotts threatened with legal
action
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CAMPBELL Soup, the US food group, yesterday threatened legal action to force
the board of Arnotts, the Australian biscuit company, to drop a key plank in
its defence against a hostile takeover bid.
Campbell, which is offering ADollars 8.80 a share for the 17.2 per cent of
Arnotts it requires for majority control, also sought permission from the
Australian Securities Commission to extend its bid.
Campbell's bid values Arnotts at ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 857.1m).
The group would spend only ADollars 206m to gain control of 50.1 per cent of
Arnotts' shares, but has offered to buy all the 67.1 per cent of the shares
it does not own.
Arnotts' main defence is a 1985 agreement signed by the two companies when
Campbell took a friendly 32.9 per cent stake to help protect Arnotts from a
hostile bid by Mr Alan Bond, the former Australian entrepreneur.
Arnotts claims the agreement gives the board the right to prevent Campbell
exercising majority voting rights or appointing a majority of directors
unless the US group acquires more than 85.1 per cent of the shares.
Mr David Johnson, Campbell chief executive, challenged Arnotts'
interpretation of the agreement in a strongly worded letter sent to all
Arnotts' directors at their home addresses.
Mr Johnson said Arnotts' interpretation was 'flagrantly contrary to
Australian law and public policy' and 'prejudicial to shareowner interests
because it is intended to interpose the existing board between the bid and
the shareholders'.
He also claimed the agreement was illogical and unenforceable, inconsistent
with Arnotts' articles of association, and contrary to the rules of the
Australian Stock Exchange, which generally requires voting rights to reflect
ownership.
Mr Johnson said Campbell would have 'no choice other than to commence
appropriate court proceedings' if the board refused to acknowledge that its
interpretation of the agreement was incorrect.
Campbell's bid is subject to approval from the Foreign Investment Review
Board (Firb), which has been widely lobbied to reject the bid to prevent
control of Arnotts from passing outside Australia.
The bid has also been criticised by Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer (finance
minister), who will make the final decision on whether to allow it to
proceed.
Mr Dawkins suggested that Arnotts had failed to keep promises relating to
investment and marketing which were made to the Firb when Arnotts acquired
its existing stake in 1985.

FT  24 NOV 92 / International Company News: NZ reforms help PDL triple
profits

<TEXT>
PDL Industries, the New Zealand electrical goods maker, more than tripled
net profits to NZDollars 6.42m (USDollars 3.37m) in the six months to
September 30, from NZDollars 1.99m a year earlier.
Sir Robertson Stewart, chairman, said the recovery in the company's fortunes
was due to New Zealand's economic reforms which he had staunchly opposed.
PDL has become one of the New Zealand stock market's best performers. Its
shares began the year at NZDollars 2. On Friday they rose 70 cents to
NZDollars 11.20 on expectations of a good result, and closed at NZDollars 11
yesterday.
Sir Robertson said the company was benefiting from a changed economic
environment.
He praised the government for removing import protection and implementing
tough new anti-labour laws.
He said PDL would concentrate its expansion programme on a plant in Malaysia
which should be operating next year. The plant's production would be sold to
the south-east Asian market. The remainder of capital spending would go on
upgrading New Zealand factories, he said.
Sales fell to NZDollars 116m from NZDollars 127m following the sale of
subsidiaries related to its associate company Lasercorp. Export sales rose
52 per cent to NZDollars 15.6m. Lasercorp had turned the profits corner, Sir
Robertson said. It returned to the black with net profits of NZDollars 1.05m
for the six months to September, against losses of NZDollars 4.9m.

<TEXT>
LOSSES suffered in the European associate of M-Net, the South African pay
television company, offset a sound domestic performance causing attributable
earnings to fall by 36 per cent in the six months to the end of September,
writes Philip Gawith in Johannesburg.
Turnover rose by 29 per cent to R353.2m (Dollars 121.7m) from R274.4m a year
earlier and net profits were 43 per cent higher at R22.1m, against R15.5m.
M-Net's share of losses incurred by associated companies, however, amounted
to R9.3m against none previously. This dragged attributable profits down to
R12.8m from R15.5m in 1991.
A 29 per cent increase in the number of shares in issue - a R252m rights
issue was concluded in January - further diluted earnings per share which
fell by 36 per cent to 6.5 cents from 10.2 cents.
Mr Ton Vosloo, chairman, attributed the improvements in turnover and profits
to advertising revenues remaining firm, despite the recession and continuing
growth in the subscriber base.
He said that the losses by associate companies were attributable to the
strategy of restructuring and aggressively growing FilmNet, the European pay
television company. M-Net was part of a consortium, led by Richemont, the
Swiss tobacco and luxury goods group, that bought FilmNet in November 1991.
M-Net has an effective equity stake of 45 per cent in FilmNet.

FT  24 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: IBM forms client-server unit
but denies policy shift
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines announced a worldwide initiative to promote
client-server computing, the use of multiple computer systems distributed
around a corporate network. It has formed a business unit, reporting
directly to Mr Jack Kuehler, IBM president, to focus on client-server
products and strategies.
The move is seen by IBM competitors as an acknowledgment of market trends
away from IBM's traditional view of corporate computing based upon a central
mainframe computer. However, IBM takes a different view.
'Already, IBM is probably the leading supplier of client-server computing
systems', although it is hard to quantify the loosely defined market, said
Mr Kuehler.
He stressed that the formation of the new business unit was prompted by
customer demand rather than a strategy shift by IBM.
'This is not a new direction away from mainframes,' Mr Kuehler said. He
acknowledged that mainframe computers may or may not fit into the
client-server computing model, depending upon the needs of individual
customers.
In the past, IBM executives have defended the role of mainframe computers,
the company's most profitable products.
Client-server computing, often called the next wave of computing, is rapidly
gaining acceptance, making it one of the fastest growing segments of the
computer industry.
The concept of client-server computing is to distribute computer power and
computing tasks throughout the systems linked to a network, whether they be
personal computers, workstations, mid-range computers or mainframes.
This contrasts with the traditional data processing model with a centralised
mainframe or minicomputer hub, surrounded by terminals, or more often today
by desktop PCs that are linked on local area networks.
'Many of IBM's customers are looking for help to convert to client-server
computing,' Mr Kuehler said. 'IBM sees this as a growth opportunity for
services and software as well as all types of hardware.'
More than 900 employees, most of them programmers, have been reassigned to
the new client-server unit. Its role will be to help IBM's product units to
co-ordinate the delivery of integrated client-server systems. The unit will
develop products.
The new business unit will be headed by Mr Thomas Furey, former manager of
IBM's software development laboratory in Santa Teresa, California.
The unit's first task, Mr Furey said, would be to establish customer centres
which will showcase client-server systems based on IBM and non-IBM products,
and help customers assess and pilot test client-server solutions tailored to
their needs.
IBM has several of these customer centres in Asia and Europe. Sixty more
will be added in the US and centres will be established in large markets
throughout the world.

FT  24 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: French retailer FNAC up 9.4%
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FNAC, one of France's largest retailing groups, bucked the sluggish economic
environment by achieving a 9.4 per cent increase in net profits to FFr156m
(Dollars 28.9m) for the year to August 1992.
The group, which is chaired by Mr Jean-Louis Petriat and controlled by the
GMF insurance group, has for decades dominated the French market for
'cultural' retailing with its record and book shops.
However, in recent years it has faced fierce compet-ition from Virgin, the
UK leisure group, which has opened megastores in France.
FNAC has retaliated by playing Virgin at its own game. It has accelerated
its own expansion outside France and has opened its own megastores in
France, culminating in the launch late last year of its opulent 'Cathedral
of Culture' on Avenue des Ternes in Paris, north of the flagship Virgin
megastore on the Avenue des Champs-Elysees.
This competitive climate has affected FNAC's performance. The group mustered
an increase in sales of 11.1 per cent to FFr8.25bn for last year.
But the slowdown in consumer sales, coupled with increased competition and
the impact of FNAC's own FFr491m investment programme, meant that the growth
in net profits was fuelled by a rise in exceptional earnings from property
transactions. These increased from FFr80.5m to FFr107.8m.
The overall increase in net profits enabled FNAC to raise its dividend by
10.6 per cent to FFr26 for the last financial year.

A STRONG improvement in automotive parts sales helped Varity, the industrial
and farm equipment maker, post a modest third-quarter profit.
Kelsey-Hayes, Varity's automotive components subsidiary, reported a 23 per
cent improvement in operating earnings and a 7 per cent rise in sales. The
improvement was due to relatively strong demand for light trucks in North
America, where K-H has a high share of the market for wheels and anti-lock
braking systems.
Varity, which is based in Buffalo, New York, posted net earnings of
USDollars 10.5m, or 23 cents a share, in the three months to Oct 31,
compared with a Dollars 17.8m loss, or 91 cents, a year earlier. The latest
figures include a foreign exchange loss of Dollars 6.4m, following a Dollars
2.3m gain a year earlier.
Sales climbed to Dollars 844m from Dollars 759m. The bulk of the increase
came from a one-third rise in sales at Perkins, the diesel-engine maker,
where business was hit by a four-week strike in the third quarter of 1991.
Perkins turned a 1991 operating loss of Dollars 6m into a profit of Dollars
7m for the latest quarter.
In spite of the decline of the world farm machinery market, Massey Ferguson
recovered to a Dollars 7m profit from a Dollars 7m loss on a 6.4 per cent
rise in sales.
Varity's long-term debt dipped to Dollars 795.6m on October 31 from Dollars
864.2m.

FT  24 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Recovery in Ecu bond prices
wiped out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GENTLE recovery in Ecu bond prices in recent weeks was wiped out yesterday
after the devaluation of the escudo and the peseta at the weekend undermined
a gradual return of confidence.
Ecu bond prices fell a point on fears that European markets may have entered
a further period of divergence - that is, that the gap between high-yielding
and low-yielding markets is set to widen rather than narrow.
'The re-emergence of ERM tensions is a setback for the market: it means the
Ecu is less likely to be the new European currency,' said a trader.
Until this setback there had been increasing confidence that problems over
the Maastricht treaty would be resolved within the framework of the European
Monetary System.
However, the Ecu bond market has some support, determined by its value
relative to theoretical Ecu yields (based on government bond yields
denominated in component currencies). Dealers report buying interest when
the margin of real Ecu bond yields over theoretical yields widens to about
40 basis points.
'In a sense, (Ecu bonds) are a cheap option on any hardening of the Ecu, as
long as they are trading above their theoretical value,' said Mr Robin
Bowie, a director of Barclays de Zoete Wedd in charge of European bond
trading.
After narrowing to 15 basis points last week, the spread had increased to 33
basis points by yesterday.
Meanwhile, the market's liquidity has failed to return, since the breakdown
in the existing market-making system during the summer.
The issue will be discussed at the end-of-year meeting of the International
Securities Market Association Ecu sub-committee on December 4.
'I expect a strong vote in favour of resumption of market-making with
reasonable (bid/offer) spreads,' said Mr David Ovenden, Ecu product manager
at JP Morgan, who chairs the committee.

EASTMAN Kodak, the world's biggest producer of photographic equipment,
yesterday announced a series of disposals. Kodak's Atex subsidiary, which
make computer systems for newspapers, is being sold to a British
entrepreneur; Estek, which produces cleaning and inspection equipment for
the semiconductor industry, is being bought by ADE Corporation, based in
Massachusetts; and Kodak's credit facility is being purchased by GE Capital,
part of the General Electric group.
The Atex and Estek disposals were foreshadowed in July, when Kodak said that
it planned to dispose of 10 lines of business, primarily in its information
division. Although the businesses were not individually identified, Atex and
Estek were known to be among those up for sale.
The purchaser of Atex is an investment consortium headed by Mr Danny
Chapchal, a British businessman. Mr Chapchal, a trained accountant, heads
SQL Systems International, a Surrey-based management systems software
company.
He was originally invited into SQL by a group of venture capital firms to
help stem its losses. Mr Chapchal said yesterday that the same group of
institutions - which includes Euroventures Benelux and the South Yorkshire
Pension Authority - were backing the Atex deal.
'I see this as a major opportunity in a market I know extremely well,' said
Mr Chapchal, although he declined to comment in detail on future plans for
the business.
Atex was founded in 1973, acquired by Kodak in 1981, and supplies electronic
pre-press systems to about 900 users, including The Times in the UK, The New
York Times, The Jerusalem Post, and Fortune.
Atex has recently been embroiled in the controversy over whether the design
of computer pre-press equipment has caused repetitive strain injury among
users. A number of damage claims are outstanding against the company.
Yesterday, however, Mr Chapchal said that 'the purchasers (of Atex) are not
assuming any RSI liability'. He declined to discuss details of the purchase
agreement.
No price was disclosed in the other deal in Kodak's information systems
business, the disposal of Estek to ADE Corporation. Estek was formed in
1986, and employs around 60 people at its Charlotte plant.
The third transaction, the sale of the credit operations to GE Capital was
not foreshadowed in July. The credit business was established in 1986 and is
designed to provide long-term financing to customers purchasing Kodak
equipment. It currently provides financing to over 12,000 clients, and has
assets of around Dollars 1bn.
GE Capital, a financial services institution with assets of over Dollars
80bn, is acquiring the Kodak subsidiary's stock but will operate the
business under the Eastman Kodak Credit Corporation name.

THE 312 securities broking and marketmaking member-firms of the New York
Stock Exchange that do business with the public yesterday reported profits
of Dollars 802m for the third quarter.
In the comparable nine months last year, NYSE member-firms earned Dollars
2.66bn.
Although earnings were slightly lower than the Dollars 842m made in the same
quarter of 1991, and well below the Dollars 1.14bn recorded in the second
quarter of this year, the record Dollars 3.31bn in profits the firms have
racked up since the beginning of this year indicate that the explosive
growth in business enjoyed by Wall Street since 1991 shows little sign of
fizzling out.
In spite of the strength of year-to-date earnings, a slowdown in stock
underwriting business, especially of initial public offerings (IPOs), and
turmoil in the European currency and bond markets, which left some firms
with gains but others nursing losses, contributed to the overall decline in
profits during the quarter.
The NYSE's specialists - the firms that make markets in stocks on the
exchange's trading floor - reported a 22 per cent increase in third-quarter
profits to Dollars 18m, thanks primarily to an increase in trading activity.

TOKYO Kyoei Steel, a medium-sized Osaka steelmaker affiliated to Sumitomo
Metal Industries, has suffered a setback in its plans to buy Florida Steel,
a US minimill, after only 54 per cent of bondholders responded to Florida
Steel's buy-back offer.
Kyoei's Dollars 343m offer for Florida Steel was contingent on 90 per cent
of the debentures being tendered. Kyoei has halted its efforts to raise
financing until a sufficient number of debentures are tendered. Either party
can terminate the deal if it is not closed by December 15.
Florida Steel has extended its cash tender offer of Dollars 125m, the
principal amount of the outstanding 14.5 per cent subordinated debentures
due 2000, to mid-December.
Kyoei's attempts to acquire FLS, parent of Florida Steel, has been rife with
problems. Several lawsuits were filed by preferred shareholders who were
riled by an offer of only Dollars 24 a share in cash for stock with
liquidation value of Dollars 53 a share. Subordinated debt holders were
widely expected to accept the offer of par plus accrued. The Securities and
Exchange Commission is conducting an 'informal inquiry' into some of Florida
Steel's financial statements.
Florida Steel's problems stem from a Dollars 377.8m leveraged buy-out in
1988. The company has been unable to service its Dollars 289.9m of debt and
defaulted on its bank loans and subordinated debt.
Kyoei has offered to assume all of Florida Steel's debt. Common shareholders
will receive Dollars 30.072 a share.

NORWAY yesterday unveiled a NKr5bn (Dollars 775.2m) rescue plan for its
three biggest banks - Den norske, Christiania, and Fokus - and warned this
would be the last time they would receive state support.
The latest rescue package increases to NKr20bn the amount transferred to the
three banks in the past 12 months. In addition, the banks' own insurance
fund has pumped NKr7.4bn into the sector, of which NKr7.2bn has been written
off as losses.
Last year, Christiania and Fokus bank saw their share capital wiped out and
were acquired by the state.
Den norske, Christiania, and Fokus face far-reaching measures to reduce
costs by 15 per cent in order to comply with terms and conditions of the
rescue plan.
In the nine months ended September, the three banks suffered combined net
losses of NKr3.7bn. The NKr5bn aid package is made up of NKr4bn in 'paid-in'
core capital and NKr800m in state guarantees of which NKr260m is in cash.
The ordinary capital of Den norske, the biggest bank, has been wiped out by
losses, and its ordinary shares are to be written down to zero.
Den norske's three biggest shareholders at end-October included the county
employees' pension fund with a 12 per cent stake, Vital Forsikring, the big
insurance group, with 8.9 per cent, and the national pension fund with 7.2
per cent.
Den norske is to receive NKr1.5bn in preference capital and a guarantee of
NKr600m. This means the state's shareholding in the bank will rise to 70 per
cent from 55 per cent.
The bank said operations would be streamlined further in 1993 and assets
reduced by NKr7bn to NKr155bn. Costs would be reduced by 7 per cent, both in
1993 and in 1994.
Christiania Bank, the second biggest bank, will be supplied with core
capital of NKr1.9bn of which NKr1bn will be in the form of new share capital
after the current share capital is written down against uncovered nine-month
losses. The remaining NKr900m will be in the form of a subordinated loan.

FT  24 NOV 92 / International Company News: Italy's SME to be split into
three

SHARES in SME, the Italian state-controlled foods retailing and catering
group, rose 8 per cent to L6,000 on the Milan bourse yesterday following the
government's decision to split the company into three for the purposes of
privatisation.
SME is 62 per cent owned by IRI, the state holding company, with the 38 per
cent balance of the shares listed on the Milan bourse. SME sales last year
totalled L2,323bn (Dollars 1.68bn).
'We feel splitting the group into three is the best way of getting value,'
Mr Michele Tedeschi, IRI's chief executive, said yesterday.
SME has a market capitalisation of L2,700bn. The shares had been suspended
for more than a week pending clarification of the government's privatisation
plans. The government is clearly determined, where possible, to head off
bids from potential asset strippers.
Mr Tedeschi and members of the government made clear they wished to use the
SME privatisation as a model of the cabinet's broader programme of selling
off state assets. IRI was criticised two months ago for the poor handling of
its decision to sell its software subsidiary, Finsiel, to STET its
telecommunications arm.
Under the privatisation programme, SME will be split as follows:
Frozen foods and ice creams. This part, considered as the industrial side of
SME, will consist principally of Italgel Gruppo Dolciario. It will be sold
in its entireity with IRI retaining no stake. Groups such as Nestle and
Unilever are reportedly most interested in these activities.
Branded/canned foods, olive oil. This will centre round the brand names of
Cirio Bertoli de Rica and international activities such as SME International
Food. SME has 24 per cent of the US olive oil market. It is also possible
the milk business, currently included in this grouping will be hived off
into a separate fourth group for special sale.
Motorway chain restaurants and chain stores. The main companies will be
Autogrill and Gs retailing. IRI intends to retain a shareholding, probably
through a golden share.
The aim, according to Mr Tedeschi, is to create these groups out of the
existing company. He insisted minority shareholders' rights would be
respected in the proposed division of assets prior to sale. He also said he
hoped all the necessary arrangements could be in place for approval by the
SME board by January 7.
IRI is being advised in the operation by Wassertein Perella. IRI estimates
the entire operation could be complete within four to six months.

FT  24 NOV 92 / International Company News: Carlsberg registers 5%
improvement

CARLSBERG, the Danish brewer, yesterday announced a rise of 5 per cent to
DKr1.36m (Dollars 219.4m) in pre-tax profits for the year to September 1992.
The result was achieved despite exchange losses and reduced customer
spending in many main markets.
Overall group turnover improved marginally to DKr14.95bn from DKr14,46bn the
previous year. Beer sales fell slightly to 21.3m hectolitres.
Carlsberg said the overall UK market had shrunk and uncertainty about the
proposed merger with Allied Lyons had not provided the best stimulus.
The group was uncertain whether it could achieve the same comparatively high
level of earnings in 1992-1993.

FT  24 NOV 92 / International Company News: Mannesmann warns of nine-month
profit fall

MANNESMANN, the German engineering company, yesterday warned that profits in
the first nine months of the year were 'considerably lower' than in the same
period last year, despite the fact that sales, including acquisitions, rose
by 18 per cent to DM19.18bn (Dollars 11.9bn).
Without giving any concrete profit figure, Mannesmann blamed the profits
fall on a number of factors, including the state of the economy,
restructuring costs, lower income from financial dealings, the decline in
earnings from trading, and the costs of building up its mobile telephone
operations.
The company said profits in the trading division were severely hit by the
downturn in steel and pipes markets, but the result in this area was still
positive. The downturn in the market for capital goods had hit demand for
plant and machinery, but the result was still 'clearly positive' and, in the
circumstances, satisfactory.
The group's Brazilian operations were likely to break even this year after
two years of losses. Operating profits in the group's automobile technology
business improved, but restructuring costs meant that this area made a net
loss - but less than in the same period last year.
Stripping out the effect of acquisitions, sales would have risen by just 1
per cent, the company said.
At the interim stage, Mannesmann surprised the market by reporting
first-half net profits down 89 per cent to DM15m from DM134m.
