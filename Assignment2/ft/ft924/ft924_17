FT  24 NOV 92 / International Company News: More job cuts at Bayer as
earnings plunge 32%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BAYER, Germany's leading chemicals and drugs group, yesterday announced a
sharp drop in profits, a rising tally of job losses, and warned that there
was no sign of improvement.
A 32 per cent slump in third-quarter earnings dragged pre-tax profits for
the first nine months of this year down to just DM2.2bn (Dollars 1.37bn) -
16 per cent less than in 1991.
Bayer, last of the top three chemicals corporations to report, blamed a
'dramatic' fall in volume sales in the third quarter for the accelerating
downturn. Mr Manfred Schneider, the new chairman, said orders for chemicals
in the three months to the end of September were down between 10 per cent
and 15 per cent.
Rivals Hoechst and BASF last week announced nine-month profits down 19 per
cent and 45 per cent respectively.
The D-Mark's revaluation against the US dollar and other currencies had a
substantial impact on sales and profits, Mr Schneider said.
Bayer's turnover, down 2.4 per cent at DM31.7bn at the nine-month mark, fell
7 per cent in the third quarter to DM9.6bn.
First-half sales were virtually unchanged at DM22bn, and profits were 10 per
cent lower.
Mr Schneider said exchange rate fluctuations accounted for one-third of the
earnings fall so far.
An early effect of the post-summer downturn, which has hit most German
industry, has been a marked increase in the number of job losses. Bayer,
which started the year planning 3,000 and later revised the figure to 4,000,
said yesterday that 6,200 jobs would go by the end of the year.
Reductions would continue next year if there were no fundamental changes in
chemicals markets, Mr Schneider said.
Other structural changes were also under way, he added. These included the
planned closure of factories making ingredients for dyestuffs.
Although Bayer had managed to increase prices for over-the-counter medicines
and some consumer and veterinary products, the chemicals business was still
suffering for reductions due to world overcapacity and slack demand.
Even pharmaceuticals had not been able to escape this trend, Mr Schneider
noted. Overall, prices had fallen 2 per cent in the period under review.

FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: National Grid in Pounds 100m investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL GRID, which manages the electricity system in England and Wales,
yesterday outlined plans for an initial Pounds 100m investment in its
planned telecommunications network as it disclosed a 7.3 per cent rise in
interim pre-tax profits.
Mr David Jefferies, chairman, said that Pounds 100m had been earmarked for
investing in the next 18 months on the alternative telephone network for
large users.
Talks on potential collaboration on the project were in progress with three
North American companies with marketing and networking experience.
However, Mr Jefferies warned against City expectations of rapid returns,
saying that a market share of less than 1 per cent was likely in the first
few years.
Approval for the project, Telecom Electric, was given last week by 12
regional electricity companies which own the National Grid Company.
At the same time it decided against flotation of the NGC.
In the six months to September 30 1992, the group made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 261.6m, against Pounds 243.7m in the corresponding period of last
year on a historical cost basis.
Turnover was Pounds 666.3m (Pounds 655m).
The interim dividend goes up 10.5 per cent at a cost of Pounds 42m, against
Pounds 38m last time.
Some analysts believe the RECs are unlikely to go below this percentage rise
when they fix their dividends this month and next.

FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: A question of regaining market credibility
 -Amstrad's quest to regain its reputation as an innovator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTRAD, the consumer electronics group which is the subject of a Pounds
113m buy-back bid by its founder and chairman, Mr Alan Sugar, faces two
unresolved legal disputes of particular interest to shareholders when they
gather today for the group's annual meeting in London.
The law suits relate to the group's ill-fated 2000 series computers launched
in the late-1980s and designed to spearhead the company's push into the
lucrative corporate market for personal computers.
Until then Amstrad and Mr Sugar had ridden the crest of a consumer spending
wave as one 'blockbuster' product after another boosted turnover, profits
and the share price.
Hot on the heels of innovative audio products, such as the ready stacked
hi-fi system, came the enormously successful PC1512, the first low-cost
personal computer system - launched in 1986 and aimed at the mass market.
By 1988, eight years after its listing, turnover had topped Pounds 625m and
pre-tax profits reached Pounds 160.4m.
But one prize still eluded Amstrad. Although its first generation PCs had
captured the lion's share of the home computer market, manufacturers such as
IBM and Compaq still dominated the buiness PC market in Britain and Europe.
In the autumn of 1988 Amstrad set about plugging the gap with a new range of
more powerful PCs. However, within months it was clear that some of the new
PCs had reliability problems associated with their disc storage devices.
Amstrad was forced to recall many of the machines and spent between Pounds
6m and Pounds 7m in recall and modification charges. In the case of one of
the models, the PC2386, it took 18 months to identify and rectify the fault.
But by then the damage had been done. In the fast moving PC business the
Series 2000 machines were already old. Market prices had dropped and
specifications had changed.
Amstrad was forced to write down the value of its inventory to more
realistic levels and record a Pounds 20.4m exceptional item against profits
in the year to June 30 1991.
But arguably Amstrad suffered a much more serious, but unquantified loss in
terms of its reputation and credibility as a business PC manufacturer.
Certainly there is little doubt that the Series 2000 disaster set back its
attempts to enter the corporate market - a setback which the group is still
trying to overcome.
Amstrad began legal action in California last year against the two US
manufacturers of the disc drives which Amstrad claims were faulty.
In separate suits Amstrad has been seeking a total of Dollars 291m (Pounds
193m) in damages and compensation from Seagate and Western Digital, the
manufacturers which supplied the disc drives.
Both companies have vigorously denied liability and Western Digital
subsequently issued a counter claim for the 'exceptionally large expenses it
made in helping Amstrad resolve its problems.'
Since then Amstrad has suffered further setbacks. The case against Seagate
was dismissed by the California court in April on jurisdictional grounds and
Amstrad was told to refile in a 'proper forum' - the UK courts. So far
Amstrad has not yet done so.
Similarly the suit against Western Digital was also dismissed on
jurisdictional grounds on November 4, but Amstrad was given permission to
refile within 30 days.
Although Amstrad's latest annual report makes no specific mention of the
suits the two cases have a particular importance now that Mr Sugar has
launched his 30p-a-share offer for the 65 per cent of Amstrad he does not
own.
The offer document includes a letter from Amstrad's directors which notes in
its section on litigation that although '. . . the Directors and Mr Sugar
believe the group has a strong legal case, the extent and timing of any
recovery is uncertain'. Kleinwort Benson, Amstrad's financial advisers, also
confirm that the implications of the legal action were examined 'in some
detail'.
Nevertheless Mr Sugar says the board is still 'considering' whether to
pursue the legal action, even though he accepts that a positive settlement
could boost the cash in Amstrad's balance sheet, and therefore the value of
its shares.
Whether or not the legal cases are pursued, shareholders are likely to
remember the unfortunate 2000 series as the turning point in Amstrad's
fortunes.

FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Restructuring costs behind fall at Fenner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COSTS of streamlining operations in the UK pushed Fenner, the
engineering group, down by 26 per cent to Pounds 5.53m at the pre-tax level
for the year to August 29.
Exceptional charges for redundancies and reorganisation came to Pounds
2.27m, pushing the UK business slightly into loss. The charges also off-set
the slight advance at the operating level from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 11.3m.
Sales were 4 per cent down at Pounds 196.6m.
The operating gain was largely due to cost efficiencies. Over the last 18
months the company has cut costs by about Pounds 3m on an annualised basis
in the UK.
Mr Peter Barker, chairman, said the results showed the extent to which the
cost base had been cut back. 'We have tailored the operations to today's
level of demand.' he said. 'Notwithstanding the continuing recession, the
underlying profit trend is more encouraging.'
The power transmission business in the UK was operating profitably. Margins
were helped by the transfer of sourcing to the Far East through Contimach,
Fenner's Hong Kong company. The hydraulic and pneumatics operation had
suffered in the latter part of the year, although order books were currently
standing at record levels.
Mr Tom Brown, managing director, sought to ease anxieties over the proposed
closures of several British Coal pits, customers of Fenner's conveyor belt
business. In the worst case scenario, he said 'it would be a kick in the
shins, but not a total disaster'. British Coal represented less than 7 per
cent of total group sales, and any closures were expected to be offset by an
increase in export business.
Profits were at a record high in South Africa. In India, the contribution
had fallen as the economy began to slow following government measures to cut
inflation.
Fenner cut the dividend, as foreshadowed at the interim stage, from 5.1p to
2.5p, for a total of 4.2p (8.55p). Earnings, depressed by a high tax charge
including Pounds 600,000 on ACT, were 0.01p (5.47p). Excluding the
exceptional charge earnings fell to 5.08p. Debt was reduced by Pounds 7.3m
to with gearing of less than 40 per cent.
COMMENT
Fenner came in above analysts' expectations, even with the exceptional
charges. Yet even more encouraging was the decision not to cut the dividend
more than was forecast at the interim stage. Business appears to be
stabilising, and the full benefit of cost cuts should feed through in the
current year. However, there are still uncertainties about the amount of
profit which comes from politically unstable areas such as South Africa.
Forecasts for the full year are for about Pounds 8m, with the group
returning to a fully covered dividend. With a prospective p/e of some 15
times, last night's share price of 66p looks about right for the time being.

Some analysts believe the RECs are unlikely to go below this percentage rise

Current cost operating profit of Pounds 179m, up 4.6 per cent, reflected an
improved contribution from the pumped storage and interconnections business,
offsetting a reduction in transmission revenue.
Part of the improvement was due to cost reductions. NGC expects staffing to
be about 5,500 by the end of the financial year and 5,000 by March 1994,
against 6,600 when it was formed.

<TEXT>
Futura Holdings, the footwear manufacturer, announced increased pre-tax
losses of Pounds 1m from turnover sharply down at Pounds 1.77m in the 26
weeks to June 26.
The result compares with losses of Pounds 940,000 from sales of Pounds 4.04m
for the 28 weeks to July 13 last year. Losses per share were 26.69p (19.44p)
and there is no dividend.
Notice of an extraordinary meeting regarding the sale of a large part of the
group's property portfolio for Pounds 4.31m cash has been sent to
shareholders.
The Stock Exchange has agreed to restore the group's listing - it was
suspended last March - following the disposal and restoration of banking
facilities, expected to be completed before December 31.

Hewetson, which serves the construction industry, suffered a 32 per cent
fall in interim pre-tax profits and is cutting the dividend by 69 per cent.
However, the group had some success with gearing, reducing it from 48 per
cent to 28 per cent.
In the six months to September 30 turnover fell 26 per cent to Pounds 14.3m
(Pounds 19.2m) but the operating surplus dropped 43 per cent to Pounds
650,000 (Pounds 1.15m). After reduced interest charges pre-tax profit worked
through at Pounds 476,000, against Pounds 703,000 which was struck after
exceptional charges of Pounds 154,000.
Earnings per share came to 2.09p (4.6p) and the interim distribution is 0.5p
(1.6p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES OF Dagenham Motors Group fell 25p to 78p after the Essex-based motor
distributor warned that second half profits were 'likely to fall short of
current market expectations'.
Mr David Philip, chairman, said makers' price cuts and the abolition of car
tax 'have had an immediate and severe impact on used vehicle values'.
Profits from the group's largest dealership at Dagenham had fallen following
the introduction of short time working and redundancies at the nearby Ford
plant, he added.
Nevertheless the final dividend should be held at 4p.
In September the group announced profits of Pounds 1.13m pre-tax for the six
months to June 30 on turnover of Pounds 75.6m. Profits for the 1991 year
amounted to Pounds 2.11m, achieved on turnover of Pounds 127.2m.

FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Recovery at revamped Marling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW management team at Marling Industries, the safety belt webbing and
industrial textiles group, said their reorganisation and recovery plans were
progressing well, even although some businesses faced difficult trading
conditions.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 593,000 to Pounds 659,000 in the six
months to September 30, in line with forecasts made at the time of June's
Pounds 18m rights issue.
At that stage, the group announced sweeping changes after reporting pre-tax
losses of Pounds 11.9m for the year to March 31.
Mr David Abel Smith, who became chief executive in January, said yesterday:
'Our policy of focusing on our core businesses with their leading market
positions is proving successful. We are increasing the efficiency of our
operations, improving gross margins and we view the future with optimism.'
Marling has sold Boalloy, its loss-making subsidiary which makes commercial
vehicle bodies, and stopped funding a joint venture to make automotive
safety airbags with Electrolux Autoliv, which would have required investment
of between Pounds 6m and Pounds 7m over the next 18 months.
Total turnover fell from Pounds 51.6m to Pounds 38.8m, but sales of
continuing businesses rose marginally from Pounds 33.9m to Pounds 34.4m.
While markets throughout Europe had deteriorated since the summer, the group
said planned rationalisations at subsidiaries in the UK, Germany and Spain
were all on schedule.
The total workforce had been reduced by 105 to 1,140 and would fall further,
but these redundancies were covered by provisions made at the year-end.
Elsewhere, Marling said action had been taken to cut costs without reducing
gross margins, to respond to the new reduced level of demand, particularly
from the European motor industry.
Mr Abel Smith said he was considering a number of acquisition opportunities
in the group's chosen field of industrial webbing and narrow fabrics, but
emphasised they would only be pursued if they generated cash and enhanced
earnings.
Marling hopes to appoint a non-executive chairman to replace Mr Peter Held,
the 69-year-old founder of the group, who stepped down as chairman in
September.
Mr Abel Smith said it had not proved easy to find a candidate who could
bring suitable skills to the post, but he hoped that an announcement would
be made soon.
Earnings per share worked through at 0.57p, compared with losses of 0.86p
last time.
The interim dividend is passed (0.3p), but the group said it intended to pay
a final distribution.

Net asset value at British Investment Trust stood at 164p per share at
September 30.
A year earlier it stood at 170p.
There had been only modest changes in the geographical distribution of the
portfolio with the emphasis remaining firmly on large, internationally
orientated and financially strong companies.
In the half year consolidated gross revenue moved ahead from Pounds 19.3m to
Pounds 19.7m, while the attributable balance came to Pounds 8.18m (Pounds
7.92m).
Earnings per share rose to 2.66p (2.47p) but over the year they are expected
to be held at 4.34p.
The interim dividend is again 1.9p and the forecast is for a maintained
total of 4.5p.

The shares were suspended at 1 3/4 p; three years ago they traded at 163p.
The group has been struggling with shrinking marketing and promotional
expenditure by companies.
In July it recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.45m for 1991-92 compared with
profits of Pounds 2.05m for the previous year. Turnover fell by 11 per cent
to Pounds 44.5m.

FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Carlton consortium poised to gain control
of ITN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Carlton Communications-led consortium last night effectively won control
of Independent Television News, with the support of the news organisation's
top management.
A final deal offered last week to ITN shareholders, at present the ITV
companies, was accepted by companies holding 74.7 per cent of the shares.
As soon as the acceptances pass 75 per cent - and that will only need the
support of any of the small ITV companies which have not yet been formally
approached - the offer becomes unconditional.
The fundamental change in the ownership of ITN now seems certain to go ahead
because Thames Television, which ceases to be an ITV company at the end of
this year, has agreed to sell out for Pounds 14 a share.
At the same time Granada, Scottish and Anglia have agreed to join the
consortium.
Granada, Carlton, Central, London Weekend and Reuters will each have 18 per
cent with the 10 per cent balance held equally by Scottish and Anglia.
The consortium members are committed to raising up to Pounds 30m for ITN to
tackle a Pounds 5m a year lease deficit on its London headquarters.
When Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton, takes over as ITN chairman the
property problem is like to be at the top of his list.
The Pounds 14 a share offer will also be available to TVS and Television
South West, two other departing ITV companies.
The other ITV companies will only get par for their Pounds 1 shares but the
terms of a new supply agreement averaging Pounds 53.3m a year over five
years will be smoothed out to help companies in the first year of the new
franchises.
Yorkshire Television asked for and got a review of progress after two years.
It was concerned that ITV companies who were no longer shareholders in ITN
would also benefit from any cost-savings.
Undertakings have also been given on editorial and managerial independence.
Under government legislation the shareholding of ITN will have to change
again by the end of 1994.
By then 51 per cent of ITN has to be owned by non-ITV companies. The plan is
to bring in a US broadcaster.

pay-out

<TEXT>
Amber Day has paid Pounds 1.13m in compensation to Mr Philip Green, who
stepped down as the discount retailer's controversial chairman and chief
executive in September.
Amber Day's annual report, published yesterday, also disclosed that Mr
Green, who resigned after the group reported unexpectedly poor results, had
seen his annual salary increase from Pounds 325,000 to Pounds 460,000 in the
year to August 1.
However, Mr Green's pay rise is accounted for by a deferred bonus of Pounds
150,000 for 1990-91.
This year the group's pre-tax profits to August 1 fell from Pounds 10.1m to
Pounds 7.5m - well below the forecast of at least Pounds 10.1m made as
recently as mid-June, when analysts' expectations of Pounds 14m-Pounds 15m
were downgraded.
The profits shortfall was the last straw for the City, which had seen Amber
Day's shares collapse from a peak of 129p last November following a series
of bear raids and newspaper stories about Mr Green's business associates and
commercial deals.
Yesterday's annual report said the board had, in conjunction with the
group's auditors, undertaken a careful review of of transactions initiated
by Mr Green for the period of the accounts and up to his resignation on
September 24.
The board said it was 'satisfied that all these transactions were undertaken
in the commercial interests of the group and is not of the opinion that any
further provisions need to be made.'
Mr David Thomson, temporary chairman and chief executive, said the board was
actively seeking to appoint an independent chairman and at least one
non-executive director as soon as possible.
Amber Day's shares yesterday closed 2p lower at 29p.

FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Emap turns in 50% advance to Pounds 14.8m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EMAP, the media group, yesterday announced a 50 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 14.8m for the six months to the beginning of October.
Profits of the group, which publishes magazines and regional newspapers,
runs exhibitions and has expanded into commercial radio, were boosted by
disposal profits of Pounds 1m.
Turnover rose to Pounds 146.9m (Pounds 124.2m).
Despite June's Pounds 78m rights issue, Emap's net interest payable rose to
Pounds 1.33m (Pounds 1.04m). It spent Pounds 26m on acquisitions and new
launches during the half year.
Emap is raising its interim dividend from 2p to 2.075p, payable from
earnings per share of 6.1p (4.3p).
Mr Graham Ross-Russell, the chairman who is retiring after 20 years on the
board, said yesterday that investments made over three years were now
showing useful profits.
'With a strong balance sheet, there will be many more opportunities to grow
our business both through acquisitions and launches,' Mr Ross-Russell said.
By far the largest slice of profits came from consumer magazines with
operating profits up 13 per cent to Pounds 10.7m.
The circulation of established titles rose by 4.3 per cent compared with a
market that fell by 3.6 per cent. Cover prices increased by more than 10 per
cent.
Mr Derek Terrington, media analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson, said
Emap was 'a very successful magazine publisher. That's where the pleasant
surprises keep coming from.'
The other divisions, Mr Terrington said, were not so strong which meant that
the group's profits were very dependent on magazines. Operating profit for
newspapers and printing increased, however, from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 4.5m.
Kleinwort expects pre-tax profits of Pounds 42m for Emap for the full year.
The results were achieved in spite of static advertising levels and flowed
from cost reduction and tight cash control. The company said, however, that
advertising now accounted for less than 50 per cent of total revenue.
'A recovery in consumer and business confidence will have a substantial
impact on our revenue, but we are not expecting any improvement this
financial year,' Mr Ross-Russell added.
Mr Robin Miller, group chief executive, said yesterday the joint venture
with Hachette to produce Elle in the UK was 'a quantum leap' for Emap in
terms of its visibility in the womens' magazine market.
The Pounds 4.55m acquisition of Local Government Chronicle in August could
be one of Emap's best ever, Mr Miller said.

FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Whitegate deeper in red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITEGATE Leisure, which operates in the leisure, healthcare and property
sectors, announced a sharp increase to Pounds 2.95m in losses before tax for
the eight months to August 31. In the preceding 12 months the group incurred
losses of Pounds 1.09m.
Losses per ordinary share for the period were 10.2p against 4.2p for the
whole of 1991.
There was a group operating profit of Pounds 626,000 (Pounds 3.78m) for the
eight months but this was coverted into the deficit after a French operating
loss of Pounds 645,000 (Pounds 372,000) and property losses of Pounds 19,000
(Pounds 97,000 profits). Healthcare made profits of Pounds 144,000 (Pounds
20,000).
Mr James Oppenheim, chairman, said improved trading results, disposal of the
loss making French businesses - five of the six French discotheques were
sold earlier this month - and lower interest rates should lead to improved
results for the current year. The healthcare business is also to be sold
shortly.

FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Allen shows 58% decline to Pounds 855,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allen, the Wigan-based construction and property development group, bore the
brunt of the depressed property market and building business in the
half-year to September, turning in a 58 per cent fall in pre-tax profit from
Pounds 2.01m to Pounds 855,000.
Mr Donald Greenhalgh, chairman and managing director, said he was confident
1992-93 would prove to be the 'bottom of the cycle' in the construction
industry.
Although the industry could take heart from lower interest rates and other
measures announced in the Autumn Statement, consumer confidence would be the
key factor in any recovery in house sales and property prices, he stressed.
Turnover from the contracting, plant hire, housebuilding and property
development divisions, whose operations were concentrated in the north-west,
fell 20 per cent to Pounds 25.1m (Pounds 31.4m).
The downturn knocked margins, and operating profit fell to Pounds 1.38m
(Pounds 2.44m).
Mr Greenhalgh said margins from houses, which contributed half of the
operating profit, fell to 12 per cent compared with 13.1 per cent last year,
and 16.7 per cent in 1990-91.
He added that the group did not need to make any provisions against the
value of its land bank - which at Pounds 11,000 per plot was valued at a
significant discount to the main competitors - because of its cautious
approach to buying land in the past.
Earnings per share declined from 5.9p to 2.5p.
An unchanged interim dividend of 1.65p is declared and the directors expect
to maintain the final at 3.35p.

FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Security side behind ADT's 82% third
quarter increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADT, the security and car auction group, yesterday reported an 82 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits for the third quarter and a doubling of earnings
per share.
The Bermuda-based company which does much of its business in the US but
retains a UK quote, increased pre-tax profits from Dollars 23m to Dollars
41.9m (Pounds 27.7m) on sales up 14 per cent at Dollars 336m.
Earnings per share rose from 15 cents to 33 cents. The share price jumped
40p to 500p.
Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman and chief executive, said that in the absence
of unforeseen circumstances, combined operating income from core vehicle
auction and security systems for1992 should exceed the 1991 result.
The main operating increase was in the security division where profits rose
from Dollars 27.9m to Dollars 37.2m. The division benefited from a high
volume residential sales programme in North America and a reduction in
overheads as central control stations continued to be consolidated.
The commercial security market was showing early signs of improvement in the
US Midwest, south-east and west regions.
Operating profit in the auctions division was marginally up at Dollars 15.5m
on sales almost unchanged at Dollars 80.2m. The division suffered from the
decrease in manufacturers' vehicles sales in the US and a slow down in
demand for used cars in the UK. ADT said there were indications that the
downturn in the UK vehicle market had levelled out.
ADT's 'other expenses less income' line moved from a net expense of Dollars
6.8m in the second quarter of 1992 to a net contribution of Dollars 600,000,
due to what ADT called 'the generation of Dollars 5.7m of operating income
by the company's highly seasonal non-core activities'. These were expected
to produce a small operating loss in the fourth quarter.

FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitive Danka rises 32% to Pounds 7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG GROWTH in office equipment sales in the US helped Danka Business
Systems, the highly-acquisitive US-based supplier quoted in London, to a 32
per cent advance in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 7m.
The result was struck on sales 36 per cent higher at Pounds 74.2m for the
six months to September 30.
Mr Paul Dumond, company secretary, said Danka had taken a deliberate
decision not to increase the prices of machines such as photocopiers. The
decision had affected gross margins in the retail business, but was expected
to provide a longer-term benefit to the company's service and parts
operation. This latter division provides the majority of the company's
profits,
The retail operation increased gross profits by 47 per cent to Pounds 10.1m,
while service, parts and rental advanced 26 per cent to Pounds 18.1m.
Mr Dumond said plans for a quotation on Nasdaq in the US were expected to
materialise by January. However, no new shares would be issued.
Danka, which has purchased 35 companies in the US since being reversed into
a natural resources shell in 1986, was seeking acquisitions in Europe.
During the first half Danka had spent Dollars 15m (Pounds 9.9m) on six
purchases. He said their contribution in the six months had not been
significant.
The dividend is raised by 0.25p to 1.5p. Earnings advanced 25 per cent to
16.4p.

FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Diploma shares jump 22p on 14% gain to
Pounds 16.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Diploma rose 22p to 344p yesterday as the electronics, building
components and special steels group announced a 14 per cent profits increase
from Pounds 14.5m to Pounds 16.6m pre-tax for the year to September 30.
This rise was achieved in spite of a Pounds 9.6m decline in turnover to
Pounds 132.3m, though Mr Christopher Thomas, chairman, pointed out that the
comparable figures contained turnover of Pounds 20.5m and profits of Pounds
500,000 from ECS and Access, no longer with the group. There was an
extraordinary debit of Pounds 3.4m (credit Pounds 4.4m)
Interest receivable rose by Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 2.1m.
In electronics, profits grew to Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 6.2m) on turnover shrunk
to Pounds 77.8m (Pounds 83m). The best performer was Macro, the active
components distributor, which lifted turnover by 16 per cent to Pounds 45m
against 'a fairly flat market' where prices fell by a further 12 per cent.
The building components division, where profits only fell by Pounds 200,000
to Pounds 6m on reduced turnover at Pounds 43.4m (Pounds 45.2m), was largely
carried by IG Lintels. Mr Thomas said that in three years, it had lifted its
market share from 25 to 37 per cent.
The steels side was hit by uncertainty in the oil sector and general low
investment in capital goods. Turnover fell from Pounds 13.7m to 11.1m and
profits from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 700,000.
A final dividend of 7p (6.5p) is recommended, making a total of 9.75p
(8.75p), payable from earnings of 19.4p (17.3p) per share.
COMMENT
With sound and, more importantly, motivated management the key to success,
Diploma has again proved growth is possible whatever the circumstances. A
cash pile almost unchanged at Pounds 26.3m, after spending Pounds 7.7m
buying Anachem, a liquid chemical analysis systems distributor, gives Mr
Thomas leeway to buoy up the smaller companies in the current economic
storm. The stars were Macro and IG. The former's ability, through new
products and an emphasis on service, to squeeze more from mature markets was
impressive. Full-year pre-tax profits forecast range from Pounds 18.5m to
Pounds 19.5m, giving a p/e of 15 to 15.9. The shares are fully valued, not
likely to get cheaper, but a long-term stock.

James Cropper, the Cumbria-based paper and packaging group, reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 595,000 for the six months to September 26.
The outcome, from turnover little changed at Pounds 20.3m, compared with
profits of Pounds 621,000 last time. Mr James Cropper, chairman, said
trading remained difficult.
The interim dividend is held at 0.975p, payable from earnings of 4.8p (5.3p)
per share.

FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Going back on the acquisition trail - BET's
plans to move out of low-margin businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr John Clark arrived at the helm of BET, the business services company
which was bleeding cash after a burst of rash acquisitions, he said a
turnaround would take three years.
Half way through that period, this timetable is looking increasingly
ambitious. The process of disposing of some of the 1,000 businesses bought
in such haste in the late-1980s appears to be going slowly with only 18 sold
and Pounds 81m of cash raised.
As a result, Mr Clark may move BET into its next phase of reorganisation -
the acquisition of new service businesses that will give the company the
chance to grow earnings - before it has sold the bad apples in the barrel.
Shareholders will, therefore, need nerves of steel a lot of patience.
Yesterday, the business services company that aims to do its clients' chores
while they concentrate on their core businesses, reported a 43 per cent fall
in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 40.5m.
That was not all. The share price is now 16 per cent below the 110p at which
BET in July did its Pounds 200m refinancing rights issue, and the company is
questioning if it can continue paying a dividend that is uncovered by
earnings.
In the absence of any recovery in earnings - which Mr Clark appears to have
ruled out yesterday - and assuming a cut in next year's dividend - which Mr
Clark flagged as a possibility - BET's share price has significantly further
to fall if its yield is to be maintained.
Nor are there many signs of hope on the trading front. The depth of the
recession means that following Pounds 11m of exceptional reorganisation
costs in the first six months, BET will face further 'significant'
exceptional costs in the current half.
What is perhaps as damaging to the share price is the sudden revelation that
the company faces an ACT problem. While the definition of an ACT problem is
left to directors' discretion, City observers were being told as recently as
two months ago that there was no concern about a write-off of ACT.
In the absence of any economic turnaround there is, therefore, a need for
acquisitions in the UK to produce more taxable profits. But again BET faces
a problem.
BET realises it must diversify away from its dependence on the UK, which
currently accounts for 56 per cent of sales - albeit only 21 per cent of
operating profit.
As Mr Clark says, 'The cash freed up from disposals can be used to improve
BET's mix of businesses which is at present too exposed to the economic
cycle and the UK economy.'
From the point of view of the balance sheet, however, BET at least has
greater room for manoeuvre. Thanks to the disposals and the rights issue,
which repaid Dollars 380m (Pounds 251.6m) of auction market preferred stock,
and continuing strong cash flow, gearing is heading in the right direction.
After the recent disposal of Initial USA, at the high price of Pounds 42m,
gearing is down to just 12 per cent.
While further quick disposals would increase BET's freedom of movement, the
balance sheet is clearly in shape to move on to the acquisition trail.
Mr Clark says this, in itself, is quite an achievement. 'We think we have
put substantially behind us the financial strength question,' he says.
'Right now we are talking about what is the right mix of businesses to get
earnings growth. That's a significant conversation to be having.'
What BET is moving towards is a fundamental reallocation of assets away from
low or negative margin businesses towards assets that will improve its
growth potential.
The problem for shareholders watching this tricky balancing act is that very
little is clear with BET. As Mr Clark told them yesterday, BET has more
skeletons in its cupboard and there are still aspects of the business that
still need to be changed; it is very difficult to forecast a tax charge or a
level of provisions for reorganisation and it is difficult to see why the
final dividend should be maintained - other than the proximity any cut would
have to July's rights issue.
A consolation might be that Mr Clark has been there before. 'This is the
third turnaround I have done and they are always worse than you imagine,' he
says.

FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Anglo Irish held back by one-off charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DUBLIN-based Anglo Irish Bank Corporation reported a 13 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 7.34m (Pounds 6.75m) for the year to
September 30.
Earnings per share, however, fell by 23 per cent to 5.09p as a result of a
1-for-1 rights issue which was completed in February.
Mr Sean Fitzpatrick, group chief executive, said that the bank had not had
sufficient time since then to fully leverage the IPounds 26.5m in new
capital the issue provided, and that a number of one-off costs incurred
during the year held back profit growth by a further IPounds 1.1m.
Interest earnings on the new capital amounted to IPounds 1.4m, while
additional costs related to the aborted takeover of Hill Samuel Ireland
(IPounds 500,000), redundancy payments of IPounds 400,000 in the bank's UK
leasing business plus a further IPounds 200,000 contribution to a
compensation fund by an Isle of Man subsidiary relating to the BCCI
collapse.
Mr Fitzpatrick said that the bank had performed well in its core Irish
market, turning in a pre-tax profit of IPounds 8.95m on a loan book up 46
per cent to IPounds 513m.
The UK division reported a loss of IPounds 1.61m, but risk assets have been
reduced to 19 per cent of the group's total, down from 32 per cent two years
ago.
'We have retrenched away from the UK market' Mr Fitzpatrick said, but added
that the bank's long term strategy will continue to focus on its targeted
middle-sector niche lending markets in both Ireland and the UK.
'We have taken the pain this year, and we have cleared the decks for growth
in earnings next year' he said.
A final dividend of 2p is declared, making an unchanged total of 3.36p.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Ending of Cold War hots up a merger: A Dollars 3bn deal that
reflects a declining US defence budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE merger announced yesterday between Martin Marietta and the aerospace
businesses of General Electric is the most dramatic example yet of the wave
of consolidation reshaping the US defence industry in the post-Cold War era.
Many more such deals are likely over the next few years as long-pampered US
defence contractors come to grips with a sharply declining US defence budget
and the industry consolidates in the hands of the most efficient operators.
Martin Marietta is buying the GE business for Dollars 3.05bn (Pounds
2.01bn), making it the largest recent defence industry merger, but the deal
is also significant in that it brings together two of the more successful
businesses in the sector, combining from a position of strength, rather than
weakness.
Martin Marietta, with revenues of Dollars 6bn and net earnings last year of
Dollars 313m, is a leading manufacturer of space launch vehicles, such as
the Titan family of rockets, as well as military electronics, information
systems and missiles. It employs 56,000.
It is an important contractor to the Patriot air defence missile system
which helped defend Israel and Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War.
The GE businesses being sold, which had 1991 revenues of Dollars 6bn and are
expected to earn around Dollars 330m net this year, supply radar, sonar
avionics and armaments systems, missile system components and make
commercial satellites. They employ 37,700 people.
The two claimed yesterday their combination would create a defence
electronics business twice as big as the next nearest contractor and a
'lower cost, more competitive and more innovative global supplier'.
The deal was initiated by Mr Jack Welch, GE chairman, who over the past
decade has turned this once stodgy giant of US industry into a very
aggressively managed business, with interests ranging from financial
services to television. One of Mr Welch's long-held beliefs is that GE's
businesses must be first or second in their respective markets if they are
to prosper in the increasingly competitive global marketplace.
Mr Welch conducted a strategic view of the aerospace business and its flat
revenues and profits in the light of the US defence cutbacks and decided
that it needed to be part of a larger entity.
He identified Martin Marietta as the best possible partner and raised the
subject some six weeks ago with Mr Norman Augustine, the company's chairman,
while the two were closeted away at a meeting of the Business Council, a
retreat which brings together some of America's top executives.
Mr Welch admitted yesterday that GE might have tried to acquire Martin
Marietta, but it quickly became clear that Mr Augustine was interested in
buying businesses, rather than selling.
Indeed, Martin Marietta was unsuccessful earlier this year in an attempt to
buy the missiles and aerospace business of steel group LTV, which was
eventually sold to Loral, Carlyle Group and Northrop.
The deal has been structured so that GE will continue to have a stake in the
business.
It will get two seats on the Martin Marietta board and Dollars 1bn of the
sale price will be in the form of Martin Marietta convertible preferred
stock, which Mr Welch hopes will give GE a 'good upside ride'.
GE will suffer a small initial dilution of earnings per share, of around 2
per cent, but thinks that over the longer term the deal has to potential to
add 1 per cent to 2 per cent a year to the group's earnings. It says it will
use the Dollars 2bn cash proceeds for 'productivity improvements and global
growth'.
Martin Marietta will benefit from enhanced size and access to GE's research
and development laboratories, which are among the best in US industry, and
GE's global presence. The two also plan to pool the purchasing of some
commodity items.
The deal should allow some rationalisation of facilities and employees,
notably at headquarters, but both companies were at pains yesterday to
stress that they were remarkably complementary with relatively little
business overlap.
Mr Augustine, arguing that 'these two companies will be much stronger, much
better off than they would be alone', said, for example, that Martin
Marietta's space launcher business and GE's commercial satellite operations
might find work together.
Similarly, in underwater warfare, Martin Marietta made missiles and launch
systems and GE was involved in radar. This offered possibilities for the
joint business to assume prime contractor status.
While the combined business, with some Dollars 11bn of annual revenues, will
be largely defence-based, it will also have some Dollars 3.5bn of
non-military sales, in areas such as robotics, environmental clean-up and
commercial satellites.
The US company that has acted most aggressively to cope with the new defence
environment is General Dynamics, the second largest Pentagon contractor,
which is in the process of selling off non-core operations and slimming down
to just four areas of military expertise. Recent rumours have suggested that
it might even sell off one of these four, its jet fighter division, if it
can get an attractive price.
A study by Mr Jerrold Lundquist, of management consultants McKinsey, in the
current edition of the Harvard Business Review indicates that the industry
has a long slimming process ahead. 'Today a dozen defence companies compete
in six or more market segments. Tomorrow they will compete in two or three.
Several large companies and scores of small ones will fold altogether. In
1992 there are 13 companies in the space segment, and 16 vie for a slice of
the avionics pie. By 1997, there will be only five or six in each group.'
Mr Lundquist argues that the rationalisation will proceed quickly and
'companies that act first will have the greatest advantage'. Messrs Welch
and Augustine would doubtless agree.

FT  24 NOV 92 / GPA in collateral offer to banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA, the aircraft leasing company, yesterday offered its banks fees of
around Dollars 20m (Pounds 13m) and improved collateral in return for
deferring up to Dollars 1bn of debt repayments for two years.
One of the 250 bankers, representing 100 banks, who attended yesterday's
meeting said: 'There was resignation among the banks that something has to
get done to put GPA on a firmer financial footing.'
Another banker praised GPA's directors, led by the chairman, Mr Tony Ryan,
for showing 'the right degree of humility and acknowledgement of the
mistakes of the past'.
The banks were asked to give a temporary waiver by December to a potential
breach of GPA's borrowing covenants. The deadline for agreement on debt
rescheduling and a permanent change in covenants is mid-January.
The company, which has total debts of Dollars 5bn including bank debts in
excess of Dollars 3bn, needs a two-thirds majority of the banks - measured
by value of loans - for the borrowing changes. However, Mr Maurice Foley,
GPA's deputy chairman, said: 'We don't want to win by scrambling to victory
by just one vote. We want unanimity.'
Though GPA has offered Dollars 20m of fees, one banker said there were
'bound to be arguments that the fees should be higher'.
Some banks are disappointed by GPA's decision not to ask for any sacrifices
from the providers of Dollars 1.5bn of unsecured debt through an assortment
of capital market instruments, such as bonds and medium-term notes.
GPA argued that its future viability depends on its ability to tap the
capital markets which would be impossible if bondholders were alienated.
GPA gave the banks forecasts that cashflow should meet interest payments
over the coming two years, but not its commitment to buy Dollars 3.5bn of
aircraft over the same period. Bankers estimate that GPA could, however,
raise Dollars 2bn from the sale of leases and bonds backed by leases called
ALPS. If manufacturers refuse to defer or cancel some orders, bankers said
they would build conditions into covenants to force the company to ask their
permission each time it bought an aircraft.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Westinghouse in Dollars 1bn charge for shake-up and debt
reduction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WESTINGHOUSE Electric, which has been dogged for two years by bad property
loans, yesterday announced plans to get out of financial services, cut its
dividend, take a Dollars 1.13bn (Pounds 740m) after-tax charge and sell off
several businesses to bolster its crippled finances.
Mr Paul Lego, chairman of the embattled conglomerate, said the plan, which
includes a management shake-up and debt reduction scheme, would enable
Westinghouse to 'put our financial services problem behind us'.
One of the main new elements yesterday was identification of the businesses
Westinghouse plans to sell to help its finances. These are a distribution
and control company, Westinghouse Electric Supply, Knoll International, the
office furniture company, and Westinghouse Communities, a property
developer.
Westinghouse said it would retain its Westinghouse Broadcasting television
and radio station operations.
Since 1990 the company has taken two huge charges totalling some Dollars
2.6bn to cover the deterioration in its property portfolio, but problems
have led to credit rating downgrading its debt.
Westinghouse, which had previously aimed to reduce its financial services
operations over five years, will now sell off assets rapidly, taking a
Dollars 2.35bn pre-tax charge against fourth-quarter earnings. There will be
a further Dollars 300m charge for the financial unit's operating costs.
The other businesses being sold will be accounted for as discontinued
operations, together with financial services, and the Dollars 800m of net
gains and operating earnings they are expected to generate will help offset
the property portfolio charges.
Westinghouse said after taking all charges it remained in full compliance
with its bank revolving credit agreement.
The dividend is being cut to 40 cents a year from 72 cents, which the
company said would 'reflect the earnings base of the continuing business'.
Mr Lego said the action plan would provide sufficient funds to retire all of
the financial services unit's debt, which currently exceeded Dollars 6bn.
A possible buyer for some of the property assets is GE Capital, the
financial services arm of fellow-conglomerate General Electric, which looked
over the business a year ago.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Dividend warning as BET falls 43%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BET, the business services company, yesterday reported a 43 per cent drop in
profits and predicted the recession, which has savaged operating margins,
would continue for two more years.
'We are an early indicator (of recovery),' said Mr John Clark, chief
executive. 'If we ain't seeing it, then it ain't coming.' BET shares fell
from 112 1/2 p to 92p.
The company, which last July launched a Pounds 200m rights issue, also left
open the possibility that it will cut the second-half dividend. The 'current
intention' was to maintain a full-year dividend of 6.5p, Mr Clark said. This
was unlikely to be covered by earnings. Next year's dividend, which many
City analysts believe is also unlikely to be covered, would be 'considered
very carefully', the company said.
At the interim stage, pre-tax profits to September fell from Pounds 71.5m to
Pounds 40.5m on sales 4 per cent lower at Pounds 1.18bn. Earnings per share
fell from 5.6p to 1.7p and the interim dividend is to be cut from 4.25p to
2p.
The results revealed a collapse in operating profits from Pounds 93m to
Pounds 49.7m on sales from ongoing businesses of Pounds 1.13bn. This
included Pounds 11m of exceptional costs mainly covering reorganisation of
businesses for sale and the UK textile services business.
The company also revealed that it has run into an ACT problem. Its reliance
on the UK, where profits were hardest hit, meant the group was not liable
for enough mainstream corporation tax against which it could offset its ACT.
As a result, BET wrote off Pounds 8m of ACT in the first half. The group's
tax charge is likely to rise to 45 per cent this year, from 26 per cent.
Mr Clark said the new management team has also decided to sell more
businesses. The cash raised would be used to 'improve BET's mix of
businesses'.
Net debt fell from 107m to Pounds 91m - or Pounds 49m including the
proceeds of the sale of Initial USA. As a result, the interest charge fell
from Pounds 22m to Pounds 9m.
The company used the proceeds of its rights issue to repay Dollars 380m
(Pounds 251m) of auction market preferred stock and confirmed that, while it
was unconcerned by the level of this form of financing, it would be repaying
the Dollars 120m balance 'at an appropriate time' from its own resources.

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIEMENS and Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial corporations, plan to
tighten their railway engineering links in a move which could lead to the
creation of a world-scale locomotive, rolling stock and track systems group.
Siemens said yesterday that it and AEG, the Daimler subsidiary, had asked
the Berlin cartel office if there would be any fundamental objections to
'co-operation'.
'We have not yet raised the question of what form the joint venture should
take - whether it should involve all or part of our operations,' Siemens
added.
A merger, which could include all Siemens' holdings in other joint ventures,
such as those with steel and engineering groups Krupp and Krauss Maffei,
would create a company with sales of almost DM4.5bn (Pounds 1.85bn).
Both businesses were profitable, but the increasing privatisation of railway
networks, and internationalisation of markets formerly dominated by public
sector utilities buying from domestic manufacturers, made increased
competitiveness desirable, Siemens said.
There was a growing market for companies which could provide complete
systems, including tracks, signalling, locomotives, power supply and
signalling.
Competitors such as ABB and GEC-Alsthom had consolidated strong positions in
their domestic markets and were increasing their international presence. The
German industry, by contrast, was still fragmented.
Apart from seeking greater critical mass in the home market, where contracts
totalling DM100bn are expected for work on upgrading and linking the former
East German rail network with that in the west, both prospective partners
want to extend their international presence.
Seeking influence in east European markets, Siemens is currently battling
with the new management of Skoda, the biggest Czech engineering group, to
take control of its rail interests. It is lead company in a consortium of
German engineers signed up to rebuild rail links between Warsaw and Berlin.
The group, which created its own rail transport technology division only
three years ago, has many co-operation deals in the rail business, including
one with Ansaldo, the state-owned Italian company.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Lamont to lead search for EC growth plan: Germany argues
against deficit-financed schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN Lamont will lead European Community efforts ahead of the Edinburgh
summit to reach a common position on stimulating growth.
The UK chancellor will contact his fellow finance ministers in the run-up to
the summit on December 11-12 to try to achieve a consensus on how to
proceed.
The agreement to explore proposals for a co-ordinated growth package came at
a meeting of finance ministers in Brussels chaired by Mr Lamont.
Despite general agreement on the need to break the deflationary cycle in
Europe, divisions emerged during yesterday's meeting over how to resolve the
question of financing such a package.
Germany expressed reservations about European Commission proposals for an
EC-wide effort to boost activity through lower interest rates and a 'big
bang' public works programme, part of which would be targeted at eastern
Europe.
Mr Henning Christophersen, economics commissioner, said the Community could
mobilise up to Ecu12bn (Pounds 9.7bn) using the European Investment Bank and
a new European Investment Fund. This would stimulate private borrowing and
ultimately inject an estimated Ecu50bn-Ecu60bn, the price-tag for reviving
the European economy.
Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary in the German finance ministry, called for
realism and intelligence. 'We will play a constructive part on growth
initiative, but this is not the time for deficit-financed economic
programmes,' he said.
Mr Lamont agreed that stimulus must not be at the expense of higher fiscal
deficits. But he revived his criticism of high German interest rates and
their impact on prospects for recovery. 'There are questions to be asked
about monetary and fiscal policy, not least in Germany,' he said.
British officials welcomed the debate on mobilising funds for infrastructure
investment and helping sectors such as small and medium-sized companies, but
stressed that ministers had not discussed any figures, let alone agreed any.
They pointed to the UK Autumn Statement as a model which targeted areas for
capital spending while keeping tight control on public spending.
The growth package will be further discussed on Friday at a meeting of
finance and foreign affairs ministers who hope to break the deadlock over
the so-called Delors II package to raise Community spending by almost one
third over the next five to seven years.
At yesterday's meeting, Germany, France, Britain and Italy all expressed
doubts about the spending proposals. Ministers said it was difficult to
justify the spending at a time of domestic austerity. Mr Kohler said the
latest proposal by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, to
freeze spending in real terms for the next two years was 'an absolute
minimum'.
The UK also came under attack for its rebate from the Community which is
expected to amount to Pounds 2bn this year. But Sir John Cope, the British
paymaster general, remained adamant that the rebate was not negotiable,
prompting angry rejoinders from his European colleagues.

ACTION to halt the proliferation of racist, neo-Nazi groups in Germany is
under urgent consideration, following the murder of a Turkish woman and two
girls in an arson attack at the weekend.
As Germany reacted in shock and dismay yesterday to the news of the worst
racial killing since unification, Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister,
announced that the security services were gathering evidence for a
clampdown. Action would be taken in the near future, he said, but refused to
give details for fear of undermining its effect.
Thousands of Germans staged spontaneous anti-racism demonstrations in
several cities including Hamburg, Berlin and the northern town of Molln,
near Lubeck, where the killings took place. Berlin's protest was
co-sponsored by its 140,000-strong Turkish community.
The government's top criminal prosecutor announced that he was taking
personal control of the investigations into the killing of the 51-year-old
Turkish woman, and two girls aged 14 and 10.
They died after two houses occupied for many years by Turkish migrant
workers were set on fire. The police were tipped off by two informants, both
of whom yelled: 'Heil Hitler.' Nine other occupants of the building were
taken to hospital.
The attack was condemned as 'shocking' and 'disgusting' by politicians on
all sides of the political spectrum, except for Mr Franz Schonhuber, leader
of the extreme rightwing Republicans, the largest far-right party in the
country, who declined to comment.
'Hatred of foreigners is hatred of human beings,' Mr Bjorn Engholm, leader
of the opposition Social Democrats, declared.
'The state must act with determination against all terror and crime . . .
The powers and competence of the police to fight right-wing terrorism must
be strengthened and concentrated.'
Chancellor Helmut Kohl expressed outrage on German television. On a state
visit to Mexico, Mr Richard von Weizsacker, the federal president, who has
repeatedly warned against racial violence, expressed grief over the victims
of 'senseless, disgraceful violence'.
The attack also sparked renewed charges that the government had failed to
take firm action against a rash of violence against foreigners, and had
instead become bogged down in an interminable debate on how to stop the flow
of asylum-seekers into the country.
The latest victims were not asylum-seekers, but long-time Turkish residents
in Germany. At least one of the girls was born in the country and had lived
all her life there.
The three deaths bring to at least 14 the number of deaths from racial
attacks in Germany this year. Two other murders were attributed to neo-Nazi
gangs at the weekend - one of a German who was allegedly burned to death
because his skinhead attackers thought he was Jewish.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Strike leaves Italian smokers gasping
</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT'S become a case of fire without smoke in Italy.
Smokers and tobacconists are angry over a strike in the state tobacco
monopoly that has paralysed distribution and exhausted supplies throughout
the country. The tobacconists' union is appropriately acronymed Fit.
'The strike has been going on for 20 days and I know of no one who has got
any stock left - except the most expensive cigars,' said a tobacconist in
central Rome. 'I've never known anything like it - we even had a chauffeur
who had been sent out to buy as many cigarette rollers he could find. People
are desperate.'
Yesterday, a single cigarette was being traded in the street for as much as
L1,000 (48p).
In Rome restaurants, waiters were asking for tips in cigarettes. At the
airport, unsuspecting arriving passengers found themselves being offered
cash for their duty frees.
At the frontiers with Switzerland and France the flow of shoppers was
reported unusually heavy. for this time of year. Even in Naples, the centre
of contraband, stocks have been drawn down and police warned of the dangers
of buying 'doctored' cigarettes.
Today, the country's 60,000 tobacconists are due to strike in protest at
their loss of income. They have already written to the prime minister and
president of the republic seeking their intervention. Faced with higher
taxes next year, they have also asked for special tax exemption for their
lost sales.
The unprecedented shortage of cigarettes has been caused by attempts to
transform the entity running the state monopolies which consists essentially
of tobacco and matches. The government is proposing to turn the entity into
a public company and cut its 13,000 workforce by 600 jobs.
The bulk of the workforce has gone on strike in protest at the threat of job
losses. Since the monopoly controls stocks, Italy's 13.3m smokers are
entirely dependent upon its ability to distribute. The tobacconists
themselves are often small shops with little storage space thus their own
retail stocks are limited
The trouble started because both smokers and tobacconists under-estimated
the determination - or bloody mindedness - of the strikers. There were
frequent reports of settlement which proved groundless.
The latest report is that work will resume on Wednesday but stocks are
unlikely to be delivered until the weekend at the earliest. On current
prices a cigarette could cost L2,000 by then.

FT  24 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Westinghouse
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sharp initial bounce in Westinghouse's shares following yesterday's
restructuring announcement is an expression of relief that the nettle has
finally been grasped. Westinghouse's financial services business has haunted
the management for well over two years. There has been a frightening spiral
of provisions - Dollars 975m in February 1991, Dollars 1.7bn in October
1991, and now Dollars 2.35bn in the fourth quarter of 1992, plus an
incidental Dollars 300m of operating losses while the disposal is completed.
Given the trend, investors can be forgiven for wondering whether even these
sums will be enough to rid them of the nightmare.
Even if it is, there is little reason to relax. Each of the company's three
remaining core businesses faces difficulties. Few nuclear stations will be
built. Yet in conventional plant Westinghouse's emphasis on project
management involves it in lower margin areas of construction, while its
arch-competitor General Electric seems to have a sharper focus on
higher-tech, and higher margin, manufacturing. The electronic systems
division is heavily dependent on the hard-pressed US military. Environmental
systems faces opposition to construction of more toxic waste incinerators.
It is not yet clear that the new structure will be able to deal with these
problems. And presumably employees phlegmatically regard the company pension
fund's phased investment in Dollars 400m of Westinghouse stock as just one
more hazard.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's 20 per cent fall in BET's share price was its just punishment
for misjudging the cycle. The company's decision to replace its auction
market preferred shares with real equity through July's rights issue was
sensible enough. But that is scant comfort to shareholders who took up
rights at 110p in anticipation of a secure dividend. The message from
yesterday's interim results is that the pay-out cannot be sustained by cash
flow alone. With little immediate hope of an earnings recovery, and further
provisions expected in the second half, the company would be justified in
cutting this year's dividend. But that would be embarrassing after the
rights issue. Next year's dividend must now be in doubt. That BET could lose
its place in the FT-SE index is a further reason not to hold the shares.
The immediate problem is pressure from cut-priced competitors in markets
such as office cleaning and plant hire. Another swing of the axe across
BET's collection of loss making ventures should reduce the drag on profits.
If BET really can squeeze an operating margin of around 10 per cent from a
slimmed-down portfolio, operating profits of perhaps Pounds 150m may
eventually be attainable. The shares would then look cheap. With borrowing
back under control, the promise of a move into high growth areas like
contract catering would be less of a pipe dream.
This assumes, though, that margins get no worse in the near term and that
BET can dispose of the loss-makers. Given the speed of the down-turn since
the summer, there is no reason to take much on trust.

FT  24 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: GPA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is just as well that GPA owes its banks Dollars 3bn rather than, say, a
measly Dollars 3m. Given that the company accounts for more than 10 per cent
of worldwide aircraft deliveries over the next two years, one of its trump
cards at the moment may be that it is too big to fail. Even so, while the
signs from yesterday's meeting of bank creditors in London might be
described as guardedly positive, GPA will need to muster the contacts of its
veritable cabin crew of non-executives to be sure of pulling through.
GPA aims to persuade the banks that, if they bail it out of its short term
crisis, the combination of new capital, strong underlying cash flow and
recovery in the aviation market will enable it to make the much bigger
capital repayments scheduled for 1995 and beyond. Inevitably this requires
an act of faith on the part of lenders that the adjustment of capacity to
traffic potential will be reflected in firmer leasing rates by then. To be
fair there is some evidence that the recent reduction in surplus aircraft is
having an effect. But if demand is not the worry it was, the credit quality
of GPA's airline customers certainly is.
The biggest challenge for GPA, though, could be to persuade secured lenders
that the holders of bonds and medium term notes need not make any
sacrifices. There is, of course, a perfectly logical reason for this. GPA
desperately needs the confidence and the goodwill of capital markets which
at some stage it will have to tap as a condition of the refinancing.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One day's trading since the weekend's ERM realignment leaves little doubt
that the market has decided to judge it harshly. There is no knowing how
long it will take for something else to snap - that may depend on whether
Ireland has a finance minister to sign away his currency after tomorrow's
election - but there is a tell-tale whiff of trouble in the air. One month
Irish interest rates are at 35 per cent. The Danish crown is close to its
D-Mark floor. France pushed short term rates back over 10 per cent and
intervened to support the franc.
The French currency may not be first in the firing line, but each bout of
currency instability exposes growing European disillusion with the
employment cost of fixed exchange rates. Alongside the Danish krone, the
franc would certainly look vulnerable if the punt and Norwegian crown were
to be toppled. That would raise doubts not only about the viability of the
ERM itself but also about the shape of any residual inner core of strong
currencies clustered round the D-Mark.
The interest rate convergence theory is thus suddenly suspect for currencies
hitherto regarded as close to the centre. The yield premium over German
bunds and both French and Danish bonds widened yesterday. Then again, a
fresh attack on the franc could pose the Bundesbank with an awful dilemma.
It might either have to cut rates against its better judgment or risk a new
surge in its money supply from intervention, followed by a French
devaluation that would make German industry almost hopelessly uncompetitive.
What price then on it still refusing to adopt the former course?

Sir, I have been waiting in vain for the tide of protest to flood through

commercial cover for damage from terrorist action on the mainland is to be

This decision is, quite simply, a disgraceful act which exposes businesses

terrorist threat as an established part of life and thereby hands a
considerable propaganda coup to the malefactors. How does the City and the

FT  24 NOV 92 / British tourism and the faulty towers of policy: The
industry which employs more than any other in the UK is also one of the most
neglected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A recent BBC Television South West news programme was full of economic
gloom: the region's workforce was among the lowest-paid in the country; a
local Conservative MP was seen leaving the Department of Trade and Industry
in London, having requested that the area be granted special economic
assistance, and there was film of a march in support of out-of-work miners.
The programme then struck a more optimistic note. Two local companies, which
were surviving the recession and continuing to employ 40 permanent staff,
had been voted the best in their field by an annual national guide. A BBC
reporter and crew were sent to report.
Instead of coming to praise these two businesses, the report tried to bury
them. Taking the word of three people in the street - two pensioners and a
young man - the reporter attacked the managers for charging prices which she
described as 'vaguely obscene' in a recession and offering customers the
opportunity for self-indulgence when others were losing their homes.
The two managers, it seems, had chosen the wrong field of activity as far as
many in the UK are concerned. They were in tourism: one a hotel, the other a
restaurant. They had compounded their initial mistake by being successful.
In other European countries and the US, neither would be seen in this light.
Instead, they would be praised for creating jobs, maintaining standards of
excellence and, in the US in particular, for converting the occasional
visitor into a regular customer. The UK's baffling attitude towards what
Americans call the 'hospitality industry' could be one reason for the BBC
reporter's criticism. But now, as unemployment seems to be rising
inexorably, is it not time to support an industry that is creating jobs,
boosting local communities and projecting a positive image of Britain?
Tourism is now the UK's biggest employer. There are 1.6m involved, including
the self-employed - more than in the National Health Service or the
construction industry since contraction took hold in the past two years.
During the 1980s the industry created an average of 44,000 jobs a year.
Worldwide tourist spending, including tourism in the UK, totalled Pounds
26bn last year and the future looks promising. By 2000 tourism is likely to
be the world's largest industry, according to the National Economic
Development Council's report, UK Tourism Competing for Growth.
Yet who speaks for this industry at the highest level of government? As Mr
Michael Heseltine, the president of the Board of Trade, presides over the
disappearance of more than 30,000 mining jobs, who in the cabinet is
highlighting tourism's creation of a like number of job opportunities?.
Sadly no one. Since the Conservatives came to power in 1979 the tourism
portfolio has fallen into the hands of many different secretaries of state
and ministers (including two in the House of Lords) in three different
departments - Trade, Employment and now National Heritage. The tourism
industry would feel less aggrieved and neglected if it could find at least
one enthusiastic supporter at cabinet level.
Mr David Mellor, the former heritage secretary, failed to provide the same
support for tourism that he offered opera or football. The chancellor's
Autumn Statement provided only a small increase in the grant to the British
Tourist Authority which very effectively waves the flag overseas for
Britain's 18m visitors. The spending plan, however, cut the grant to the
English Tourist Board which looks after tourists in the UK.
Mr Mellor's successor, Mr Peter Brooke, in his keynote speech to the Tory
party conference, blamed most of the industry's problems over the summer on
the weather, choosing to ignore an overvalued pound which not only put many
foreigners off but also sent many Britons scurrying abroad for their
holidays.
The one man in the department who seems to recognise the importance of the
industry is Mr Brooke's deputy, Mr Robert Key, but he does not have a seat
in the cabinet. Mr Key has recommended that all government policies,
including transport and training, take tourism into account because of its
importance to the economy.
There is undoubtedly a structural problem for the government in coming to
grips with tourism. The industry is highly fragmented, comprising many small
companies, often family run and therefore unlike other big employers. Nor is
its workforce heavily unionised, giving it a relatively low profile despite
the industry's size. Tourism is also partly to blame for its own lack of
representation, as it has long failed to speak with a united voice.
But now that the overriding concern of government is with jobs and growth,
these matters must be overcome. One of tourism's strengths as a job creator
is that it has knock-on effects throughout the local community. When
Gidleigh Park - the prize winning hotel in Chagford, Devon, which was
subject to the BBC report - is busy, it creates a further 11 part-time jobs,
more work for local businesses and extra demand for village shops. (The
hotel suffered a 25 per cent drop in turnover this year as a result of the
strength of sterling, but expects to do better now that the pound has
weakened.)
The Carved Angel, the prize-winning restaurant, keeps numerous Devon farmers
and suppliers busy. But more significantly, visitors drawn to Dartmouth by
the restaurant also go to other restaurants in the town during their stay.
The other advantage of tourism is that, while the creation of jobs in
manufacturing industries depends on winning back export markets - and it is
unlikely that competitors in Europe, the US and Japan will just sit back and
watch - jobs in tourism could materialise more quickly, given the right
encouragement.
Establishing a ministry for tourism would be a start. That would not only
encourage those already in the industry, but could attract new investment
and, with it, create new jobs. It would also show the government's
determination to no longer treat tourism as a second-class industry.
Britain could also follow the example set by the Hungarian government which
has re-opened - with the aid of foreign capital - the famous Gundel's
restaurant in the heart of Budapest as a showcase for its market economy.
Indeed, the UK Department of the Environment owns the site for what could be
the capital's most stunning restaurant - on the Serpentine in Hyde Park.
However, the restaurant will close in December with the loss of 60 jobs
because antiquated park bye-laws forbid taxis dropping off customers in the
evening; it has had to survive on daytime trade.
It is hard to imagine this happening in New York, Paris or Rome. Sadly, this
is yet another wasted employment opportunity. British tourism, however,
could provide many others if only the government gave it the leadership and
encouragement to do so.

Rumours circulating before last Saturday's rugby test with Australia at

While the sponsorship would benefit the team's finances, it was felt that it

The members of the fearless BBC Panorama team who deal routinely with such
difficult subjects as cocaine and military supplies to Iraq are taking on a
really dangerous subject next week - their own future. Panorama plans to
investigate the future of its own employer, in the wake of today's
government discussion document, and has exclusive film footage of the Beeb
governors at work. It is understood that the behaviour of both governors and
senior management was exemplary when the cameras were switched on. But as
soon as they had clicked off, it was a different picture entirely. An
animated discussion ensued as to whether such a programme was a good idea.
No surprise that the argument split along predictable lines. Sir Michael
Checkland, the outgoing director general, who recently suggested his
chairman Marmaduke Hussey was a bit too old for a second term as chairman,
was firmly behind the idea. The Duke and the incoming director general John
Birt seemed less enamoured.

Who says Her Majesty's government has run out of ideas? Treasury minister
Stephen Dorrell, one of the Tories' brighter young things, is begging for
inspiration.
'I want to issue a clear and open invitation for ideas on how we can best go
forward, from financiers, builders, and anybody else with a worth-
while scheme to offer,' the 40-year old minister said in a speech on
privatisation to the Centre for Policy Studies.
This may be just another sign of the Treasury's recent abrupt U-turn on
listening to outsiders. Certainly it ought to help deflect the blame the
next time a Treasury idea goes horribly wrong. No doubt ministers would also
welcome worthwhile advice on how to make a success of the EC presidency, how
to bring about some green economic shoots, how to make the council tax
popular in the south-east etc.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Observer: Schlesinger's last laugh
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Less than 18 months after taking the helm, Bundesbank president Helmut
Schlesinger has stamped his authority on the central bank's policy-making
council in a way his cannier and more 'political' predecessor, Karl Otto
Pohl, would have envied.
The land (state) presidents on the council - which takes decisions by
majority voting, on the basis of one-man one-vote - had been known to give
Pohl a hard time, and Schlesinger too had an early taste of the rebellious
streak when he was outvoted on the scale of an interest rate increase agreed
last December.
Now a reorganisation of the Bundesbank's council has been effected - one
objective of the Pohl presidency left unaccomplished when he resigned last
year - that makes such defeats less likely.
During the past year, Schlesinger had already presided over changes in the
permanent Frankfurt-based directorate which meant that the seven men were
increasingly cast in the president's mould. Now, even though the east is
represented, the number of land presidents on the council has been reduced
from 11 to 9.
Indeed, for procedural reasons, four land presidents have yet to take up
their seats - leaving Schlesinger's directorate temporarily well in the
ascendancy with seven votes against the lander contingent of only five.
So expect Schlesinger to be able comfortably to follow his instinct and wait
at least until the beginning of next year before cutting the bank's discount
or Lombard rates.
Meanwhile, the new-look council will be a rather duller place. In addition
to the departure of Bremen's Kurt Nemitz - a man reputed never to have voted
for an interest rate increase in his life - Wilhelm Nolling from Hamburg is
also off. Always to be relied upon for a steady stream of verbal fireworks,
he will be missed.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Letter: An unnecessary burden on UK small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRYAN CASSIDY MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, An item in the Observer column ('Advising the advisers', November 12)
about Michael Heseltine's recruitment of Lord Sainsbury as part of his
renewed campaign to tackle the burden of red tape on British business
contrasted oddly with the adjoining advertisement by the Health and Safety
Executive with the headline 'Europe's tightening up on Health and Safety at
Work'.
May I suggest that among Lord Sainsbury's first tasks is to look at the new
HSE regulations. He will find that they go way beyond the requirements of
the European Community's directives on health and safety. Among other
things, the UK regulations extend to self-employed persons and they require
a written risk assessment for all promises in which more than five people
are employed.
The EC directive makes no reference to the self-employed, no reference to
the need for written risk assessments and, in particular, stresses the
importance of avoiding placing unnecessary burdens on small and medium
enterprises.
The Health and Safety Commission somewhat vaguely estimates that the cost of
introducing these new regulations will be between Pounds 12.5m and Pounds
50m in the first year and that running costs will be Pounds 70m per year
thereafter. Many people reckon that the true cost to British business will
be much higher.
Are the new health and safety regulations an example of an unlevel playing
field being created to hinder British business in competing in the single
market?

FT  24 NOV 92 / Letter: Government insensitive to BR fare rises and decline
in service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID ERDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The recent announcement of 5,000 redundancies on the railways following
the 10 per cent fare increases by BR are further examples of the
insensitivity of the government to the effects of the current long
recession.
Over the three-year course of this recession, BR has been permitted to raise
fares by more than 30 per cent, literally driving many passengers on to
increasingly congested roads.
Few commercial organisations would attempt to combine these untimely efforts
to raise revenue while simultaneously cutting the quality of service. Yet BR
is operating 36-year-old rolling stock and signalling while reducing
maintenance staff, management, frequency of trains and station opening
times, and escalating fares to levels unseen elsewhere in Europe.
Meanwhile the government, apparently surprised by all of this, studiously
avoids any commitment to a Channel Tunnel link or new rolling stock for the
London, Tilbury and Southend line, choosing instead to hide behind its ever
slowing privatisation plans.
Why is the public transport lobby so feeble and when will the interests of
the millions of tax paying commuters be properly represented? Perhaps the
minister of public transport, or anyone sitting near him who reads the FT,
would address these issues and reply.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Letter: New role for chambers of commerce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D P ROBERTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Last week you carried two letters concerning Chambers of Commerce.
Gisela Davis's (November 16) is well argued describing the virtues of
chambers as they exist on the continent with public law status. Brian Wright
(November 19) was less sure about their effectiveness in providing advice to
small firms.
A more worrying article appeared on November 16 which described how Training
and Enterprise Councils are developing membership schemes which compete
directly with chambers of commerce and undercut chambers' subscription
('Tecs move 'undercuts chambers''). This is the worst of all worlds and it
is amazing that this wholly devisive development should be allowed to
continue.
To avoid emasculation of chamber membership there is a possible solution
which could offer a way forward and help to re-establish the industrial
wealth-creating culture which we have spent a long time walking away from.
The government should introduce compulsory registration of all businesses to
be administered by chambers of commerce. The registration would be free and
the cost of administrating the scheme would be borne from either a
subvention from the local authority budget or as part of the enterprise and
business development budget of Tecs.
The membership so created would be enfranchised and would be the basis of
legitimising the directors of chambers of commerce and Training and
Enterprise councils. The chambers of commerce would become an effective
focused local centre of business opinion and leadership. They would
predominantly comprise small and medium-sized enterprises from where
Britain's future prosperity will be derived.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Letter: Tax relief for care of elderly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms CAROLINE MONTAGU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The points in your article 'The wealth cascade runs dry' (November 21)
are chillingly clear to many of the now middle aged baby-boomers. The
parents of this group, often both still alive and wishing to continue living
at home together, can easily wipe out their own assets to support
themselves. In many cases, where elderly couples try to continue to live in
their own house, income topped up by capital injections does not begin to
meet their nursing or caring costs.
This shortfall must often be met by subventions from their children at a
time when they are still financially supporting their own offspring. These
contributions can be very high and sudden, and, except for the very
fortunate, usually have to come from income after tax. For members of this
group whose parents have escalating care costs the idea of the 'wealth
cascade' has long been consigned to the dustbin.
Given the current policy of Care in the Community, would it not be
appropriate for the government to consider a means whereby those children
financially supporting their elderly parents could obtain some income tax
relief?

FT  24 NOV 92 / Leading Article: The future of the ERM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE realignments of the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo, the
ERM has become still more clearly a two- tier exchange rate system. The
possibility that most member countries of the European Community would move
smoothly from a hard ERM into European monetary union (Emu) itself has now
disappeared. But there is a more pressing question: whether the ERM itself
will survive and, if so, in what form.
In the light of hindsight, the EC's determination to sail the good ship ERM
on a direct course to Emu - despite the gale created by German unification -
was a serious error. It might have made sense if, as some hoped before the
inter-governmental conferences, the voyage to Emu could be completed within
one or two years. But once it was evident that the Germans would insist on a
character-forming long haul, the course needed to be changed.
The Spanish peseta, the pound sterling and the Portuguese escudo had all
joined the ERM during the 5 3/4 years before September's devaluation of the
lira; the Finnish markka and the Swedish krona were linked to the Ecu; and
there was just one, technical realignment, when the lira was put into the
narrow bands. Now, however, the markka, the lira, the pound and the krona
have been forced to float; the peseta and the escudo have been realigned;
the French franc, strongest of the major currencies after the D-Mark, has
been subjected to great pressure; and even stalwarts such as the Irish punt
and the Danish krone are in the firing line.
Vicious spiral
With changes this frequent, a vicious spiral sets in. The more currencies
come under pressure, the more governments insist they will never realign and
the more credibility they lose when they do. The greater the gains won by
the speculators, the more willing they are to try again. The larger the
devaluations by competitors, the more painful it is to resist realignment.
And the more painful it is to resist, the less credible such resistance
becomes. An adjustable peg exchange rate system that suffers from such
frequent realignments is in grave danger of total collapse.
The French finance ministry says that the weekend realignment means that
'our difficulties are behind us'. But Ireland sends 30 per cent of its
exports to the UK, while the punt has gained 10.9 per cent against the pound
since before Black Wednesday and short-term real interest rates are about 12
per cent. Even the French franc has suffered a trade weighted appreciation
of 2.3 per cent since early September, while short-term real interest rates
are 7 per cent.
The danger is that currencies will be picked off one after the other. This
may not matter too much if depreciation is imposed only on minor currencies.
If the franc were to retain its position, there would be more to European
fixed exchange rates than a German Gulliver among the Lilliputians. Should
the French franc be forced to realign, however, European wide monetary
stability would have to be reconstructed, almost from scratch.
Course of action
The question is, what should be done now? First, thinking about whether the
EC will get to Emu, what Emu might look like and who might get there seems
futile in the current tempest.
Second, it seems equally pointless to maintain currencies at levels that
investors judge overvalued, especially when monetary policy is already too
tight in virtually every ERM member country except, arguably, Germany.
Countries suffering from overly tight monetary policy and inadequate growth
need real depreciations.
Finally, countries that are convinced they can stick with Germany until the
Bundesbank starts to ease need to do everything they can to reinforce their
commitment. Moving to still narrower bands is the obvious route.
If the ERM is to survive as more than just a managed float around a core of
Germany and a few small countries, either Germany must readjust its monetary
policies soon, or other currencies must be credibly reinforced at their
current parities, or parities must be realigned to convincingly defensible
levels. If German macroeconomic policy continues to thwart growth at the
European level, competitive devaluations are the inevitable outcome.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Mr Clinton's medium term
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE ADVANTAGE of the US system of economic governance is that the executive
has little discretionary power to fiddle with the levers of macroeconomic
policy. Not that the president-elect should be tempted to indulge in the
transitory pleasures of monetary and fiscal measures for short-term
gratification. Mr Bill Clinton was elected on promises to reverse America's
relative economic decline by using effective government policies to foster
sustainable growth in the medium term. His presidency will be judged on
whether he has begun to do so.
The intellectual pedigree of Mr Clinton's economics transition team derives
from policy research aimed at medium-term economic fitness, rather than
short-term macroeconomic gymnastics. After a hard day's memo-writing, they
will find much of interest in the OECD's latest report on the state of the
US economy, which makes the need to boost medium-term productivity growth
its theme.
The OECD's latest short-term forecast, for what it is worth, suggests a
sluggish recovery has already begun. Yet this slow growth is important not
for what it implies about the US economy today - that it is burdened by the
heavy debts mistakenly accumulated in the past - but because it makes it
harder to sell tough medium-term policies which will deliver rising living
standards in the future.
Steady decline
The OECD spells out, in chilling detail, why Mr Clinton's promise of change
fell on listening ears. Disposable incomes per head rose by a sluggish 1.5
per cent a year, on average, between 1979 and 1989 in constant prices. For
people in work, real hourly wages did not rise at all in the 1980s, while
the real wages of production workers fell by an average 0.7 per cent a year,
partly because productivity growth was sluggish and partly because of the
growing gap between the total wage bill employers face and the pay workers
receive once health-care contributions are deducted.
Health-care reform offers one way of raising real living standards among the
working population. The OECD tracks, in detail, the astonishing rise in
resources absorbed by America's greedy and ineffective health-care industry.
While politely avoiding direct prescription, the OECD advises the US to
ditch its decentralised system and shift to European-style rationing in
which costs and salaries are controlled centrally.
Yet faster productivity growth is the only route to rising living standards
for the whole population. The problem for the president-elect is that
investment in human capital through education will take many more years to
work than he has at his disposal. Mr Bush's attempt to be the education
president, however laudable in theory and vacuous in practice, could not
have borne a harvestable fruit in one or even two terms of office.
Investment boost
A rise in private investment is more likely to show medium-term results. The
OECD rightly argues that if the US is to lift itself off the bottom of the
investment league, it must also raise national savings as a percentage of
gross domestic product by sharpening tax incentives to private savings and
reducing the federal government deficit.
The OECD's report states clearly that the US needs higher taxes. The US
federal, state and local governments together spend less as a percentage of
national output than most OECD countries; most federal programmes, with the
exception of health, have already been squeezed hard; the US government has
lower taxes than any OECD country except Turkey; and indirect taxes are
particularly low by international standards - a 5 per cent federal
value-added tax would eliminate two thirds of the structural deficit.
This is the crux of the transition team's dilemma. Mr Clinton must close the
deficit but higher taxes now, while recovery is so sluggish, look counter to
the economy's short-term need for growth. One option is to legislate now for
tax change in the future. Announcing now a VAT that will be effective in a
year's time would encourage consumers to bring consumption forward while
reducing long-term interest rates. Combined with tax incentives for
investment, Mr Clinton would have achieved what he needs: a growth package
with medium-term benefits.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Charred, not changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Before the great fire of Windsor the talk of London and elsewhere was that
Britain's royal family was on the skids. If that was so last week, then it
still is today, despite the flames that dominated the weekend news. If the
prospect last Thursday was that Prince Charles would never become king, it
is the same this Tuesday morning. A charred national monument will make no
difference, however glorious the original may have been. Hampton Court was
gutted by fire six years ago; since then, coincidentally, its occasional
inhabitants have been the victims of incessant crescendos of public
disrespect.
Hold on. This is not a prediction that a revolution is around the corner.
The establishment of a federal republic of Britain would be a remarkable
constitutional advance, but the odds in favour of any such development are
slight. Yet they are not zero. None of us really knows what the heir
apparent has on his mind. Gossip suggests that he is fed up, that he might
try to have the crown passed over his head to his son's. If he does so the
whole institution will probably crumble. Only a brave or unintentionally
destructive dauphin would risk that.
The dramatic flames of the weekend have put such speculation on hold, at
least for a day or two. It is natural to express sympathy for the Queen, as
seen on TV bravely surveying the conflagration in her raincoat. No one who
fails to make the appropriate noises will be regarded as a gentleman.
Certainly Her Majesty is held in greater public esteem than any other member
of her family. While she reigns, the institution is secure. What may come
after her is less predictable. This is not because the monarchy is costly,
although if it was privatised and managed as a tourist attraction, as it
should be, a strong finance director would doubtless find much fat to trim.
You would then be well advised to take shares in Royal Attractions plc. It
could be a far better bet than Euro Disney.
The fact that the Queen pays no tax, even on her private investment
portfolio, does rankle with a great many people. Some Labour MPs, notably
those on the public accounts committee, miss no chance of reminding us of
her tax-free status. Perhaps that is why we have been reading stories about
the prime minister negotiating a new fiscal concordat with the palace.
Monarchists must hope that he is successful. He should be. There is no case
for the Queen withholding the tax she should pay on her considerable
personal fortune. This is a simple problem of equity, which in theory can
easily be resolved.
It is harder to prescribe an antidote for the de-mystifying effect of our
national obsession with the private lives, or the imagined private lives, of
the supposedly dignified element of the constitution. It is not the Queen's
fault that the private behaviour of some members of her family is similar to
that of many of her subjects. The House of Windsor is not the product of a
long line of saints; its forebears were human, and therefore imperfect. The
damage that has recently been done to its reputation is not the consequence
of any change in royal behaviour, but rather the result of a change in the
level of intrusive salacity the public will accept from - indeed demand of -
the media that serves it.
If none of these concerns existed there would be near-unanimous support for
the decision, affirmed by Mr Peter Brooke yesterday, to finance the
restoration of Windsor Castle from public funds. The heritage secretary has
logic on his side. The building belongs to us taxpayers. We have maintained
them since 1831. The monarchy is irrelevant to this argument. Even if we
lived in a republic this valued historic monument would be maintained by the
public purse.
As it is, provided we turn up at the right time we may see most parts of it,
including some of the burned-out area - although you may need an invitation
to a state banquet to get into the grander state rooms. Those who argue that
Windsor Castle should be subject to normal planning permission and fire
regulations have a point. But that is a red herring. The cry of 'let the
Queen pay' is not rational, although strongly felt. It means 'let the Queen
pay taxes'.
There is no general cry for what is really needed, which is the
disestablishment of the monarchy. British democracy would be less stultified
if it was disconnected from the process of government. The Crown sits at the
apex of our unwritten constitution. It puts the lid on the glass jar inside
which sit the suffocating elements of a Britain that should be long past: an
over-powerful executive (thankfully rather hamstrung for the moment); a
tradition of secrecy in the name of the Crown; a tendency for ministers to
make arbitrary decisions; an obsession with maintaining the unitary
structure of the United Kingdom. Every milligram of ash at Windsor Castle is
a small national tragedy; a bonfire of the constitutional nonsense that
rests on the House of Windsor would be a huge national triumph.

FT  24 NOV 92 / This could be the last time: EC support for stricken
steelmakers will depend on industry restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European steel industry - still one of the European Community's most
powerful industrial lobbies - has been given one more chance to flex its
political muscle.
In Brussels today, EC industry ministers will discuss far-reaching European
Commission plans to provide steelmakers with political, financial and
commercial support under the Treaty of Paris, foundation-stone of the modern
Community and protector of European coal and steel industries since 1951.
The Commission proposals, published last week, are the initial response to
an appeal last month from Europe's 15 largest steelmakers suffering from
overcapacity, non-EC competition and the economic downturn.
The prospect of renewed intervention has arisen despite the fact that two
years ago, most European steelmakers seemed to be back on the road to
profitability and the Commission was considering calls for immediate
abolition of the treaty.
According to Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner who championed
the calls for abolition, the treaty had been responsible for holding back
the steel industry in the 1980s. He was particularly critical of the
lingering effects of the 1980 Davignon Plan, named after the then industry
commissioner. The plan was put in place under treaty rules which allowed the
Commission to endorse production quotas, protectionist trade measures and
large government subsidies to cope with a 'manifest crisis' in the industry.
In March 1990, however, an optimistic Commission report referred to the
'irreversible' free-market attitude of the then-thriving industry. The
treaty, Sir Leon believed, had outlived its usefulness.
But instead of abolition, the Commission opted for gradual revision of the
Treaty of Paris until it expires in 2002. Now, faced with a crippling
downturn, steelmakers have been quick to call for assistance, prompting
accusations that both industry and the Community are hankering after the
protective measures of the old days. Some member states, notably Germany,
fear the steel plan may be the first step towards a new Davignon Plan.
But a closer look suggests the current plan could be the last time steel
will get the favoured treatment given to so-called strategic European
industries.
Under the plan, steelmakers could benefit from up to Ecu450m (Pounds 368m)
of central funding to cover redundancy and restructuring costs, and perhaps
the same amount again if member states agree to match the Brussels hand-out.
A former senior Commission official will prepare a special report to guide
the industry on essential capacity cuts, and measures to protect European
steelmakers against cheap non-EC imports will be beefed up.
The Commission response is based on two industry claims which have been
readily accepted in Brussels. First, strategic or not, the European steel
industry is in crisis. Second, while the Treaty of Paris exists, it still
provides a framework for coping with such crises.
Commissioners on both the free-market and interventionist wings of the EC
executive agree that the situation is grave. As one Commission official put
it: 'Even the most liberal companies, which always complain about state aid,
have told me that they welcome the industry initiative, because it is that -
or catastrophe.'
Last week, for example, British Steel passed its interim dividend and said
that the level of its final dividend would depend on improved trading
prospects. That in turn will depend on a rise in prices. 'In the absence of
a strong increase in demand, price rises in the EC are likely to be achieved
only through a cutback in output and capacity involving restructuring,
coupled with anti-dumping measures,' the company says.
Steel prices in Europe have declined by about 30 per cent in the past three
years, as the UK and, later, the continental markets, saw customers reduce
demand.
On top of this, the threat of trade sanctions by the US, which could be
announced on Friday and which were prompted by allegations of dumping of
European steel, is encouraging European producers to divert exports to
neighbouring EC markets. At the same time, the alleged dumping of steel in
the EC by east European producers has contributed to the price falls.
With just over 50 per cent of the European steel industry still state-owned,
the industry has found it hard to rationalise and reduce overcapacity. This
overcapacity is estimated at about 30m tonnes of annual output, based on the
full operation of all Europe's steel plant, compared with forecast
production this year of 136m tonnes.
Not before time, the industry is now cutting production, with reductions of
about 2.5m-3m tonnes announced across Europe in the fourth quarter, compared
with a year ago. But further production cuts will probably be necessary next
year before the market can recover. Mr Brian Moffat, British Steel chief
executive, sees demand in the UK - first into the recession - stabilising
next year as the continental market continues to fall.
In the light of the industry's problems even the strongest advocates of free
trade within the Commission have been sympathetic to calls to assist the
industry. They believe there will be a trade-off between their support and
vital restructuring.
Sir Leon Brittan, for example, is a proponent of restructuring and capacity
cuts, provided they are carried out in a way which does not encourage
anti-competitive collusion between steel producers.
In defending their attempts to support the steelmakers, Brussels officials
also point out that:
The situation is not as bad as in the early 1980s. This time, the steel
industry has not sought to activate the 'manifest crisis' clause of the
Treaty of Paris, although it says it might still do so, if the situation
deteriorates further.
The cash element is modest, compared with industry estimates of Ecu4bn for a
three-to-four-year programme of restructuring. In spite of last week's claim
by Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, that up to Ecu900m might
be available, new EC money in the plan amounts to just Ecu240m. That is
supposed to help cover the cost of up to 50,000 redundancies estimated by
Eurofer, the European industry federation, over the next three to four
years. Member states are not obliged to match those contributions. But under
treaty rules, if an individual government decides to give nothing to its
industry, that industry will receive nothing from the Commission.
So if the plan is conservative, why are some member states still worried
about it?
More market-oriented governments - broadly speaking, the northern EC
countries - fear that the plan will be applied to a far from level playing
field. Some national industries have already been rationalised, or even
privatised, while others still benefit from hefty subsidies. 'It could help
those people who didn't take commercially prudent decisions, and penalise
those who rationalised earlier,' says one British official.
Those same member states are also anxious that approval of the plan might
trigger a state aid free-for-all for other national industries. As if to
underline the point, industry ministers are likely to spend most of today's
meeting talking about Spain's controversial Pta558bn (Pounds 3.22bn) plan to
restructure its steel industry, which aims to safeguard steelmaking in the
volatile Basque country.
Concerns that the Spanish steel plan might be blocked brought thousands of
Spanish steel workers onto the streets of Madrid last month. The Commission,
in an indication of the political sensitivity of the case, issued a
double-edged statement a month ago welcoming the 'courageous and
constructive' approach of the Spanish government, but suggesting that
capacity or state aid would have to be cut for the plan to be accepted.
In fact, ministers do not have to take a decision today on either the steel
restructuring plan, or the Spanish state aid case. Both take the form of
'communications' from the Commission rather than formal proposals. But
ministers will have to decide how strong a political signal to send about
the importance of the steel industry, at a time when other sectors of the
depressed EC economy are also suffering.
This is a political conundrum which some ministers would probably rather not
tackle. The German government, for example, has to reconcile its firm line
against subsidies with growing complaints from its industry that steelmakers
in other countries - Spain, Italy and France particularly - are benefiting
from state aid and not cutting capacity. Italy, in turn, would not want to
be too tough on the Spanish while it is in the throes of discussions with
the Commission about restructuring plans for its own state-owned industry.
As one German official puts it: on the one hand, 'if (the Spanish industry)
gets the aid on offer then there are several countries prepared to follow
up. Once you get started there's no barrier for the others'; on the other
hand, 'you can't just sit there and do nothing'.
Most steel producers, however, have already recognised that steel will never
be given the same high strategic priority as in the past. Instead, the
industry talks in terms of the 'responsibility' of the Commission and member
states to provide help, while the coal and steel treaty is still in force.
Brussels officials make clear that they expect an equal or greater effort
from the industry itself.
The success of any 'Son of Davignon' plan will thus depend very heavily on
the will of individual producers to rationalise through restructuring, and
hence improve the industry's financial health. And the state-owned companies
will have to play their part without help from subsidies that could
jeopardise the position of the private sector.
The problem, says Mr Moffat of British Steel, is that 'people don't want to
face the fact that restructuring might apply to them'. But, with the
overcapacity in the EC steel industry, 'nobody can think it won't apply'.
As Mr Edward Hadas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, wrote
recently: 'I do not believe that steel will ever again receive the sort of
attention once naturally accorded it in western Europe.'
At the same time as sanctioning the aid plan last week, the Commission
quietly approved recommendations to wind down the Ecu750m financial reserves
of the Treaty of Paris, or absorb them into other EC funds by 2002. For
those steel producers who may still be reluctant to let go of the EC's apron
strings it is a small but telling reminder of what is to come.

That warfare is disciplined insanity is borne out by today's Assignment
(7.45 BBC2) which tells of a plan for the US and Russia to join in building
a 'space shield' against missiles. Britain, we are told, not only fears
losing the 'special relationship' with Washington, but that Russia may end
up with a defence system which could defeat her Trident missiles in the
event of their use against Moscow. Over to you Dr Strangelove.
Can you name the winner of last year's Turner Prize? Any previous winner?
Then perhaps you will not want to watch this year's cheque for Pounds 20,000
being given to 'a British artist under 50 for an outstanding exhibition or
other presentation' on Without Walls (9.00 C4). Of course it is meant to put
us all more in touch with contemporary art, but a change in attitude among
artists, a keener desire to please their contemporaries, might do more.
Inside Story promises the first television interview with an IRA double

the RUC Special Branch. He now lives under an assumed name in another

FT  24 NOV 92 / Arts: The Drottningholm saga
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is nothing to beat arriving at Drottningholm. The boat from Stockholm
takes a little less than an hour and brings the evening's audience to the
summer palace of the Swedish royal family, where the court theatre has stood
perfectly preserved for 200 years.
This programme at the Barbican on Saturday, one of the highlights of the
'Tender is the North' festival, was an ambitious undertaking. The arrival by
boat could hardly be replicated, but much else that makes this Swedish
theatrical treasure special was. The entire stage structure had been rebuilt
on the platform with wings and flies left open so that the audience could
see the theatre's skeleton in action. Then we were given a history of the
theatre and excerpts from performances there.
Built in 1766, closed and mothballed only 26 years later, Drottningholm
slumbered until the 1920s when a theatre historian uncovered not only the
building intact, but also original painted scenery and the complete
18th-century stage mechanism. All of this was related at the Barbican as a
staged drama with the role of Queen Louisa Ulrika, the theatre's founder,
being taken by the Swedish soprano Elisabeth Soderstrom. Nobody more fitting
could possibly be found. Soderstrom made her own debut at Drottningholm in
1947 and recounted how the audiences used to be made up of American
tourists, who wanted their photos taken with the singers afterwards.
Today the theatre attracts a different visitor. It has become a leading
centre of period performance practice in music. A small authentic orchestra
led off the second half with a delightfully quirky account of 'Spring' from
Vivaldi's Four Seasons. There were ballet excerpts to music from
Drottningholm's great period. Anita Soldh sang a gently dramatic aria from
Haeffner's Electra and the mezzo Monica Groop gave a fruity account of
Handel's 'Where shall I fly?' from Hercules.
With this performance Soderstrom herself takes over as the theatre's
Artistic Director. It was an auspicious start, entertaining, informative,
well chosen and presented. The London audience will have taken away a good
idea of what a visit to Drottningholm means.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Arts: A Purcell weekend - Music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Purcell celebration on South Bank this last weekend bore the subtitle
'The English Genius': three days of Purcell concerts - chamber music as well
as choral odes and a sampling of the dramatic music - interspersed with
talks and foyer events.
But this weekend was in fact the launching of a boldly conceived project of
Purcell reclamation, phased in annual stages and timed to reach its finale
on November 21 1995, the 300th anniversary of the composer's death. Purcell
still needs the reclamation that anniversarial celebration tends to
encourage: the favourite works - Dido, a handful of church works, the G
minor Chaconne, the familiar songs - are always with us, but the rest is
surprisingly apt to disappear from sight and earshot for periods of time.
The main focus of the annual South Bank Purcell weekends will be the
'semi-operas': those hybrid entertainments filled with speech and dance as
well as some of Purcell's most marvellous invention for voices and
instruments. In spite of the recent Fairy Queen stagings that have enjoyed
popularity and critical favour at international festivals, received opinion
of these works - Fairy Queen, King Arthur, The Indian Queen, Dioclesian -
remains that their musical treasures are padlocked into dramatic forms now
unrevivable, and therefore quite irrecoverable. The challenge faced by the
Purcell Tercentenary Trust committee (director, Nicholas Kenyon) is to
tackle these works - Fairy Queen next year, King Arthur in 1994 - in ways
that re-discover them whole.
On Sunday the Orchestra and Chorus of the Age of Enlightenment under Gustav
Leonhardt offered in the Queen Elizabeth Hall a mouthwatering taster of the
project in their concert version of the Dioclesian Masque. In this
wonderfully vast structure a climactic formal celebration is turned by
Purcell into a feast of varied, linked pleasures. The words are cardboard
pastoral; the music - shot through with strokes of individual, unrepeatable,
sometimes wholly inexplicable genius - goes beyond them; it cries out for
some sort of stage realisation.
The remainder of Sunday's concert and most of Friday's were devoted to the
choral odes, those formal celebrations of state occasions elevated by their
music to statements of an English artistic ideal. How dire are the
verse-jingles, the sycophantic images of 'Come ye sons of Art'] And how
irresistibly robust the melodic, harmonic and rhythmic energies infused by
Purcell into its stuffed-shirt sequences] His art, which finds exhilaration
in the texture of single words, evokes both immediate delights and long
vistas; it has never seemed more modern, and more timeless.
If I had a fault to find with Leonhardt's otherwise expertly balanced
accounts of the Masque, 'Come ye Sons of Art' and Friday's two hymns to St
Cecilia, it was their overall lack of the generous gesture, the overflowing
zest for phrasing and timing which marks the true Purcell interpreter. A
touch of Beecham was wanted - in soul if not in sound-picture; a similar
shortage of spirit was felt in the Purcell Quartet's neat and knowledgeable
playing (on Saturday, in the Purcell Room) of the string sonatas.
Of the singers on all three evenings, it was the two countertenors, the
nobly poetic Michael Chance and the spritely Christopher Robson, who did
most to cherish words as well as vocal lines. I wish the Purcell Project
very well; and pray that, amid all their other valuable explorations, its
exponents manage to re-discover the 'animal' pleasures of Purcell playing
and singing.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Arts: 'Fedora' and 'Die Frau ohne Schatten' - Opera in
Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Never have so few done so little for so much. One cannot begrudge singers'
fees of SFr 20,000 (Pounds 9,200) a night if the market is willing to pay.
But it would help if they sang a decent evening's music. For the audiences
who paid seat prices of SFr 250 (Pounds 115) to hear Giordano's Fedora in
Zurich this month, Agnes Baltsa and Jose Carreras evidently gave value for
money. What they sang was of no matter: their fans simply wanted to hear and
acclaim them. But it was a pity they could find nothing better than
Giordano's verismo shavings, which make a three-act opera out of a tenor
aria and a few fragmented outpourings for an ageing diva.
If one discounts Santuzza, sung by as many mezzos as sopranos, Fedora is
Baltsa's first soprano role. It is a curious choice, which her
artfully-managed (to put it kindly) top register fails to justify. Baltsa's
middle-voice has for some time been hit-and-miss - some notes are simply
lost - while the bottom register is increasingly squally. Carreras, taking
up position for 'Amor ti vieta' as if he was rehearsing for the next Three
Tenors Concert, commands less vocal colour since his illness. He also seems
to have lost sight of the distinction between singing and shouting.
Their partnership, which caught fire ten years ago when Baltsa learned her
Carmen from Ponnelle in Zurich, still cracks plenty of sparks: both have
enormous stage presence, reacting to each other with the instinctive skill
and generosity of a dedicated couple. Nevertheless, it is sad to see two
stars living off their reputation, wasting their fading vocal talents on
operatic trivia.
Time has been kinder to Grischa Asagaroff's production. First staged in
1982, it now returns at the head of a Fedora revival extending in coming
months to Milan, Vienna, Bregenz and Berlin - all of which will be lucky to
match Andrzej Majewski's handsome belle epoque decor and Jan Skalicky's
period costumes. The Zurich ensemble, conducted by Manfred Honeck, made the
best of the cameo role-playing and orchestral colour-packaging which pad out
this flimsy Sardou-based melodrama.
Switzerland's other large-scale operatic event this month was Die Frau ohne
Schatten at Geneva: a noble venture which made awesome sense of the
Strauss-Hofmannsthal fairy-tale and its vast orchestral tapestry. The
production - conducted by Horst Stein, staged by the young German director
Andreas Homoki and designed by Wolfgang Gussmann - steered clear of oriental
or naturalistic associations, opting instead for a stark metaphysical
setting. The decor consisted of two white walls, sprinkled with tiny
hieroglyphics and converging on a black void. Within this permanent
single-level framework, the Emperor's world was suggested by a random group
of giant pink spear-shafts; a collection of outsize yellow boxes and rags
signified the human world of Barak's home, while a suspended ball
represented the spiritual domain of Keikobad.
None of this told a simple narrative. There was a whiff of bathos whenever
Keikobad's ball loomed into view. The metaphor of the shadow was ignored,
Barak was a simpleton. But the production's strengths far outweighed its
weaknesses. Homoki created dramatic space from the music, drawing out an
expressive visual language between the characters. The acting and blocking
was refined and purposeful. Freed from visual conventions, the production
struck the emotional and symbolic core of the work.
Stein's conducting, spacious but never slack, showed masterful grasp of
Strauss's themes and crescendos. The cast was of uniform strength. Beneath
his grubby overalls and cropped hair, Wolfgang Schone's Barak combined the
all-suffering simplicity of a Wozzeck with the vocal dignity of an Amfortas.
As the Dyer's Wife, Deborah Polaski resembled a towering frump of a
Hausfrau, but sang with warmth, power and freedom. Thomas Moser eloquently
captured the tragic dimension in the Emperor. Ellen Shade's Empress looked
beautiful and sang radiantly. Reinhild Runkel's white-haired, androgynous

FT  24 NOV 92 / Arts: Sickert, the-odd-man-out - William Packer admires this
artist, too French for the English and too English for the French
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER

<TEXT>
Walter Sickert is one of the great figures in British art in the modern
period. His example directly influenced his contemporaries, set the
character of much of our art school education well into the 1960s, and
persists at a general level even today. Such work is well-mannered,
well-observed, the paint rich and lively on the surface, close in tone,
thoroughly painterly and professional. The subject-matter is intimate and
domestic, scenes of the bedroom and the kitchen, theatre and music-hall, the
local street, the corner cafe, the unassuming shop.
And among our best painters of that period, Sickert again must stand high on
the list, perhaps even in first place. Yet in that very company  - from
Whistler, Sargent, Bomberg and Spencer to Bacon and Freud - we discover an
odd paradox of British art at large. For to be thus typical of us, it seems,
is necessarily to be an outsider of some sort, incomer or eccentric, typical
only in peculiarity.
Born in Munich in 1860 of a Danish father and Anglo-Irish mother, as much at
ease in French and German as in English, he was as naturally cosmopolitan as
the American painter, Whistler, his first mentor. Through him he met Degas,
who introduced him into the Paris art world of the 1880s. He was a constant
traveller, staying abroad for years on end, notably at Dieppe and Venice.
Ever independent, he soon distanced himself from Whistler, writing in 1888
that 'Now that you have taught me to walk I am not crying to be carried.' He
also frequently wrote art criticism for newspapers and magazines. Was it the
occasional wearing of the critic's hat that allowed him the critical
detachment and practical independence that together characterised him until
his death, in 1942?
Too English for the French, who remain largely ignorant of him, too French
for the English to accommodate readily, Sickert is still something of an
odd-man-out, sui generis. There have been small group and dealers' shows
galore, but London has seen no full study since the Arts Council's centenary
show at the Tate in 1960, and nothing major since the show of late work at
the Hayward 11 years ago. This admirably comprehensive Royal Academy
retrospective is thus all the more welcome for being so long over-due.
It is hung in broadly chronological sections, each covering the several
interests of its period. We follow his emergence from Whistler's shadow, the
early influence of Degas, and the establishment of a personal and particular
imagery of music-hall, artiste and audience. Then it is the street-scape of
Dieppe, then Venice and Saint Mark's. And now it is Venice again, but in the
persons of the women, old and young, who were his models. So it is that the
nude, the intimate, domestic, unidealised nude, as of the brothels of Degas
and Lautrec, enters his repertoire of subjects, soon made entirely his own
in the dark and ambiguous interiors of Camden Town, redolent of violence and
murder and the enduring myth of Sickert's involvement with Jack-the-Ripper.
So we move on, the palette lightening, to the interiors, the portraits,
theatre paintings and figure groups of his middle and old age, so often
based on press and theatre-publicity photographs, all set out clearly
enough, though fussy captioning does jar occasionally. And it is surprising
to read that the Italian inscription in the second, splendid painting of
Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies as Marlowe's Queen Isabella - 'The abuse heaped on the
head of a King makes me speechless, makes me tremble' - remains unexplained.
Unidentified perhaps, but it is yet singularly appropriate to the story of
Edward II, and the painting itself is dated about 1936.
But nice matters of iconography and identity, or whether a grey-green wall
means London or Venice, dear as they are to art-scholarship, are not really
the substance of such exercises as this. Rather it is that in bringing so
much of the work together of all kinds and periods, the emphasis returns to
the work as work, and to the act of painting itself. And what emerges is not
merely the refined and careful quest after aesthetic and technical effect,
which we know from the individual works, but collectively something
altogether more robust and radical. The paint lies lush on the surface, the
brush-mark flickering and active, the paint positively relished. The drawing
is only as precise as it needs to be, sometimes all but perfunctory - and
yet it always is enough, the resolution of each image perfect even in its
imprecision. To come to Sickert from Munch at the National Gallery - almost
his exact contemporary - is to catch, by the immediacy of the figures and
portraits of the 1890s and 1900s especially, a decided hint of expressionism
in the air.
The other technical matter is Sickert's use of the photographic reference,
which is open and declared in the later work. Here is no slavish copying -
indeed no artist can properly use the photograph without an understanding of
its inherent distortions and omissions. But, by supplying the image
complete, it does free the artist from questions of composition and
organisation, leaving him only to decide upon the general treatment of the
surface and the actual handling of the paint. It is thus hardly surprising
to find Sickert as free and openly experimental in these later works as ever
he was before.
The question is only: how soon did he begin? It is known that he was using
the post-card or photograph to supplement his own drawings and studies well
before 1900. But already, so it seems to me, from this remarkable
exhibition, a good many of his major paintings of Dieppe or Venice at the
turn of the century, of l'Eglise Saint Jacques, or the horses and facade of
Saint Mark's, were nothing less than comprehensive reworkings of the
standard post-card view.

sector

<TEXT>
The European Commission's powers under the Rome Treaty to ensure that EC
competition rules are applied to regulated industries throughout the
Community have been upheld by the European Court in an important series of
cases.
The cases, brought by Spain, Belgium and Italy, dealt with the Commission's
measures in the telecommunication services sector which were designed to
open up access to the market by abolishing all special or exclusive rights
relating to the supply of telecommunication services other than voice
telephony.
Among other things the measures also allowed users to terminate long-term
supply contracts once the special rights had been abolished.
The Court ruled that the Commission's powers were not limited to simply
surveilling rules already in existence but that it had a general right under
the Rome Treaty to implement new measures such as those under attack. The
fact that such a measure could have been implemented by the Council of
Ministers did not affect the Commission's competence to act.
The Court thus held that the Commission's measures were lawful and that the
exclusive rights of establishment and exploitation of telecommunications
services given to organisations by EC countries could therefore be
abolished.
However, the abolition of special rights was not lawful in that the
Commission had failed to define them precisely. The right to terminate
long-term supply contracts was also overruled on the ground that other Rome
Treaty provisions should have been used.
Joined Cases C-271/90, 281/90 and 289/90: Spain, Belgium and Italy v
Commission, ECJ FC, 17 November, 1992.
UK fishing licence conditions
overturned
UK FISHING legislation which places nationality and residence conditions on
fishing vessels operating from the UK has been overturned by the Court.
Under UK law, the granting of fishing licences was subject to certain
conditions, one of which was that at least 75 per cent of the crew of the
vessel seeking a licence had to be British citizens or EC nationals
ordinarily resident in the UK, excluding Spanish and Portuguese nationals
until January 1, 1993.
The Court said the exclusion of the Spanish and Portuguese nationals was
contrary to the Rome Treaty provisions on the free movement of workers, the
right of establishment and the freedom to provide services throughout the
Community. The residence requirement was also contrary to the same
provisions.
C-279/89: Commission v UK, ECJ FC, 17 November, 1992.)
Dutch old-age pension rules not discriminatory
THE COURT has upheld Dutch old-age pension rules, in spite of the fact that
their effect benefited men more than women. Dutch legislation provided that
individuals were entitled to an old-age pensions when they reached 65. This
pension could be increased if the pensioner had a dependent spouse who had
not yet reached 65 years. However, the amount of the increase was dependent
of the spouses's own earnings.
A Dutch man whose pension was reduced by virtue of the fact that his wife
was receiving certain state benefits, brought an action in the Dutch courts,
contesting the decision to reduce his pension and arguing that the national
rules were contrary to Community law, in that they benefited men more than
women and were thus discriminatory and unlawful.
The European Court held that men benefited more from the rules in question
than women, by virtue of the fact that husbands were generally older than
their wives and that therefore the rules were per se discriminatory.
However, the Court went on to find the rules were nevertheless objectively
justified in that, among other things, they formed part of the social policy
of the Netherlands and a certain margin of discretion was allowed in the
application of such rules.

FT  24 NOV 92 / People: Mobil - gearing up for Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mobil is pressing ahead with plans for closer integration of its European
operations in time for the single European market. When Brian Davis,
chairman of Mobil Oil, the UK refining and marketing affiliate, retires at
the end of the year, his successor will be Geoffrey Cardinal, currently
manager of marketing services for Mobil Europe - which co-ordinates the
activities of the 16 European affiliates.
In parallel moves, Gerhard Roth, manager of planning and administration with
Mobil Oil AG (Moag) in Germany will replace Burkhard Genge as country
manager. Genge becomes vice president of lubricants for Mobil Europe.
In France, Chris Schneebeli will move from manager of logistics support and
development to become president of Mobil Oil Francaise. He replaces Georges
Dupasquier, who moves on to be vice president of Mobil Europe.
At the same time, some European managers will join the boards of other
national affiliates to enhance the process of European integration. This
will produce what Geoffrey Cardinal calls a 'form of matrix operation, where
we have strong local teams, but each of their functions is part of the
European refining enclave'.
One of the strengths he can bring to his new post, Cardinal says, will be
his experience of cultural differences and the 'many, many commonalities' in
different parts of Europe.
Cardinal has spent nine years with Mobil Europe, first as manager, marketing
analysis, and later as manager, public affairs. He then gained wide European
exposure as general manager of Mobil's marketing and refining businesses in
Cyprus, Norway and Austria, where he had responsibility for Mobil's
marketing business in eastern Europe.
Last year, when Mobil moved the headquarters for its European operations
from Fairfax, Virginia to London, Cardinal became manager of marketing
services across Europe.
He was born in Warwickshire in 1947, and studied economics at Sheffield
University. His career with Mobil began in 1971 as a planning analyst. After
moving into marketing, he became general manager of Prime Garages, a company
responsible for Mobil's service stations.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Business and the law: Flash warning - The potentially
far-reaching implications of the US Supreme Court's Kodak judgment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent US Supreme Court ruling against Eastman Kodak reinstating an
antitrust lawsuit filed against the photographic equipment giant in 1987 by
18 service companies, came as a rude shock to America's commercial lawyers.
Lawyers for the companies, which accused Kodak of violating federal
antitrust laws by operating an illegal 'tying-in' agreement involving sale
and repair of photocopiers, hailed it as the most important decision for US
business in a decade.
Mr Richard Fine, a Los Angeles attorney who filed a brief on behalf of the
California State Electronics Association (CSEA) in support of the
independent service providers, said the decision guaranteed survival of a
domestic service industry for all products, including cars, computers and
consumer electronics.
The decision would reduce the amount consumers pay for service and repair of
products and boost the provision of parts manufacturing. Ultimately, by
reducing US dependence on foreign made parts, the ruling would reduce
America's balance of payments deficit, he said.
Antitrust lawyers regard the decision as no less revolutionary but for
different reasons.
The Supreme Court move came as a big surprise, says Mr Roy Englert, a
partner in the Washington office of the law firm Mayer Brown &amp; Platt. This
is because the ruling delivered a sharp rebuke to the free-market, Chicago
School approach to competition issues that has dominated the Supreme Court's
handling of antitrust cases in recent years.
'The court has relied on heavier and heavier doses of economic theory in its
antitrust decisions. Most people expected the Kodak case to go the same
way,' he says.
Instead the justices said there could be no blind reliance on economic
theory. The theory must relate to the evidence of the market.
On another level, by ordering Kodak to go to trial on the 1987 lawsuit, the
Supreme Court decision has sown fresh confusion about the extent to which
antitrust cases can be disposed of by summary judgment without going to full
trial.
The US still has juries in civil cases. Corporate lawyers believe juries
invariably rule against companies accused of anti-competitive policies
because they do not understand the issues. It is in their clients' interests
therefore to dispose of antitrust cases before trial.
The case against Kodak was that by refusing to sell independent service
groups parts to fix its copiers, the photographic equipment giant was, in
effect, trying to squeeze them out of the market. Kodak's policy was to only
sell parts to owners of its copiers that had to use Kodak to service the
machines, or who performed repairs themselves.
Service companies argued that this policy amounted to an illegal 'tying-in'
arrangement. Kodak insists this was not anti-competitive because it only
controlled a quarter of the market in copier machine sales. Consequently,
its monopoly on parts and servicing was legal.
In other words companies that contracted to buy Kodak copiers knew what they
were letting themselves in for. So long as there was strong competition in
the equipment market itself, tied service agreements were not necessarily
anti-competitive.
The court rejected this argument by six to three. If Kodak had won, the
result could have been the domination of the US service industry by a few
original equipment manufacturers, a disastrous outcome for consumers, Mr
Fine says. As it is, the decision has given the service industry a new lease
of life that will lead to greater competition and drive prices down.
The importance of this cannot be underestimated, he adds. The US is no
longer a manufacturing based economy. More than 60 per cent of its gross
domestic product is service oriented. In the car industry in 1990 about
Dollars 255bn (Pounds 169bn) was spent on parts and servicing, dwarfing the
Dollars 147.8bn spent on new car sales. The high-tech equipment service
market, worth Dollars 250bn a year, is forecast to grow by more than 17 per
cent a year.
Mr Fine also believes more competition in the service sector will create a
demand for cheaper spare parts. Many manufacturers seem to be discouraging a
market in service and repair of their products by pricing parts at levels
that encourage consumers to buy new models when existing ones break down
rather than get them fixed.
Mr Fine points to a brand of Japanese television on sale in California for
Dollars 300 new; yet to replace its four most expensive parts would cost
Dollars 800. New wide-screen televisions cost about Dollars 2,500, but a
replacement picture tube costs Dollars 2,600. This pricing policy should
create the opportunity for new American parts manufacturers to spring up and
for existing ones to expand, he says.
The Kodak case is now back in San Francisco's federal district court for a
trial on the facts; Kodak shows every sign of fighting it - in spite of the
perceived wisdom that if the case goes before a jury the plaintiffs will
win.
Mr Jim Hennefer, the attorney running the case for the independent service
companies, says he is knee-deep in documents requested by Kodak, while new
evidence of abuse by Kodak arrives daily. The next preliminary hearing is
set for December 17, when the district court judge will set a trial date for
autumn 1994.
Meanwhile, Mr Fine is pursuing a Dollars 600m class action suit on behalf of
CSEA against 34 of the world's biggest consumer electronics manufacturers.
CSEA alleges that the makers fail to compensate independent service
companies properly for doing their warranty work as required by state law.
He says he is close to agreeing settlement terms with some of the companies,
but last week was forced to file fresh class action damages suits against
Sony, Sharp, Toshiba and Sansui, which have shown no signs of settling.
In spite of these actions in California, the avalanche of litigation between
manufacturers and the US's 250,000 independent service providers predicted
by Justice Scalia in the wake of the Kodak ruling, has yet to materialise.
Some lawyers say the impact of the Kodak decision may be narrower than first
thought. Kodak's policy was aggressive and its terms stringent. It may yet
turn out to be a one-off.
'The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers' Association filed a brief in support of
Kodak. It hoped Kodak would win, because if Kodak's policy was ruled OK then
theirs definitely would be. But just because Kodak lost doesn't mean the car
manufacturers' policy on after-sale service and parts violates antitrust
law,' says Mr Englert.
There is good news for antitrust lawyers too. Last week the Supreme Court
accepted for review a predatory pricing case in the tobacco industry from
the 4th Circuit Court of Appeal in Richmond, Virginia. That will provide an
early opportunity for the justices to make it clear whether or not they have
really abandoned the Chicago School approach to competition issues.

The Court of Appeal's judgment last week in the Camelford Water Pollution
case marks the first major restatement of the English law on exemplary, or
punitive, damages for 20 years, according to City solicitors Herbert Smith.
Rejecting a claim for punitive damages by 180 people who suffered
side-effects from drinking contaminated water at Camelford, Cornwall in July
1988, the Appeal Court made it clear that punitive damages cannot be awarded
in claims of negligence, breach of statutory duty or public nuisance.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Legal Briefs: European Court to rule over Mediobanca
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The first direct challenge to the European Commission over the EC Merger
Regulation has reached the European Court. The Commission ruled in December
1991 that a rise in Mediobanca's shareholding in Assicurazioni Generali from
5.98 per cent to 12.84 per cent did not fall foul of the Regulation because
it did not enable Mediobanca, alone or with others, to exercise control over
AG. The ruling mentioned an agreement between Mediobanca and Euralux, the
second largest shareholder in AG, not to sell their shares to anyone else,
but said there was no agreement for any joint exercise of voting power. This
was challenged by three minority shareholders who say there was a secret
agreement between AG, Mediobanca and Lazard Freres, Euralux's owners, to
enable Mediobanca and Euralux to gain joint control over AG, and that the
Commission was misled about the agreement and Mediobanca's control. The
minority shareholders have appealed against the Commission's refusal to
re-open proceedings, questioning its understanding of the concept of
'control' in article 3 of the Regulation.

FT  24 NOV 92 / People: Thomson foundation grows in Wales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is 30 years since Roy Thomson (later Lord Thomson of Fleet) set up the
Thomson Foundation with the aim of furthering the training of print and
broadcast journalists in underdeveloped countries. 'The general belief was
that in 20 years we would be out of business,' says current director Norman
Cattanach; 'Instead, the mandate keeps growing.' As a reflection of its
expanded activities, the foundation has just appointed another three
trustees, in addition to the current six.
The organisation, which for the past three and a half years has been based
in Cardiff, has secured the services of Lord Howe, who, as well as having
been foreign secretary between 1983 and 1989, was born in Port Talbot.
Scots-born Cattanach is particularly keen on the, initially controversial,
Welsh connections of the enterprise; he points out how 'it is very handy to
have people who do not believe that one language, English, is the be-all and
end-all. We are also more attuned to the aspirations of small countries
here.'
John Tusa, who steps down after six years as managing director of the BBC
World Service, also becomes a trustee, as does Lady Luce, who is deputy
chairman of the English-Speaking Union and is married to former arts
minister Sir Richard Luce. Of the latter, Cattanach explains: 'She is not an
expert in the media; it will be a very good thing to have someone who can
look on dispassionately.' They join a group of trustees drawn from the
diplomatic service and the media, including Lord Campbell of Croy and Lord
Thomson of Monifieth.
Recent projects of the foundation, which draws its income partly from Roy
Thomson's original grant, and partly from the British Council, the Foreign
Office and others, range from bringing television to Tanzania, to training
30 (out of 3,000) producers of China Central TV. Vietnam features high on
next year's agenda, with plans among other things to help develop the
two-year-old English newspaper Vietnam News.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LEP Group, the heavily-indebted freight forwarding and security concern, has
made board changes intended to assist David James, the company doctor who
has been advising the group since March and became chairman and chief
executive in August.
John East, who has been with Lep since 1988, has resigned as finance
director. He will receive Pounds 85,000 in compensation plus consultancy
fees of more than Pounds 100,000 for helping James to investigate last
year's heavy losses and litigation involving ADT, the security group which
has written off Pounds 65m on its investment in Lep, and John Read, who
resigned as Lep's chairman last November.
Mike Kirkman has resigned as human resources director and will receive
compensation of Pounds 220,000. He joined the group in June last year and
was heavily involved in negotiating this summer's rescue package, which
involved 25 banks swapping debt for equity in the restructured company.
They are being replaced by Digby Davies, 34, and Ronald Series, 41, two
South African-trained chartered accountants who have already worked with
James on the Lep reconstruction, and will take executive responsibility for
the group's accounting, financial, administrative and treasury functions.
East and Kirkman have also resigned as directors of Lassen Trustees, which
runs Lep's pension fund. East was one of the directors of Lassen last year
when it agreed to buy a property from Lep for Pounds 12.5m, boosting Lep's
interim results. The property was subsequently valued at Pounds 8.5m,
causing a shortfall in the pension fund.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Technology: China sets sights on electronics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China is planning an ambitious effort to modernise and expand its
electronics industry, senior Chinese government and industry officials said
on a recent trade mission to the US.
Currently, China is roughly 10 to 15 years behind the most advanced
semiconductor production technology, they said. The country's production of
computers is limited and the bulk of its electronics industry is focused on
low-end consumer electronics products.
However, by 2000, China aims to achieve volume production of semiconductor
chips with submicron feature sizes, equivalent to today's most advanced
technology.
The goal of the Chinese government is to quadruple production of personal
computers by 1995, as well as to expand greatly the manufacture of
telephones, telephone switchgear and consumer electronics products.
The Chinese visitors told US semiconductor production equipment
manufacturers that they plan to purchase up to Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn)
worth of equipment to expand chip production over the next two years. They
made it clear that they strongly favour US suppliers over their Japanese
competitors, according to US industry officials.
These sales, if they materialise, would represent a big boost for US
semiconductor equipment producers, whose 1992 sales total approximately
Dollars 5.5bn, according to VLSI Research, a market research group.
'In order to catch up to the pace of the world electronics industry as soon
as possible, the Chinese government aims to accelerate industry
development,' Yu Zhongyu, chief engineer for the Ministry of Machinery and
Electronics Industry, told US industry executives at a meeting organised by
Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (Semi), an international
trade group.
By 1995, China aims to fulfil 40 per cent of its semiconductor requirements
domestically, up from a current level of about 20 per cent today, he said.
It projects the total value of electronics products to be worth Yuan
130bn-150n (Pounds 15bn-Pounds 17bn) by then.
Until June 1991, Cocom export restrictions limited sales of western and
Japanese electronics products to China. With the liberalisation of export
controls, trade is rapidly increasing.
In addition to purchasing semiconductor production equipment and materials
from western suppliers, the burgeoning Chinese semiconductor industry is
seeking co-operative agreements with US companies, Zhongyu said.
'We welcome Semi members to co-operate with China in any form of technology
transfer - collaboration in production, joint ventures or foreign-owned
ventures.' Semi is planning to stage a first-of-its-kind semiconductor
production and materials trade show in Shanghai in October 1993.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Technology: Crossed lines on European IT networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many British companies know all too well that in these days of prolonged UK
recession and increasingly global markets, their future lies in mainland
Europe. The export opportunities opened up by sterling's devaluation have
reinforced this perception.
The trouble is that companies do not always know the best way to go about
building up business abroad. They are aware of the customers they want to
attract or the sectors they wish to penetrate. They may also have a fair
idea of the sort of electronic systems they need.
But this is where their planning often starts to fall down, according to a
study carried out among industrial, financial, service and consumer
companies for 3Com (UK), part of California-based 3Com, which makes computer
equipment. It concluded that there is a worrying lack of agreement between
managers at different levels as to what their companies really need.
For instance, while main board directors tend to favour systems of strategic
value, such as those linking different business functions like manufacturing
and sales, managers responsible for implementing European networks often
take a narrower view, wanting facilities like electronic mail. Only 35 per
cent of directors see the latter as being important for European growth
compared with 52 per cent of network managers.
Also, there is a tendency to be over-ambitious. Nearly half of directors
expect their international data communications to increase by over 40 per
cent in the next 12 months, as do about a third of network managers.
Astonishingly, nearly 20 per cent of those polled expect growth to exceed
100 per cent.
This, says Tom Plimmer, 3Com's UK managing director, 'could lead to
complexity outgrowing capability'. The study, carried out by Business
Marketing Services with 50 directors responsible for strategy and 100
network managers, also revealed other worrying examples of inconsistency.
As many as 81 per cent of network managers believe they derive value for
money on their European networks; only 48 per cent of directors think so.
Moreover, less than a quarter of the companies have strategic networking
plans to support their growth. Hardly flattering to the network managers was
the fact that directors seem 'barely aware of their existence'.
There is also disturbing news for airline and hotel operators. More than 40
per cent of directors would consider video conferences as an alternative to
business travel, on which UK companies now spend Pounds 22bn a year.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Technology: Something to shout about - Computers that
recognise human speech are the talk of the town
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For at least two decades, the computers of science fiction novels and films
have obeyed spoken commands. Now, with the development of advanced automatic
speech recognition technology, reality is beginning to catch up with
imagination.
In the US and Italy, hospital radiologists are experimenting with a computer
that can directly transcribe their comments as they examine x-ray images.
Some New York stockbrokers are trying out computers that can respond to
their verbal buy and sell orders.
At one of the leading US newspapers, writers who have become disabled by
repetitive strain injuries that limit their use of a computer keyboard are
dictating their reports to computers that can transform speech directly into
text.
All are pilot customers for a new range of products unveiled last week by
International Business Machines which demonstrates significant strides in
the ability of computers to decipher the frequently ambiguous mutterings of
human speech.
Until now, speech recognition has been more of a curiosity than a practical
means of communicating with a computer. Pioneers of computer speech input
have focused upon the needs of disabled computer users with systems that are
trained to 'understand' an individual's speech, or upon narrowly defined
applications that require a limited vocabulary.
Yet the vast potential of speech recognition to provide a more 'natural'
link between man and machine is spurring development efforts throughout the
computer industry.
For people whose jobs keep their hands full - dentists, bank clerks,
emergency room doctors, pilots or police car drivers, for example - speech
recognition could provide a way to make use of computers as they work.
'Speech is the most natural and efficient means of communications,' says
James Cannavino, IBM vice president and general manager of personal systems.
'Enabling computers to accept and compute the spoken word can mean
tremendous gains in productivity for existing customers and can open up the
world of computing to a whole new population of users.'
Advances in the complex mathematical algorithms needed to analyse speech and
guess at the true meaning of the spoken word have contributed to the latest
generation of speech recognition products.
The availability of powerful microprocessors and signal processor chips at
relatively low cost has brought speech processing to the desktop computer.
Noise-cancelling microphones that screen out background noise are also
critical to making speech processing systems practical in the workplace.
Still, key challenges remain. These are: the variations between the way
different people pronounce the same words; a wide vocabulary; and the
tendency of speakers to blend one word into the next in continuous speech.
IBM's new offerings reflect compromises between these challenges.
IBM's 'Speech Server' is a voice dictation system that must be trained to
recognise the voices of individual users. It also requires users to talk in
a clipped fashion, pausing between each word.
However, the system provides the most accurate speech recognition available,
IBM claims. Its vocabulary of 20,000 words is larger than any existing
system and it can be customised to accept new words by individual users. The
program accepts dictation at up to 70 words per minute - faster than most
computer users can type.
Speech Server is aimed at businesses that generate large volumes of
documents that must be transcribed with great accuracy. As text is dictated
into a headset or lapel microphone, the program is trained to accept the
speaker's accent. It analyses the speaker's voice and displays the speech in
text.
A statistical language model sorts out homonyms such as two, to, or too, and
recognises frequently used word patterns such as President George Bush.
If the program does not recognise a new word - a name, for example - it will
display a few guesses, enabling the user to 'point and click' with a mouse,
or type in a new word on the keyboard.
Speech Server is designed to run on an IBM RS/6000 workstation with up to
eight users on a local area network. The program costs Dollars 6,950 (Pounds
4,600), plus Dollars 695 per user for networked systems. It requires a
special processor circuit board costing Dollars 1,900.
For continuous speech applications, IBM is taking a different tack. Its
Continuous Speech program, developed in conjunction with Carnegie-Mellon
University, is designed to enable software developers to incorporate speech
recognition in existing or new applications products. Continuous Speech
accepts any voice and is expected to find use in a broad range of
applications with a relatively limited vocabulary of up to 1,000 words.
Systems that allow anyone to say anything to a computer at a normal rate of
speech are still on the drawing board. IBM's new offerings do not quite live
up to the capabilities of Hal, the infamous computer in the science-fiction
classic 2001: A Space Odyssey, but they do suggest that by the turn of the
century we may indeed be regularly talking - and listening - to computers.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Orchestrating an orderly
exit for the owners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate finance executives in Manchester have started playing tunes on a
new instrument. It is called the Obo and Barclays Bank has been sufficiently
intrigued to start sending groups of managers to hear what is uttering
forth.
Obo is an acronym for a financial instrument, which the inventor, James Dow
of KPMG Peat Marwick, calls an 'Owner Buy Out'. For good measure, his
partner Malcolm Edge has ensured that any taxophonic qualities can be
pleasantly muted.
It is designed to allow a venture capital fund or suchlike to buy 20 or 30
per cent of a good, but highly geared, small- or medium-sized business so it
can fight on through the recession, probably pay off the bank, and live to
sell itself or float another day.
It hardly sounds revolutionary but Dow and Edge claim there has never been
anything quite like it before. They say it offers businesses, investing
institutions and banks a counter-recessionary strategy for the mutual
benefit of all.
Many good companies are tight against borrowing limits and are already
overgeared. Banks are refusing to lend more and know that opportunities to
recover lendings via receivership are poor, with prices depressed.
Meanwhile venture capital funds and other equity financiers are paralysed by
poor deal flow and illiquidity and are desperate to find some low-risk
equity investment.
The Obo theory is to find temporarily troubled, but fundamentally sound,
companies which, if they can get through the recession, have good prospects
of profit growth.
They have a proven management, but will have probably run out of the cash
reserves they felt sure would see them through the recession. These are
among the companies now beginning to fail - for no other reason than that
the recession has proved unreasonably long for their pockets.
The aim would be to sell or float a business in three or four years' time
when the trade sales and stock markets should be recovering. By then profits
should also be improving, together with prices.
Are these assumptions about recovery reasonable? Dow says price to earnings
ratios must recover - private company p/e ratios have been falling behind
the FT500 average now for four years and are currently 40 per cent adrift.
This discount should wither, he says, when recession eventually eases and
with it the pressure on margins and profits.
The value to the banks of the whole process would be to lessen their own
risks and this has prompted Barclays to send groups of managers, half a
dozen at a time, to listen to Dow and Edge. Similar seminars are planned
with other clearers.
Investing institutions, meanwhile, have a chance to take a stake in a proven
enterprise with a fair chance of exit and reasonable dividends in prospect.
But will business owners wear it? Some may have no choice if the alternative
is closure, but Edge claims to have devised a very tempting tax arrangement
to induce them. This involves the owner taking a scrip dividend equal to the
value of the investing institution's stake.
This would then be taxed as income, rather than a capital gain, and use made
of tax credits so that the net rate emerges as 20 per cent, rather the 40
per cent that would apply via the capital gains route.
If everything then worked to plan, the business could float, or sell, after
a few years with higher earnings and, hopefully, for one or two more times
earnings than would be possible now.
The investor would have a running yield plus a final capital receipt, while
the company owner would have two bites from selling and should make more
money.
Dow and Edge say there is real interest, with one deal already in the
pipeline.
There are a lot of assumptions, plus real faith that recession cannot go on
forever. The risk of their being wrong, they say, is worth taking.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Management (The Growing Business): A Spaniard in the works -
A fresh start abroad is the dream of many entrepreneurs. Lorraine Bacchus
describes the bureaucracy encountered by an expatriate horticulturist in
Andalusia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LORRAINE BACCHUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years ago, Scotsman Callum Christie decided that southern Spain would
provide the ideal climate for a new horticulture venture. Subsequent events
have proved him right but Spanish bureaucracy has at times left him
wondering why he is putting himself through so much pain.
'It's the time wasted on endless legal formalities that is so frustrating,'
he says, 'together with the knowledge that as an outsider you're obviously
mainly dealing with people who know the ropes better than you, can get a
better deal for themselves and can be more competitive. As an outsider it
takes a long time to acquire that necessary insider network.'
Christie has two sides to his horticultural business, Mundo Verde, both in
Andalusia. The nurseries in San Martin del Tesorillo, near the Costa del
Sol, concentrate on indoor ornamental plants with the Schefflera Bola being
the principal seller he has developed.
On the plains near the Sierra Nevada, with Granada an hour away, his farm is
entirely devoted to strawberry runners, produced mostly for sale to the
growers in the Huelva region whose big export markets are Britain and
Germany.
In total he owns 12 hectares, yet has found it difficult to borrow money
against the land and its fixed assets
'I'm pretty sure I would have managed to raise money in Britain against this
security but I think the banking system here is very conservative and
expensive. The base rate is 15 per cent, with loans costing anything over 17
per cent,' says Christie.
However, his main cashflow problems are caused by the endemic use in Spain
of a kind of promissory note called a letra de cambio. They constitute an
acceptance of the goods concerned and a promise to pay.
They can be dated for any time ahead and are so widely used that in cases
where the issuer's creditworthiness is known, the bank will lend against the
security of the letra in advance of the settlement date.
However, if there are insufficient funds when the letra is finally
presented, it will be returned to the drawer with costs and his own bank
will then recoup the loan. If the issuer refuses to pay up, the only
recourse is through the courts.
'All this can take months,' says Christie, 'and is further complicated by
the fact that if the issuer of the letra lives in a different province, you
have to instruct your lawyer to appoint another lawyer based in the relevant
district to act for you. You can't pursue someone in legal terms from
outside his province.'
Both lawyers have to be paid up front and, as with all debt chasing, there
is no guarantee of success.
Thirty per cent of Christie's business involves the use of letras de cambio
and he says he has never had so may bad debts. 'Obviously we have good
customers who pay promptly but there is a substantial number who use every
dodge to avoid payment.'
Part of the job of debt collecting falls to Christie's 23-year-old son CJ
(they share the same Christian name and so initials avoid confusion) who
joined his father in Spain two years ago.
His Spanish is now so proficient that in Andalusia at least he is often
mistaken for a local. 'As my Spanish has got better, so the job has got
easier and more enjoyable because you can indulge in a bit of banter with
the customers as well as being firm when necessary. But I'm still a gringo
and so I'm sure I have to work harder to get an order and that I get messed
around a lot more than a Spaniard.'
CJ spends a lot of his working life on sales trips, driving all over Spain
and dealing with people in almost every region. This has given him a
valuable insight into the Spanish character
'I've never been in business in Britain so I can't make comparisons, but
here you can sometimes spend a hour talking about football, the sovereignty
of Gibraltar, the weather and so on before even broaching the subject of how
many plants they want. But I think that if I didn't spend the time doing
that, l would not get the orders. And anyway, it is fun.'
The horticulture business in Spain can be as precarious as anywhere. Just
last year, the Christies lost all their strawberry runner harvest because of
unseasonal rain and flooding.
Christie thinks a more secure business might be that of a notary. 'It's
incredible to think how much money they must earn just because of the amount
of red-tape in Spain.
'With company accounts, for example, you have to sign them in front of a
notary. You have to pay him for this privilege as well as perhaps waiting a
hour to see him and another hour or so driving to his office,' says
Christie.
'You also have to appear in front of a notary to obtain the title deeds for
your property and to obtain the authority to sign documents on behalf of
your own company. Each time you have to pay him just for witnessing your
signature. And all this is on top of your lawyer's fees,' he says.
The authority to sign company documents is known as a poder and in business
in Spain you need to use it a lot - even to collect a refund.
'You have to go in person to the nearest tax office - in my case a two-hour
drive away - with your poder and passport to prove that you are who you
claim to be and that you are empowered to receive money on behalf of the
company,' explains Christie.
A corredor comercial, similar to a notary, has to be used to witness
signatures when a bank loan has been negotiated. For this, the official
receives a tenth of 1 per cent of the agreed loan which can be a
considerable amount.
'I can only assume all this signature witnessing is either because there's a
lot of fraud in Spain or because, in case of problems, nobody wants to be
where the buck stops,' says Christie.
For the Christies, the main pleasure of being in business in Spain has come
from the Spanish workers they employ. They describe their small team as not
only extremely industrious but also loyal and interested in the company.
'These five years have certainly been a learning experience and at certain
levels it has been very enjoyable. I can't say though whether I would embark
on the project with the benefit of hindsight,' says Christie.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Timetable slows for BR sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government appeared to be paving the way yesterday for a possible
slowdown in the timetable for its controversial plans to privatise British
Rail.
Transport ministers suggested that the first passenger service franchises,
originally intended to come into operation in April 1994, might now be
delayed for months.
One reason for the government's caution is the legislative timetable which
has prevented the government from introducing the rail privatisation bill
this month. It will now have to wait until early in the new year.
Ministers recognise that immense complexities with privatisation must be
resolved before the private sector can be convinced that passenger service
franchising offers an attractive opportunity.
Under pressure in the Commons yesterday on the timing of rail privatisation,
as Labour claimed the timetable was 'in tatters', Mr Roger Freeman, the
transport minister, admitted that the main privatisation bill was 'dependent
on early passage of the paving bill'.
The bill paving the way for privatisation will be considered in the House of
Lords next week, but is unlikely to be approved finally by parliament until
January.
Until recently, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, had been
indicating that he hoped the main bill would have completed its
parliamentary passage by next summer.
In order to give an impression of momentum and press ahead where possible,
however, the government is planning to designate five railway lines as pilot
franchises in the new year in an attempt to give the private sector an idea
of how they might work under independent operation.
Services on the lines will continue to be run by BR, but as self-contained
'ghost' franchises with separate profit-and-loss accounts. Likely candidates
include the London Tilbury &amp; Southend Line and Chiltern Line services from
London Marylebone.
Mr MacGregor insisted yesterday that BR's announcement of the loss of 5,000
jobs over the next four months was a 'commercial decision' and not connected
either to the government's plans to privatise the railway or to the
public-spending settlement in the Autumn Statement.
BR warned last week of further job cuts, putting part of the blame on the
'tight' financial settlement imposed on it by the government.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine hopeful on trade deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE is likely to acquiesce to a wider agreement further liberalising
world trade although it objects to the deal reached by the European
Community and the US on subsidised food exports, Mr Michael Heseltine, the
trade and industry secretary, suggested in the Commons yesterday.
In an optimistic assessment of the prospects for concluding a fresh
agreement under Gatt (general agreement on tariffs and trade) he said: 'I
believe it is possible to complete the negotiations this year.'
Mr Heseltine maintained that, in the round, France stood to gain as much as
the other members of the EC from new trading opportunities likely to result
from world output increasing by perhaps Dollars 200bn (Pounds 131.5bn) a
year.
He cast doubt on whether a situation could arise in which the veto provided
by the EC's so-called Luxembourg compromise would be available to France.
Mr Heseltine confirmed that it was for the European Commission, headed by Mr
Jacques Delors, to conduct any discussions within the EC on whether it had
held to its negotiating remit in agreeing to new limits on agricultural
production.
He emphasised that the Commission believed it had discharged its remit, and
insisted: 'It is not for individual countries within the Community to
frustrate that position.'
Mr Paul Channon, Tory MP for Southend West and a former trade secretary,
asked if a final agreement achieved through Gatt would be subject to
majority voting by the EC council of ministers. He also claimed that the
Luxembourg compromise was abolished in 1983.
Mr Heseltine replied that the European Commission was empowered to take up
negotiations with the Gatt authorities in Geneva.
If and when a satisfactory outcome was achieved, it would be for the council
of ministers to decide 'whether or not that agreement, taken in the round,
is acceptable'.
He added: 'It is much to be questioned whether the Luxembourg compromise
would be relevant in such circumstances.'
Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, emphasised that
France would be a net beneficiary of any new Gatt agreement.
French industry stood to gain more than the amount its farmers stood to
lose, and the French government should be urged not to base its judgment on
the single issue of farm subsidies.
Mr Heseltine told MPs concerned about the position of the textile industry
that it was anticipated that there would be some form of a 'carry-over
agreement' for the Multi-Fibre Arrangement due to expire at the end of the
year. A draft Gatt agreement envisaged a 10-year transitional period before
the MFA was phased out.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers aim to ease EC fine print
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government is considering how it might ease up on the fine print of
European Community directives, in spite of its drive during its presidency
of the Community to spread good enforcement practice on EC-wide law.
The foreign office is leading a discussion within Whitehall of ways to bring
greater flexibility into the UK's approach to its Community
responsibilities.
Until now, British anger at the relaxed view it sees some other member
states taking of implementing EC law has been intensified by the UK's own
record of conscientious enforcement.
It was British pressure that led to the inclusion in the Maastricht
agreement of provisions enabling the European Court of Justice to fine
member countries that fail to obey EC rules.
Such pressure also led to a declaration of the importance of each EC country
'fully and accurately' putting EC directives into national law within
specified deadlines.
British ministers emphasise that there is no question of a decision not to
enact EC provisions, but suggest there is a strong case for not being so
punctilious in setting out the details of how a particular directive can be
met and how its implementation can be monitored and inspected.
The question of 'over-implementation' is especially acute where
responsibility for ensuring compliance with the law lies with local
authorities.
Central government's attention to detail in devising guidance for local
councils in, for example, areas such as environmental health, can lead to
extra bureaucracy both for the council and for the businesses they have to
regulate.
The move would sit well with the government's present emphasis on
deregulation to reduce the burdens on business, and might easily form the
Foreign Office's main contribution to the initiative, since there is little
legislation for which it is directly responsible.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Brooke defends pledge of cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, strongly defended the decision
to use taxpayers' money to meet the multi-million-pound bill for repairing
fire damaged Windsor castle in the Commons yesterday.
He stressed: 'Windsor Castle is the property of the state, and it is the
government's responsibility to ensure that resources are provided to
maintain it in a manner commensurate with its status, and its role on
occasions of state'.
Ms Ann Clwyd, the shadow heritage secretary, said there was 'legitimate
public concern that the total cost of repair should not be paid exclusively
by the taxpayer'.
In more aggressive tones, and to cheers from some of his Labour colleagues,
Mr Bill Michie, MP for the Heeley division of Sheffield, contrasted the
government's readiness to find up to Pounds 60m to meet the cost of
repairing Windsor Castle with its attitude to the homeless sleeping in
'cardboard cities'.
Mr Brooke refused to 'lend credence' to the Pounds 60m figure in advance of
properly prepared estimates, but acknowledged that whatever the total
finally proved to be it was unlikely to be 'absorbable' within his
department's budget.
He envisaged that the cost would be spread over a number of years, and that
he would be involved in negotiations with Mr Michael Portillo, the chief
secretary to the Treasury.
Mr Brooke joined with Sir Anthony Grant (C Cambridgeshire South West) in
condemning the attitude of Labour critics of the cost as 'mean and
Pecksniffian'.
Mr Alex Salmond (SNP Banff and Buchan) argued that if the taxpayer had to
meet the bill it strengthened the case for requiring the Royal family to pay
taxes in the same way as everyone else.
Mr Brooke answered that taxation was a matter for Mr Normam Lamont, the
chancellor of the exchequer.
The minister emphasised that responsibility for the fabric of Windsor Castle
had rested with the government since 1831, while the contents, including the
royal collection, were the responsibility of the Queen.
Meanwhile, local fire chiefs said the cause of the fire was not yet known,
despite claims it had been started by a halogen lamp igniting inflammable
fluid.
Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service said: 'The brigade does not yet know
what the cause is. The investigation is continuing.'
The halogen lamp theory has puzzled some picture experts, who claim that if
only the most basic safety rules were being followed, there should have been
no prospect of the fire beginning in such a way.
Other possible causes being investigated include an electrical fault - the
part of the castle where the fire started was being rewired - a discarded
cigarette, or hot bitumen dropped on the chapel roof.

ONLY the inescapable core of government should remain in the public sector,
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday,
Alison Smith writes.
Mr Dorrell said that should be the approach to privatisation schemes for the
future. He also urged businesses to propose schemes for co-operation between
the private and public sectors. The key question in considering joint
capital projects was, he said, whether the private sector was genuinely
assuming risk.
Addressing the Centre for Policy Studies, the rightwing think tank, he said
that in looking at possible privatisations, the question was no longer 'what
can we sell?' but 'what must we keep?'
Even after the privatisation of British Rail, British Coal and London buses,
the government would still own more than Pounds 100bn worth of tangible
assets, while local government owned a further Pounds 200bn.
'Improvement of the management of these assets depends upon breaking down
traditional barriers which have divided public-sector activity from the
private sector.'

FT  24 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory MPs form pro-Europe group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRO-EUROPEAN Tory MPs last night launched the 'Positive Europeans' group
within the party and pledged to push for the the Commons stages of the
Maastricht treaty to be finished by May - regardless of the date of the
second Danish referendum.
The latest faction in the continuing debate over Europe claimed a membership
of more than 75 backbenchers, out of a total of about 240 Conservative MPs,
excluding members of the government
Mr Ray Whitney, the Tory MP for Wycombe, said that the Euro-sceptic
Conservatives 'have so far attracted disproportionate attention, given that
they are a small minority within the party'. He added: 'We intend to correct
this.'
After Euro-sceptic Tory MPs and the Labour party brought the government to
the brink of defeat earlier this month, Maastricht will return to the
Commons next week for the beginning of its committee stage. Little headway
is expected before MPs rise for the Christmas recess.
Ministers say the 'third reading' - the last of the Commons stages of the
bill before it goes to the House of Lords - will be completed by May, about
the time they expect the second Danish referendum on Maastricht.
The government has been deliberately vague, in order to appease the
Euro-sceptics, about what happens if the Danish poll is postponned.
The Positive Europeans might have the effect of making the government's
balancing act more difficult.
Mr Whitney promised: 'We shall be urging the government to proceed with the
committee stage of the Maastricht bill with a strict timetable resulting in
the third reading by May.' He said the group would take an active role
'during the committee stage of the bill in the Commons and in the public
debate outside'.
Last night the committee elected Mr Ralph Howell (C Norfolk North) and Mr
Ian Taylor (C Esher) as vice-chairmen, and Ms Jacqui Lait (C Hastings and
Rye) and Mr Stephen Milligan (C Eastleigh) as secretaries.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Historic building experts to plan
work - Commons row over liability for repair costs fo up to Pounds 60m after
Windsor Castle fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HISTORIC-building and art experts are to meet shortly to make preliminary
plans for the restoration of the castle's damaged state apartments. They are
expected to report within a month.
The extent of the damage will possibly take weeks to establish, as the
structure has to be inspected, and rescued and lost pictures and furnishings
checked against the castle's inventory.
First priority will be to put a temporary roof over the burnt-out sections
to keep out rain, dampness and frost that could further affect masonry and
timbers weakened by the fire and the thousands of gallons of water pumped on
the blaze.
A number of organisations will be involved, including the National Heritage
Department, which will be responsible for paying for repairs to the
structure; English Heritage as the historical and technical experts; and the
royal household as occupiers.
According to English Heritage, which will play a big role in advising on the
form restoration should take, the building should be allowed to dry
naturally rather than by using industrial heaters, which might harm
surviving timbers.
The most likely judgment is that the state apartments should be returned to
the condition they were in before the fire, based on the wealth of archive
evidence available.
That will require a pool of skilled labour, particularly carpenters and
plasterers, either from specialist builders or individual craftsmen. Several
building companies specialise in historical restoration and retain teams of
craftsmen. One, Sussex-based James Longley, won the contract at Hampton
Court palace, damaged by fire in 1986, in open tender. English Heritage also
maintains teams of specialists.
Sir Geoffrey de Bellaigue, director of the royal collection, has reported to
the Queen that the greatest damage was to the fabric of the castle.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Customers pay dearly despite a rainy season: Bronwen Maddox
analyses water company plans for meters and tackling leaks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATER companies have never found it easy to persuade their customers that
water is scarce and expensive, and the present rain cannot help.
In the past two weeks Anglian Water and Essex Water have announced
compulsory metering for some of their customers. Both hope to curb the
demand for water by charging for it.
Essex Water is adamant: 'This is nothing to do with drought. We have less
rainfall than the rest of the country, the population is rising, and the
stark fact is that Essex is running short of water.'
Metering proposals have been controversial because water bills for large
families may rise sharply.
Nevertheless Ofwat, the water industry regulator, has given its backing
because it is worried that if companies have to build expensive new
reservoirs and treatment plants, the costs might also push up bills.
For the same reason, Ofwat is urging all companies, including those outside
the dry south-east, to look harder at the leakage of expensively treated
water from their mains networks.
By the end of this month, it will publish a report on the cost of supplying
water to each region, including figures on how much water is lost. Past
estimates have suggested that a quarter of water is lost, as environmental
and consumer groups have not hesitated to point out.
Much of the water industry is questioning whether metering and leak-plugging
are worthwhile, given the huge costs.
Water companies in England and Wales already install meters for most
commercial customers and all new residential properties. According to
industry estimates, it might cost Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn to fit meters to
all older domestic properties in England and Wales.
Mr Trevor Newton, group managing director of Yorkshire Water, says that
metering 'would mean spending the equivalent of a full year's capital
expenditure to upset two thirds of our customers - would you do it?'
Most of Yorkshire's customers live in flats or houses with rateable values -
the present basis for setting water bills - less than the average for the
region, so metering would probably lead to higher bills.
Mr Mike Rothery of Thames Water said: 'The industry is sceptical that
metering would actually reduce demand.' Ten small metering trials organised
by the Department of the Environment appear to have indicated falls in
demand of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent.
Mr John Browning, managing director of Bristol Water, is not convinced that
the savings last. 'At first people are very conscious of the meter, but
after a bit they seem to go back to their old habits,' he said.
Many water companies argue similarly that the benefits of plugging leaks may
be outweighed by the costs. Many companies argue that in regions where water
needs relatively little treatment, it may not be worth identifying all leaks
if the water simply returns to the water table.
In Mr Browning's view, the extent of leakage has also been overestimated. If
leakages on the customer's side of the wall are excluded, typical figures
for the industry might be as low as 6 per cent to 12 per cent.
It is hard to get accurate overall figures, though, because the companies
make very different assumptions when calculating leakage.
But by bringing the issue into focus, even if compulsory metering remains
largely confined to the south-east, companies may be encouraged to gather
better information on where water goes and why people use it.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Controls on travel cover meet attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING STANDARDS off-icers, the travel industry and Labour launched an
immediate attack on package-travel regulations laid before parliament
yesterday.
Trading standards officers said they would be able to check that travel
companies had taken out insurance, as required by the regulations, but would
not be able to say whether the cover was sufficient to protect consumers.
The proposed regulations give travel companies three ways to ensure that
customers are protected against corporate collapse. Companies can be bonded
to an approved trade body, such as the Association of British Travel Agents
(Abta), for a percentage of turnover; they can insure against insolvency on
behalf of their customers; or they can hold pre-payments on trust.
Companies operating outside approved trade bodies will be monitored by
trading standards officers.
Baroness Denton, consumer affairs minister, said the regulations aimed to
protect package travellers 'without making the cost of holidays prohibitive
by imposing an unfair burden on the smaller operators'.
The Institute of Trading Standards Administration said: 'We're happy to go
along to see whether a company is covered or not. But it's not our job to
find out whether that cover is adequate. We believe that can only be done in
detail by accountants and actuaries.'
It said trading standards officers would have preferred a scheme under which
all travel companies would have to be licensed.
Abta said the government's failure to set up a central licensing authority
'will result in company failures next year, with red faces in Whitehall and
Westminster'.

FT  24 NOV 92 / 3i clients form club to protect interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS ABOUT the impact of the planned flotation of 3i, the investment
capital group owned by the Bank of England and the clearing banks, have
prompted the setting up of a club to represent the interests of companies in
which 3i has a stake.
The club, to be formed on Friday, is intended to ensure that 3i's commitment
to long-term investment is not sacrificed to 'City short-termism' after
flotation.
The proposed aims for the club include representation on the 3i board; to
ensure the views of investee companies are heard; and the purchase of shares
at a discount when the group is floated. 3i confirmed that it intended to
float the group but that plans to do so this year had been delayed because
of the recession.
The plan to form a 3i Client Communication Club, 3i/3c, has been formulated
by Mr John Garrod, the chairman, managing director and founder of Rite-Vent,
a Tyne and Wear engineering company in which 3i holds a 22 per cent stake.
Mr Garrod said: 'The demand of the City for dividends could put considerable
pressure on 3i to force the pace with their client companies, which might
not be in the companies' interest.'
Of the 1,000 companies Mr Garrod has contacted, 250 have responded, and most
support the club proposal.
At present, 3i has no formal representational structure for companies in its
portfolio.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Hong Kong TV maker to set up Tyneside plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HONG KONG-based Kong Wah consumer electronic and electrical products
group has chosen south Tyneside for its first European plant.
The company said yesterday that the Pounds 10m project would eventually
produce 1,000 wide-screen and digital stereo televisions a day for the
European market. It is to receive Pounds 3.25m in regional selective
assistance from the Department of Trade and Industry and will create 280
jobs.
The Redwood Group, Kong Wah's project manager and adviser, said the company
had decided on the project partly because it was concerned that European
Community quotas under which televisions made elsewhere can be imported
without tariff may be tightened.
This year, tariffs apply once colour television imports from non-Community
countries exceed 650,000 Ecus (Pounds 528,500) in total. The 1993 quota is
under negotiation in Brussels and there is to be a review next year of the
general scheme of preference under which the quotas operate.
European sales account for half the Kong Wah group's turnover - about
Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in 1991.
The company, Hong Kong's largest television manufacturer, will start
production in September in a factory to be built in South Shields on land
reclaimed at a cost of almost Pounds 1m by the Tyne and Wear Development
Corporation. The company has started discussions on the UK sourcing of
components.
The project, for which other European locations, particularly France,
competed, qualifies for a European Coal and Steel Community loan. Kong Wah
is investing Pounds 3.25m and the TWDC is providing a Pounds 500,000 grant.
The news is a boost to south Tyneside, where the 18 per cent unemployment
rate is the highest of any English travel-to-work area.
Mr Lam Chung Kui, Kong Wah's chairman, said the north-east was recommended
by companies already there.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Cocaine worth Pounds 160m seized in raid on ship
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE AND Customs seized the biggest single haul of cocaine in the UK in an
armed swoop as the drugs were being unloaded from an oil rig support ship
yesterday.
The haul, weighing just over a tonne with an estimated street value of
Pounds 160m, was brought into a wharf at Woolwich Reach, London, aboard the
Panamanian-registered vessel Fox Trot Five.
It brought cocaine seizures so far this year to about 2.7 tonnes - more than
the total for all of last year, when 1.061 tonnes, worth Pounds 138.4m, was
intercepted.
Scotland Yard said the operation, codenamed Emerge, followed months of
intensive intelligence gathering and surveillance. A police officer
accidentally fired a shot during the raid but no one was injured. A number
of people were arrested by officers from the London-based No 9 Regional
Crime Squad and Customs.
An eye-witness said Fox Trot Five was boarded by about two dozen officers
armed with machine guns and wearing balaclavas.
The previous record seizure was in July, when Customs investigators seized
935kg of cocaine hidden in lead ingots.
Customs said: 'The amount of cocaine being seized is constantly spiralling.
We are delighted to have been able to stop this latest amount reaching the
streets.'

FT  24 NOV 92 / SE chief urges greater powers for regulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR ANDREW Hugh Smith, chairman of the London Stock Exchange, last night
called for greater powers of enforcement for UK regulators.
In a speech to the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants, Sir Andrew
went further than in previous criticisms of the regulatory system,
suggesting that regulation could not be effective 'without statutory power
to interrogate, to demand documents and records and perhaps to demand
answers'.
His views on the shape that regulatory reform should take appear to tally
closely with those of Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and
Investments Board, who is engaged in a review of the SIB's regulatory role
commissioned by the Treasury.
Last month Mr Large said that he might ask the government for new powers to
mount civil litigation against alleged City wrongdoers, along the lines of
the powers held by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Sir Andrew, in yesterday's speech, backed such a plan: 'I believe that (the
SIB) should now receive the statutory powers necessary to provide a fully
effective investigatory capacity.'
He also called for a rationalisation of the rules governing London's
markets, complaining: 'We have too many detailed rules.'
He suggested that rules, framed from general principles, need to be tailored
to suit specific product areas, and advocated greater differentiation
between the requirements of wholesale and retail markets.
Sir Andrew argued for greater co-operation between national regulators,
whether statutory or self-regulatory bodies.
'In a multinational marketplace there will need to be a constant interchange
of information,' he said. 'If miscreants do not observe national boundaries,
then neither should the authorities.'
The London Stock Exchange spent Pounds 13.5m on developing Taurus, its
paperless settlement system, in the first half of its financial year -
taking the total spent so far to about Pounds 60m, Richard Waters writes.
In the period to the end of September, the exchange earned income of Pounds
94.5m, down from Pounds 100.5m in the corresponding period in 1991. At the
same time, operating costs rose from Pounds 76m. 6m to Pounds 82.5m.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Barclays staff protest at cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKING unions protested yesterday as Barclays Bank told staff that an
acceleration of its job-cutting efforts meant it could no longer guarantee
that all redundancies would be voluntary.
The Barclays Group Staff Union said it would 'not remain impassive' if there
were compulsory redundancies.
Barclays confirmed that it expected to lose 3,000 more jobs by the end of
1995 than its estimate last year of 15,000. It said it had already shed
9,000 staff through natural wastage and voluntary redundancy. Barclays told
the financial services union Bifu that yesterday's announcement may not be
the end of job losses. It said the 18,000 programme by 1995 was not a
ceiling - 'it could go higher'. Bifu has estimated that 27,000 banking jobs
were lost last year.
Barclays said it would continue to rely on voluntary schemes and cuts in
recruitment to reduce numbers, but said it 'realistically cannot guarantee
that the level of take-up will be sufficient to achieve the necessary
reductions'.
Mr Iain MacLean, assistant general secretary of the Barclays staff union,
said it was 'trying to persuade the board forcefully' that it should avoid
compulsory cuts.
Separately, Bifu said leaders of its TSB section had called for the
executive to approve a ballot for industrial action over the possibility of
compulsory redundancies among the planned 440 job losses.
The TSB's retail bank has already agreed redundancy terms with 80 senior
managers. It is trying to agree redundancy with 150 branch managers within
the next few months, and 120 computer and 80 clerical staff are also
affected.

THE delayed green paper on the BBC is expected to be published today. The

will be a presumption that the BBC's licence could continue in return for

The main area of controversy is likely to surround a suggestion that licence

Mr Chris Hopson, in a paper for the European Policy Forum think tank, said
that would be a Trojan horse for those who wanted to dismantle the

FT  24 NOV 92 / Agenda sets out bottom line / Review of the policy document
issued yesterday by the Auditing Practices Board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST significant policy document from the newly established Auditing
Practices Board is certainly not muted in its recommendations.
The 21-page document on the future development of auditing was whittled down
from a 60-page original based on about 60 submissions.
Mr Bill Morrison, the board's chairman, said yesterday: 'I started with a
blank sheet of paper, and it was the hardest task I have undertaken in a
lifetime of auditing.'
The document sets out an agenda for the board over the next few years. What
chance the issues it raises have of materialising successfully is open to
question.
The board is funded by the professional accountancy bodies, as was its
predecessor, the Auditing Standards Committee. Its broader membership,
including non-accountants, gives it a more independent feel.
Its document begins with a comprehensive summary of perceived difficulties
with the state of auditing, most notably concerns about lack of
independence, poor quality and gaps in scope.
It ends with eight 'enduring principles' for auditing: integrity,
independence, competence, rigour, accountability, judgment, communication
and providing value.
There is also an overall mission for the audit profession: 'To give
confidence in the integrity of corporate reporting by public and
private-sector entities, for the benefit of stakeholders and society as a
whole, by providing an external and objective view on the reports given by
directors of companies' activities, performance, viability and prospects;
and to contribute to improving standards of corporate governance and
behaviour.'
There is not always a perfect link between the different sections. For
example, it touches on the potential threat to the independence of an
accountancy firm conducting consulting or other work for an audit client. It
does not, however, discuss the risks when the auditor might have to
criticise work conducted by professional colleagues.
There is not much offered on ways to achieve aims, although the board
emphasises that it is still 'floating' ideas.
More fundamentally, there is little attempt to quantify the extra costs of
extending the scope of the services auditors are being expected to provide.
Much of the material in the document sounds familiar. It endorses findings
of other recent inquiries - such as the call for audit committees in the
Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance.
Mr John McFarlane, managing director of Citibank UK and chairman of the
board's working party, said the bulk of current auditing was good, but
criticised the accountancy profession for not responding to calls for reform
in the past.
His recommendations will be broadly welcomed. Above all, the call for legal
reform to divert some of the burden of responsibility away from auditors
will bring cheers from the accountancy firms.
That merely echoes proposals made in the Likierman report in 1988, which
still sit largely unimplemented on Whitehall desks.
Perhaps the most radical proposal is for greater emphasis on reasserting the
role of companies' shareholders, the auditors' true 'clients' in law.
Mr Donald Brydon of BZW Investment Management, another member of the working
party, said this was the first examination of the relationship between
shareholders and auditors.
As with legal reform, that throws the onus far beyond the remit of the
Auditing Practices Board and into an unpredictable environment that is far
more difficult to control.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Iran may be owed arms payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN MAY owe Iran Pounds 200m or more for payments made by the Shah's
regime in 1979 for Chieftain tanks, spares and other military supplies that
were embargoed after the revolution brought Ayatollah Khomeini to power.
Negotiations between the governments over the contracts are referred to in a
July 1990 government briefing document prepared when ministers were
considering relaxing the 1984 export guidelines that prohibited approval of
defence equipment exports to Iraq or Iran while they were at war.
The document - released during the Matrix Churchill trial - says dropping
the guidelines would be 'a very useful factor in the negotiations enabling
the further release of items the Iranians have already paid for and with the
possibility of at least limited resupply likely to affect Iranian
attitudes'.
The document says that if the negotiations with Iran 'go badly and the
Iranians force us to arbitration, it could cost us up to Pounds 200m or
more'.
The Iranian deal was handled almost entirely by International Military
Services, the government defence sales company. The company's shares are
vested with the Ministry of Defence but the MoD gives it almost autonomous
status. The MoD refers inquiries about IMS to the company, which does not
respond to press inquiries. The MoD confirmed talks were continuing and said
the matter was in IMS's hands.
Throughout the Iran-Iraq war IMS maintained an office in Tehran and another
in Amman in Jordan, which maintained close military co-operation with Iraq.
The Iranian Military Procurement Office in London stayed open until
September 1987 in spite of evidence that Iran was conducting a worldwide
arms buying network from there.
The office was opened in 1982 and worked actively until it was closed,
according to officials of the National Iranian Oil Company, whose building
the procurement office used.
Officials said contracts handled by the office between 1982 and 1987
included British-made military spare parts. Officials said the office's
activity was curtailed only in response to political pressure. 'The
government knew 100 per cent what was going on here,' said one.
In answer to a parliamentary question last week Mr Douglas Hogg, Foreign
Office minister, denied the government had given approval for the
procurement office to be reopened in the UK.

FT  24 NOV 92 / London Tube strike called off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAIL UNION leaders agreed to call off strike action on London's Tube network
yesterday, 12 hours before it was due to start.
Both sides claimed victory, but London Underground will now press ahead with
introducing flexible working practices and restructured pay scales, as the
RMT rail union, which represents 11,000 of the network's 21,000 workforce,
appeared to climb down over the planned overhaul of pay and conditions.
The action was called off after a special meeting of the RMT's left-leaning
ruling executive committee, which accepted a formula agreed between
management and union leaders during 25 hours of talks with the Acas
conciliation service at the weekend.
The RMT said it had secured important commitments from the company, although
it accepted that the management had not made concessions on the main changes
to pay and conditions. London Underground said its position had not shifted.
Under the plan, all 21,000 employees will switch to salaried status, with 30
per cent losing financially after three years and 70 per cent gaining
immediately. About 5,000 jobs will be shed in the next two to three years.
The link between promotion and seniority will end and some workers will have
to reapply for their jobs under new training schemes. Many allowances, such
as compensation for travelling time, have been consolidated.
In 1989, strike action by rail unions and some unofficial groups forced
London Underground to abandon a less ambitious plan to restructure pay and
introduce flexible working.
Paying tribute to Acas, Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT, said:
'London Underground claimed there was no place for Acas in the negotiations,
yet 24 hours later they were involved.'
He said the issue that provoked the dispute was the company's refusal to
continue talks. The union had been assured of further negotiations in
working parties.
London Underground said the working parties formed part of long-standing
plans to aid the change of working practices, and would discuss local
details only.
The company denied guaranteeing no compulsory redundancies but said it would
seek to avoid them. It would not jointly refer any issue relating to the
changes to Acas for binding arbitration, but would expedite any union
approach to Acas 'unilaterally' on a non-binding basis.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Trade figures point to further rise in deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VOLUME of imports is growing at a steeper rate than exports, according
to government figures released yesterday. They suggest that the
current-account deficit will widen further in coming months.
The Central Statistical Office said that seasonally adjusted volumes of
imports, excluding oil and erratic items such as gems and aircraft, rose in
the three months to the end of October by 1.5 per cent compared with the
previous three months. Export volumes minus the same items were flat over
the same period.
Last month import volumes as measured on that basis saw a 2.9 per cent
increase compared with the previous month, while export volumes rose 2.6 per
cent. Export and import volumes set new records last month.
On a value basis, the deficit on visible goods - all merchandise items
including oil - rose to Pounds 3.3bn in the three months to October 31. In
the the May-July period, the deficit was about Pounds 400m lower, at Pounds
2.9bn.
The visible deficit widened to Pounds 1.2bn last month from Pounds 991m in
September. Between the two months, imports increased in value by 5 per cent,
from Pounds 9.7m to Pounds 10.2bn. The value of exports rose 3.5 per cent,
from Pounds 8.7bn to Pounds 9.1bn.
Taking into account an assumed surplus on invisible trade - services,
interest payments and other financial transfers - of Pounds 100m in both
months, the current-account deficit last month worked out at Pounds 1.1bn
against Pounds 891m in September.
The sharpness of last month's rise in import values was partly due to the
effects of sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism in mid
September. Since then, the pound has lost about 13 per cent of its value on
a trade-weighted basis.
According to the CSO, import prices as measured by unit values increased by
3.4 per cent between September and October, on a non-seasonally adjusted
basis. Bearing in mind that about three fifths of imports are invoiced in
sterling, this suggests that about half the full effect of the devalued
pound may so far have worked its way through to import prices.
Leaving aside oil and erratic items, export volumes in the three months to
October were 4 per cent up on the same period last year. On the same basis,
import volumes were up 9 per cent.
Over that period and on the same three-monthly basis, imports of cars
measured by volume have increased by 20 per cent, general consumer goods by
17 per cent and food, drink and tobacco by 12 per cent. As measured on the
same year-on-year basis, exports of chemicals have increased by 9.5 per cent
while exports of manufactured intermediate goods such as industrial
components have seen a 6 per cent rise.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Cement maker cuts jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CASTLE CEMENT, Britain's second-largest cement company, announced yesterday
that it was cutting its manufacturing capacity by a tenth with the loss of
more than 100 jobs.
It is the second large British cement manufacturer in less than a week to
announce cuts.
Blue Circle, the country's biggest producer, announced on Thursday that it
was reducing its capacity by a sixth with the loss of 550 jobs, a fifth of
its workforce.
The companies blame the deep recession in the construction industry for the
fall in demand for cement, which they say is unlikely to rise to previous
levels even when the market recovers.
Castle, which is owned jointly by Aker, the Norwegian cement producer and
engineering company, and Euroc, the Swedish industrial group, is to reduce
manufacturing capacity by 320,000 tonnes a year by mothballing one of the
three kilns at its Ribblesdale works in North Yorkshire.
The closure of the kiln will involve the loss of 70 jobs. A further 38 jobs
are to go due to shift reductions at the company's Clyde works in Scotland
and at Ketton in Lincolnshire.
Before the latest cuts Castle employed 1,350 workers. Overall the group is
reducing its capacity from 3.2m tonnes to 2.9m tonnes, which represents a 25
per cent reduction in capacity since 1989.
The group has already closed its Pitstone works at Tring in Hertfordshire
and shut down two kilns at Padeswood in north Wales, with the loss of about
450 jobs.
Castle supplies about a quarter of all cement sold in Britain. Blue Circle
supplies about 45 per cent and Rugby about 20 per cent. Only a very small
amount of cement is imported by other suppliers.
Mr Leslie Hewitt, Castle's managing director, said the latest closures
reflected the greater strength of the group in the north, where it had most
of its surplus capacity. The closures would ensure a better balance in
production between the north and south.
Aker and Euroc said the kiln closure and redundancies would cost the group
NKr15m (Pounds 1.5m) this year but would generate net savings of NKr15m to
Nkr20m.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Engineers criticise DTI in blueprint for recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Engineering Employers' Federation urged the prime minister yesterday to
support its campaign for a long-term industrial strategy to bring about a
sustained recovery.
'We'd like a direct response from the prime minister,' said Mr Neil Johnson,
the federation's director-general, announcing a 'twin-track' industrial
strategy that combines immediate action to rectify the balance of payments
and continuous long-term development of technology and industry.
The federation's document reflects the industry's disappointment with the
performance of the Department of Trade and Industry in the seven months
since the election.
'We're still looking for tangible action and visible effects rather than
words and promises,' Mr Johnson said.
'In recent weeks, industry itself has been doing the job of the DTI,
fighting for a voice and for action within government. I believe we have a
right to expect a more effective and more committed champion.'
Mr Johnson was in no doubt that the recent change of heart at the Treasury,
as illustrated by some of the Autumn Statement proposals, had been forced by
pressure from industry rather than the DTI. But the federation is now taking
the battle a stage further. A senior, effective and forceful department of
state is needed to develop a long-term strategic view of industry, Mr
Johnson said.
'If the DTI lacks the vision, the competence or the determination - or if it
is simply too busy with short-term issues - to deal with long-term strategy,
then perhaps we should look to the creation of a specialist Treasury section
to do this vital work.'
The federation canvassed its 5,000 member companies and other organisations
to produce its industrial strategy. It argues that a long-term strategy is
needed to give some meaning to short-term measures such as changes to
capital allowances.
Behind its plea lies concern about two long-term trends - rising consumption
and falling investment - that, in combination, highlight the critical need
to regenerate the UK's industrial and manufacturing base.
The federation's proposals for immediate action by the government include
encouragement for internationally mobile investment to locate in and remain
in the UK; 'effective, timely and internationally competitive' export
finance; and the permanent extension of capital allowances for plant and
machinery to 100 per cent.
In the long term the government should take a lead in developing a vision of
how industry and technology can be developed to national advantage. But
industry itself should also be thinking strategically.
The federation wants the City to look for achievable future rates of return,
not illusory expectations of unsustainably high profitability. The 1980s had
left a legacy of excessive expectations on rates of return of investment, Mr
Johnson said.

CANADA'S markets are braced for another steep rise in interest rates today
as the central bank seeks to brake the sliding Canadian dollar, writes
Bernard Simon in Toronto.
The Bank of Canada is expected to raise its weekly discount rate to almost 9
per cent, compared to its present 7.95 per cent and a low of 4.93 per cent
in early September.
The jump in rates, which included two increases in banks' prime lending rate
last week, has failed to reverse the currency's slide. The dollar fell below
77.80 US cents yesterday morning, against almost 84 cents at the end of
August.
A senior Bank of Montreal official yesterday predicted it would fall
further.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Radical reform of health care system recommended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADICAL reform of the US health care system, including tough budgetary curbs
on physicians and hospitals and steps to expand access to care, is
recommended by the OECD.
Its report criticises many aspects of the system and says linking employment
and health insurance provision is 'archaic and makes no more sense than
linking automobile insurance to people's employment'.
The US has the worst record among OECD countries in controlling health care
costs and securing access to care. In real terms, costs have risen at an
annual rate of 5.5 per cent for two decades, twice as fast as GDP growth. In
per capita terms, the US spends twice as much as the OECD average. Yet 35m
people, one in seven, still lack insurance cover.
The root cause of cost inflation lies in the 'nature of the system'. Once
insured, the marginal cost of treatment is low; yet 'physicians have
incentives, both moral and financial, to offer as much and as good a
treatment as they can'. To stop costs exploding, all OECD countries except
the US have placed budgetary curbs on providers, limiting doctors' ability
to provide costly new treatments.
The OECD says the US has no choice but to impose broad controls on price and
volume of health care services. Such controls are already imposed in US
publicly-financed schemes such as Medicare, the programme for the elderly,
but are likely to be resisted in the US private sector.
Gaps in health care cover persist because the private insurance system for
those under 65 is voluntary and closely tied to employment. Private insurers
'have a powerful incentive to charge bad risks their (high) actuarial cost,
or refuse coverage'. Such 'cream-skimming' results in prohibitive insurance
costs for small companies and individuals because there are few policy
holders over whom to accommodate bad risks. (Bad risks are people most
likely to become ill or those with pre-existing conditions.)
The OECD outlines two options for reform. The federal government could
regulate private insurers more heavily - to prevent them excluding bad risks
 -and cut insurance premium costs by offering means-tested subsidies. Or
they could move to the tax-financed social insurance system favoured in
other OECD countries, 'guaranteeing universal access, carrying lower
administrative costs and avoiding cream-skimming'. The 'play or pay' plan
put forward by Democrats in Congress and backed by Mr Bill Clinton, might
serve as a transition to a mainly tax-financed system. Under this, employers
would have to provide insurance for employees or pay a payroll tax to
finance an expanded public-sector scheme.
OECD officials say the most promising reform comes from Mr John Garamendi,
California's insurance commissioner. Under this, care would be financed by
payroll taxes. The link between employment and insurance would end, since
individuals would sign up with competing 'health insurance purchasing
corporations'. These would use payroll taxes to buy care from competing
private-sector providers. The US problem is that such a plan, while cutting
growth of health care costs, would raise tax burdens.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Close race for Georgia Senate seat
</HEADLINE>

   ATLANTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOTERS in the state of Georgia today cast ballots in a closely fought
run-off election for a US Senate seat, writes Barbara Harrison in Atlanta.
The incumbent Democratic Senator Wyche Fowler, a liberal with backing from a
coalition of blacks, women and labour, is being challenged by Mr Paul
Coverdell, a conservative Republican, who has the support of the religious
right.
The outcome of the race is important enough to have drawn Mr Bill Clinton to
campaign for Mr Fowler; the president-elect said he needed him in the Senate
to help 'break this gridlock in Washington'. A Fowler victory would give the
Democrats 57 Senate seats, the same number as before the election.
Another by-election next week in North Dakota, where the Democrats are
strongly favoured, would add another seat but their total would still be
short of the 60 needed to cut off Republican filibusters.
The run-off is being held because Georgia law requires a candidate to
receive a majority of the vote; in the November 3 election, Mr Fowler won
just 49 per cent of the ballots, while Mr Coverdell won 48 per cent.
The campaigns have been called the dirtiest in local memory. The
mud-slinging, conducted largely through television advertisements, has
dismayed many voters and is likely to spur few to vote.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNOFFICIAL results from Sunday's Peruvian elections indicate President
Alberto Fujimori will win the overall majority he sought in the new
constituent congress. But his victory has been somewhat marred by a record
number of spoiled and blank votes.
Almost one in four Peruvians turned in a void vote. Although as yet no
official turnout figures have been announced, reports from outlying regions
indicate the abstention rate has been unusually high in a country where
voting is obligatory.
Analysts blame a general disillusionment with politics. But the election
boycott by ex-president Alan Garcia's Apra and twice-president Fernando
Belaunde's Popular Action, Peru's two weightiest parties, clearly left a
significant minority of voters with nowhere to go.
Ms The Popular Christian Party (PPC), the only 'traditional' party to field
candidates, won more votes on Sunday than any other opposition group and its
leader, Ms Lourdes Flores Nano, is likely to emerge as Mr Fujimori's chief
opponent.
The pro-government alliance of Cambio (Change) 90 and New Majority is
expected to end up with 46 seats in the 80-member congress, to be installed
on December 30.

FT  24 NOV 92 / US growth of 2.5% predicted for 1993: OECD annual survey
indicates underlying rate of inflation likely to fall below 3 per cent

THE sluggish US recovery should pick up speed next year but low levels of
savings, investment and productivity growth raise doubts about the
longer-term outlook for living standards, the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development says in its latest annual survey of the US
economy.
It says that US economic growth is likely to rise from 1.8 per cent this
year to just under 2.5 per cent next year, reflecting the delayed impact of
past cuts in interest rates and an easing of private-sector restraints on
growth, such as high corporate and individual debt burdens.
'Inventories are very lean, and so further expenditure increases should be
translated quickly into production. With productivity already back to its
pre-recession trend, increased production is likely to require additional
hiring, which should reassure households and contribute to their willingness
to spend.'
The recovery, however, will be slower than in past business cycles, with the
unemployment rate likely to remain close to 7.5 per cent until the end of
next year.
Given substantial slack in labour and product markets, the underlying rate
of inflation is likely to fall below 3 per cent next year.
The current account deficit will rise, but should not far exceed 1 per cent
of gross domestic product, partly because exports will continue to be
supported by the competitiveness of the dollar against the D-Mark and yen.
The OECD is gloomier about the US's medium-term prospects, pointing to a
'serious erosion of the factors underpining current and future prosperity'.
Living standards as measured by real per capita consumer spending rose at a
1.75 per cent annual rate during the 1980s, against 2.25 per cent during the
1970s.
But even this reduced growth may not be sustainable because it reflected an
increase in labour force participation rates, as women entered the paid
workforce, and reduced provision for the future, as both individuals and
government borrowed heavily. At some point, savings and taxes will have to
rise, temporarily reducing living standards.
Labour productivity, as measured by output per hour, grew at an annual rate
of only 0.8 per cent in the 1980s, a 'deceleration from the already anaemic
1.7 per cent pace of the 1970s'. Real wages either stayed level or fell,
depending on the measures used.
Reasons for the decline in productivity growth are not fully understood but
the OECD believes a decline in savings and investment played a big role.
During the second half of the 1980s, the ratio of net national savings to
GDP fell to 2.5 per cent of GDP, the lowest of any OECD country. This
compares with a 7 per cent rate in the 1970s and an average of 10 per cent
in other industrialised countries. The ratio of net investment to GDP was
also the lowest in the OECD area in this period.
The OECD says the main policy priority is to raise national savings by
reducing the federal budget deficit, which was equivalent to 5.5 per cent of
GDP in fiscal 1992.
The main source of persistent deficits is growth of federal 'entitlement'
programmes, mainly pensions and health care for the elderly, that has far
outstripped growth of tax revenues.
If the US adopts policies 'commonplace in other OECD countries', it can
readily eliminate the deficit by the mid-1990s, the report says. The OECD
recommends spending cuts and tax increases.
Effective controls on health-care costs, including a freeze on federal
spending relative to GDP, could save Dollars 90bn (Pounds 60bn), or more
than 1 per cent of GDP, by 1996. Allowing less tax relief on federal pension
payments could raise a further Dollars 26bn, or 0.4 per of GDP. But the OECD
says general tax increases would be preferable to a squeeze on
non-entitlement programmes, such as food stamps, which were cut in real
terms in the 1980s.
The OECD says a broad-based 5 per cent value added tax could raise about
Dollars 140bn, equivalent to nearly 2 per cent of GDP. That alone would be
sufficient to cut the structural budget deficit by two-thirds. A
25c-a-gallon tax on petrol would raise a further Dollars 23bn.
Other possible revenue measures include a tax on employer-paid health
insurance, which would raise Dollars 40bn, and a tax on the rental value of
owner-occupied housing.
The OECD points out that the total US tax burden, at 32 per cent of GDP, is
the lowest of any OECD country except Turkey. 'Solutions to the US budget
situation are readily found,' it concludes, 'what is required is the will to
implement them.'

FT  24 NOV 92 / Candidates play dirty in Georgia fight for Senate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATLANTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOTERS in the state of Georgia today cast ballots in a bitterly fought
run-off election for a US Senate seat.
The result is expected to be close. The incumbent Democratic Senator Wyche
Fowler, a liberal with backing from a coalition of blacks, women and labour,
is being challenged by Mr Paul Coverdell, a conservative Republican, who has
the support of the religious right.
The outcome of the race is important enough to have drawn President-elect
Bill Clinton and Vice President-elect Al Gore to campaign for Mr Fowler. Mr
Clinton appeared yesterday in Macon and Albany, and Mr Gore has been in
Georgia twice in the past week.
Mr Gore, underscoring what is at stake in the contest, said: 'In Congress,
the margin of one vote can make a tremendous difference.' A victory for Mr
Fowler would give the Democrats 57 Senate seats, the same number as before
the election.
Another by-election next week in North Dakota, where the Democrats are
strongly favoured, would add another seat, but their total would still be
short of the 60 needed to cut off Republican filibusters.
The run-off is being held because Georgia law requires a candidate to
receive a majority of the vote; in the November 3 election, Mr Fowler won
just 49 per cent of the ballots, while Mr Coverdell won 48 per cent.
The result of today's voting is expected to hinge on turn-out. Because
run-offs do not galvanise voter attention, turn-out is estimated to be just
25-33 per cent of the registered voters. This compares with 73 per cent on
November 3.
Consequently, both candidates have campaigned frantically during the past
three weeks. Mr Fowler has appealed particularly to black churches for help
in mobilising voters and Mr Coverdell has done the same at fundamentalist
Christian churches.
Ironically, little Christian spirit has been shown in what has been called
one of the dirtiest and nastiest campaigns in local memory.
The mud-slinging match, conducted largely through television advertisements,
has dismayed many voters and is likely to spur few other than the party
stalwarts and the ideologically-motivated to vote today.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Temple threatens to pierce Rao's procrastination policy: The
testing time ahead of India's prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR P V Narasimha Rao's legendary ability to procrastinate endears him to
many Indians. They seem to prefer this unassuming 71-year-old to some of his
younger and more aggressive rivals.
He has served them well, patiently steering the country through a
balance-of-payments crisis last year and charting a course to India's
biggest economic reforms since independence.
However, with a new session of parliament opening today, Mr Rao's ability to
sit out the harshest storms faces some tough tests.
Top of the political agenda is a potentially explosive dispute over the
planned construction of a temple to the Hindu god Ram next to a mosque in
Ayodhya, a town in northern India. The government has tried to stall efforts
by Hindu militants to build the temple amid fears of further bloodshed at
the site where 2,000 people have died in the past three years.
The right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), the main opposition
party, supports claims by the Hindu fundamentalist Vishva Hindu Parishad
(VHP) that wants to build the temple. They accuse Mr Rao's Congress party of
currying favour with Moslems.
Mr Rao has won support among educated Indians for avoiding direct
confrontation with the BJP and VHP by referring disputes over the ownership
of the site to the courts. In the summer, the VHP and its allies in the
Hindu priesthood accepted a temporary delay in construction. But time is
running out for Mr Rao - the fundamentalists' deadline expires on December
6.
The prime minister's problems are compounded as the local government in
Uttar Pradesh state, including Ayodhya, is ruled by the BJP. Firm action by
the central government could involve suspending state government powers - a
move fraught with political risk, not least because Uttar Pradesh is India's
largest state. Refraining from action could be worse given the
fundamentalists' determination. 'We are prepared to die,' says the BJP MP
for Ayodhya, 'We will make any sacrifice for Ram.'
Second only to religion in India are the passions aroused by caste.
As early as 1952, about 27 per cent of public sector entry-level jobs were
set aside for the lowest castes, chiefly untouchables. This month, after
years of arguments, the Supreme Court ruled that so-called 'other backward
classes' - those slightly above the untouchables - should benefit from
positive discrimination by having reserved access to 22.5 per cent of
entry-level posts.
The verdict prompted violent protests on student campuses across northern
India - being barred from 49.5 per cent of public sector appointments
naturally alarmed the educated middle classes.
The issue does not present Mr Rao with any immediate decisions. It will be
up to bureaucrats to put the policy into practice. But it increases tensions
in the same geographical areas as the Ayodhya temple dispute since Uttar
Pradesh and neighbouring states have above-average numbers of low-caste
people who will have the right to jobs previously monopolised by their
middle-class neighbours.
Nor will debate over religion and caste spare Mr Rao from having to do
battle over the economy. The opposition parties will seek to hurt him on two
fronts. First, they are seizing on complaints by people who believe they
have been harmed by reform - chiefly farmers protesting against cuts in
fertiliser price subsidies. The BJP yesterday filed a motion to adjourn
parliament for a day in support of farmers.
Mr Rao tried to defuse the farmers' anger by increasing other cash handouts.
The second economic issue Mr Rao is vulnerable on is the Rs35bn (Pounds
800m) Bombay securities market scandal. The affair, which caused heavy
losses for banks and stockbrokers, hurt the government by revealing
weaknesses in financial supervision.
It exposed Mr Rao's economic reform to attack from those who argue
deregulation increased the opportunities for financial wrong-doing. Mr Ram
Niwas Mirdha, chairman of a parliamentary committee investigating the
scandal, said India should create a 'proper regulatory framework' before
allowing more liberalisation.
Mr Rao has formidable advantages to confront these problems. First, he and
his party are secure in power. According to an opinion poll published this
weekend, 49 per cent of voters support Mr Rao for prime minister, against 14
per cent for Mr L K Advani, the BJP leader.
Congress has local difficulties, notably in Karnataka state in the south,
where Mr Rao sacked the state's chief minister following allegations of
widespread corruption. Overall, it has no real rivals - the BJP is strong in
those parts of the north where it has fanned the flames of fundamentalism.
Moreover, the BJP is a one-issue party. On economic reform, it snipes at the
government over individual measures which can be turned to party-political
advantage.
Nevertheless, there are two distinct risks. One is that the temple dispute
may explode into violence. A military crackdown in Uttar Pradesh would
undermine government efforts to promote India-wide political stability. That
would discourage investment, particularly by foreigners.
The second danger, is that fighting bush-fires will distract Mr Rao from
further economic reform. He admits the financial scandal has delayed banking
and other reforms.
One senior political adviser to the Congress party says Mr Rao needs to show
more active leadership. There is widespread public support for a
'reasonable' solution in Ayodhya and the further pursuit of 'sensible'
economic changes, says the adviser. 'But someone needs to stand up and shout
to drown out the BJP.'

FT  24 NOV 92 / Growth in rural poor put at 40%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER at the United Nations
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of rural poor in developing countries has risen 40 per cent over
the past 20 years, an indication of failure among international aid
programmes, according to a study released yesterday by the Rome-based
International Fund for Agricultural Development (Ifad), Reuter reports from
the United Nations.
The report, covering 114 nations with large rural populations, said the
trickle-down theory of economics and attitudes towards the poor prevented
them from being integrated into a country's economic structure. Ifad, a UN
agency, said most programmes were too heavy on capital investment.
'Development is not something that happens in spite of the poor. It is
something that happens because of them.
'Societies will not need massive infusions of foreign aid as farmers will
generate their own savings and invest them in local production.'
The rural poor were poor because they had been denied resources available to
others - land, credit, technology and social services.

<TEXT>
THE INDIAN government has banned insider trading in stocks and shares, as
part of capital market reforms, R. C. Murthy reports from Bombay.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the market watchdog,
which will administer the insider trading laws, can impose a penalty of
Rs500,000 (Pounds 11,500) or two years' imprisonment or both for violations.
The administration of Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, is rushing
through the reforms as foreign investors, who from earlier this year have
been able to make direct purchases on India's stock exchanges, are holding
back in the absence of a proper regulatory mechanism.
The laws have been made effective from last Thursday when allegations were
made of insider trading in the shares of Tata Engineering and Locomotive, a
market leader, which last week announced that net profits plunged by three
quarters in the first half to September. Its share price had fallen from
Rs301 in early November to Rs222.50 last week.
Sebi relented yesterday on registration fees for brokers. Mr G. V.
Ramakrishna, Sebi chairman, has agreed to make appropriate changes in the
definition of 'annual turnover' to bring down the fee.

</HEADLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S trade deficit more than doubled during the first six months of the
current financial year to Dollars 26.22bn (Pounds 17.3bn) compared with
Dollars 10.21bn for the same period of last year.
This indicates that India's performance on the balance of payments, worries
over which led to an economic reform package earlier this year, is not
proceeding on course, say economists.
The trade deficit for the six months to September has worsened despite a
5.37 per cent increase in exports in dollar terms, to Dollars 85.48bn
against Dollars 81.13bn. However, uncertainty over rupee-rouble trade after
the collapse of the Soviet Union continues to exert a negative influence,
according to a government economist.
The increase in the trade deficit has been fuelled by a higher-than-expected
22.3 per cent growth in imports to Dollars 111.70bn from Dollars 91.34bn.
'This growth in imports appears unduly large because of massive import
compression by the government last year,' said a Commerce Ministry official.
'But there is still cause for concern as the Indian industrial sector
continues in a recessionary phase.'

FT  24 NOV 92 / SA lures back investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISINVESTMENT from South Africa has been reversed over the past year,
according to the Investor Responsibility Research Centre (IRRC), an
independent Washington-based research institute, writes Michael Holman.
According to the 1992 edition of the IRRC publication, International
Business in South Africa, 508 non-US companies have direct investment or
employees in South Africa, up from 454 a year ago. Of these, 153 are
British, 142 German and 111 are American.
US companies are also returning to South Africa, but in much smaller
numbers, says the report. Since President George Bush lifted the ban on new
investment in July 1991, five US companies have established offices,
bringing the total of US companies with direct investment or employees up to
111.
US disinvestment from South Africa began on a substantial scale after the
violence of the mid-1980s, with the number of US companies in the republic
falling from 267 in May 1986 to 168 by October 1987 to a low of 106 in 1991,
according to IRRC statistics.
But the report notes that US companies remain reluctant to invest in South
Africa 'because of more than 60 state, city and county selective contracting
laws that penalise companies doing business in South Africa when awarding
contracts'. Investors are also discouraged by violence and political
uncertainty, the report adds.
The trend towards establishing non-equity links with South African companies
'has continued to increase dramatically', the report continues.
It says that 303 non-US companies have non-equity links (such as licensing
or distribution agreements) with South African companies, a net increase of
132 from a year ago. US companies with non-equity links rose by 23 to 256.

FT  24 NOV 92 / US warns of 5m more ozone cancer cases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEPLETION of the ozone layer will cause a sharp increase in cancer over the
next century - including 5m more cases and 70,000 deaths in the US alone - a
top US government official warned yesterday.
The prediction from Mr William Reilly, administrator of the US Environmental
Agency, came in Copenhagen at a United Nations conference on the ozone
layer, at the start of three days of talks where 92 countries are trying to
bring forward the phase-out of ozone-depleting chemicals to 1996 from the
year 2000.
Mr Reilly said the cost of implementing the existing protocol was Dollars
35bn (Pounds 23bn) for the US. The cost of the accelerated programme was
Dollars 2bn, but Mr Reilly expected it would save 10,000 lives by 2075 -
Dollars 200,000 a life.
Industrialists at the meeting warned that businesses worldwide were
stockpiling chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) - some of the chemicals considered
most damaging - in anticipation of an early production ban.
The ozone layer absorbs the sun's ultraviolet radiation, which can cause
skin cancer and cataracts in humans and lower crop yields. Dr Bob Watson, a
leading atmospheric scientist, said: 'There is now evidence that ozone is
being depleted over heavily populated areas of the northern hemisphere by
about 3 per cent in summer and 5 per cent in winter.' He added that even
with existing controls depletion levels could double by the year 2000.
The World Meteorological Organisation, which recently warned that ozone
levels over northern Europe were lower than usual this year because of cold
weather, said yesterday levels over Scotland were 20 per cent below average
in mid-January this year.
Delegates were wrestling over the importance of adding two new chemicals as
they sought to renegotiate the Montreal protocol of 1987. The protocol
regulates ozone-damaging substances - HCFCs, a less damaging replacement for
CFCs, and methyl bromide, a fumigant used for preserving fruit and grain.
Mr David Maclean, UK environment minister, said: 'If you want to get rid of
CFCs - and they are the bad guys - you must turn to HCFCs.' According to one
leading international chemical manufacturer, industry put off adopting HCFCs
for fear they would eventually be banned too.
He believed US carmakers were stockpiling the chemical to enable them to
carry out six-year service warranties on cars at low cost.
Mr Reilly said that while he did not have details of US manufacturers'
plans, 'it would make sense for them to put together a CFC bank for
servicing existing stock', a comment that was denounced by environmental
groups as 'extremely unhelpful.'

FT  24 NOV 92 / Dirty oil in Japan's political machine: Scandal hearings
that could end a faction's dominance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE central pillar of Japanese politics looks set to crumble.
That pillar is the Takeshita faction, the largest grouping within the ruling
Liberal Democratic party. It has dominated Japanese politics since the
mid-1970s when it was led in an earlier incarnation by then prime minister
Mr Kakuei Tanaka.
It has made and broken Japanese prime ministers. Its power is recognised in
the White House where its leaders visit for talks separately from the
Japanese cabinet.
On Thursday Mr Noboru Takeshita, the faction's titular head, will give sworn
testimony to parliament over his role in the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal.
This will give an official airing to allegations that in 1987 his supporters
enlisted the help of the then leader of Japan's largest organised crime
syndicate to quell a right-wing campaign against Mr Takeshita's bid to
become prime minister.
The exposure could signal the demise of Mr Takeshita's political authority,
at a time when the faction's leadership is extremely unstable.
Mr Takeshita brought together the alliance which supports Mr Keizo Obuchi,
the faction boss recently elected to replace Mr Shin Kanemaru, who was
forced to resign after admitting he had received an illegal donation of
Y500m (Pounds 2.7m) from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, a trucking company. That
alliance could fall apart without Mr Takeshita's authority to hold it
together.
Meanwhile Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the faction's crown prince, and Mr Tsutomu Hata,
the finance minister, are preparing to split from the faction, taking about
36 members of the parliament's lower house with them.
Scandals and factional power struggles are the lifeblood of Japanese
politics. There have been 18 political scandals since 1945. Many have
involved larger sums than the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin case and some have led to
the resignations of serving prime ministers without leaving any lasting mark
on the political system.
How far the consequences in this scandal extend will depend on two central
characters - Mr Ozawa and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister.
Mr Ozawa is an ambivalent politician. He has risen to the top as an insider,
a dealmaker and money-raiser, first the protege of Mr Tanaka and then Mr
Kanemaru. He masterminded the LDP's 1990 election victory when many thought
the party risked losing its lower-house majority. It is now thought this
victory was funded with Sagawa Kyubin's donations.
Only two months ago he apologised to the Takeshita faction for failing to
protect Mr Kanemaru from a probe into his illegal dealings. He then fought
an unsuccessful campaign to claim the faction leadership as the chosen
successor of the disgraced kingmaker.
However, since his bid for power was thwarted, Mr Ozawa has sought to
transform himself into the standard bearer of a younger generation of
political leaders. He claims to be fired with a quasi-nationalist mission,
to modernise the country's inward-looking political institutions so that
Japan can rightfully claim and responsibly wield its growing international
power.
In an interview in Bungei Shinju, a political magazine, he explained: 'In
the cold war era Japan did not need a political view, the only political
concern was how to divide up the budget. Japan enjoyed its economic
prosperity thanks to support from the US. Now the cold war is over Japan
must change its political structure to have a responsibility to the world.'
The ambiguity in Mr Ozawa's position makes it difficult to predict how he
might wield the power of the new faction.
Some radical possibilities are being suggested by Tokyo's political rumour
mill. One idea is that the government's unpopularity over the Sagawa scandal
may force a vote of no-confidence in the Miyazawa government. If Mr Ozawa's
36 members abstained, Mr Miyazawa could lose, which would bring down the
government.
This might force the LDP to call an election while its popularity is low
because of the potent combination of scandal and gathering recession. There
is a precedent: in 1980 the Ohira government was brought down when 69
dissident LDP members abstained in a no-confidence vote.
An even more radical possibility is that the Ozawa forces may ally with
younger members of the Socialist and trade union parties to create a
cross-party grouping to campaign for an overhaul of Japan's electoral and
political funding system. In private, supporters of Mr Ozawa and Mr Hata
claim they have already calculated how many non-LDP politicians would join a
new grouping.
Mr Shigezou Hayasaka, a leading political analyst, said: 'Ozawa is one of
the few politicians who could change Japanese politics. This could be the
first step towards re-organising Japanese politics, including the opposition
parties.'
The Takeshita faction's weakness may provide Mr Miyazawa with an opportunity
to assert his independence by working in alliance with Mr Ozawa and the
LDP's other main factions, the Mitsuzuka and Watanabe factions.
Creating such an alliance would be fraught with difficulty. It could be
sealed only by offering the Ozawa faction a share of the seats in the
cabinet which could enrage the Takeshita faction.
In the past week Mr Miyazawa has sought to regain the political initiative,
taking charge of the LDP's often confused response to the Sagawa Kyubin
case, and pledging that the 1993 budget will be expansionary to allay
business criticism that economic policy is being overlooked by the
concentration on the scandal.
Yet Mr Miyazawa, a former bureaucrat, may lack the strength to stamp his
authority on the party, particularly at a time when it will be beset by
crises. The economy is mired in a deep downturn, the Sagawa Kyubin scandal
is not running out of steam and calls for political reform are becoming more
insistent. At the same time, the world anxiously expects Tokyo to seal the
Uruguay Round of trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade by facing down its powerful agricultural lobby and pledging to open up
its protected rice market.
Mr Ozawa can afford to wait and watch, keeping his options open. Mr
Miyazawa's government will be making policy on the run for the foreseeable
future.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Hussein defends his stance on Gulf war

KING HUSSEIN of Jordan yesterday made a blistering attack on the Gulf
states, quashing prospects for a reconciliation between Amman and its
southern Arab neighbours.
In his second speech to the nation in three weeks, the king said he would
never apologise for Jordan's pro-Iraqi sympathies during the Gulf war.
Riyadh, in particular, has sought an overt apology as a condition of
resuming pre-Gulf war relations, which were frozen after Jordan's pro-Iraqi
tilt during the crisis.
Without naming any Gulf states, he said he would seek to defend Arab unity
despite states he described as 'motivated by tribal affiliation and a
high-handed mentality. . . who expect others to come in obeisance,
proclaiming their fealty in praise and gratitude.'
Earlier in the speech the king called for an Arab order 'far removed from
the stains of oil, consumerism and tyranny' of the Gulf states. He also
denounced Kuwait for evicting 300,000 Palestinians after the Gulf war
'although they had spent their entire lives in (Kuwaiti) service.'
In the speech, broadcast to the country from a graduation ceremony of the
Royal Staff and Command College near Amman, the king defended his position
in the Gulf war and, in a direct reference to Iraq, called for 'a national
reconciliation and democracy which would help it to overcome all obstacles'.
He recently dissociated himself in the strongest terms yet from the regime
in Iraq, which he said risked leading the country towards disintegration.
The king - who acknowledged this month he was suffering from cancer -
yesterday reaffirmed his commitment to the peace process despite a year of
limited progress and criticised Arab factions calling for an end to the
talks.
In an indirect reference to the Moslem Brotherhood and Palestinian groups in
Jordan which recently petitioned the king to abandon the talks, he warned
against 'hollow rejectionism.'
The UN Security Council yesterday pre-empted a personal appeal by Mr Tariq
Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, for a relaxation of sanctions by
reiterating that Baghdad had not yet complied with its obligations under the
Gulf ceasefire, writes Michael Littlejohns, UN Correspondent, in New York.
Mr Andre Erdos of Hungary, council president, read out a litany of lapses by
the Iraqi authorities. His statement, approved by members in prior
consultations, concluded that Iraq 'has up to now only selectively and then
partially complied with the obligations placed upon it by the Council'.
However, the UN body voiced hope that the new meeting attended by a
high-level Iraqi delegation would impress once again on Baghdad 'the
imperative need for full compliance'.

THE United Nations said yesterday there had been more than 100 violations of
an international ban on flights over Bosnia-Hercegovina since it came into
force last month.
Mr Cedric Thornberry, deputy head of the UN Protection Force (Unprofor),
said flights involved helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. 'There has been a
good deal of flying over Bosnia, despite the Security Council resolution.
Well over 100 flights were registered in the past month.'
World attention has been focused on numerous Serb violations of the flight
ban, but Mr Thornberry said Croat and Moslem forces have also violated the
no-fly zone.
'It is too early to say for certain whether or not some were combat flights,
but it cannot be ruled out since it has been clear that helicopter flights
are being made with the deliberate intention of avoiding radar,' he said.
Diplomats said that military equipment was probably being smuggled in by
Croats and Moslems in defiance of an arms embargo imposed on the former
Yugoslav republics by the UN on May 31.
The UN Security Council, frustrated by repeated violations of the embargo,
last week agreed to tighten sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia and
western navies launched a naval blockade. Yesterday, three ships flying the
flags of Syria, Ecuador, and Liberia were halted for inspection but later
let go after nothing suspect was found.
The western navies have been patrolling the Adriatic since July, but until
last week they only had the right to ask merchant ships to identify their
cargo and destination. Under new rules of engagement the warships are
allowed, if necessary, to fire across the bows of suspected
sanctions-busting vessels, forcing them to stop to be searched by boarding
parties.
However, the ban on flights over Bosnia, adopted by the Security Council on
October 9, did not authorise the use of force against violators. Mr
Thornberry said: 'It is not for us to decide what to do about these flights.
That is for the Security Council.'
On the issue of Croatia, a European diplomat said yesterday: 'Western
governments have not taken any action against Croatia, although 'they know
the exact sizes and elements of the Croatian army involvement'. The Croatian
government has denied any military presence in Bosnia. But Mr Thornberry
said the Croatian Defence Council, which controls Bosnia's Croat forces, had
told UN peacekeepers that the Croatian army controls large stretches of
territory around Mostar.
Fighting yesterday continued in Sarajevo. Mr Thornberry said 192 shells were
counted by UN observers - all but two of them fell on Bosnian government
positions.
Despite the failure of ceasefire agreements to take hold, the international
airlift has continued. Since July, 1,568 aid flights have reached Sarajevo.

SENIOR trade negotiators will meet on Thursday in Geneva to relaunch the
108-nation Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, with the intention
of reaching agreement on outstanding policy issues by the end of the year,
writes Frances Williams in Geneva.
The meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) follows last week's
settlement by the US and the European Community of the farm trade squabbles
that held up progress in the multilateral talks for nearly a year.
Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt) and TNC chairman, said countries now had the opportunity to
negotiate 'a package of results acceptable, and of benefit, to all the
participants in the round'.
He cautioned that 'hard work and further determination at the political
level' were required. However, he added that 'nobody should be in any doubt'
that it could be done.

FT  24 NOV 92 / World Trade News: French farm deal opposition is political
arm-waving - Paris seems to be playing for time to prepare a climbdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government's refusal to accept the US-EC farm trade accord might
look incomprehensible to some, but it is playing a rational, if high-risk,
game.
The signs are that Paris is playing for time so that it can find a way to
climb down and accept the deal without provoking too much domestic unrest.
The Socialist administration at the same time has to threaten to veto the
deal to guarantee its own survival. But it is unlikely to carry this
through.
To brandish the veto 'would be to recognise our weakness and admit our
isolation', Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, the agriculture minister, told a French
newspaper yesterday.
The most forceful note came from Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, in
a television interview a day earlier, but even that was half-hearted. France
might veto if the worst came to the worst, but the accord must first be
discussed by the European Commission and then by EC foreign and farm
ministers, he said. Mr Soisson has called for an emergency EC ministerial
meeting to debate the deal next week.
Even if the government did plan to carry out its threat of a veto, President
Francois Mitterrand has good reasons and the constitutional power to
overrule it.
For one thing, a French veto would spark a diplomatic crisis in the EC when
the Community is already at its weakest for years. Mr Mitterrand has devoted
much of his political life to building up, not demolishing Europe, even to
the extent of putting his own survival in the balance in the September
referendum on Maastricht.
For another thing, Mr Mitterrand is in no mood to do the Socialist party any
special favours, as shown by his recent lack of support for senior
Socialists in the blood transfusion scandal.
He needs the party to stay in government until the general elections next
March because an early change of government could leave him uncomfortably
exposed. But beyond that, he knows that a conservative administration is
likely to win the election and has already said he is ready to work with
such a government, as he did in 1986-88.
All this invites the question of whether the opposition will be able or
willing use this crisis to dethrone the government early and unsettle Mr
Mitterrand.
The opportunity will come tomorrow when the government will hold an
extraordinary debate on the deal in the national assembly, the first since
the Gulf war.
As it must in these circumstances, it has resorted to article 49-1 of the
constitution, under which the government puts its own survival on the line
on matters of general policy.
Now as during the Gulf war, the conservatives can hardly vote against the
government - which does after all oppose the EC-US deal - for defending a
vital national interest.
The right depends even more on the agricultural vote than does the left, has
unanimously denounced the deal and pressed hard for a veto. Mr Jacques
Chirac, leader of the RPR Gaullist party, has called it 'a Munich of
agriculture', in reference to the 1938 Munich betrayal.
Moreover, the right can only get a majority in the national assembly if the
Communists support it. The French Communist party is so anti-American that
it can hardly vote against a government that has itself taken a tough
anti-US line.
All this suggests that opposition parties, who have not yet decided how to
vote, will either reluctantly support the government's stance on the deal,
or abstain tomorrow.
The RPR will probably 'support the position of France and not that of the
government', said Mr Jacques Toubon, a Gaullist MP from Paris.
In theory, the opposition could vote against the government for not being
tough enough, but that would lack credibility given Mr Beregovoy's promise
that France will use the veto if necessary.
It might also be unwise given that the RPR and centre-right UDF leaderships
continue to be so divided on other issues that they are in poor shape to
fight an election, let alone lead France through the trade war that would
follow a veto.
The Communists, meanwhile, have an interest in keeping Mr Beregovoy in power
because they know they would lose national assembly seats in a general
election.
All this suggests that the opposition will try to use the debate tomorrow to
blame the government for having botched the negotiations and to put pressure
on it to threaten to use the veto more aggressively.
An important sub-plot to this drama is that the farm trade row has added to
the growing general unrest over France's position in the EC, shown in the
narrowness of the Maastricht referendum result.
'The enemy is not the US, it is the European Community,' said Mr Philippe
Seguin, the rebel Gaullist MP who led the campaign against the Maastricht
treaty.
'What is at issue is the. . .liberty taken by the Commission to defend
positions which threaten member states' fundamental interests.'

FT  24 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Luxembourg minister may win MacSharry job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LUXEMBOURG has appointed Mr Rene Steichen to its seat on the 17-member
European Commission, with a strong chance he will take over the EC farm
portfolio from Mr Ray MacSharry next year.
Mr Steichen, 42, has been agriculture minister in Luxembourg's Christian
Democrat-led coalition since 1989.
He takes over the Grand Duchy's top spot in Brussels from Mr Jean
Dondelinger, the cultural affairs commissioner, whose health has been poor.
In September, Mr MacSharry turned down the Irish government's invitation to
stay on in his post.
He has announced that he is retiring from public life to pursue a career in
the private sector. Since then, no obvious candidate to succeed him has
emerged.
The post of agriculture commissioner brings control over more than half the
Community budget, and by tradition is held by a small country.
It holds diminished attraction now that Mr MacSharry has settled reform of
the Common Agricultural Policy and has negotiated agreement with the US on
long-running disputes with the EC over subsidised food exports.
It is also possible that in the new Commission, which is due to take office
from January 1, 1993, agriculture's international dimension will be hived
off, leaving Mr MacSharry's successor the important but mundane job of
managing markets.
Mr Steichen has also had charge of cultural affairs, and could fill Mr
Dondelinger's job; however, he seems an obvious choice for agriculture now
that mooted candidates from Portugal and the Netherlands have failed to
emerge.
Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the Portuguese commissioner, is to be replaced
by Lisbon's foreign minister, Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, rather than Mr
Arlindo Cunha, the farm minister who chaired the last stage of the CAP
reform talks.
Mr Frans Andriessen, the EC external affairs commissioner, seems likely to
stay for another two years.
Two possible replacements from Holland, Mr Piet Dankert, minister for
Europe, and Mr Gerrit Braks, a former farm minister, had also been canvassed
for the agriculture job.
It was rumoured in Brussels in recent weeks that France might get the farm
slot, in order to help offset its farmers' hostility to the CAP and Gatt
reforms.
Few Commission officials or EC diplomats give this idea credence, but it may
resurface during the difficult negotiations in coming weeks between France
and its partners.
Luxembourg's appointment makes it certain that there will be at least five
new commissioners in January, though this number could still rise to eight
or nine.

FT  24 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Farmers single out Coca-Cola factory in
anti-US protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
COCA-COLA yesterday became the latest US-owned company singled out for
attack as a symbol of US capitalism by militant French farmers stepping up
their protests against last Friday's EC-US farm trade deal.
A group of 300 angry farmers demonstrated outside the Coca-Cola factory at
Grigny, southern Paris. They occupied the plant, halting the production
process, and burning tyres beside the Coca-Cola symbol nearby.
For the militant French farmers, the Coca-Cola blockade was one of a series
of demonstrations staged yesterday ahead of tomorrow's nationwide protest
against the trade deal. But for Coca-Cola and other French subsidiaries of
US groups, the demonstration poses a serious threat to the stability of
their businesses.
Demonstrations are part of daily life in France. About 6,000 protests a year
are held in Paris alone. The farmers are particularly inventive. One of
their favourite ploys, the Operation Escargot, whereby convoys of farmers
drive tractors at a snail's pace, has been highly successful at generating
media coverage and creating chaos on the French roads.
Recently, the farmers have taken to aiming at carefully selected targets.
One of the most successful Operations Escargots took place this spring when
a group of farmers sealed off the roads around the EuroDisneyland theme park
outside Paris as part of their campaign against EC farm reforms.
The latest round of Gatt demonstrations have been more aggressive and
overtly anti-American in tone. The farmers started last week by burning the
US flag outside the American embassy in Paris, continuing this weekend with
demonstrations outside French branches of McDonald's fast food chain.
McDonald's at Amiens was forced to close on Saturday night; angry scenes
occurred outside the Lille branch as farmers set fire to piles of straw.
The farmers have continued to hit other targets, such as government
buildings. There were other protests at Chalons-sur-Marne, Arles and Blois
yesterday. But, as the French farmers are well aware, assaults on US
corporate targets attract most media attention, causing maximum
embarrassment for the French government.
The US embassy has stepped up its security and McDonald's has circulated
emergency instructions to its 236 French branches. McDonald's has, somewhat
belatedly, begun an 'information campaign' directed at the farmers' unions,
pointing out that its French branches buy most of their meat, grain and
vegetables from farms in France.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany was urged yesterday to use his good
offices to prevent any French veto of the EC-US farm trade agreement.
The deal, negotiated last week, was hailed as a breakthrough by all main
political groups and lobbies in Germany, except the farmers' union. Even
farmers merely voiced sympathy for their French counterparts, but said they
would not organise violent protests.
The government cautiously welcomed the deal, and hoped France would not try
to veto it. Mr Dieter Vogel, government spokesman, said he hoped France
would be reassured by the examination of the deal by the European
Commission. He implied it might be possible to find some mitigation for
France during the investigation.
The most forthright endorsement came from the German Federation of Chambers
of Commerce (DIHT), the liberal Free Democrats in the ruling coalition, and
the opposition Social Democrats (SPD). The farm spokesman of Mr Kohl's
Christian Democrats, normally close to German farmers, expressed cautious
support.
The DIHT said the EC's external trade policy could not be allowed to fail
because of the French farmers' protests. It urged the German government to
use all its influence to ensure France backed the deal.
Mr Florian Gerster, SPD European affairs minister in Rhineland-Palatinate,
urged Mr Kohl to show firmness to France and dissuade it from vetoing the
deal and provoking a trade war with the US.
Mr Egon Susset, the Christian Democrats' parliamentary spokesman on
agriculture, said the deal should 'give room for manoeuvre once more to
European agricultural policy, and get the farming industry out of the dock'.
The deal should be critically examined, to ensure it did not go beyond the
Common Agricultural Policy reform agreed in the EC last May.

<TEXT>
TURKEY is prepared to participate in any military action subject to
international agreement to stop the dismemberment of Bosnia and the
slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Moslems, Mr Suleyman Demirel, the
Turkish prime minister, said in London yesterday.
However, his government would only act in the context of an international
operation decided by the United Nations or the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe.
Mr Demirel, in London for talks with Mr John Major, the British prime
minister, and to address the Confederation of British Industry, said the
Balkan countries would discuss possible joint action to deal with the
Bosnian crisis at talks in Turkey starting tomorrow.
He warned of the risk of the Bosnian conflict spreading to other countries.
If Kosovo, where the majority population is Moslem, but which Belgrade
considers to be an integral part of Serbia, and Macedonia became involved in
the fighting, the risk of still greater bloodshed would be great.
In his speech to the CBI, he urged European business leaders to use Turkey
as a gateway to the newly emerging former Soviet Asian republics and
highlighted the possibility of exploiting natural gas fields in the area,
with plans already under discussion for a possible pipeline to the west.
Mr Demirel refused to be drawn on whether Turkey would extend its agreement,
which expires at the end of the year, allowing US, British and French
aircraft to use Turkish bases for the protection of Kurdish 'safe havens' in
northern Iraq.
Though he gave no indication that the authorisation would not be extended,
he emphasised that Turkey was particularly concerned about the declared
intention of some Kurdish factions to set up an independent Kurdish state.
'Turkey cannot accept such an idea. Iraq should not be divided,' he said,
indicating that it had to be made very clear that any renewal of the
agreement should not be seen as an encouragement of Kurdish separatist
aspirations.
Turning to the Cyprus problem, Mr Demirel refused to distance himself from
Mr Rauf Denktash, the leader of the self-styled Turkish republic of northern
Cyprus, increasingly seen by UN officials as one of the most serious
obstacles to an agreement on a reunification of the island as a federated
state. 'We are giving all the encouragement necessary for a successful
conclusion of the negotiations. But we cannot tell Mr Denktash to surrender.
He definitely represents his people. His elimination from the situation
would create very great problems.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREECE and Macedonia are close to solving their dispute over finding a name
by which the European Community could recognise the former Yugoslav
republic, the EC special envoy on the Macedonian question said yesterday.
Mr Robin O'Neill, a retired ambassador who has been shuttling between Athens
and Skopje for two months, said: 'I believe we are as close to a solution as
you can be. It's for the government of Skopje to take the decision.'
The Macedonian government is due to make up its mind by tomorrow so that Mr
O'Neill, acting for the British EC presidency, can prepare for a decision on
recognition to be taken at next month's EC summit in Edinburgh.
Both Athens and Skopje have been urged to accept a compound name in which
the word Macedonia is used as an adjective not a noun.
While the EC leaders may be unwilling to reverse their joint support at the
Lisbon summit in June for the Greek view that Macedonia should not be
recognised under that name, Greece fears that if Macedonia decides at the
last minute not to compromise, individual member-states may go ahead with
recognition after the summit. Mr Constantine Karamanlis, the Greek
president, last week sent a letter to the other EC heads of state ahead of
the summit, which reportedly warned that Greece might close its border with
Macedonia if it was granted recognition by that name.
Macedonia, so far recognised by only a handful of countries, among them
Russia, Turkey and Bulgaria, has been lobbying actively for recognition and
has already applied for membership of the United Nations.
Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, is staking his
political survival on the issue. Speaking in Geneva yesterday after meeting
Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, co-chairmen of the international peace
conference on ex-Yugoslavia, Mr Mitsotakis said Greece stuck by its position
that the term Macedonia could not appear in the internationally-recognised
name of what he called the 'Republic of Skopje'.
Feeling runs so high among Greeks that the national karate team pulled out
of a competition in Spain last week where the Macedonian team was competing
under the country's new flag, emblazoned with a sunburst design apparently
inspired by the ancient insignia of Alexander the Great.

RUSSIA and Ukraine yesterday removed a key obstacle to a western plan to
reschedule the former Soviet Union's foreign debt when they agreed to settle
a row over Soviet assets and to let Moscow handle western creditors.
The accord between the two rivals gives western creditors an opportunity to
reschedule the foreign debt of more than Dollars 70bn (Pounds 46bn) at talks
which start in Paris today.
After months of refusing to give up its 16.5 per cent share of the debt
until it got a similar share of the assets, Ukraine has finally allowed
Russia, the only republic to make any debt repayments since the collapse of
the Soviet Union, the sole right to negotiate with western creditors.
The Ukrainian government has also given up claims on debts owed to the
Soviet Union by its former Third World allies.
In theory, these debts amount to more than Dollars 100bn, but are performing
so poorly that Russia has been trying to sell them.
In return, Moscow, which has persuaded most other republics to give up all
claims on all former Soviet assets in return for assuming their share of the
debt, has promised to negotiate with Kiev a special pact on sharing out
remaining assets and liabilities.
The Ukrainian government says this means it will get a share of former
Soviet embassies abroad, as well as reserves of gold, hard currency, and
diamonds which it has accused Russia of hoarding for itself, but which
Russia denies having.
The only catch to the hard-won agreement not to wash their dirty laundry in
public is that both parties reserve the right to renounce it if they fail to
agree a bilateral pact by the end of the year.
While their agreement may eventually unravel, both of the republics are now
under pressure to clear the way for a rescheduling accord.
The Russian government has been particularly anxious to clinch a
rescheduling agreement before a critical session of the Russian
super-parliament on December 1.
The new government in Ukraine, meanwhile, realises that it is more
profitable for the struggling republic to get rid of the Soviet debt burden.
It is now up to western creditors to decide which debts to include in a
rescheduling.
Germany wants to stick to a cut-off date of January 1 1991, while the US,
which has a very small exposure, is sympathetic to Russian demands that it
cover all debts incurred until the Soviet Union's collapse in December 1991.
Experts for the Russian government and the main Civic Union opposition group
have agreed a compromise anti-crisis plan which must now be approved by
political leaders of both sides, Leyla Boulton writes.
The plan is part of moves by President Boris Yeltsin to salvage the thrust
of market reforms and the composition of his cabinet ahead of the
potentially stormy December 1 session of the super-parliament.
The document rejects a return to price controls and old-style state
procurement demanded by the Civic Union, but puts more emphasis on
protecting the poor and minimising unemployment.
The document also appears to assume that monetary and credit policy will
continue to be improvised by the government and the Russian central bank.
The document makes no changes to the government's privatisation programme.
However, it does call for more support to create small businesses in
industry and other productive spheres, and for the speeding of small-scale
privatisation.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Inflation and money supply growth too high in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATION and money supply growth are still too high in Germany, Mr Johann
Gaddum, a Bundesbank council member, warned yesterday. His comments are
likely to further dampen expectations of an interest rate cut this year,
writes David Waller in Frankfurt.
Mr Gaddum said inflation, currently running at 3.7 per cent, was
unjustifiably high, especially because import prices had fallen sharply and
producer prices had remained stable. He blamed high rents, and price
increases in the service sector, in building, in administrative charges and
rentals, for what he called 'home-made inflation'.
He warned further that the outlook for inflation was bad because of the
effect of the VAT increase next January and because the level of wage
increases was out of line with productivity. He urged that in present
circumstances the government's main priority should be to save, not to try
to keep everyone happy.
Mr Gaddum warned that special factors could not explain away the fact that
M3 money supply growth, at 9.3 per cent, was way above the 3.5-5.5 per cent
target range. September's interest rates cut had not been justified by price
and monetary developments, although the upward valuation of the D-Mark would
dampen price increases and had influenced the decision. The rate cut ought
to be seen as an advance against future good behaviour.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Bonn U-turn on intervention: Pact near to avert east German
industrial collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government, opposition and trade unions appear headed towards
agreement on long-term state intervention to prevent the complete collapse
of east Germany's former industrial heartland.
The deal would be the core of a 'solidarity pact' between the government and
unions, as well as employers and the 16 federal states, involving a
commitment to wage restraint from trade union leaders.
Agreement on such a pact could provide just the sort of indicator demanded
by the German Bundesbank as a precondition for any significant further
reduction in interest rates.
Mr Bjorn Engholm, leader of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), had more
than an hour of talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday at which demands
for an interventionist industrial policy topped the agenda.
Emerging later, he welcomed the government's change of heart on industrial
policy. 'I am pleased that the government is apparently seriously planning
no longer to abandon heavy and core industries, but to salvage them,' he
said.
However, he said he still differed with the chancellor on the timing of any
tax increase to finance the extended burden of eastern subsidies. 'We differ
by around 24 months,' he added.
Mr Kohl has promised that there will be no new tax rises before 1995 - after
the next general elections.
The aim now is to keep key industries going in eastern Germany, even if the
Treuhand privatisation agency fails to sell them off to the private sector
in the next 12 months. At present, there are about 3,200 such companies on
the Treuhand books, and investment from the west is slowing markedly.
Such a policy would amount to a significant reversal of government strategy
in the east, and an important victory for the trade unions to present in
exchange for wage restraint. The government has until now insisted that
companies unable to be privatised would have to close.
The change in direction was confirmed yesterday by Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the
economics minister, who is immediately responsible for subsidy programmes in
eastern Germany.
In a radio interview after talks among leaders of the ruling coalition on
Sunday night, he said the government was determined to prevent the
'de-industrialisation' of the region.
'Companies which cannot be privatised at the moment, but which it is clear
could be salvaged, will be kept alive over an extended period with
government funds so that the industrial core is not lost,' he said.
The policy switch was also confirmed by Mr Peter Hintze, secretary-general
of Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), who said there was agreement
in the party leadership over the proposal that 'industrial cores' in east
Germany be preserved.
The unions, led by Mr Franz Steinkuhler of IG Metall, the engineering
workers' union, and Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, of the oTV public sector
workers' union, have demanded key industries should be defined according to
their sector and regional importance.
They conducted several rounds of secret talks with the chancellor before
details emerged last week.
Before Mr Engholm went in to yesterday's talks with Mr Kohl, his SPD party
declared a new industrial policy in the east was top of its agenda.
Party secretary, Mr Karl-Heinz Blessing, said: 'Whole branches are
threatened, like engineering and the textile industry. We cannot expect new
private investment in the new Lander in significant amounts.' He quoted the
example of Mercedes-Benz' recent decision not to go ahead with a DM1bn
(Pounds 400m) truck plant south of Berlin.

FT  24 NOV 92 / European car sales set to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEST European new car sales are expected to fall 3.5 per cent next year, the
largest drop for more than a decade. The German and Italian markets are
forecast to contract sharply, while France and Britain stage a slow
recovery.
Worldwide, however, 4.1 per cent growth is expected, to 35.2m from 33.8m,
ending two years of decline.
The latest report by DRI automotive analysts says demand will recover
strongly next year in North and South America, and growth will continue high
in the Asia/Pacific region, excluding Japan.
Sales in North America fell sharply from 1989 to 1991 and recovery this year
has proved weak, with estimated growth of 1.6 per cent to 9.2m.
According to the report sales in North America will jump 11 per cent in 1993
to 10.25m, and by 10.2 per cent to 1.46m in Latin America, helped by strong
growth in Brazil.
Sales in Japan fell by 4.6 per cent in 1991, and a 8.2 per cent drop is
forecast this year to 4.47m. Demand should be virtually unchanged there next
year, recovering gradually in 1994. Sales are not expected to exceed 5m, the
level reached in 1990, until 1997.
Excluding Japan, demand in the Asia/Pacific region is expected to expand by
9.5 per cent in 1993 to 2.52m after an increase of 9.9 per cent this year.
By 1996, sales are forecast to grow to 3m from 2m in 1990.
The weakest demand is forecast for west Europe, where sales are expected to
decline by 3.5 per cent in 1993 to 12.83m following a drop of 1.7 per cent
this year to 13.29m.
The surge in demand that followed German unification is now subsiding, and
sales there are expected to fall from 4.16m in 1991 to 3.88m this year, a
drop of 7 per cent, and by 11 per cent in 1993 to 3.45m.
The report suggests Volkswagen, Fiat and GM Europe (Opel/Vauxhall) will
suffer disproportionately among the big six in Europe with falls of 100,000
or more next year.
Production in west Europe is forecast to drop by 270,000 or 2.2 per cent
next year to 12.89m, with Germany and Italy falling back sharply. Growth in
output in the UK will be supported, however, by rising production by Nissan,
Toyota and Honda.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Czechoslovakia in new divorce move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE tri-cameral Czechoslovak federal assembly will try again today to
terminate the Czech and Slovak federation legally. Last week the Slovak part
of the chamber of nations, the bi-cameral lower house, failed by three votes
to approve the country's 'velvet divorce.'
Czech and Slovak authorities have in the meantime finalised many technical
issues raised by separate statehood.
One agreement makes the Czech and Slovak governments jointly and separately
responsible for the Dollars 200m three-year, 9 per cent notes issued by the
Czechoslovak State Bank in November 1991. The notes mature in November 1994
but require the bank to repay capital and due interest in case of default.
The technical grounds for default include dissolution of the Czech and
Slovak federal republic or the state bank. Both will take place on January 1
when two separate states and two separate central banks will emerge from the
old federation.
However, the state bank has organised a noteholders' meeting on December 14
in London at which they will be offered a choice between redeeming any notes
tendered by December 11 or retaining the notes on the original terms but
with the addition of a dual guarantee from the Czech and Slovak governments.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Inflation rate at 4-year low in Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN inflation has fallen to its lowest level in four years and is now
running at 4.9 per cent on an annualised basis.
According to preliminary figures released by Istat, the national statistics
institute, consumer prices increased by a maximum of 0.6 per cent in the
main cities during November. Complete figures, due shortly, are considered
unlikely to show any significant variation.
This is the fourth successive month that inflation has dropped. Price rises
on an annualised basis have not been below 5 per cent since 1988.
Declining inflation reflects a combination of capped public sector wages,
frozen utility tariffs and recession.
The impact of the September devaluation and subsequent float of the lira
outside the ERM has yet to be felt on inflation. The government is hoping
depressed domestic demand will limit inflationary pressures.
Yesterday, the industrialists' confederation, reported production down by
5.1 per cent this month on last November.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Major pours cold water on big EC projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR has indicated he favours co-ordination of economic planning by
members states - rather than big multi-billion pound, cross-border
infrastructure projects - to stimulate growth in the European Community.
He believes that excessively ambitious plans for combatting economic
downturn would only add to member states' budgetary problems.
The prime minister's views were made clear yesterday as officials outlined
parameters for EC talks on a Community growth strategy ahead of the
Edinburgh summit on December 11-12.
After yesterday's finance ministers' meeting in Brussels, Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, is to lead efforts to reach a common EC position in time for
the summit. Mr Major met Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier, in
Brussels yesterday in the first of a series of pre-summit bilateral
discussions.
British officials brushed aside claims the UK had made a U-turn by bowing to
pressure to add the issue to an already crowded summit agenda.
Downing Street said proposals for multi-billion-pound infrastructure
projects, widely reported to be under discussion in the European Commission,
were not realistic.
Officials stressed that the British presidency would seek the backing of its
EC partners for the more modest goal of co-ordinated action to maintain or
boost member states' capital spending programmes.
The officials said the UK presidency would urge action broadly parallel to
that set out in the government's autumn statement on public spending earlier
this month. This seeks to stimulate growth by maintaining capital spending
projects and other supply side measures while holding down the public sector
wages bill.
Such proposals fall substantially short of the measures being suggested by
the Commission and several EC countries to fight slowing growth rates and
unemployment.
Sir Leon Brittan, the senior UK commissioner, yesterday appeared to reflect
Mr Major's views when he rejected such plans as 'grandiose' and likely to
exacerbate member states' budgetary difficulties.
However, he argued in a BBC interview that there was now a good case for an
EC-wide drive to boost capital spending and to open up monopoly sectors to
competition.
In London, a senior government official agreed there was now a broad
consensus across the Community that the Edinburgh summit should discuss
fully how to react to the economic downturn.
By following the UK's medium-term programme of preserving capital spending
schemes while restraining pay rises, member states could maintain the goal
of budgetary convergence, he said.
However, it was also pointed out that the Edinburgh agenda was already
lengthy with such issues as enlargement, completion of the single market,
future Community financing, Denmark's demands on the Maastricht treaty and
the definition of subsidiarity.
The future of the exchange rate mechanism and the conclusion of the Gatt
accord on trade liberalisation are also certain to need time for debate.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Punt hangs on after rates rise: Irish central bank action
with an eye on the election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH punt was spared an expected speculative assault in the foreign
exchange markets yesterday after the Irish central bank pushed up overnight
interest rates to 30 per cent. The move followed the devaluation of the
Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo at the weekend.
The bank suspended its normal overnight short-term facility (STF), which
carried a 13.75 per cent interest rate, and replaced it with a
straightforward secured overnight loan facility carrying a 'minimum' 30 per
cent interest rate.
Central bank one-week funds are available at 25 per cent. However, quotes
for one-week interbank rates in Dublin were yesterday reported to be running
as high as 100 per cent.
A rise in the STF would normally signal a rise in commercial bank rates and
its suspension yesterday was being viewed in the market as a means of
holding off a rise in those rates until after the general election tomorrow.
According to foreign exchange dealers in Dublin, the sharp rise in overnight
rates together with the continuation of exchange controls on
non-trade-related transactions made funds scarce in the money market and
resulted in only light selling of the punt yesterday.
'The onslaught on the punt has not materialised,' said Mr Jim Power, senior
economist at the Bank of Ireland group treasury. He said: 'It is now very
expensive to go short on the Irish punt. It is very difficult to get any
quotes for anything other than overnight funding and these range from 30 to
70 per cent.'
Nonetheless, yesterday afternoon, the punt fell to its floor against the
Belgian franc, at the moment the strongest currency in the ERM, at BFr54.02,
although it stayed between half a pfennig and a pfennig above its floor
against the D-Mark of 2.619. Unusually, the central bank refused to comment
on whether it had been intervening in the market to support the punt by
selling reserves, although under ERM provisions it would be obliged to
intervene once a floor level had been reached.
Light trading was reported on the Irish gilts market also, but with values
approaching their previous lows in October. The yield on the benchmark
9-year 2001 gilt rose to more than 10 per cent, indicating heavy discounting
by the market.
Irish share prices closed a further 1.66 per cent up yesterday, the ISEQ
index putting on 18 points to 1,152.92 after a 34.76 point gain last Friday
on expectation of a devaluation of the punt.
According to Mr Dan McLaughlin, senior economist at Riada stockbrokers in
Dublin, 'the (overnight) interest rate increase may succeed as a holding
operation, but it is now only a matter of time before a realignment.' He
said that the political uncertainty over the outcome of the election and the
lifting of exchange controls at the end of the year 'leave the punt looking
very vulnerable'.
If, as now seems likely, no party emerges with a clear majority from the
election this week, negotiations over the formation of a new government
could stretch well into the new year. Indeed, such negotiations could now be
complicated over whether a continuing defence of the punt can be justified
given the level of interest rates and their adverse effect on industry and
mortgages.
Mr Power said: 'The precedent (from September) would suggest that if the
high money market rates continue into next week, then retail rates will also
soon be pulled up.'

SPAIN, Portugal, Norway and Greece all raised interest rates yesterday and
Iceland devalued the krona, as Europe's smaller central banks acted to
protect their currencies after the weekend ERM realignment.
Norway claimed some success in the battle against currency speculation. But
other central banks were waiting nervously for signs of whether yesterday's
upsurge of speculation against the Danish krone and Irish punt will ebb.
Iceland's 6 per cent devaluation - matching the weekend moves affecting the
Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo - was accompanied by a package of
consumer tax increases and cuts in company taxes as part of an attempt to
curb unemployment.
Leading yesterday's action was the Bank of Spain, which raised its benchmark
intervention rate 0.75 points to 13.75 per cent to shield the peseta from
pressure. The move appeared to be an attempt to pre-empt fresh assaults on
the peseta after Spanish exchange controls are lifted today.
The peseta eased yesterday slightly below its new central parity in the ERM
of Pta72.06 to the D-Mark, adding to speculation of a more significant fall
today.
The Spanish exchange restrictions, introduced following a 5 per cent
devaluation of the peseta during September's foreign exchange upheavals, had
already been partially lifted on October 5.
The Bank of Portugal also pushed up domestic money rates, supplying
liquidity to the banks at interest rates of up to 20 per cent, six points
higher than its regular intervention rate of 14 per cent.
Dealers reported Bank of Portugal intervention to protect the escudo's new
ERM parity. The bank declined to confirm the reports, but said it was
'determined to protect the escudo's stability'.
Greece does not participate in the ERM, but since September has pegged the
drachma against the D-Mark. It announced an increase in interest rates on
Treasury bills - the main financial instrument favoured by foreign
investors.
The interest rate on the one-year bill is expected to be increased from 21.5
to 23 per cent next week.
Norway's central bank meanwhile said its strategy to defend the krone
against devaluation had so far proved successful, with currency starting to
flow back into the country.
The central bank raised the key overnight lending rate to 25 per cent
yesterday from 17 per cent on Friday, when it was increased from 10 per
cent. It currently stands at its highest level since 1986, when it was
briefly increased to 50 per cent, just before the country's last
devaluation.
The central bank also limited the banks' access to borrowing by imposing a
40 per cent interest rate penalty if daily borrowing exceeds the limit.
Norway was the first Scandinavian country to link its currency to the
European currency unit, from October 1990. Sweden abandoned its Ecu link
last Thursday.
Yesterday the Norwegian krone strengthened to NKr8.00539 per Ecu, or some
0.14 per cent below the central Ecu rate, after falling 0.71 per cent below
the rate on Friday.
Dealers said the Bundesbank had helped support the krone and the Bank of

FT  24 NOV 92 / Capital burden eased for financial advisers

INDEPENDENT financial advisers will not have to meet heavy EC demands to
hold a minimum level of capital, Community finance ministers agreed
yesterday.
Ministers exempted independent investment advisers from requirements to hold
Ecu50,000 (Pounds 40,650) of capital as part of a formal agreement on the
investment services directive.
But independent advisers will only be exempt if they simply pass clients'
orders and payments on to dealers, do not deal in shares directly on their
clients' behalf, and are subject to a proper ethical code.
The investment services directive will grant large investment firms a
'single passport' to deal in shares around the Community. Ministers reached
a broad agreement on the principal outstanding problems in June, but
yesterday they eradicated member states' final technical objections.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC financial services commissioner, described yesterday's
agreement as 'the crucial and culminating step in the creation of the
internal market in financial services'.
The directive, which will work in tandem with a measure on capital adequacy
requirements for banks and brokers, covers brokers, dealers, portfolio
managers and underwriters of large share issues.
The final obstacles included Britain's concern that thousands of independent
financial advisers would be crippled by the need to meet minimum capital
requirements. Most member states have not developed a similar network of
independent advisers, although Germany and Ireland will also benefit from
the exemption.
Safeguards will prevent independent advisers exploiting their exemption in
third countries, where they will still be covered by national restrictions.
Ministers also agreed that foreign exchange activities would benefit from
the directive as long as they were linked generally to other broking
activities. They rejected calls for individual transactions to be directly
linked to securities deals.
France and Belgium had argued that banks and brokers would be able to set up
foreign exchange operations in their countries independently of other
activities, but under the compromise agreed yesterday that would not be
possible.
Sir Leon also promised to bring forward legislation which would allow
information on banks, insurance companies and brokers to be passed between
supervisory authorities.

<TEXT>
THE European Community was urged yesterday to strengthen its legislation to
avoid a repeat of last year's collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International.
Sir Leon Brittan, financial services commissioner, suggested to finance
ministers a series of additions and amendments which he thinks should apply
to the whole financial services sector.
Based on the recommendations of four EC inquiries into the BCCI affair, he
wants to:
oblige financial groups to have a transparent corporate structure, easing
supervision;
make it compulsory for such groups to have their head office and registered
office in the same country;
require external auditors to report 'relevant information' on financial
groups to the supervisory authority;
allow financial supervisors to pass information to official inspectors
investigating fraud and abuses of company law.
Sir Leon said he also hoped to strengthen international co-operation between
supervisors by pressing for agreements between the EC and third countries,
particularly the US and Japan. He also wants a ministerial or Commission
recommendation laying out the circumstances in which supervisors could veto
the appointment or reappointment of external auditors.

FT  24 NOV 92 / GE disposal creates US defence group with sales of Dollars
11bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MARTIN MARIETTA, the US defence electronics group, is to pay Dollars 3.05bn
(Pounds 2bn) for the aerospace businesses of General Electric, the US
conglomerate, creating one of the country's largest defence contractors with
combined annual sales of Dollars 11bn.
The takeover is one of the largest of a wave of deals aimed at restructuring
the defence industry in the expectation that the US military procurement
budget will continue to decline.
'The one thing I think I can absolutely promise is that these two companies
will be much better off together than they would be alone,' said Mr Norman
Augustine, Martin Marietta's chairman and chief executive.
Mr John Welch, GE's chairman and chief executive, said his company had
initiated the deal after a strategic review to find the best way of
developing its aerospace division, whose operating profits have stagnated in
a range of Dollars 640m-Dollars 655m over the past four years.
'We decided that clearly Martin Marietta was the best complementary fit . .
. we talked to no one else in the industry,' Mr Welch said.
Mr Augustine said that there was virtually no overlap between their
businesses; GE Aerospace is centred on satellites, radar, sonar and
communications systems while Martin Marietta is stronger in launch systems
and missiles. The two groups had concluded negotiations in only four weeks.
While the deal offers few opportunities for reducing overheads by
eliminating overlapping capacity, Mr Welch and Mr Augustine both said the
newly combined group would be able to compete more effectively in the
tighter defence market.
The new company will start with an order backlog of Dollars 19bn and about
Dollars 3.5bn of civil and commercial business.
Mr Augustine said about Dollars 100bn a year in defence contracts was still
'a non-trivial amount of money in our minds', and strong companies would win
a disproportionate share.
GE will receive about Dollars 800m in cash, Dollars 750m in new debt and
Dollars 1bn in perpetual convertible preferred stock and will retain the
right to Dollars 500m owed to the division by trade creditors. It will also
take two seats on Martin Marietta's board.
GE said the aerospace division will have made a net profit of about Dollars
330m this year, and its sale at slightly over nine timesearnings would
dilute the group's earnings per share by under 2 per cent. The deal would,
however, increase GE's growth rate by 1 to 2 percentage points, and the
dilution should be overcome in less than two years.
Mr Augustine declined to predict the deal's impact on Martin Marietta's
earnings, but said it would increase operating earnings, earnings per share,
free cash flow and free cash flow per share.
Martin Marietta's debt to capitalisation ratio will rise to about 46 per
cent because of the acquisition, but Mr Augustine said this ratio would
return to its current level of about 20 per cent within three years.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Call for auditors to give wider information
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUDITORS should be made more accountable to shareholders and report on a far
wider range of activities in their scrutiny of listed companies, the
Auditing Practices Board said yesterday.
The recommendations follow strong public criticism of the role of auditors
after recent high-profile corporate collapses such as the Maxwell business
empire, BCCI and Polly Peck.
Auditors should provide more detailed information on a company's
performance, management and future viability, said the APB, the body funded
by the accounting profession which was created last year to draw up auditing
standards and guidelines.
In a radical, wide-ranging discussion document on the future development of
auditing, it said there was a need for auditors to report to a wider
audience of 'stakeholders' which might include both existing and potential
debtholders, customers, suppliers, employees and regulators.
In exchange, it says the law must be changed to reduce the exposure of
accountants to litigation and to share the risks of legal action with
directors of companies.
The APB stressed that auditors' are responsible to a company's shareholders
in law and condemns the colloquial use of the word 'client' by accountancy
firms to refer to a company and its directors.
It says that shareholders should be more directly involved in the
appointment, remuneration, scope of work conducted by audit firms, and in
discussion of the auditor's findings.
It welcomes recent calls from other bodies for the appointment of audit
committees in companies, for periodic rotation of auditors and for limits on
the dependency of an audit firm on a single company for fees.
But it rejects suggestions that auditors should not be allowed to conduct
other services such as consulting for audit clients.
It says independence is principally an attitude of mind which must be
controlled within the accountancy firms with strong controls and tight
procedures.
It has asked for comments on its proposals by March 31 next year.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Current account deficithit by rise in imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S current account deficit widened last month to its highest figure
since April after the effects of sterling's devaluation led to a sharp rise
in the imports bill.
The rise in the deficit to Pounds 1.1bn from Pounds 891m in September came
as imports increased by 5 per cent between September and October to Pounds
10.2bn, the highest monthly figure since mid-1990.
The widening deficit was in spite of a strong rise in exports in October
compared with September, which indicates UK exporters are holding their own
in difficult trading conditions caused by the international economic
slowdown.
Much of the large rise in the value of imports was due to the 13 per cent
devaluation in the pound since it left the European exchange rate mechanism
in mid-September. This had the effect of pushing up unit prices of imports
by 3.4 per cent between September and October.
The increased imports suggest that underlying economic demand may be picking
up as part of a recovery. However, any large increases in the prices of
imports in the coming months could increase inflationary pressures, making
it more difficult for the government to keep to its target of maintaining
underlying inflation at beneath 4 per cent.
The increase in exports to a value of Pounds 9.1bn in October from Pounds
8.7bn in the previous month helped sentiment on the stock market, where a
burst of buying support saw the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares reach a
new trading high of 2,745.2. This beat the previous record established in
May shortly after the election.
Profit-taking and uncertainties on world currency markets saw the index lose
ground in late afternoon, to finish an overall 9.5 points down on the day at
2,722.9.
Britain's current account deficit decreased gradually during the early
stages of the two-year recession as demand for imports fell, but has
increased during recent months. The deficit fell to Pounds 6.3bn in 1991
from Pounds 17bn the previous year. In the first 10 months of this year, the
deficit has so far reached Pounds 9.7bn.

FT  24 NOV 92 / ERM states act to aid currencies: EC ministers agree to
consider proposals for co-ordinated package to boost growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SEVERAL European govern-ments yesterday threw a protective ring around the
beleaguered exchange rate mechanism in an effort to prevent another crisis
by sharply raising domestic interest rates.
The moves to forestall the kind of intense selling which drove sterling and
the Italian lira out of the ERM came as finance ministers of the European
Community agreed to explore proposals for a co-ordinated growth package in
response to fears of a 1930s-style slump in Europe.
The ministers will seek to find a common Community position on ways of
stimulating EC growth ahead of next month's Edinburgh summit.
As tension remained high in currency markets yesterday in the wake of the
weekend ERM realignment, Denmark, Ireland, Spain and Portugal sharply
increased their short-term money market rates to stem a tide of speculative
selling of the more vulnerable currencies.
Germany, however, appeared to be resisting pressures to cut its official
interest rates, a move which would significantly ease current tensions
because it would staunch the buying of D-Marks.
As high German rates again came in for criticism from Mr Norman Lamont, the
UK chancellor, Mr Horst Kohler, a senior German finance ministry official,
damped hopes of an imminent cut. He said any decision on rates was for the
Bundesbank alone, and that conditions were not necessarily appropriate to
lower the cost of borrowing at the present time.
In Brussels, Mr Kohler said he hoped that the 6 per cent devaluation of the
peseta and escudo at the weekend would bring some relief to the ERM, but he
went on to say: 'We reject any idea of linking automatically realignments
with interest rate cuts.'
The need to tighten monetary policy to fend off speculation against the
weaker currencies in the middle of a Europe-wide downturn led to renewed
worries about whether the eight-member ERM, which has been existence for 13
years, could continue to survive for much longer without a radical overhaul.
There was particular concern about the French franc - which with the D-Mark
is one of the linchpins of the ERM. The franc weakened against the German
currency yesterday, forcing commercial banks to raise the price of
short-term lending in francs.
Outside the ERM, Norway and Greece raised borrowing rates, while Iceland
devalued its currency by 6 per cent.
After the 6 per cent devaluation of the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo
at the weekend, the chief focus of foreign exchange dealers yesterday was
the Danish krone - seen as a possible target for devaluation, because of
Denmark's trade links with countries which have already devalued.
Dealers argue that, unless Denmark devalues, its exporters will lose ground
to European countries which have already devalued.
Denmark let overnight rates rise to around 50 per cent to give the krone
support. However, the currency closed against the D-Mark at DKr3.8818 ,
close to its ERM floor of DKr3.9016.
In Ireland, the central bank said that it would offer overnight funds to
banks at a rate of 30 per cent and said it was suspending its normal
short-term facility rate of 13.75 per cent.
The Irish punt closed at DM2.6297, but dropped below its ERM floor against
the strongest currency in the system, the Belgian franc.
There was concern that a speculative attack on the Danish krone could herald
similar assaults on other currencies, such as the franc. The franc weakened
sharply against the D-Mark to a close of FFr3.394 from previous FFr3.386.
Three-month money, which was quoted at 9 1/2 per cent a week ago, stood
yesterday at 10 1/16 per cent.
Reflecting the continuing pressure in currency markets yesterday, Spain
acted to tightened its key money rate by three-quarters of a percentage
point to 13.75 per cent, while Portugal's central bank was reported to have
intervened in its money markets to prop up its currency.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories battle to limit Iraq damage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine sought yesterday to head off a Labour assault on the
government's role in the exports-to-Iraq affair by insisting it had faced
'conflicting interests' between helping UK companies and stopping Saddam
Hussein's arms build-up.
His remarks came as Mr John Major disclosed that he saw a minute in August
1990 - after Iraq invaded Kuwait - about potential exports to Iraq by
companies including Matrix Churchill that needed to be stopped. He was
chancellor at the time. The embargo was imposed the same month.
Mr Major also confirmed, in a letter to a Labour MP, that he had known in
October 1990 about the Customs investigation into the company.
Also underlining how Mr Major's involvement in the affair will remain a
focal point at Westminster, Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader,
accused him of 'dereliction of his responsibility' for saying he had not
known about changes to the export guidelines made since 1988.
In a letter to Mr Ashdown, the prime minister said: 'I was not a party to
those decisions and I had no reason to know about them.'
Mr Ashdown said that Mr Major had implied he did not know about the changes
on November 12 - when the prime minister had also written to him about the
affair and when details of the changes were beginning to emerge in
newspapers.
In the Commons, Mr Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, emphasised
the comparatively minor nature of Britain's role in supplying defence
equipment to Saddam Hussein in the late 1980s.
'In interpreting policy guidelines, judgments had to be made about British
contracts for British factories, offering British jobs, in circumstances
where other people in other nations were queueing up to fill those orders if
we didn't,' he maintained, in an increasingly self-assured address delivered
to a noisy Commons.
Out of Dollars 11.3bn of contracts concluded by Iraq for the import of
defence equipment between January 1987 and August 1990, British companies
won just Dollars 200m worth of business, he said.
The speech came as Mr Alan Clark, the former trade minister at the centre of
the affair, said on BBC television: 'I'm not particularly bothered about who
we are trading with, providing the industrial and labour consequences in
Britain are favourable.'
Accusing Mr Robin Cook of quoting selectively, Mr Heseltine asked what
credence could be given to the shadow trade and industry secretary's
allegations if he 'cannot even quote accurately from government documents'.
Mr Heseltine defended the action of himself and three other ministers in
signing public-interest immunity certificates to prevent confidential
government documents being used as evidence in the Matrix Churchill trial.
He 'would not have acted' in the way he did unless he had been 'absolutely
satisfied' that the judge would make available those documents or parts of
documents necessary for the course of justice.
But he avoided answering a question put to him repeatedly by Mr Neil
Kinnock, the former Labour leader, about whether he knew when he signed the
certificate that one of the men on trial had been forwarding information to
the security services.
He sought to undermine Labour charges that the government had not merely
armed Saddam's forces but also paid for the privilege by disclosing that
Iraq took up medium-term credit facilities from Britain in respect of only
Dollars 54.3m worth of military goods between 1983 and 1989 - a figure that
'did not include armaments of any kind'.
Opening the debate, Mr Cook said Mr Major approved a new credit facility to
Iraq in 1987 when he was chief secretary to the Treasury.
'I am sure no one showed him the letter of November 1987 from the Export
Credits Guarantee Department, which said a notional 20 per cent had been set
aside for military business,' he said, in a slighting reference to what he
called the prime minister's 'nobody told me' defence.
He said a Commons written reply from the Department of Trade and Industry
confirmed 'there is Pounds 830m outstanding on which the ECGD might be
invited to honour guarantees in respect of exports to Iraq.'
The Labour party's motion charged that the conduct of ministers in the
matter had been 'inconsistent with the security of British troops, with open
government, and with the just administration of legal process'.
It was defeated by 310 votes to 265, a government majority of 45.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour angry at asylum measure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR staged its own version of a special standing committee yesterday to
demonstrate the range of opposition to the government's controversial Asylum
Bill.
Angered by the government's refusal to agree to this optional parliamentary
procedure for the measure, Labour hired a committee room at Westminster and
called lawyers including Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, former chairman of the Bar
Council, and those with experience of asylum seekers to say why they had
reservations on the bill.
Mr Graham Allen, an opposition home affairs spokesman, said the government
should have set up a special committee to consider the bill instead of
rushing into the main standing committee stage.
The special committee allows MPs to call witnesses and consider a bill's
implications. It is rarely used, and only on legislation where there is some
cross-party consensus.

SCOTTISH nationalists promised a programme of action during next month's EC
summit in Edinburgh including a demonstration in the city to stress their
case for home rule.
Meanwhile Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, announced plans to give Scotland

independent Scotland within Europe was a 'fantasy'.
Asserting that Scots often got on better with continental Europeans than the
English, he offered the prospect of Scotland having more influence in the
EC, while staying within the UK.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Summit focus on Danes, Hurd says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MAIN priority for the Edinburgh EC summit next month would be to find a
solution to Denmark's demands for clarifications of the Maastricht Treaty,
after its rejection by the Danish people in a referendum last June, Mr
Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, told the Commons foreign affairs
committee yesterday.
The difficult task for the UK presidency was to find a way in which Danish
views would be taken into consideration in a legally binding document
without any renegotiation of the treaty. But although a Foreign Office
memorandum submitted to the committee stated specifically that any solution
to the Danish issue must satisfy the concern of other partners that the
treaty itself should not be reopened, Mr Hurd did not entirely rule out the
possibility of amendments to the treaty.
'We cannot have the treaty without the Danes,' he said. He again raised the
possibility that Britain might complete its own treaty ratification
procedures before the second Danish referendum had taken place. The British
parliament was due to complete all stages of the Maastricht ratification
bill by June next year. Although the Danish government had indicated that it
would like to hold another referendum in May 1993, that was by no means a
certainty.
'If everybody waits until everybody else has ratified the treaty, it will
never be done. That is an argument for Kingdom Come,' Mr Hurd told Mr Peter
Shore, Labour MP for Stepney and Bethnal Green.
Mr Hurd made clear that the UK wanted negotiations for an enlargement of the
Community (with Austria, Sweden and Finland) to start next year, even if all
countries had not ratified the Maastricht treaty before they began.
It is highly unlikely that some of Britain's partners would allow
contravention of the firm agreement not to start negotiations with new
applicants until the treaty had been ratified by all members and new
budgetary arrangements had been agreed.
Mr Hurd also said that the European Community's Council of Ministers did not
need to take an immediate decision on the Gatt trade negotiations, thus
lessening the likelihood of a French veto.
The Council of Ministers would not have to take a decision on the Gatt
agreement until after it had been reached, probably not before March next
year.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Biggest haul of cocaine in UK seized
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIGGEST single haul of cocaine in the UK was seized yesterday in an
armed swoop involving the Special Boat Service, armed police and Customs
officers.
The haul, weighing just over a tonne with an estimated street value of
Pounds 160m, was brought into a wharf at Woolwich Reach, London, aboard the
Panamanian-registered vessel Fox Trot Five.
The raid brought cocaine seizures so far this year to about 2.7 tonnes -
more than the total for all of last year, when 1.061 tonnes, worth Pounds
138.4m, was intercepted.
The operation, codenamed Emerge, followed months of intelligence-gathering
and surveillance. The previous record seizure was in July, when 935kg of
cocaine hidden in lead ingots was seized.

SHOP STEWARDS at Ford UK, market leader for new cars, voted yesterday to
ballot on strike action over job losses, Lisa Wood writes.
Officials voted unanimously to ballot the 25,000 hourly paid workers as soon
as possible on industrial action up to and including a strike. Union leaders
are recommending a Yes vote.
In September Ford said it wanted a reduction of 1,487 in the workforces of
its Halewood, Merseyside, and Dagenham, east London, plants. It wanted
voluntary cuts but said that if they had not been achieved by December 11
they would be compulsory.
Unions were offered an alternative: a six-month pay freeze and a cut in
lay-off payments. That was rejected.

SHOP STEWARDS at Ford, UK the leader in the market for new cars, voted
yesterday to ballot on strike action over job losses.
Officials voted unanimously ballot the 25,000 hourly paid workers as soon as
possible on industrial action up to and including a strike. Union leaders
are recommending a 'yes' vote and believe strike action is possible.
In September Ford said it wanted a reduction of 1,487 in the workforces of
its Halewood, Merseyside, and Dagenham, east London, plants. It wanted
voluntary cuts but said that if numbers had not been achieved by December 11
they would be compulsory.
Unions were offered an alternative: a six-month pay freeze and a cut in
lay-off payments. That was rejected this month.
Mr Jack Adams, deputy general secretary of the TGWU general union, said that
the strike ballot decision had not been taken lightly. He said that Ford
clearly found it easier to shed UK workers rather than German or Spanish
workers.
Today hourly paid workers receive the second phase of a two-year pay deal,
which will give them a 5 per cent rise.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ERNST &amp; YOUNG, one of the big six international accounting firms, has agreed
to pay Dollars 400m (Pounds 265m) to settle an array of lawsuits stemming
from its audit work for failed US savings and loan institutions.
The money will be paid to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) and
Resolution Trust Corp (RTC), the federal agencies charged with overseeing
the multi-billion-dollar thrift industry debacle.
The settlement is one of the largest arising from a mass of litigation which
followed the collapse of many S&amp;Ls in the 1980s, and by far the biggest
involving an accounting firm. Mr Ray Groves, chairman of Ernst &amp; Young, said
yesterday that although the agreement was costly it was 'the only realistic
solution to an endless stream of lawsuits that would have been even more
expensive to defend'.
The federal agencies had alleged that Ernst &amp; Young failed to meet required
professional standards and had violated federal regulations in its work for
a variety of thrifts. Some of the S&amp;Ls audited by the firm and involved in
the litigation were among the highest-profile casualties in the sector -
including Dallas-based Vernon Savings &amp; Loan, Silverado Banking in Denver,
and California's Lincoln.
Under yesterday's deal Ernst &amp; Young said the firm itself would pay Dollars
100m, with insurance covering the remainder. The firm will pay the Dollars
100m over four years and expects to fund the sum out of current earnings.
In addition to the cash settlement, Ernst &amp; Young has agreed to a 'cease and
desist' order by the Office of Thrift Supervision, concerning its future
accounting practices. In the order the firm neither admitted nor denied
allegations of improper auditing practices. It did, however, agree to
additional training for auditors in relevant areas, external third-party
review of audit partners' work and various other operational changes.
Three individuals - two former partners and one current partner - signed
consent orders prohibiting them from working for insured financial
institutions, while seven other partners (six current and one former) signed
consent cease and desist orders, requiring additional training.

<TEXT>
BETHLEHEM Steel, the second biggest US steel group, has signed a letter of
intent to sell most of its bar, rod and wire operations to Ispat Mexicana, a
member of the Asian Ispat Group.
Under the terms of the deal, Ispat will acquire the entire operations apart
from the Johnstown wire mill, which Bethlehem has agreed to sell to TMB
Industries of Chicago.
Bethlehem said Ispat planned to follow a modernisation programme which would
essentially follow Bethlehem's earlier plans, including installing a
continuous caster and a rod block at the local plant to increase efficiency
and production capability.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The bar, rod and wire operations bring
in less than 10 per cent of Bethlehem's annual sales of roughly Dollars 4bn.
A Bethlehem spokesman said most of the bar, rod and wire operations were
being sold as a unit to preserve as many jobs as possible.
Tokyo Kyoei Steel, a medium-sized Osaka steelmaker affiliated to Sumitomo
Metal Industries, has suffered a setback in its plans to buy Florida Steel,
a US minimill, after only 54 per cent of bondholders responded to Florida
Steel's buy-back offer.
Kyoei's Dollars 343m offer for Florida Steel was contingent on 90 per cent
of the debentures being tendered. Kyoei has halted its efforts to raise
financing until a sufficient number of debentures are tendered. Either party
can terminate the deal if it is not closed by December 15.

out today

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HACHETTE, the troubled French media group, and Matra, the defence
electronics, company are expected today to announce details of revised terms
for their merger.
The shares of both companies, together with those of MMB, the company that
controls them, were suspended on the Paris stock market pending an
announcement this morning.
The supervisory boards of the three companies, all chaired by the flamboyant
Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere and controlled by his family, met yesterday to discuss
the final plans for the merger.
Hachette, which owns the worldwide rights to Elle magazine, is also expected
to complete plans this week for its recapitalisation. The company's future
has been clouded by uncertainty since the collapse early of La Cinq, the
French television station in which it was the managing shareholder.
The group, which has also been burdened by the legacy of its over-ambitious
expansion in the US during the 1980s, remained in the red with net losses of
FFr39.3m (Dollars 7.4m) in the first half of this year.
Hachette announced this spring that it planned to raise FFr900m in new
equity, together with FFr600m from a convertible bond and FFr1.3bn from
subordinated notes. Mr Lagardere also astonished the Paris stock market by
disclosing plans to merge Hachette with the apparently incompatible Matra,
claiming their union would produce significant savings in central costs.
Matra and Hachette last month announced provisional terms for the merger in
which the former's investors were likely to be offered 11 Hachette shares
for every five of their existing shares.
However MMB's management has since indicated that the terms may be changed
in favour of Matra's shareholders, possibly along the lines of offering five
Hachette shares for every two Matra shares.

<TEXT>
PERU has taken an important step towards settling a series of US lawsuits
filed by international bank creditors more than two years ago, paving the
way for restructuring about Dollars 10bn of outstanding external debt and
interest, writes Alan Friedman in New York.
The lawsuits, launched by more than 200 banks, and seeking to recover more
than Dollars 2bn of debts,were filed to meet a US statute of limitations
deadline.
Yesterday Citibank, which chairs Peru's debt advisory committee, announced
an agreement under which the banks would withdraw their lawsuits if the
Peruvian government drops its concerns about the statute of limitations on
legal claims by the creditor banks. Both sides said they will try to resolve
the dispute by next April 15.

Olympia &amp; York's US subsidiary yesterday gained further breathing space from
two creditors threatening to enforce claims against the ailing real estate
developer, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
*****
Battery Park Holdings, a company linked to Toronto's Bronfman family, agreed
to suspend a lawsuit against O&amp;Y until next April, subject to certain
unspecified conditions. BPH launched proceedings last week to recover
Dollars 75.4m which it alleges O&amp;Y misappropriated from the World Financial
Centre in lower Manhattan. BPH is also claiming Dollars 8.5m in cash flow
from the project.
Separately, Swiss Bank Corporation and O&amp;Y extended for 24 hours yesterday's
5pm deadline set by SBC for compliance with a judgment related to payment on
an Dollars 8m line of credit. The payment relates to one of O&amp;Y's troubled
New York properties.
O&amp;Y had indicated that action by either BPH or Swiss Bank to enforce their
claims would lead it to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the US
bankrutpcy code. The company's US operations are the only ones which so far
remain outside court protection.
*****
The Walt Disney Company, the entertainment group, and Nestle, the
Swiss-based foods company, are to enter a long-term alliance for licensing,
sponsorship and marketing purposes, writes Alan Friedman.
The new accord calls for Nestle to sponsor a pavillion at Disney's Epcot
Center in Florida as well as a sponsor at Disneyland Park and the Walt
Disney World Resort.
The two companies will also co-operate on licensing, marketing and tie-in
promotions.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORGAN Guaranty Trust, the leading US bank, is shifting its market making in
Swiss franc foreign exchange and forward rate agreements (FRA) from Zurich
to London.
The move is another blow to Zurich's status as a financial centre. Morgan is
by far the most active foreign bank in these markets in the Swiss financial
capital, exceeded only by the big three Swiss banks.
'The trend to London will be underlined by our move,' Mr Karl Preisig,
managing director of Morgan's Zurich branch, admitted.
Mr Preisig said the decision was prompted by the need to save money and by
the declining level of activity in Zurich. Most foreign banks have already
given up interbank trading there and even the big Swiss banks have shifted a
large part of their trading to London, he said.
The shift will affect seven of Morgan's 150 staff in Zurich. Six are moving
to London and the other is being reassigned within the bank. Mr Preisig said
Morgan would continue to make markets in Zurich in local products and was
strengthening its contacts with Swiss customers.

<TEXT>
PEPSICO, the large US soft drinks, snacks and restaurants group, yesterday
stepped up its assault on the Spanish market by acquiring Kas, a beverage
brand owner, and Knoor Elorza SA (KESA), a production operation which
manufactures, bottles and distributes for both Kas and Pepsi.
The Dollars 320m deal virtually doubles Pepsi's share of the Spanish
carbonated soft drinks market - traditionally dominated by Coca-Cola, its
big domestic rival - by adding Kas's 6 per cent market share to Pepsi's 7
per cent. A year ago, Pepsi earmarked Spain as a major area for
international expansion, saying it would invest at least Dollars 1bn there
over the next five years in local beverage and food operations.
The Kas and KESA businesses are both majority-owned by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya,
the Spanish bank. Pepsi already holds a 30 per cent stake in KESA, which was
formed in 1989 as a joint venture between the US company and the Knoor
family, which founded Kas.
The aim of KESA was to create a single, country-wide bottling syspten which
could produce and sell Pepsi's soft drinks brands, plus all of Kas's
fruit-flavoured drinks and mixers. Pepsi's bottling had previously been
split between half a dozen franchise operations, and in Cataluna the
business is still franchised to Cadbury-Schweppes. KESA's facilities take in
a 'southern hub' in Seville and a northern centre in Echevarri, Vitoria.
Net annual sales for the combined beverage operations are estimated to be
around Dollars 470m in 1992, and Pepsi yesterday predicted that this figure
could rise to over Dollars 1bn within five years. Most of the products sell
under the Kas name.
In addition to commanding 6 per cent of the carbonated soft drinks market,
Kas also holds around 8 per cent of the juice nectar sector.

Z-LANDERBANK Bank Austria, Austria's largest bank, is to raise its stake in
the troubled securities house Vindobona Privatbank from 25 per cent to 51
per cent.
Bank Austria said the performance and image of Vindobona, set up by four
young equity market specialists two years ago, had not lived up to its
expectations.
Earlier this year, Mr Michael Margules, one of its founders, was charged
with money laundering in the US. In August, the Austrian fraud police opened
an investigation into the part played by some Vindobona employees, including
Mr Michael Lielacher, the chief executive, in issues of shares of Hungarian
companies two years ago.
A Bank Austria spokesman said Vindobona's profits this year were likely to
fall 20 per cent below the expected Sch90m (Dollars 8.04m) to Sch100m level.
The plan is that the founding executives, who own 40 per cent of Vindona,
will agree at a shareholders' meeting on December 3 to sell part of their
holdings to Bank Austria, lifting its stake to 51 per cent.
Mr Lielacher confirmed that he would stand down as chief executive, and Bank
Austria said it would be installing its own managers.

<TEXT>
AIR FRANCE, the French state-owned airline, yesterday disclosed a
bigger-than-expected net loss of FFr2.7bn (Dollars 500m) for the first nine
months of 1992 amid stormy scenes in Paris as employees demonstrated against
job cuts.
The board also yesterday gave final approval to the proposed merger between
Air France and UTA, another French airline. The merger, following which the
UTA businesses will represent two-fifths of the new group, will take effect
from December 29.
The merger has triggered a cost-cutting drive at Air France involving the
loss of 1,500 jobs. The group's employees yesterday staged strikes and
stoppages in protest against the cuts, resulting in the cancellation of some
flights.
More than 2,500 demonstrated outside the group's headquarters, chanting
slogans against Mr Jacques Attali, its chairman, and Mr Jean-Louis Bianco,
France's transport minister.
Air France, which, like other international airlines, has been affected by
the economic slowdown, had originally anticipated net losses of FFr2.5bn for
the first nine months of this year. The outcome was slightly worse than
expected, prompting the board to forecast overall losses of FFr4bn for the
full year, with consolidated losses of FFr3bn on sales of FFr57bn.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Canada's Conrad Black thought that taking control of Fairfax, Australia's
second largest newspaper chain, was going to be trouble free, then he
probably didn't listen to his well-placed friends in Britain's Conservative
party.
It is one thing to upset the local journos by replacing most of the Fairfax
editors, it is quite another to fall out with Malcolm Turnbull, the
lawyer-turned-merchant banker, best known for defeating the British
government in the infamous Spycatcher case. As Lord Armstrong, former
Cabinet secretary, will testify, Turnbull has considerably more clout and
stamina than most corporate gadflys.
Turnbull has teamed up with the Australian Shareholders Association to
oppose a new Fairfax executive option scheme. He claims the scheme, which
will be voted on at tomorrow's Fairfax agm, enriches Black's right-hand man,
Dan Colson.
Defeating the motion would be sweet revenge for Turnbull, who received
substantial fees for working on the Fairfax takeover, but was forced to quit
the bidding consortium after a series of blazing rows with Colson.

Helena Wiesner, a former leading light in the Consumers Association, has

looks after the interests of small insurance policy-holders in the event of
an insurance company not being able to meet its obligations.
Wiesner, who replaces Rosemary McRobert, will serve for one year and
represent the interests of policyholders of authorised insurance companies.
The board was established under the Policyholders Protection Act 1975 and is
financed by statutory levies on the insurance industry as required.
Wiesner, 47, has spent most of her career in the financial services sector.
Before setting up on her own as an independent financial consultant, she had
worked for the Consumers Association for 18 years, most recently as head of
its Economic and Social Group. She is currently a director of LAUTRO and a
member of the Insurance Brokers Registration Council.
The government has also re-appointed Michael Hall, a financial consultant,
as the alternate member who will stand in for Wiesner when necessary. He is
a former member of the Council of the Insurance Ombudsman Bureau.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Pressure mounts on ministers over terror cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRY and its insurers could ask the government to help them launch a new
reinsurance scheme that would pay for any losses caused by terrorists.
The Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce
(Airmic), which represents more than 300 leading companies, and the
Association of British Insurers (ABI), the industry trade association, are
examining details of such a scheme, after a meeting in London yesterday.
The move comes amid widespread concern among businesses about the probable
withdrawal of terrorism cover by most commercial insurance policies. They
fear they will be left without cover for damage by bombs. Mr Alan Fleming of
Airmic said: 'We have to get industry's strength of feeling across to
government.'
Yesterday's meeting was also attended by representatives from the CBI and Mr
John Greenway, Conservative MP for Ryedale and chairman of the Commons
all-party insurance and financial services committee.
Airmic and the ABI are unlikely to call for the government to introduce its
Northern Ireland compensation scheme in mainland Britain. Mr Greenway said
that would give a 'huge propaganda advantage to the IRA'.
Ministers are thought to be concerned about cost. The government has paid
about Pounds 620m for property damaged by terrorists in Northern Ireland
since 1968, while claims from the two London bombs in April are an estimated
Pounds 800m.
Instead, the focus is on ways in which the government and business could
support the reinsurance market, allowing insurers to continue offering cover
against terrorism.
Mr Fleming said Airmic had presented a proposal to the ABI, although no
details were made available.
In a letter to ministers last week, Mr Greenway suggested that the
government work 'in partner-ship with the private sector to provide the
levels of reinsurance that the market was able to offer in the past'.
The Baltic Exchange yesterday agreed a settlement with its insurers for its
St Mary Axe building, which was damaged in the April bomb attack in the
City. Royal Insurance and other insurers have agreed to pay the Pounds 27.6m
claim in full.
Sales of all types of life assurance policies fell in the third quarter of
this year, while sales of single-premium policies, the industry's most
successful product, fell for the first time since 1984, the ABI said, Norma
Cohen writes.
Mr Mike Jones, chief executive of the association, said the drop largely
reflected the recession and general economic uncertainty.
Sales of personal pensions remained buoyant, largely because of a rise of 35
per cent in single-premium business. Tax rebates from the Department of
Social Services fell by 19 per cent. That suggests that much of the growth
in personal pensions may be due to people who have exhausted all the
available tax benefits topping up their existing pensions.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Gas power plans scaled back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS FOR the construction of eight gas-fired power stations in England and
Wales have been abandoned or delayed in moves that will ease fears that the
electricity market will be heavily oversupplied in the mid 1990s.
The National Grid, which manages the electricity system, said yesterday that
of 28 stations for which it had agreed connection plans earlier in the year,
four had been cancelled and another four deferred.
Disclosures of the delays and cancellations come amid the government's
review of energy policy, prompted by British Coal's pit closure plan.
Displacement of coal-fired power stations by gas-fired facilities has been
one of the main factors in the decline of British Coal's market.
But capacity figures from National Grid do not hold much comfort for British
Coal. They still suggest an oversupplied market which, with present energy
policy trends, will not need large amounts more coal than British Coal
already expects to sell.
National Grid's figures, published with its interim results, confirm an
increase in the share of the electricity market held by the nuclear
industry. Nuclear Electric's share in the first half of this year was 21.4
per cent, compared with 18.5 per cent in 1991-92.
Separately, the environmental group Greenpeace urged the government to close
Magnox nuclear power stations after publishing an analysis which, it said,
showed that a levy on electricity consumers was being used to support the
facilities' losses.
Nuclear Electric, due to give evidence in the House of Commons on the issue
today, responded that electricity generated by the Magnoxes was the cheapest
in the system in 'avoidable' terms. Their early closure would not save any
of the inescapable liabilities.
The cancellation and delay of the eight Combined-Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT)
power stations, with a capacity of 6,000MW, will have been influenced by the
possibility that permission for gas-fired projects will become less likely
after the energy review.
National Grid said that the new gas-fired projects already completed or
under construction suggested that plant margin - that is, the surplus of
capacity over peak demand - would be 32 per cent by 1996-97.
That compares with 22 per cent that could be expected in a typical system.
It is, however, far below the 60 per cent figure suggested earlier this
year, when National Grid included all stations of which it had been notified
but which do not necessarily have planning consent or contracts for gas
supplies.
In all, National Grid knows of 22,876MW of capacity that could be produced
by CCGT projects, but only 10,000 MW of that is totally committed.
The Greenpeace report, based on its interpretation of Nuclear Electric's
accounts, says that only 14 per cent of the Pounds 1.2bn levy notionally
funds the cost of future decommissioning. Even then, it says, there is no
decommissioning fund, so no money has been set aside to deal with
liabilities.
Monktonhall colliery, near Edinburgh, is to supply 3,000 tonnes of coal a
month to ScottishPower for four months for the nearby Cockenzie power
station. The pit is leased by more than 120 former British Coal miners.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Pearson hope for Channel 5
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES Television is hoping to persuade Pearson, the media and industrial
group, to take a 20 per cent stake in Channel 5, the new national television
channel.
The Independent Television Commission has set a deadline of December 4 for
Thames to show that it has raised 70 per cent of the investment needed.
So far only Thorn EMI, the Thames majority shareholder, is prepared to
commit itself to a stake of between 30 per cent and 35 per cent in a venture
likely to cost more than Pounds 100m.
Pearson, which holds stakes in other television ventures, could, under
broadcasting legislation, take a 20 per cent stake in Channel 5.
It is believed that Pearson has been having detailed talks on a potential
stake for the past two or three years. No decision has yet been taken.
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, is one of two UK companies in talks
with Thames.
One of the obstacles is the cost of retuning millions of video recorders
likely to suffer interference from the Channel 5 signal. But engineers now
believe that by broadcasting the signal in a different mode - horizontal
polarisation - the cost can be reduced.

FT  23 NOV 92 / (CORRECTED) Survey of Eastern France (12): Champagne sales
hit hard - Cutbacks and job losses in third bad year for producers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 10th December 1992) appended to this article.
ONE chilly March day this spring, the streets of Reims were packed with
thousands of stony-faced workers, shouting angry slogans and brandishing
placards, in protest against the cutbacks and job losses at the champagne
houses where they work.
The mood of their employers was little different. The champagne industry is
in the throes of its worst crisis since the oil shock of the mid-1970s. The
champagne houses of Reims and Epernay, which flourished in the bullish mood
of the 1980s, have been floundering in the chillier climate of the 1990s.
Champagne sales have been hit by everything from the global economic
slowdown, to the strength of the franc against key export currencies and
fiercer competition from other products, notably sparkling wines. The
champagne houses, now in their third successive year of falling sales, are
struggling for survival against a backdrop of mounting debts and
frighteningly high stocks.
It is easy to paint a picture of the champagne sector as yet another
industry that has fallen victim to the economic woes of the early 1990s. But
even after the economy recovers, the champagne houses will still face the
challenge of getting to grips with the longer term issues of the backlash
against alcohol consumption and adjusting to life in the increasingly
competitive international drinks industry.
Champagne is one of France's oldest and most prestigious products. It is an
important source of employment in the Champagne region to the east of Paris,
with 6,500 people employed directly by the champagne houses and thousands of
others who are indirect employees.
The industry is dominated by LVMH, the giant luxury goods group which owns a
series of champagnes, including Moet et Chandon, Mercier, Pommery and Veuve
Cliquot, as well as a string of cognacs, fashion houses, luxury luggage
makers and perfumes. LVMH towers over the other companies with champagne
sales of FFr4.82bn last year alone.
Other leading players include Seagram and Remy Cointreau, which also have
interests in other areas of the international drinks industry. These large
groups have gobbled up many of the independent houses over the years but
three of the six biggest champagne companies are still in family hands.
Marne et Champagne is majority-owned by the Burtin-Mora family as is
Champagne Taittinger by its founding family. Laurent Perrier belongs to the
Burtin-Mora family, with Banexi and Credit Commercial de France as its other
major shareholders.
These companies, like the rest of the industry, thrived in the 1980s. The
market reached its peak in 1989 when 248m bottles of champagne were sold,
compared with 188m five years before. But as sales rose, so did prices. The
champagne producers had taken advantage of their buoyant market to hike the
price of their product.
By 1990, when the recession really began to bite in the US and western
Europe, champagne sales were hit not only by the fall in consumer purchasing
power, but also by the backlash against high prices. It took time for the
industry to get to grips with the pricing problem. When sales started to
fall, the producers' first response was to try to compensate for depressed
demand by raising prices.
Sales fell by 6.6 per cent to 232m bottles in 1990, according to the Comite
Interprofessionale du Vin de Champagne (CIVC), only to fall again, by 10 per
cent to 214m bottles, in 1991. The worst affected area of the market was
exports. The French market, still the biggest single source of champagne
sales, slipped by 8.1 per cent to 135m bottles last year. But export sales
fell further, by 11 per cent to 75m bottles.
Some export markets declined dramatically. The UK, which had become one of
the industry's most buoyant markets in the 1980s, fell by 34 per cent and
Australia, also reeling from recession, by 33 per cent. In the US, where
sales fell by 13 per cent, champagne was affected both by the economic
crunch and also by competition from Californian sparkling wines, which have
made great strides in quality over recent years.
This year has been little better. Exports have fallen further, as have sales
in France. The CIVC anticipates an overall reduction in sales of champagne
to between 200m and 210m bottles by the end of the year. There have been
reports in the French press of some small houses facing falls in sales of up
to 70 per cent since the start of the year.
The problems posed by this decline in sales are aggravated by the
deterioration in the industry's financial state. Stocks have risen as sales
have fallen. Many champagne houses are now crippled by serious cashflow
problems because of the financial cost of carrying heavy stocks.
Since this spring the market has been flooded by 'fire-sale' champagne as
producers have desperately off-loaded their surplus stocks. Some houses have
been selling champagne for as little as FFr38 a bottle, well below the
production cost of around FFr55. They have chosen to swallow the losses,
rather than face the financial blow of another increase in servicing costs
on their stock.
The champagne houses have also been forced to cut costs. There have been
lay-offs across the industry, even at the largest houses, triggering a spate
of industrial action including strikes at Mumm and Piper-Heidsieck this
spring.
However the industry has also taken tactical steps to try to improve its
position by tightening up the specification for the composition and
production of champagne in an attempt to reduce output. The quantity of
grapes required to make champagne is being increased from 150 kilos a
hectolitre to 160 kilos. Meanwhile the amount of grapes that the vineyards
are allowed to harvest has been reduced from a maximum of 12,000 kilos a
hectare to 10,400 kilos.
These measures should, or so the CIVC hopes, ensure that champagne is
produced in smaller quantities, but at higher quality, thereby enabling the
producers to charge more for its new improved product when it comes on to
the market in 1994 and, hopefully, alleviating the present pressure on
prices.
After all, as Mr Jean-Michel Ducellier, president of the Champagne Houses'
Union, said: 'Champagne is about one thing - quality.'
CORRECTION
An article in the Eastern France survey on November 23 incorrectly stated
that Laurent-Perrier champagne is majority-owned by the Burtin-Mora family.
The company is controlled by the de Nonacourt family, which holds more than
70 per cent of the equity.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Acas talks raise hopes of Tube strike being averted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES ROSE last night that a planned Tube strike may be averted as the RMT
rail union considered calling off action in protest at London Underground's
shake-up of pay and conditions.
Both sides expressed cautious optimism that the all-out, indefinite strike
due to start at midnight tonight would not go ahead following 25 hours of
informal talks at Acas, the conciliation service, over the weekend.
If the left-leaning ruling executive committee of the RMT agrees to call off
strike action it is likely to be seen as an industrial relations coup for
the company. In the past, rail unions have forced London Underground to
abandon less ambitious plans to restructure pay and introduce flexible
working practices.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said last night the talks had
provided 'clarification' on a number of 'important areas', including the
role of the unions in future negotiations.
'My hopes are higher tonight that we can avert a stoppage than they were
when I arrived on Friday night,' he said. A joint statement agreed during
the talks would be put to the union's executive committee this morning.
Mr Ian Arthurton, London Underground's director of passenger services, said
the company had not shifted its position during the talks. It could not
negotiate with just one of the three rail unions.
Aslef, the drivers' union, and the TSSA white-collar rail union are in the
process of balloting members on strike action.
Mr Arthurton said: 'We are hopeful that the RMT executive committee will
take a decision early on Monday to withdraw their strike threat.'
Under the plan all 21,000 employees would switch to salaried status with 30
per cent losing financially after three years and 70 per cent gaining
immediately. About 5,000 jobs would be shed in the next two to three years.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Arts: Killers - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Adam Pernak's electric first stage play, Killers, is about the distinction
between permitted killing - by soldiers - and murder, and indeed whether
such a moral distinction can or should exist.
Killers is set in the north of England during the Gulf war and traces the
fortunes of two brothers. On the day that the elder, David Shand (Mark
McGann), is sent to fight for Kuwait, the younger, Jonathan (Stephen McGann)
murders a man with whom his girlfriend has had a casual affair.
The rest of the action concerns the effect of the double-trauma on the
family, especially Mrs Shand (Rowena Cooper).
The relationship between the parents, unable to face the pity and horror of
their neighbours at the civilian killing and at the absence of their other
son in a war they do not understand, eventually snaps.
The tone is anti-war, anti-prison and anti-establishment. What else would
you expect from a writer who juxtaposes killing for your country and
civilian crime?
Yet there are also ironies. As the real war goes on, father (Sam Kelly) and
sons wage their own private war for control of the stereo system.
Even in the depths of parental misery, where mother and father seek refuge
at the allotment, there are acts of comic violence. As Mrs Shand bears the
brunt of her husband's disappointment with his life, she suddenly hits back,
sweeping away the row of vegetables he has just meticulously planted - again
perhaps a reflection of the wider anarchy.
The character of the mother is a study in the English inability to put
feelings into words. She disapproves of herself for feeling proud of her
sons and is unwilling to admit her fears for them.
The play suggests that parents who legitimise their own powerlessness
through aspirations of their children's glories run a serious risk of
disappointment. Maternal pride is a heavy burden, perhaps too heavy, for
young people to bear.
There is passion and poignancy. The real life brothers McGann deliver strong
performances as both sons are haunted by the ghosts they have created. They
fail to come to terms with what they have done, but do come to terms with
each other.
Their mutual understanding is based on both being killers. In the end they
have a deeper relationship than any other in the play.
Pernak is only 22 and Killers is part of the 20th young writers' festival.
Of course, the play has flaws. The attempted equation between the two
killings is ambitious, perhaps pretentious and does not completely come off.
David kills because it is his professional duty to do so: Jonathan kills
merely in a fit of pique.
Nevertheless, the excitement is sustained throughout. Direction is by Ian
Rickson and there is an effectively unobtrusive set designed by Lucy Hall.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Season of goodwill and runny noses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WINTER IS upon us and tissue manufacturers are praying for a stream of runny
noses.
It is three years since the UK last suffered a big flu epidemic and in the
meantime the market for facial tissues has suffered, with volume sales down
2 per cent on last year.
'I hate to say it, but we are sitting with our fingers crossed for a really
good cold season,' says Mr Paul Southern, product group manager for facials
at Scott, the US paper group. He believes that the market for facial tissues
 -worth about Pounds 140m - has been static for 10 years and is now in
decline.
Mr Southern laments: 'Tissues are a discretionary purchase. People are using
toilet tissue or kitchen towels instead.'
Toilet tissue is not designed for nose-blowing, warns Mr John Waters, trade
market manager for facial tissues at Kimberly-Clark, the US group that sells
Kleenex.
Tissue manufacturers' hopes for a good winter are shared by cold-remedy
manufacturers. So far, the flu figures monitored by Meditex, a London-based
research group, are marginally up on last year.
'It's looking encouraging - at least from our point of view,' says Mr Roger
Crow, marketing manager at the consumer division of Wellcome, the healthcare
company.
At stake is a market for pharmacy-based remedies worth about Pounds 68m a
year, according to Ms Lesley Spokes, product manager for Sudafed, Wellcome's
decongestant remedy and the market leader in the UK. That market is more
resistant, with growth of 1 per cent by volume and 8 per cent by value.
'It's a one-off distress purchase.'
The price of the cold is more than just the cost of tissues and remedies. It
is the world's most expensive disease. SmithKline Beecham, the
Anglo-American healthcare company, reckons a fifth of the UK population
suffers from a cold or flu during any week in the winter. Colds account for
more days off than all other diseases combined.
Increased consumption of hot toddies, a well-known palliative for colds, may
be behind the fact that two thirds of Scotch whisky sales are in the last
third of the year.
However, the Scotch Whisky Association reckons the increase is more likely
to be related to Christmas festivities than the cold. More than 40 per cent
of all alcohol sold in the UK is shipped during the last quarter of the year
 -the season of goodwill and excessive alcoholic intake. And 40 per cent of
all hangover remedies are sold in the four weeks around Christmas.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Rail sell-off proposal stirs controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S plans for pressing ahead with the privatisation of British
Rail are being undermined by growing controversy over the implications for
jobs, train services and fares.
Yesterday the Department of Transport confirmed that delays in the
legislative timetable meant the rail privatisation bill, due to be published
this month, was unlikely to appear before the new year.
That has enabled opponents of privatisation - including many hostile forces
in BR - to build up a row similar to the one that forced a government
rethink over pit closures.
The first shot in the campaign appears to have been fired with BR's
announcement last week that 5,000 rail jobs are to go in the next four
months, with more big cuts in later years.
In breach of normal convention, it emerged, BR failed to discuss the
proposed cuts with the Transport Department before making its announcement.
Ministers are angry that the job losses were allowed to become linked with
the government's privatisation plans. Mr John MacGregor, transport
secretary, is today expected to say the job losses are a commercial reaction
to BR's downturn in revenues and have nothing to do with privatisation.
Some Tory backbenchers who favour the principles of privatisation are
beginning to question whether the depth of a recession is the right time to
press ahead with it. Among the concerns are:
BR's workforce of 138,000 will suffer cuts running into tens of thousands.
Loss-making rural passenger services will be threatened with closure because
the private sector will require large subsidies to operate them.
Track charges will make Railfreight unviable.
Fares will rise as the railways are put on a more commercial footing.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Companies reveal wider-ranging data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COMPANIES are disclosing numerous non-financial indicators of their
performance, a study by Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based annual report
monitoring service, has found.
Information - including production and sales volumes, market share, and
research and development data - is appearing in the reports of many
companies, the analysis of the FT-SE 100 top quoted companies found.
Little of the data is quantified or comprehensive, though, and most details
emphasise the companies' strengths and not their weaknesses.
The report suggests that the measures can be a valuable tool and are
sometimes more reliable than financial measures because they are not
affected by price changes or accounting policy choices.
The most widespread non-financial data cover the number of outlets, branches
and offices, shown by two fifths of companies.
Other commonly published indicators include market positioning, production
volume, sales volume, market share and number of customers.
Most data appear in the chairman's statement, operating review or directors'
report. The study says BAT, British Gas, Grand Metropolitan, Lonrho and
United biscuits are among the best at disclosing quantified measures.
The Accounting Standards Board's proposals on the operating and financial
review statement encourage the disclosure of non-financial information. The
study warns that core measures must be systematic and comparable over time
to be meaningful.
The board's decision to withdraw the requirement in the profit-and-loss
account notes to show revenue investment on items such as advertising means
that many such disclosures will be entirely voluntary.
The study shows that those disclosing revenue investment activities are very
few, with 22 per cent showing no such information and 48 per cent showing
only research and development expenditure, which they are obliged to
publish.
There was no apparent connection between the industry sector and the level
of type of disclosure.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Unions 'win less recognition'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION recognition at workplaces set up in the 1980s was much lower than in
previous decades, a study suggests.
The research into the reasons behind employers' recognition of unions
concludes that it is a 'long-term decision made at or near the set-up date
of an establishment'. It argues that product and labour-market structure at
that date play an important role in determining union recognition.
The study suggests that factors such as industry-wide union density,
technology, and expected workforce composition are crucial to recognition.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Fujimori appears to win clear majority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori appeared last night to have won an absolute
majority in Peru's new 'democratic constituent congress', according to exit
polls published by the Lima-based opinion research organisation, Apoyo, as
voting closed.
The official party formed from his own Cambio (Change) 90 party and New
Majority, a group of independents which includes several former cabinet
ministers, is expected to take 44 of the 80 seats. The Popular Christian
party took second place with about eight, followed by the Independent
Moralising Front and Renovation.
The 18-member congress will replace the two-chamber parliament dissolved by
Mr Fujimori on April 5. It is charged with writing a new constitution, as
well as fulfilling legislative and watchdog functions, and is expected to
satisfy international demands for a return to formal democracy.
Polling stations were under heavy military guard and security around the
capital was tight. Early morning voting was light and polling was extended
for 90 minutes to allow as many as possible of the 11m electorate to cast
their votes.
The electoral process, monitored nationwide by a team of 200 observers from
the Organisation of American States, appeared to have been orderly. There
were no reports of violence despite earlier fears that Sendero Luminoso
guerrillas had planned to disrupt voting.
Peru's two largest traditional political parties boycotted the elections.
They claim the new congress will be reduced to rubber-stamping decisions
taken by the executive branch.

FT  23 NOV 92 / The ERM Realignment: Norway overnight lending rate up again
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S central bank last night was forced to raise its key overnight
lending rate for the second time in three days following the realignment of
the Spanish and Portuguese currencies in the ERM, which failed to relieve
pressure on the krone, Karen Fossli reports from Oslo.
The Bank of Norway increased the key rate to 25 per cent from 17 per cent,
the level to which it was raised on Friday after Sweden floated its currency
and interest shifted to the krone as a possible target for devaluation.
Both the finance minister and the governor of the central bank have promised
to use every weapon available to defend the krone.
The minority Labour government last night also announced the abolition of
electricity tariffs charged to heavy industry, in a move designed to bolster
competitiveness against Sweden, the country's main trading partner, since
the devaluation of its currency.
The abolition from Friday of the electricity tariff has been estimated by
analysts to enable annual saving of NKr800m (Pounds 82m) to industry.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Now the tough talks can begin: The EC and US have
compromised on farm trade, but the Uruguay Round is a long way from
completion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Free trade, one of the greatest blessings which a government can confer on a
people, is in almost every country unpopular,' wrote Thomas Babington
Macaulay in 1824.
The US and EC negotiators who on Friday settled a long-standing dispute over
EC subsidies to oilseed farmers, and made a potentially historic
breakthrough on their two-year dispute over reform of Europe's farm
subsidies regime, may find comfort in Macaulay's words as they read of
French farmers rampaging across their countryside in defence of subsidies
that have distorted the agriculture sector for decades.
Friday's compromises, which defused an imminent and possibly ruinous trade
war, have also paved the way for resumption of long-stalled multinational
negotiations aimed at ambitious and unprecedented reform of international
trade.
This so-called Uruguay Round aims for the first time not just to liberalise
farm trade; it would reform the quota-blighted trade in textiles and
garments; open markets up to trade in services; impose rules protecting
patents and copyright; cut tariffs across the world by at least 30 per cent;
and strengthen rules for settling international trade disputes.
'The real victory is for international trade,' said Mr Ray MacSharry, the
EC's agriculture commissioner, who  - along with Mr Edward Madigan, his US
counterpart  - played a pivotal role in settling the long-standing farm
trade dispute. But neither he, nor any of the other trade negotiators
involved in Friday's breakthrough, is so disingenuous as to believe all will
now be plain sailing.
The first and most severe problem facing trade negotiators is one of time.
The Uruguay Round, launched in the coastal resort of Punta del Este six
years ago, should have been completed two years ago. Deadlock on reform of
farm trade has blocked progress in all of the other areas since the end of
1990. But the package must be complete before March 1 next year, when the US
administration's 'fast track' authority expires. Uruguay Round negotiators
know they must have the package complete by March 1 or face the danger of it
being torn apart by the US Congress.
Settling the many outstanding Uruguay Round issues 'will be a day and night
exercise,' Mr Arthur Dunkel, director general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), the trade watchdog that has the task of
negotiating agreement between the 108 countries participating in the round.
'The first decision we have to make is the decision to conclude the round,'
says Mr Dunkel: 'If we have this decision, then one way or another, we can
be sure the work will be done.' A focal point for final agreement is Mr
Dunkel's 'final act', an inch-thick draft settlement which he published in
December last year in a bid to forge a breakthrough. Much of the detail of
an agreement is already documented in the 'final act', and Mr Dunkel will be
fighting hard to ensure speedy progress by limiting changes to the minimum
possible.
The first task of negotiators gathered back in Geneva will be to win wide
international backing for the US-EC farm trade deal. Particularly important
here will be the Cairns Group of farm exporting nations, which includes
countries such as Australia, Canada, Argentina and New Zealand. It was the
walkout led by Argentina in Brussels two years ago over the inadequacy of
Europe's proposals for reform of farm trade which almost scuppered the
round. All of these countries have made it clear that they will not open
their markets in areas such as services unless farm trade reforms are
adequate.
The US, with the backing of other farm exporters, was initially pressing for
the elimination of the EC's farm subsidy regime. This was probably never the
real US objective, but it raised expectations. Gatt officials are optimistic
that the more modest cuts agreed on Friday, which range from a 36 per cent
cut in the value of subsidised farm exports over six years to a 21 per cent
cut in volume, will be enough. The reforms are unlikely to provide
significant new export opportunities into Europe, but will be valuable if
world food prices rise following a decline in the volume of EC food
surpluses dumped onto world markets.
The next task in Geneva will be to press countries to open their markets to
trade in services. This already accounts for at least 19 per cent of world
trade  - about Dollars 810bn in 1990  - and is forecast to be a booming area
in the decades ahead. The US and the EC have jointly called for 'maximum
liberalisation and minimum exemptions', but a number of areas remain
fiercely controversial:
Financial services  - which embrace banking, securities, and insurance - are
especially important to countries such as the US, France, the UK and
Germany. In Brussels a month ago, US and EC trade negotiators agreed a
common position, and plan joint action to cudgel compromise from key
countries including Japan, Korea and the five Asean nations of Singapore,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand  - all of whom have made
'woefully inadequate' market-opening offers so far, according to US
officials.
Telecommunications: the world's 12 main telecoms markets  - including the
US, the EC, Japan, Canada and Australia  - are understood to be close to
agreeing an 'extended negotiation' which will last for two years, leading to
rules for opening up basic telecommunications to international competition.
Audio-visual services  - that is, the international marketing of films,
videos and television programmes  - is particularly important to the US, and
particularly contentious in Europe. Films and TV programmes were the US's
second most important export to the EC last year, according to US trade
officials. The EC's Dollars 30bn market in these services accounts for
almost a third of total world trade, and would be even more lucrative if it
were liberalised. At present, France insists that 60 per cent of any
prime-time television programming should be of EC origin. Other member
states want between 40 and 50 per cent. There are strict limits on video and
film production and distribution. The US will not be alone in pressing the
EC for a significant market-opening offer in this sector.
Maritime services has attracted a great deal of controversy, but it is
uncertain whether reform of 'cabotage' arrangements  - allowing foreign
ships to carry cargo between two ports inside any one country  - will be
possible. Some liberalisation of international shipping will be pressed for,
along with action against 'closed' shipping conferences which allow shippers
plying a route to block new entrants.
Government procurement contracts have long been closed to international
competition, and again have been an important target for US trade
negotiators. Reforms will be resisted by powerful domestic industrial
lobbies, particularly in the construction sector. Even the US could face
local controversy, where the 'Buy America' act, under which state and local
authorities must buy US-made products where available, is widely used to
ensure government contracts go to local companies.
The third task in Geneva  - and perhaps the most time consuming  - will be
to negotiate tariff cuts across a wide spectrum of industrial and
non-industrial goods, and to press governments to replace non-tariff
barriers to trade (such as quotas) with simple tariffs.
These market-access negotiations are particularly cumbersome because they
have to be negotiated bilaterally between all 108 countries involved in the
Uruguay Round.
The overall aim is to obtain average tariff cuts of at least 30 per cent,
but difficult issues have yet to be resolved:
Zero-for-zero versus tariff peaks: the US is pressing for the EC to
eliminate entirely its tariffs on a number of goods  - particularly in the
chemicals and pharmaceuticals areas. At the same time, the EC has been
unwilling to agree these zero-for-zero deals unless the US agrees to attack
some of its high tariffs on products such as glassware and ceramics. EC
officials appear confident that compromise is possible.
Rice imports for Japan and South Korea: this issue falls at the intersection
between farm trade and market access. Up to now, Japan and South Korea have
kept their local rice markets firmly closed, bowing to pressure from vocal
farm lobbies which are potentially more violent even than French farmers.
Following US-EC agreement to liberalise farm trade, these countries will
come under pressure first to open at least 3 per cent of their markets, and
then slowly to cut tariffs  - which may initially be set as high as 700 per
cent.
Bananas have become a controversial issue for Europe, where preferential
import quota regimes targeted at former French and British colonies have
attracted criticism inside the Gatt. Demands for comprehensive replacement
of quotas with tariffs will force such arrangements to be dismantled,
arousing consternation particularly among small Caribbean island exporters.
Banana trade may appear to be an arcane area for heated controversy, but its
symbolic importance is likely to be great if Japan or Korea could use it to
prevent concessions on rice trade. If the only way to force Japan and Korea
to open up their rice markets is to accept tariffs in banana trade, the
Community may have no choice but to compromise.
But perhaps as sensitive an issue as any is what the Japanese government
decides to do. So far, the US-EC dispute has sheltered the Japanese from any
difficult decisions. Significant concessions in the coming weeks will be
called for from Japan, and if it fails to deliver, it might not only scupper
the Uruguay Round, but also lay the ground for a potent anti-Japanese
backlash, particularly in the US.
As Mr Dunkel said after talks in Washington last week: 'The hour of Japan
has come.'

FT  23 NOV 92 / Construction Contracts: Air separation plant in Yorkshire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CLUGSTON CONSTRUCTION has begun work on a contract to build a Pounds 20m air
separation plant for Air Gas Production (AGP) at Eggborough power station in
North Yorkshire.
The plant, which has a 10 megawatt electrical load, is to be built on land
adjacent to National Power's Eggborough power station so that it can have a
direct electrical supply, avoiding the use of the local electricity system
and thereby reducing capital and running costs. AGP will create 35 jobs when
the plant is operational at the end of 1993.
The 10-year agreement with National Power is believed to be the first of its
kind and has been made possible by the privatisation of the UK electricity
industry.
It is also the first air separation plant to be built by AGP, a joint
venture between AGA Gas UK and Distillers MG, which are the UK subsidiaries
of AGA AB of Sweden and Messer Griesheim Gmbh based in Germany.
The construction contract for infrastructure, drainage, foundations and
buildings was awarded to Clugston by Linde AG of Germany, the turnkey
contractors.
The plant will produce nitrogen, oxygen and argon from atmospheric air for
industrial customers.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of Eastern France (13): New investment incentives -
Chalons-sur-Marne, capital of the Champagne-Ardenne region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE many other provincial towns across France, Chalons-sur-Marne has seized
the opportunity offered by decentralisation of local government in recent
years to initiate a wave of investment.
Chalons-sur-Marne, capital of the Champagne-Ardenne region, badly needs to
invest to attract private sector industry to counterbalance its
uncomfortably heavy dependence on public sector jobs.
Accordingly, Chalons-sur-Marne will early next year open a 56-hectare
business park at Les Escarnotieres, just outside the town, which will offer
a range of tax, social security and job creation incentives for arrivals.
Further ahead, there are plans for a FFr400m to FFr500m freight airport, due
to be one of Europe's largest, on the site of a military airbase at nearby
Chalons-Vatry, jointly funded by the town, the chamber of commerce and
private sector banks. The project has run into resistance from Aeroports de
Paris, the French airports authority, unwilling to see freight business move
from Orly to the provinces. However, the city authorities are optimistic,
thanks to promises of support from the European Commission. If successful,
the scheme is due to open by the end of 1995.
The airport project is also, incidentally, an example of the surprisingly
close co-operation between the Communist-run city and the conservative
controlled Chamber of Commerce - 'it is essential that we work together to
provide the best tailored solutions for companies,' says Mr Christian
Bernard, the chamber's manager.
The region and the Marne departmental councils are also controlled by the
right, but despite these political differences there is broad agreement with
the city on local planning and economic development.
Chalons-sur-Marne is doing its utmost to play on its geographical advantages
to attract businesses to the area. The town's great asset is to be
positioned on the junction between France's main west-east motorway - half
way from Calais to the German border - and the country's main southern
motorway from Paris to Milan.
The southern route, the A26, follows the line of the ancient Via Agrippa,
indicating that the town has a historic claim as a distribution centre. It
is no accident that distribution companies fill eight pages of the local
telephone book, including Harris Distribution, the UK group which opened a
depot there last year.
A combination of historical accident and design means that 40 per cent of
Chalons-sur-Marne's workforce is employed by the state. Big local state
employers include France Telecom, the post office, the SNCF rail board and
the regional and Marne departmental offices.
'We are a town of civil servants, which means we are relatively prosperous,
but have a weak industrial base,' explains explains Mr Pierre-Yves Danion,
economic adviser to the Communist mayor, Mr Jean Reyssier.
This has cushioned Chalons-sur-Marne from the decline of traditional
industries which have badly hit neighbouring areas like the Vosges, so that
it has an unemployment rate of 9 per cent, well below the national average.
Yet it is only too conscious that this cushion could deflate at a time when
central government is looking for new ways to control its budget deficit. As
a result, the town hall is badly short of business tax, a locally levied
payroll and turnover charge which forms an important part of its funding.
This, argues Mr Danion, is another example of how central government has
shifted more responsibility to local authorities without giving them the
full means to exercise their new role.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of Eastern France (11): Tri-national heritage -
Mulhouse, the industrial heart of Alsace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE the late 18th century, Mulhouse has variously been part of
Switzerland, Germany and France, a heritage which has left deep traces in
the form of an eclectic way of life. Today, a casual visitor, arriving at
Mulhouse-Basel airport - which straddles the Swiss frontier and is jointly
managed with the Swiss authorities - can be forgiven for wondering which
country Mulhouse is in, writes William Dawkins.
Mulhouse city dwellers, like other residents of Alsace, speak of the rest of
France as if it were another country, calling it simply 'the interior.'
Their local newspapers are in French and German and 35,000 Mulhouse
residents - nearly 15 per cent of the population - cross the German border
to go to work every day, in search of higher wages across the Rhine. Few
German workers come the other way, into France, though Mulhouse does boast a
community of German companies.
The city practises Swiss-style environmental policies, with a recently
launched programme to collect household waste in recyclable plastic bags. It
holds regular joint municipal planning sessions with Freiburg, its nearest
German neighbour. It also boasts positively Teutonic labour relations
stability, with one notable exception: the strike at the local Peugeot plant
three years ago.
'Traditionally, we are an attractive centre for German companies who want to
get into the French market, with all its special characteristics. We are
also attractive to international companies who see this as a good base from
which to serve northern Europe without having to set up in Germany,'
explains Mr Laurent Kammerer, head of the mayor's private office.
The city has a plentiful pool of labour though city officials do complain of
a skills shortage. This is partly because of a fast-growing immigrant
population of nearly 18 per cent, many of whom have been attracted by the
local car industry. A rise in the National Front vote, to 23 per cent in
Alsace generally in the last regional election, could be a worrying
consequence. However, city officials attribute this more to regional
dissatisfaction with the centralising Paris bureaucracy than to social
tension.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of Eastern France (8): Talented lobbyist -
Strasbourg's mayor has a twin-track career
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE vivacious Mrs Catherine Trautmann, the 41-year-old mayor of Strasbourg,
is in the forefront of the young generation of leaders to have seized the
initiative from Paris in defending Alsace's interests, writes William
Dawkins.
Mrs Trautmann's unexpected victory in the municipal elections three years
ago gave the traditionally centre-right Strasbourg its first Socialist mayor
since the 1920s. She wasted no time in exercising her talent for lobbying
the Paris bureaucracy by leading a Franco-German campaign to put pressure on
a reluctant SNCF rail board to build a new Train a Grande Vitesse line east
from Paris to Strasbourg.
When the SNCF complained that the French section of the line would not be
profitable enough to be built without heavy financial help from local
government, Mrs Trautmann promptly formed an association of the French and
German cities concerned to prove to the Paris government that the line would
be highly profitable if linked to the German high speed rail network.
'It is an axis of integration to link the European Community to its new
members in the east,' argues Mrs Trautmann, who accuses the SNCF of viewing
the project on a narrowly French perspective. The line is expected to come
into service in 1999 or 2000, depending on the outcome of the dispute
between the SNCF and the regions over financing.
This European reflex is typical of Mrs Trautmann's style; she is also an
active member of the European parliament. 'Strasbourg is a laboratory for
Europe and we want it to stay that way,' she says. Like an increasing number
of French politicians, Mrs Trautmann, a one-time junior minister under the
former government of Mr Michel Rocard, attaches great importance to building
her local power base. Earlier this year, she refused the offer of another
ministerial job on the grounds that she wanted to keep her twin mandate as
mayor and European MP.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of Eastern France (9): A flexible workforce - The
transformation of Peugeot at Mulhouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRAMATIC changes have taken place over the past three years at the Mulhouse
assembly plant of Peugeot, the car maker which is the biggest employer in
Alsace, writes William Dawkins.
In the autumn of 1989, the sprawling suburban plant, which occupies more
than 350 hectares - nearly the same size as the centre of Mulhouse itself -
saw the start of one of the most damaging pay strikes in Peugeot's history.
The dispute spread to Sochaux - Peugeot's other main centre in neighbouring
Franche Comte - inflicting a serious blow on Alsace's traditional reputation
for stable labour relations. Since then, the Mulhouse plant and its 12,500
staff have overcome that trauma to become an industrial success story.
Mulhouse has been among the leaders in the Peugeot group in adapting
Japanese-style production efficiencies, team management and just-in-time
stock control, under its new production director Mr Alain Baldeyrou, who
joined just after the strike.
In recognition of this, Peugeot chose Mulhouse last year for the assembly of
the 106, its latest hatchback, currently rolling off the production lines at
1,400 vehicles per day, the highest output in the plant's 30-year history.
Over the past 10 years, Mulhouse has reduced the period from order to
delivery at the factory gate from more than 10 days to around seven and a
half, and slashed its costs.
Suppliers now deliver at least daily, as a result of which nine component
producers have moved to Alsace to be able to keep to Peugeot's rigorous
delivery schedules.
Inside the plant, says Mr Baldeyrou, 'we've tried to create motivation among
the operating personnel by making office staff understand that they are at
the service of the operators.'
This strategy means that Mulhouse only allows machine or car design changes
to go ahead after consulting machinery operators, a previously unusual
practice in the French car industry. By the same token, its workforce are
encourage to come up with ideas for improvements in car components and
design. The coach-building shop alone has proposed 7,000 improvements over
the past year, says Mr Baldeyrou with satisfaction.
The transformation of Peugeot at Mulhouse is a testament to the flexibility
and dependability of the local workforce, believes Mr Baldeyrou. More than
15 per cent of the workers there are foreign, equally divided between the
European Community and North Africa, with the rest mainly from Alsace.
However, any local employer also has to be wary of competition from more
generous employers across the German frontier, only 10km away, where
salaries are significantly higher, he warns.
Peugeot used to suffer from workers leaving to earn more in Germany, though
Mr Baldeyrou says that problem has receded over the past year as the German
economy runs into difficulties.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of Eastern France (7): International identity -
Strasbourg, capital of Alsace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRASBOURG is the most western city in Mitteleuropa, according to its
forceful young mayor, Mrs Catherine Trautmann (see personality profile,
below).
Strasbourg, the capital of Alsace, looks and feels almost like a German
provincial town, with its steep tiled roofs and half-timbered houses. Yet
its identity is firmly international.
The city's traditional European credentials - as the venue for the plenary
sessions of the European Parliament and the base of the Council of Europe -
were recently re-inforced when its citizens produced a 72 per cent 'yes'
vote in the September referendum on European political and monetary union -
the biggest pro-Maastricht majority in France.
President Francois Mitterrand was no doubt grateful for this, but the result
was unsurprising, because many thousands of Strasbourg residents owe their
living to various forms of European co-operation.
The parliament, the fast-expanding council, the European Court of Human
Rights and the institutions associated with them have been joined over the
past year by the planning team for Europol - the Franco-EC police
co-operation unit - and Arte, the new Franco-German cultural television
channel.
It was partly a recognition of Strasbourg's diplomatic and intellectual
richness, as well as France's busiest conference centre outside the capital,
that the French government chose it as the new site for the elite civil
service college, the Ecole Nationale d'Administration. The college will move
there from its Paris headquarters next January.
The city is, however, far more than a think-tank on the Rhine. It also
happens to be France's second banking centre after Paris, harbouring the
headquarters of nine big regional banks, representing a balance sheet total
of FFr220bn.
This is a reflection of the town's long history of innovative banking,
founded on Franco-German trade and its skill in adapting the concept of
mutual banking from the German invader at the end of the last century.
Credit Mutuel, Alsace's largest bank, broke new ground again in the early
1970s by becoming the first French bank to offer insurance policies,
launching the idea of 'bancassurance' now widely followed by its national
competitors.

disputed with Paris
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern France faces a continuing wrangle with Paris over the financing of a
new Trains a Grande Vitesse high speed rail link from the French capital
through Strasbourg and on to Germany's Inter-City Express network. The line,
due to open early in the next decade, is urgently wanted across the eastern
region. Alsace sees the line as an important step in the economic
development of the upper Rhine valley and a catalyst to trade between France
and eastern Europe.
Distances by main road routes from the Lorraine metropolis to other European
cities are as follows:
Paris           300 km.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of Eastern France (4): Textbook solution - Epinal's
industrial diversity brings success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EPINAL, capital of the department of Les Vosges, is a textbook case of how
to respond to the long-term decline of a traditional industry.
Until 30 years ago, it was the thriving capital of the French textiles
industry, known for its images d'Epinal, popular cotton prints of French
historical scenes.
Since then Epinal and the wooded valleys around it have lost 35,000 textile
industry jobs in the face of low-cost Far Eastern competition, so that today
the sector employs only a quarter of the workforce. Les Vosges' reputation
as an area that fears it has much to lose economically was further
re-inforced when it produced a solid majority against the Maastricht treaty
in the September referendum. Yet Epinal has survived the textile downturn
surprisingly well, by turning its mechanically well-qualified and
comparatively cheap workforce to other sectors, such as paper - another
traditional Vosges industry - and engineering, which between them now employ
a quarter each of the department's workforce.
The Vosges softwood forests and the proximity of cheap nuclear-generated
electricity have attracted leading Scandinavian paper companies on the
look-out for an entry to continental Europe, such as Norsk-Skog Industrier,
which last year opened a FFr2.8bn paper plant at Golbey just outside Epinal,
the department's biggest ever foreign investment.
Engineering has become the department's biggest single employer, partly
through the creation of small independent businesses by former textile
workers.
The sector has also been helped by the arrival of foreign investors like
Trane, the US producer of heating and cooling equipment which is the largest
private sector exporter in Lorraine, and whose presence has inspired the
start-up of around 10 subcontractors since its arrival at Golbey in the
early 1960s.
'We have found here a flexible workforce, able and willing to adjust to new
techniques,' says Mr Antonio Gallo, Trane's sales director for Europe and
Africa.

Profile of the mayor of Epinal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PHILIPPE SEGUIN is better known as a leading rebel member of the
conservative RPR party than as mayor of Epinal, a job he has held for the
past nine years, writes William Dawkins.
Now aged 49, Mr Seguin achieved national distinction two months ago when he
emerged as leader of the campaign against the Maastricht treaty on European
monetary and political union.
His arguments that the treaty was an affront to national sovereignty
reflected the mood of his own electorate in Epinal and Les Vosges (where Mr
Seguin is also MP), which showed up as islands of anti-Maastricht sentiment
in the otherwise pro-treaty region of Lorraine.
His Maastricht campaign reinforced Mr Seguin's claim as a possible successor
to Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR leader, despite a lacklustre performance in a
television debate with President Francois Mitterrand.
Unlike his counterpart in Strasbourg, Mr Seguin was not born and brought up
in the town where he is mayor - a common phenomenon whereby French political
parties 'parachute' promising supporters into local government jobs.
Mr Seguin, born and educated in Tunisia before its independence from France,
is a graduate of the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the training ground
for many in the French political and business elite, and was a junior
minister in the 1986-1988 Gaullist government. He looks likely to become an
influential member of the French cabinet if, as seems likely, the right wins
next March's legislative elections.
Far from neglecting Epinal in pursuit of his national ambitions, Mr Seguin
has cultivated his local base, working hard to lobby foreign companies to
come to Les Vosges and overseeing an unprecedented increase in investment in
leisure and cultural facilities by local government in Epinal.
He complains, however, that the economic development of Les Vosges is
handicapped by a lack of co-operation between towns and communes; a
shortcoming apparent in many other French provinces as they get to grips
with decentralisation.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of Eastern France (3): Industrial turnaround - An
emphasis on technical education pays off in Nancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS hard to imagine that Nancy, an elegant and prosperous town with some
of the finest 18th century buildings in France, has ever seen an industrial
crisis.
Yet the area around the largest town in Lorraine has lost more than 10,000
jobs over the past decade, mainly from the state-owned steel plants at
nearby Pompey and Neuves-Maisons.
Over the same period, more than 8,000 new jobs have been created, partly
thanks to a wave of foreign investment, and partly thanks to start-up
businesses fostered by the departmental and city authorities. As an
industrial centre, Nancy, has traditionally been a base for chemical,
clothing and food-processing industries. It has also developed as a
financial and administrative capital.
'We have survived the crisis of re-industrialisation better than Lorraine as
a whole because of our tradition of technical education,' claims Mr Bernard
Guerrier de Dumast, deputy mayor and president of Nancy Technopole, the
town's technological showpiece. The Technopole, built up over the past 20
years by the city and regional authorities, provides cheap office space and
advice for about 100 small businesses grouped on Nancy's university park,
with start-up capital available through the Institut Lorrain de
Participation. The intellectual nucleus for all this comes from Nancy's
three universities - the first of its universities was founded as far back
as 1572 - and its five prestigious civil service technical schools, which
were originally established to train engineers for the coal and steel
industries. They are now being encouraged by the Technopole to bring forward
high technology projects that could be turned into commercial propositions
on site. The body responsible is Promotech, a small business consultancy
service backed by the city authorities, which estimates that 80 per cent of
its clients are still in business 10 years after starting up. Nancy does
not, unlike some other towns, pump aid into start-up businesses, emphasises
Mr Guerrier de Dumast - 'that would be complete folly and only harm the
businesses which already exist,' he explains. 'On the other hand, our job is
to help them do well.'

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of Eastern France (5): Korean investment - New colour
TV plant at Fameck, near Metz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   I don't believe in global production
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
we need to manufacture near the market,' says Mr Soonhoon Bae, president of
Daewoo, the Korean electronics giant, explaining his decision to start
making colour TV sets in Lorraine.
Daewoo is building a FFrs100m plant at Fameck, near Metz, which it hopes
will start production next spring, without output rising to 400,000 units by
1994-5.
'We looked at several European countries, but ruled out Germany because some
fellow Korean companies had not had a very happy experience there and the UK
because of transport costs,' Mr Bae says.
Daewoo was attracted to France, for two reasons:
First, wage costs there are competitive, at least with the rest of Europe.
Second, the French government is no longer - despite (or perhaps
increasingly because of) the continued problems of its own maker of TV sets,
Thomson - hostile to Asian companies setting up in competition on French
soil.
Having decided on France for TV manufacture, Daewoo then looked at various
sites. But it eventually rejected the idea of taking over facilities being
abandoned by Alcatel at Cherbourg and Bull at Belfort, and opted for a green
field site at Fameck.
'Within a 500 kilometre radius of Fameck, you have a market of some 50-60m
people', says Mr Bae.
Another possible site for Daewoo TV-making with the same general
geographical advantage was Strasbourg. But the Korean company decided to go
further north, because it has already been making micro-wave ovens for the
past four years at Longwy. 'With people coming from the steel sector in this
region, you have a very skilled work force,' says Mr Bae.
In July the European Commission launched a wide-ranging dumping inquiry into
TV sets imported direct from the Far East.
Did Daewoo feel compelled by such EC trade moves to invest in Europe? No,
says Mr Bae. Daewoo took its decision to manufacture TVs in Europe more than
a year ago, but it needed some time to complete negotiations with the French
government and the European Commission's regional fund which are, together,
paying one third of the Fameck plant's capital cost.
But Mr Bae admits that the EC dumping inquiry 're-inforces the logic of our
decision to manufacture locally in Europe.'

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of Eastern France (1): A cultural melting pot - The
three eastern regions of Champagne-Ardenne, Lorraine and Alsace illustrate
in vivid microcosm the challenges and opportunities facing modern France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROUPING together 5.2m inhabitants, more than the entire population of
Denmark, the three eastern regions of France are getting to grips in their
different ways with the competitive challenges thrown up by the country's
central role in Europe. The big issues facing eastern France today are as
diverse as its geography, which stretches from the fertile hills of
Champagne, through the remote forests of Les Vosges mountains to the
industrialised Rhine valley.
They include the problems faced by the huge cereals farms of the Marne as
the reforms of the European common agricultural policy begin to bite; the
impact of recession on the champagne industry; Lorraine's attempts to
modernise its industrial base after heavy job losses in its steel, coal and
textiles industries and Alsace's bid to forge closer links with its German
regional neighbours on the east bank of the Rhine, as this pivotal region
exerts increasing autonomy from Paris.
These challenges do, however, have one thing in common. They are all linked
in one way or another with the obligations and opportunities thrown up by
European Community membership, an issue which runs especially deep in a part
of France that provides the physical and cultural link with northern and
central Europe.
'We are at a crossroads, not just of motorways but of cultures . . . we are
no longer at a frontier. We are in front of a new region that links France
and Germany. Paris is no longer at the heart of Europe,' says Mrs Catherine
Trautmann, mayor of Strasbourg.
The sentiment is echoed by Mr Bernard Guerrier de Dumast, deputy mayor of
Nancy: 'We are a melting pot, a synthesis of German and Latin culture. We
have always lived, for good or ill, with the idea of Europe.'
It is no surprise that, like the rest of the country, the three regions were
passionately divided on European monetary and political union in France's
September referendum.
Alsace, where the regional capital Strasbourg is home to the plenary
sessions of the European Parliament, produced the biggest pro-Maastricht
majority of any region in France - 66.2 per cent. Lorraine also said yes,
despite a pocket of resistance in its southern department of Les Vosges,
fiefdom of Mr Philippe Seguin, mayor of Epinal, the rebel RPR Gaullist
politician who led the anti-treaty campaign. Meanwhile, neighbouring
Champagne-Ardenne produced a 'no' vote, reflecting the strength of the
agricultural lobby there.
Traditionally, eastern France has always been a centre of political,
industrial and financial influence, albeit a fragmented one. For the three
regions appear to co-operate less with each other and have less in common
than they do with their foreign neighbours in Germany, Belgium and
Switzerland.
Apart from Mr Seguin, tipped as a possible future leader of the Gaullist
RPR, and the forceful young Socialist Mrs Trautmann, the east is the local
political base for Mr Gerard Longuet, president of the conservative Parti
Republicain, who unseated Mr Jean-Marie Rausch, a centrist former Socialist
government minister, as president of the Lorraine regional council after the
regional elections last March.
Other local heavyweights include Christian Poncelet, a senior RPR senator
and former government minister, who now heads Les Vosges departmental
council and Mr Antoine Waechter, leader of the Greens party, who is a vice
president of the Alsace regional council.
The east is also the traditional cradle of some of the biggest names in
French industry, reflected in the continued existence of a large industrial
workforce and a small service sector.
Alsace, for example, is home to De Dietrich, the engineering and kitchen
equipment group which is France's oldest family controlled company, as well
as to carmaker Peugeot's showpiece plant at Mulhouse, assembly centre for
its newest model, the 109.
In neighbouring Lorraine there is Pont a Mousson, the pipes division of
Saint Gobain, three plants belonging to Usinor Sacilor, the state-owned
steelmaker, plus three-quarters of French coal output. Financially, the east
boasts France's second largest banking centre, based in Strasbourg, where
Credit Mutuel, Cial and Sogenal have made a specialty in lending to export
oriented local industry.
Like other French regions, they are all striving to use the decentralisation
of power initiated 10 years ago to seize more of the initiative in their own
economic development - but with mixed success.
'This is a decentralised country, where all the key decisions are still
taken in Paris,' mourns Mr Guerrier de Dumast. 'Too many big investment
projects go to the Paris region, which still exerts a power of attraction
that the provinces cannot resist. Without a will to reverse this in Paris,
it will never turn back.'
The east has, however, managed to attract a wave of foreign investment,
partly thanks to its central geographical position in the EC. This has also
been helped by generous aids available in Lorraine, keen to diversify away
from its traditional industries, plus a network of internationally active
economic development agencies.
It has also benefited in a small way from the Paris government's attempts to
spread more of the central bureaucracy out to the provinces, with the recent
move of the prestigious Ecole Nationale d'Administration to Strasbourg, and
the move of the CNRS national science research centre library to Nancy.
But the east has not yet won the battle in what has become a test case of
the power struggle between Paris and the regions, the continuing wrangle
over the financing of a new Trains a Grande Vitesse high speed rail link
from Paris through Strasbourg and on to Germany's Inter-City Express
network.
The line, due to open early in the next decade, is desperately wanted across
eastern France. Businessmen in Les Vosges complain that road and rail links
to neighbouring regions are poor, while Alsace sees the line as an important
step in the economic development of the upper Rhine valley and a catalyst to
trade between France and eastern Europe.
'We see the TGV as a symbol of desencalvement, breaking out from our
regional isolation,' adds Mr Gerard Cherpion, president of the Saint-Die
chamber of commerce, near Les Vosges' border with Alsace.
However, the SNCF French rail board's traffic forecasts on the French
section of the TGV-East are so poor that it wants the three regions to
contribute a combined FFr6bn to the FFr26bn cost of the project and to
charge 30 per cent above normal TGV rates for the tickets.
They have responded with an initiative launched by Strasbourg's Mrs
Trautmann, to create an association of French and German regions to lobby
both Bonn and Paris for a Franco-German TGV link. The lobby has been
effective, in that it produced in July an agreement in principle from
President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl that there should
be such a link.
Yet, the crucial question of who pays remains to be settled. Mrs Trautmann
accepts that the regions should make some kind of contribution, but argues
that the profit forecasts become much better if calculated on through
traffic on both the French and German sections, rather than the French part
of the line alone.
Others are less moderate - 'why should we have to pay, when Rhone-Alpes and
Brittany got their TGV for free?' asks a Les Vosges local government
official.
Many others in eastern France agree.

through industrial recession - Profile of Hino Motors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HINO MOTORS, Japan's leading truck maker, is earning money.
However, its net profits for the year to March 1992 fell 41.1 per cent to
Y7.35bn, and in the first half of the current year profits slipped again by
66.8 per cent to Y1.64bn.
As a 0.5 per cent return on Y307.2bn of sales, profits are dismal. Yet with
rival makers Isuzu and Nissan Diesel both in the red, Hino is in relative
terms roaring through Japan's industrial recession.
What is helping see Hino through hard times are the decades during which
Hino carefully cultivated markets throughout the rest of Asia, where unlike
Japan, North America, and Europe, most economies are still thriving. Asia
takes some 60 per cent of Hino's exports and the comparative sales figures
for Japan and the rest of the world are striking.
Hino's sales of medium- and large-scale trucks at home fell from 28,511
units in the first half of the last fiscal year to 20,030 this year, and
Hino expects a full year decline of 24 per cent. The value of sales in the
first half was off by 24 per cent to Y81.73bn.
Yet overseas was a different story. Exports of medium and large trucks rose
from 10,065 units to 13,011, with most of the increase in the more costly
heavy trucks. As a result export revenues from these products rose by 52 per
cent to Y40.69bn.
The stunning rise in export sales was in the end not enough to compensate
for the slackening of the Japanese market, and total sales were down by 2.5
per cent. Yet Hino's strong export business has provided it with an
invaluable cushion against the recession, and has allowed it to keep its
assembly plants working more or less at full capacity.
Hino has taken some steps to trim costs. It is, for example, trying in three
years to reduce by 30 per cent the 3,000 different vehicle types that it now
offers to its customers. Yet it has not been forced, like some other leading
manufacturers, to cut back drastically on part-time labour, or to cut
directors' salaries.
In the first half of the year, truck sales to Taiwan rose by 90.3 per cent
to 4,062 units both because of the buoyancy of the economy, and because the
government introduced regulations to prevent overloading vehicles, forcing
fleet operators to enlarge vehicles fleets to maintain capacity. Sales to
Thailand shot up by 42.4 per cent; to Hong Kong 85.6 per cent, while sales
to China more than doubled.
Perhaps even more important, the outlook for economic growth in the Asian
region - as opposed to most of the developed world and the former Soviet
bloc - continues to look very strong. Hino is doing business in the right
place, and can look forward to continued buoyant export sales.
At home, Japan is unlikely for a long time to provide the kind of growth
seen in the late 1980s. Yet there are some favourable signs. The government
in late August announced a Y10,700bn package of emergency economic measures
aimed at boosting the economy, and much of this money will be spent to
increase public works spending, including construction.
Hino estimates the package will increase demand for trucks by some 5,000
units this fiscal year. The impact next year could be larger.
Hino has also been holding its own domestically. Its 29.3 per cent share of
the domestic market was nearly unchanged from last year, with the share of
large trucks up 2.4 percentage points to 31.9 per cent while medium trucks
were down by 1.8 percentage points to 27.3 per cent. The rise in the market
share for large trucks was partially the result of a full model change in
May.
Hino's business is also underpinned by a close relationship to Toyota,
Japan's largest and financially strongest car maker. Toyota is Hino's
largest shareholder with an 11.2 per cent stake, and in the first half of
the year consigned production of 178,720 vehicles, worth Y122.6bn, to Hino.
Hino's production of Tercel, Corsa, and Corolla II models were down, but
production of Hilux, the small commercial vehicle, rose.
In spite of an underlying strong business, however, Hino profits have
suffered for fundamentally the same reasons that profits have fallen in
Japanese industry. For one, Hino's capital investment nearly doubled in two
years to peak at Y42.1bbn last year.
Although this year it is budgeted to drop to Y38bn, Hino is paying heavy
depreciation charges on earlier investments at a time when sales, and,
therefore, prices, are slack.
Hino is also paying sharply higher distribution costs, and wages have also
gone up significantly. Lower interest income, and sharply higher interest
payments on bonds has also undermined non-operating profits.
As a result, in spite of underlying strong business and no real financial
difficulties, Hino will have to wait to see any significant improvement in
financial performance.

the 1980s bursts - Japan

JAPANESE truck makers, hit by the downturn in the country's economy, are now
hoping the government's public works programme will prop up demand. The cut
in capital spending by Japanese companies has caused truck sales to plummet,
and the end of the construction boom has added to the gloom.
Purchases of highly-priced products have been cut sharply, and sales in
medium and large trucks have been the hardest hit in the vehicle market. The
lengthy life span of commercial vehicles is also hampering demand growth.
The 4 per cent decline in corporate capital expenditure for the present
fiscal year is hurting truck sales. Large truck sales for the first 10
months of this year have fallen 20.3 per cent to 129,707 units from the
previous year. For the full year, sales are expected to be about 150,000
units, down sharply from the peak of 193,775 in 1990.
Profits for the truck makers have been hit accordingly. Hino, the industry
leader, with about 30 per cent of market share, said net profits for the
first six months to September plunged 66.8 per cent to Y1.64bn. Nissan
Diesel fared worse, posting a net loss of Y119m.
In the boom years of the late 1980s, the sharp rise in demand from
construction, real estate, and trucking drove up sales for truck makers.
However, the construction industry is likely to see more than a 10 per cent
fall in orders for the present fiscal year, and the transportation industry
is also experiencing a slowing in demand.
Hino, however, says it expects the government's public works spending
programme, which is part of the emergency economic package, to boost sales.
Last August, the Japanese government announced a Y10,700bn emergency
spending package to support the faltering economy, the bulk of which is to
be spent on public works. Hino says that the public works programme will
increase demand by some 20,000 units for the industry next year.
Mr Jonathan Dobson, motor industry analyst at brokers Jardine Fleming in
Tokyo, has his doubts. He says an increase in public works spending will not
necessarily mean new demand from construction companies, since the life
cycle of a truck is about 10 years. 'There were lots of trucks bought during
the bubble, and companies will bring those into use rather than buy new
ones.'
Additionally, most of the trucks are operated by non-construction-related
private companies. And since 70 per cent of vehicles engaged in
construction-related operations work for the private sector, which is not
expected to recover for another few years, the truck companies projections
may be over-optimistic.
Shin Maywa Industries, a leading maker of speciality vehicles, such as dump
trucks, concrete mixers, and tank lorries, says although public works
projects are definitely a positive indicator, the effects will take some
time to filter through. 'We probably won't feel the impact this fiscal
year,' says Shin Maywa.
Meanwhile, truck makers have turned to overseas markets, especially in
south-east Asia and the Middle East. Hino saw a 52 per cent rise in exports
for the first half, especially in Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia, while
Mitsubishi Motors said exports grew 22.1 per cent due to strong demand from
Saudi Arabia and Iran.
With the anti-inflationary policies through high interest rates eased in
Thailand and Indonesia, truck makers believe the fall in demand from
south-east Asia has bottomed out. The reconstruction of Kuwait is also
contributing to the rise in exports.
However, the rise in exports has not been able to compensate for the fall in
domestic sales. While increases in exports to China, India and Pakistan may
hold potential business opportunities in the longer run, truck makers admit
in the short term, profits will not be covered simply by exports.
The environmental issue is also pressuring profits, as the series of
government regulations over gas emission of trucks planned to start in 1994
is forcing companies to increase spending on research and development.
Most truck companies agree that times are hard, and many, including Hino,
are looking to diversify into other industries. Mr Koji Endo, analyst at SG
Warburg Securities in Tokyo, says while the government's public works
spending will provide underlying support, the industry may not see a
fully-fledged recovery until 1996.
One bright spot for commercial vehicles may be connected to the
environmental theme. The surge in the country's garbage waste has pushed up
demand for garbage trucks. Shin Maywa says sales over the next few years are
expected to rise by a stable 5 per cent.

programme of technology - A look ahead at the development of new products

ENVIRONMENTAL legislation has become the most powerful influence on truck
technology and will remain so, through to the year 2000 and beyond. The
challenge for manufacturers is one of complying with progressively-tougher
exhaust emission and noise limits, while remaining competitive on vehicle
cost, fuel consumption and performance.
Though environmentalists might argue otherwise, making trucks quieter and
cleaner does little or nothing to enhance their appeal in the eyes of
today's recession-battered transport operator, whose concerns are more than
ever centred on costs and vehicle productivity.
If truck operators lived in a world where fuel consumption, vehicle price
and payload (carrying capacity) were of no consequence, then cutting noxious
emissions to the levels being demanded under so-called Euro 2 and 3
legislation in 1996 and 1998/9 would be simple.
But new technology is needed to clean up the diesel engine without incurring
those penalties. Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulates are the two most
critical noxious exhaust constituents subject to legal limits. At present,
moves to reduce NOx lead to heavier fuel consumption and/or reduced engine
power.
At the same time, formation of particulates (visible as black exhaust smoke)
is increased. They can be readily removed from the exhaust using a filter,
albeit a heavy, bulky and expensive unit, in which the deposits are
periodically burned off harmlessly at high temperature.
But diesel technology is moving ahead at such a pace that many manufacturers
expect by the end of the decade to be offering engines which need no
aftertreatment (exhaust filters or catalytic converters) to meet even Euro 3
emissions legislation.
And those turn-of-the-century engines will match the performance and fuel
efficiency of today's diesels.
In the forefront of such development are the American company Cummins, which
builds engines in the UK, and Scania of Sweden. They have joined forces to
develop an all-new diesel fuel system called HPI (standing for high pressure
injection). It will raise peak injection pressures, from today's typical
1300bar, to 1700 or even 2000bar (30,000psi). With HPI, injection will start
later in the cycle and finish earlier, enabling both NOx and particulates to
be reduced.
Using the established American principle of mechanically- actuated
injectors, HPI will feature a new method of electronic injection control,
designed to overcome the leakage and injector bursting problems which would
otherwise result from such ultra-high fuel pressures.
Meanwhile, Mercedes-Benz is involved in a parallel fuel system research
collaboration with another US engine maker, Detroit Diesel. Less radical
technology will be applied than in HPI; further refinement of Detroit's
present DDEC electronically-controlled injectors is the most likely path of
development.
In the wake of the agreement with Mercedes, Robert Bosch, Europe's near
monopolistic diesel fuel system supplier, has taken a 49 per cent stake in
Detroit Diesel's research company.
Nevertheless, Bosch's own German-based research and development programmes
continue, with emission law compliance central to them.
Meanwhile, traditional European diesel fuel-injection systems, in which the
injector is opened hydraulically, continue to be developed. For diesel
makers wanting to meet Euro 2 emission laws, without the virtually total
engine redesign needed to accommodate HPI or DDEC, Bosch will be supplying
its new RP 39/43 sleeved-element pumps which feature electronic control of
injection timing and fuel metering (quantity).
Constrained by an inherent injection pressure limit of about 1300bar, their
installation will mean, for the same low emission levels, say the proponents
of HPIx, a greater fuel thirst. On one trend all truck and bus builders
agree: more electronics are inevitable and not just on engines.
Interactive electronic connections between the engine, semi- or
fully-automated gear-change systems, and anti-skid and anti-wheelspin
systems are already the subject of extensive road trials. Safety as well as
vehicle operating efficiency are driving such developments, as commercial
vehicle manufacturers struggle to endow their products with a more positive
image in the eyes of a hostile public.
Electronic control of compressed air-powered truck brake systems has been
under active development for nearly a decade. It promises higher safety
standards, specifically on the longest trucks and buses, where the
compressibility of the air in pipes running from the driver's brake pedal to
actuators on the rearmost axle create a built-in delay. A 'brake by wire'
system can eliminate that piping, each brake actuator being fed via an
adjacent air reservoir and solenoid valve.
Unfortunately, progress is inhibited by the need for both halves of
articulated tractor-trailer combinations to be equipped for electronic
braking. In a big fleet that hampers interchangeability and hence
operational flexibility.
Given most truck operators' conservative, even sceptical, view of
electronics - especially the thought of them applied to often neglected and
abused trailers - it is hardly surprising that 'braking by wire' has been
greeted less than enthusiastically.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (14): Quieter and
cleaner roads ahead - A look at tougher regulations on emissions and noise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

BELATEDLY, Europe has begun to follow North America along the road to a
quieter and less polluting truck and bus population for the 1990s.
It is doing so because of an EC directive issued last year reducing the
amounts of gaseous and particulate pollutants commercial vehicles over 3.5
tonnes may emit.
Because noise is also regarded as an environmental pollutant, further
legislation means that heavy commercial vehicles are destined to become
quieter as well.
New models of trucks produced since July 1 this year have had to emit fewer
exhaust pollutants than their predecessors.
From October 1 next year all new trucks produced, even those designed and
developed before the legislation was drawn up, will have to comply with the
tighter rules.
These changes, however, represent only stage one of a two-stage process and
can be complied with relatively easily by truck makers because they are
based on Brussels's assessments of short-term environmental gains achievable
from readily available technology.
A much bigger problem is stage two, which will apply to all new models of
diesel trucks from October 1, 1995, and to all production one year later.
The emissions limits, in terms of grammes of pollutants per test, to be
introduced in the second stage, will see Europe's standards for truck
exhaust emissions brought into line with those due to become applicable to
trucks in North America for the 1994 model year. These will be the strictest
rules in the world. The standards will also bring the EC into line with
Switzerland and Austria.
They are unlikely to be quite so effective in EC countries, however, because
EC ministers have not yet agreed to revise the driving test cycle on which
exhaust emissions limits are based.
The US 'transient' test cycle is more stringent than the low-speed test
cycle used to set EC standards and more accurately reflects modern day
driving conditions.
The UK, often in the past seen as a laggard on vehicle exhaust emissions,
pressed unsuccessfully for a revised cycle to be incorporated in the
upcoming EC standards. But at least a proposal to introduce the transient
test is now on the agenda for discussion of yet tighter EC emissions
standards intended to be introduced for trucks in 1999.
The 1995/96 standards aim roughly to halve pollution caused by large diesel
trucks and buses by reducing emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides,
gaseous or 'unburnt' hydrocarbons and solid particles of burned fuel.
The main targets of the legislation are acid rain-causing oxides of nitrogen
and the particulates, which some research indicates are carcinogenic.
As part of the 1991 EC directive, there are also new lower limits on
particulate emissions specifically due to be applied to new trucks from
January 1 next year; however, the limits are not regarded as sufficiently
tough to require particulate traps.
The 1995/6 standards are likely to require substantial changes to truck
diesel engine technology if they are to be met.
According to Ricardo Group, the UK-based engineering consultancy which works
on engine projects for most vehicle makers world-wide, the US 1994 standards
continue to represent 'one of the greatest challenges facing the truck
industry'.
To meet them, truck manufacturers and the leading independent engine
producers such as Cummins Engine are having to resort to advanced technology
such as multi-valve cylinder heads, a variety of electronic control systems,
exhaust catalysts and 'traps' to capture and subsequently burn off
particulates. Of necessity, the 1996 legislation will also lead directly to
the introduction of improved quality diesel fuels, which under another draft
EC directive must have its sulphur content reduced to meet the lower limits
on particulate emissions. Sulphur is the main culprit in the generation of
particulates.
But the US itself is not standing still.
The US industry has already achieved a strong research and development
momentum from a tightening of US standards which took effect in 1991 and
which cut the permissible NOx level to the present 5 grammes from 6. They
were able to meet the tighter standard by redesigning engine combustion
chambers and pistons.
Federal legislators now envisage reducing permitted pollutant levels further
from May 1998.
California, always the first to tighten the environmental screw, plans to
demand such a cut four years earlier.
Trucks with a gross weight of up to 26,000lb are targeted to reduce
emissions by 50 per cent from a 1994 baseline, and by 30 to 50 per cent if
it can be shown that a higher reduction is not technically achievable,
according to the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers' Association. Part of the
solution may lie in the use of alternative fuels such as methanol, which are
already undergoing fleet test programmes.
The US industry, in conjunction with the Southwest Research Institute, has
now launched an international co-operative industry research programme aimed
at meeting likely end-of-century standards.
The Clean Heavy-Duty Diesel Engine programme aims for a 2-gramme NOx limit,
0.1 grammes of particulates and 0.5 grammes of hydrocarbons per brake
horsepower hour.
Leading engine manufacturers taking part include Caterpillar and Navistar of
the US, Hino, Isuzu, Mitsubishi and Nissan Diesel of Japan, and Volvo of
Sweden, and the programme will run until 1995.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (11): Signs of the
long-awaited recovery - A look at the US industry after the worst year for
truck sales since 1983
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER several years of hoping in vain for a reversal of slumping sales,
there are signs of the long-awaited recovery in the US heavy truck industry.
Demand for class eight vehicles was surprisingly strong through the first
half of this year, with truck sales for Paccar, Navistar, General Motors and
Ford at their highest levels in three years and overall new truck orders
coming in at an annual rate of more than 120,000 units. This compares with a
decline of 22.3 per cent in sales of class 8 vehicles for the first nine
months of last year. Indeed, 1991 was the worst year for heavy truck sales
since 1983, with only 98,730 units sold.
One reason for the improvement, according to Runzheimer International, a
company which tracks the transportation industry, is that fleet managers are
trying to reduce maintenance costs by replacing trucks at shorter time and
mileage intervals.
Heavy truck sales are expected to receive a further boost in the next few
years from the Intermodel Surface Transportation Efficacy Act to modernise
US highways, which is expected to stimulate the weak construction market.
The sector is also starting to benefit from the 1990 Clean Air Act, which
calls for tighter emissions standards by 1994. Fleets have started to
replace older vehicles with more modern trucks which comply with the new
standards.
While the Clean Air Act should stimulate sales even further next year, it is
not expected to be a panacea for all the industry's problems. Indeed, the
impact of the Clean Air Act may be less dramatic than initially expected
because engine makers can now do in-cylinder modifications which are less
expensive than replacing entire vehicles.
The US heavy truck industry continues to be plagued by over-capacity, with
manufacturing capacity estimated at more than twice the rate of sales. This
excess is the legacy of the 1980s when it was believed that retail sales in
the US would never slip below the 100,000 level and projections called for
annual sales ranging from 125,000 to 135,000 vehicles.
Competition among heavy truck makers also remains fierce, in a sector where
six players control between 9 to 30 per cent of the market.
Navistar is still the biggest player in the North American market, with a
combined market share of 29.3 per cent for heavy and medium trucks.
In spite of its commanding market share, Navistar is struggling to survive.
The company has not posted an annual profit since 1989, and it is expected
to remain in the red this year, with a nine-month net loss of Dollars 182m,
or 81 cents a share, including special charges of Dollars 89m.
Navistar's vertical integration, and the resulting high fixed costs have
contributed to the company's woes, but its main problem stems from steep
medical benefits for retired former workers. The company, which left the
farm equipment business years ago, is in the middle of a legal battle over
the healthcare benefits it is still paying former International Harvester
employees.
Both the company and the United Auto Workers' Union, which represents the
former employees, have said they hope to reach an agreement by early
December, but there are no guarantees of success and a protracted legal
battle could drive Navistar into bankruptcy.
The picture is less bleak at Mack Trucks, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
France's Renault Vehicules Industriels (RVI), which accounts for about 11
per cent of the North American market. Mack has undergone an overhaul since
Renault acquired full control of the company in October 1990 and Renault
recently said Mack was seeing a revival in demand in North America.
Paccar, with about 21.4 per cent of the class eight market, remains one of
the strongest players in the North American heavy truck market thanks partly
to the quality and dependableness of its heavy trucks. The company, which
makes Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks, saw third quarter profits rise 7 per
cent to Dollars 18.2m, or 54 cents a share, on revenues which grew 19 per
cent to Dollars 683.6m and its full-year earnings are expected to exceed
1991's figures.
But it is the light truck segment that remains the bright spot of both the
US truck and car industries. At a time when new car sales are expected to be
static, fourth quarter production of pickup trucks, mini vans and sports
utilities is expected to jump nearly 19 per cent to 1.05m.
The so-called 'baby boom' generation can take credit for the surge in light
truck sales by choosing to use utility vehicles and vans as family cars
instead of the traditional station wagon.
Ford has benefited from the popularity of its Explorer sport utility and
Chrysler has gained from the strong sales of its minivans, which are
officially classified as trucks although they are mainly used as cars.
The pickup truck segment now accounts for close to 48 per cent of the light
truck market, with sales expected to reach 2.2m this year.
US manufacturers now face their biggest challenge in the full-size pickup
sector. In contrast with the compact truck market, which was largely
developed by Japanese manufacturers, the big three US vehicle makers have
always controlled the full-size pickup sector. Ford and Chevrolet's
full-size pickups are the best selling vehicles of any type in the US.
Toyota, which has been eying the full-size pickup market since the
mid-1980s, is finally moving into the arena this year. In an attempt to
forestall anti-Japanese sentiment, the new Toyota pickup is slightly shorter
than the Ford models and has a V-6 engine instead of the more powerful V-8
engine found in most full-size pickups. Toyota will have to contend with the
more conservative nature of US pickup truck drivers, but in the long term it
will probably put pressure on US producers in this extremely important
sector.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (6): Eyes on Europe -
Profile of ERF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY NORMAL motor industry criteria, ERF should have been one of the early
casualties of what is the deepest UK truck market slump since the Second
World War.
It is small. It achieved an output of 4,319 trucks in its peak year of 1989
and expects to make and sell only around 2,000 this year, during what now
appears to be the trough of the recession. It thus enjoys few of the
economies of scale of far larger rivals such as Daimler-Benz and Iveco.
Its sole manufacturing plant is at Sandbach, Cheshire, in the far north-west
corner of England. It has been heavily dependent on the UK for its sales -
and the UK has been by far the most badly hit of all European truck markets.
ERF is also the UK's last publicly-quoted independent truck company, still
family-controlled but nevertheless having recession-rattled banks and
shareholders to satisfy and no group parent to draw on for support.
Ten years ago, when the last severe truck sales downturn occurred, it did
indeed look as if ERF would not survive. The company was then what chairman
Peter Foden describes as a 'fruit salad' truck maker, employing large
numbers of people to produce tailor-made vehicles fitted with almost any
type of engine, transmission or axle dictated by the whim of customers.
It was an inefficient way of producing trucks and for which ERF could
command little premium. It was also unsustainable. ERF's debts rose; output
plummeted; overheads swung.
The action taken by Mr Foden then, underpins its survival now.
The model range was streamlined, and standardised around Cummins engines,
Eaton gearboxes and Rockwell axles. It retained its own cab design and
manufacturing - having pioneered the non-rusting plastic composite, rather
than metal cab - and with the recovery of the mid-80s reaped the benefits.
By the time it became evident, in mid-1990, that the present UK sales slump
was deadly serious ERF had achieved four years of sustained profitability
culminating with a record pre-tax profit of Pounds 7.83m in 1989.
Since then, it has been sharply downhill all the way for the entire
industry.
Even so, after 18 months of losses, and with the market still sliding
downwards, ERF managed a small profit in the first half of its financial
year to September 1991. Four months ago, Mr Foden was able to report that
the full-year 1990/91 loss of Pounds 4.47m had been cut to Pounds 563,000 in
1991/92.
That is a function of a work force almost halved once more to around 750,
production pared to nine trucks a day on only four days a week, with ERF no
longer building for stock.
Because ERF buys in key driveline components, lowering output is primarily a
question of turning off the suppliers' taps - done quickly and relatively
easily. There is little scope left for reducing overheads further.
With all truck makers still bleeding, such considerations would still be
almost irrelevant if ERF were highly geared and running out of cash
resoures. But it is not. Gearing at mid-June was 17 per cent, up from 6 per
cent the previous year, and is probably still rising.
But this largely reflects increased on-balance sheet leased assets to bring
ERF's Pounds 6m new product range to fruition - an ambitious project,
involving another all-new cab, which will see the renewal of the range over
the two years following the 1993 launch.
To compensate for the UK downturn, ERF has been putting extra effort into
its traditional overseas markets - largest of which is South Africa - and
which in the past year or so have been accounting for about 30 per cent of
unit sales, although trucks and bus chassis are mainly despatched in kit
form.
This year, however, ERF has decided to take the plunge into Europe, in what
Mr Foden describes as 'one of the most important steps ERF has taken for
many years'.
Two wholly-owned distribution subsidiaries have been set up, ERF France and
ERF Espana - with a third to follow in Portugal - to act as liaison with
fledgling dealer networks.
The first truck destined for sale in continental Europe was shipped in
mid-November. Final contracts with an initial two dealerships in France and
four in Spain were being signed at around the same time.
According to Rod England, ERF's sales and marketing director, eight French
dealerships, covering the main conurbations from Paris to Marseilles, should
be in place by the end of the year, with five in eastern and central Spain.
All are independently owned, most with other commercial vehicle franchises.
Once sales have become established, ERF plans then to turn its attention to
Portugal, followed by the Benelux countries.
Mr England says he believes ERF can capture around 2 per cent of Continental
Europe's market for trucks of 16 tonnes and over - equivalent to around
1,500 units annually - within the next two to three years.
In theory at least, ERF's timing is fortuitous - it is entering the
Continental market helped by a 'windfall' devaluation of sterling after its
departure from the ERM, although its fall against the franc and peseta is
much less than against the D-Mark.
'But it's not helped us as much as we would like', observes Mr England,
'because markets have been turning down in Europe. What it does provide is
the flexibility to counter heavy discounting by the big guys in Europe.'
To the obvious question of why should any Continental truck operator want to
buy from a small, in European terms, relatively unknown UK producer, Mr
England retorts that 'there are always people looking for something
different.
'Within any country there are people dissatisfied with the reduction in
choice that has gone on as the industry has rationalised, such as Volvo
getting together with Renault. So we're saying to people there is a choice -
that we're a maker of high quality products that does things just a little
differently, with a low cost of ownership because parts are cheap and the
vehicles last a long time.'

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (7): German success -
Profile of Mercedes-Benz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS MIGHT be expected, Germany's reunification has had a profound impact upon
Mercedes-Benz, the luxury car and world's largest truck maker. Nowhere
within the group's industrial activities have the effects been more keenly
felt than in the commercial vehicles sector itself.
Against the background of a 5 per cent drop in total world commercial
vehicle output last year, Mercedes increased its own production by 14 per
cent to a record 296,000 units. Its world-wide unit sales rose by 12 per
cent.
The value of its commercial vehicles sales also jumped by 14 per cent, to
DM27.6bn, outpacing the 31 per cent increase in its car sales.
However, with some other important world markets declining, without the
German surge it would have been a different story.
At 122,000 units, Mercedes' German sales of commercial vehicles were 44 per
cent higher last year than in 1990. Within the total, van sales rose by 42
per cent, those of the trucks carrying the materials for eastern Germany's
reconstruction by 49 per cent.
The increases were thus a notable contributor to last year's 12 per cent
rise in Mercedes' total turnover to DM67.1bn and the 1990-matching DM1.55bn
net income Werner Niefer was able to report to shareholders in his final
year as president and chief executive.
He is to hand over to Mr Helmut Werner, joint chief executive, at the end of
the year.
If Germany underpinned Mercedes' performance last year, developments
elsewhere in the world reinforced the value of its sustained policy of
globalisation. As most other western European markets turned down, Mercedes'
commercial vehicles sales outside Germany also slipped, again by 14 per cent
 -but still by not enough to prevent its share of the over-six tonnes truck
market increasing from 26 per cent to more than 31 per cent.
There was gloom also in the North American market, which dropped by 10 per
cent although Mercedes' US subsidiary, Freightliner, was able almost to
maintain its own sales volume, at 22,600 compared with 23,000 in 1990.
Its global presence meant, however, that Mercedes was able to benefit from
the steady liberalisation of the Mexican economy - accelerated by the North
American Free Trade Agreement with the US and Canada - to the extent of a 63
per cent rise in sales to 9,600. At the same time the loosening of Brazil's
economic reins gave affiliate Mercedes do Brasil a 33 per cent commercial
vehicles sales fillip to reach 40,700.
No-one expected the German surge to last indefinitely. Nevertheless, its
commercial vehicles market rose by a further 9 per cent in the first quarter
and has continued strong, to the extent that Mr Niefer now appears to have
been pessimistic in suggesting that total commercial vehicle sales this year
would fall back from 1991 levels. Market analysts, DRI/McGraw Hill, for
example, predict that by the end of this year van sales will have risen by
another 50 per cent.
In contrast, Mr Niefer's expressed hopes of a recovery in other European
economies and markets have been only partially fulfilled. Even so, total
sales and output are expected to be maintained at around the levels of a
year ago.
In Europe, in particular, and in spite of planned research and development
spending of more than DM5bn over the next few years, Mercedes no longer
believes that putting competitive products into the marketplace is enough.
'More and more, the market is seeking combined product/service packages for
specific transport requirements,' according to Mr Niefer - with actual
ownership of commercial vehicles becoming less relevant.
With this in mind, Mercedes has launched in Germany, the UK and several
other Continental countries a vehicle leasing venture, Charterway, with
contracts based around an agreed transport capacity rather than specific
vehicles.
With the single EC market in mind, the company has also developed related EC
service arrangements under which truck operators can obtain individually
agreed, fixed-price service packages at any of Mercedes' 2,400 commercial
vehicle service outlets in Europe through a cashless payment system.
These actions have been taken in the context of Mercedes' conviction that
growth in European road transport will continue to be extensive for the
foreseeable future. Indeed, it is forecasting 40 per cent growth in the
volume of transport in Europe over the next decade, even though it already
accounts for more than 60 per cent of goods transport in the region.
In that belief, and working within collaborative EC research programmes such
as Prometheus - aimed at maximising traffic flows while increasing road
safety - Mercedes' research engineers are working on a number of programmes
from collision-avoidance radar through to comprehensive route guidance and
congestion-avoidance systems.
'The requirement now is rather for integrated action on the part of all
concerned - the manufacturers of the different forms of transport, the
logistics industry and also the relevant politicians,' according to Mr
Niefer.
Despite the hitherto buoyant state of the German market, Mercedes - like the
country's other major leading vehicle makers - remains increasingly
concerned at Germany's continually rising production costs and the strength
of the D-Mark.
Partly for that reason, and in spite of German plants accounting for more
than 188,000 of Mercedes' commercial vehicle output last year - its top
management has been placing increasing stress on future growth coming from
increased sales and production from what is now a total of more than 50
production and assembly plants world-wide, employing, when output of nearly
580,000 cars annually is included, a total of more than 237,000 people.
Nevertheless, Mercedes is continuing to invest in the expanded Germany:
since February last year light trucks have been assembled at a plant south
of Berlin in Ludwigsfelde, and, since September, T2 vans have also been
assembled there. Mercedes has, however, been forced to postpone indefinitely
a new 40,000-a-year truck factory in Brandenburg.
The commercial vehicle product range itself now totals 200 truck models in
more than 2,700 different versions from vans to 48-tonne trucks.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (9): Declining fortunes
 -Profile of Iveco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the Turin automobile group Fiat closes its accounts at the end of
December it will not be expecting a positive contribution from its Iveco
industrial vehicle subsidiary. Iveco looks set to follow last year's loss of
Fl199m (Dollars 111m) on sales of Fl12.244bn with another negative bottom
line.
Fiat notes in its half-yearly report that Iveco's sales volume in 1992 has
continued to follow the downward trend that began two years ago. The decade,
which opened with 1990s' meagre net profit of Fl23m on sales of Fl11.689bn,
has started badly.
Yet only three years ago the company was posting record results, closing
1989 with a post-tax surplus of Fl591m on sales of Fl12.426bn. The second
half of the 1980s had seen good performance following heavy losses that had
only been interrupted by small surpluses in 1981 and 1982.
Senior management at Iveco, whose Dutch corporate nationality reflects its
trans-border origins, point to three factors that have caused the sharp
worsening in the profit and loss account. Essentially a European business,
with less than 12 per cent of turnover coming from markets outside western
Europe, Iveco has been hit by 'falls in production volumes and sales prices
due to the market crises'.
Last year Iveco invoiced a total of 122,300 vehicles, compared to 125,000 in
the previous year. Moreover, the figure for 1991 included sales of 6,600
units by the Spanish Pegaso subsidiary which became part of the Iveco Group
last year.
But the purchase of a controlling stake in Pegaso did not make a positive
contribution to Iveco's financial results. Indeed, senior management says
that it was one of the three factors that caused the worsening recorded last
year, the Spanish subsidiary posting a loss of Pta19.738bn (Dollars 173m).
In the Pegaso operation, under which it acquired a 60 per cent stake from
the INI Spanish state holding corporation, Iveco continued the strategy of
expansion by acquisition that has been a characteristic. Iveco's own
establishment in 1975 provided the example, the company being born from the
merger between three subsidiaries in Italy's Fiat Group (Fiat Veicoli
Industriali, Lancia Veicoli Speciali and OM), France's Unic and West
Germany's Magirus.
Since then, Iveco has undertaken nine operations. These include the purchase
of a 48 per cent stake in the ordinary share capital of Ford's truck
operation in the UK in 1986, now called Iveco Ford Truck. In addition to its
Spanish acquisition, last year Iveco also subscribed the total issue of
preference stock made by Iveco Ford Truck and acquired the UK company Seddon
Atkinson with Enasa.
In Italy Iveco has grown by the acquisition of coach and bus makers Orlandi
(1977) and Sicca (1989), the construction truck manufacturer Astra (1986)
and the fire-fighting vehicle maker Baribbi this year. An important Magirus
activity is fire-fighting vehicles, and in 1987 this had been boosted by the
acquisition of Bachert, another west German company.
While forming part of a full model range, fire-fighting, other special
vehicles and coaches are not, however, the core of Iveco's business. This is
trucks, where over the past two years it has tried to update its range.
Indeed, the third factor to which senior management attribute last year's
loss are the costs of introducing new models.
Iveco's investment in the EuroCargo range of light 6-to-10 tonne vehicles
was rewarded by the Truck of the Year Award last year. The company has
focused on technological innovation to reduce running costs, increase
reliability and improve driver comfort and safety. Iveco's EuroCargo range
offers users a wide choice, with six engines, three cab types, two
wheelbases, four solutions for suspension and three types of rear axle.
Higher up the scale, Iveco has also been updating its models. Earlier this
year the company launched the EuroTech family of heavy-duty trucks. To
satisfy the wide range of applications that includes municipal vehicles, and
town and suburban deliveries as well as long-distance transport, Iveco's
EuroTech offers many combinations of engine, chassis and cab. And at the
other end, Iveco extended its Daily/Turbo Daily range of light commercial
vehicles by starting production of new models.
The Daily/Turbo Daily range was updated in 1989 and the range for off-road
applications has been updated this year. Senior management says that the
investment undertaken on this and on the EuroCargo and EuroTech ranges gives
Iveco a new combination of products that is unequalled.
Over the past five years Iveco's investment plan has involved spending of
Fl8bn on fixed assets, research and development, training and new production
ventures. The results are evident in the rationalisation of product range
and the new models bearing the Iveco badge.
But, notwithstanding management claims that it has finally been possible to
eliminate the inefficiencies deriving from the many different industrial
histories of Iveco's component companies, perhaps more can be expected in
terms of plant rationalisation. At present Iveco's 41,300 employees (about
24,000 in Italy) are spread between 21 plants (11 in Italy).
The company's management points to the prospects of still fiercer
competition in an already tough European market. Range flexibility, product
personalisation and quality are deciding factors. So also is cost. Further
rationalisation of production would give Iveco, whose sales in the first six
months of the year were 3.5 per cent down on January-June 1991, a sharper
competitive edge. It would ease the compression on operating margins and
help in stemming losses.
Seventeen years ago Iveco's founding members, led by Fiat, decided that
concentration was the only viable strategy. And Iveco's creation and
development has involved a rationalisation process. Perhaps more is to come.
Last year a little-noticed, but significant, step was taken when Iveco Fiat
changed its name to Iveco. In consolidating its single, European image, the
Magirus, Unic, Ford Truck and Pegaso names are probably targets for similar
treatment.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (10): Obstacles to
progress - EC deregulation plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMBITIOUS plans to totally deregulate European Community road haulage
operations have had a bumpy ride over the past couple of years.
But while full deregulation will not be achieved in time for the formal
creation of the EC Single Market at the end of this year, there are signs
that the remaining obstacles to further progress are slowly being
dismantled.
'We do not yet have cabotage in the EC and they still have not solved the
problems of vehicle taxation. Nevertheless, when you consider what has been
done in the last few years after years and years of stagnation, a great deal
of progress has been made,' says Mr Reg Dawson, a leading EC transport
consultant.
Still far from clear is the effect that the likely eventual liberalisation
of EC road haulage activities will have on future demand for commercial
vehicles.
On the one hand, deregulation is expected to result in considerable
rationalisation of the European road haulage industry, suggesting fewer
customers for commercial vehicle manufacturers. Conversely, though,
survivors of the anticipated shake-out will need more vehicles to support
their expanding operations.
Crucial to the full deregulation of EC road haulage activities is the issue
of cabotage - the right of hauliers from one EC country to freely operate
inside another state.
Vehicles engaged in cabotage work are subject to many of the regulations of
the state where the work is carried out. But that situation is itself
causing complications. For example, while the host country's laws apply to
issues such as pricing, contracts, vehicle weights and dimensions, work and
rest hours, other matters including social security, vehicle registration
and taxation come under the jurisdiction of the operator's home country.
The establishment of EC cabotage made little progress until mid-1990 when
the European Council of Ministers finally agreed to its introduction in a
very limited form. Basically, that system makes available a quota of
cabotage authorisations - just under 17,000 for 1992 - distributed among the
member states.
Supporters of full deregulation of the European road haulage industry had
hoped that initial moves on cabotage would lead to its full introduction in
1993. But vested national interests have slowed down such development.
Some EC countries, notably Germany and France, fear their domestic haulage
industries could be badly damaged by a sudden influx of competition from
outside countries such as Spain and Greece where operating costs are lower.
For that reason, Germany in particular has insisted on linking the issue of
cabotage with moves to harmonise hauliers' costs, for example through
vehicle and fuel taxes, throughout the Community. Germany also wants to see
the establishment of a common system for tolls and road-user charges for
heavier commercial vehicles.
The German authorities appear to be winning the argument over the need to
harmonise haulage industry costs within the EC. The European Commission has
within the last couple of months put forward a proposal which, if accepted,
could mean that hauliers have to pay a road tax for using the Community's
motorways from January 1994.
The Commission claims such a tax, which would be based on the size of
vehicle and the time spent on the road, would allow member states to recoup
some of the costs of building and maintaining road infrastructures.
The most recent meeting of EC transport ministers in October made some
further progress on harmonising road taxes. However, the Commission's
published proposals do not suggest any minimum or maximum charges. Instead,
individual member states would set their own tax levels.
That absence of a standard tax figure, it is feared, could lead to
continuing disputes between countries such as Germany, which want to set
higher charges, and poorer member states who fear that implementing such
taxes would badly damage their industries.
Meanwhile, pressure is growing on EC ministers to reach agreement on the
subject of cabotage. Specifically, time is running out on a controversial
European Court ruling that if the ministers fail to agree a timetable for
full cabotage by the end of this year, there must be complete cabotage
freedom from 1993. Detailed proposals on the subject are expected to be
ready for discussion at the next European Council meeting in early December.
Having had a deregulated road haulage industry for some 20 years, the UK is
one of the countries most in favour of deregulating and harmonising
operations throughout the EC.
However, the UK remains out of step with the rest of the Community on the
subject of vehicle weights. While other EC countries allow trucks of 40 or
even 44 tonnes on their roads, the UK has a limit of 38 tonnes and a
derogation to continue with that limit until 1999.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (8): West closes the gap
 -The eastern European industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT decision by Mercedes-Benz to shelve indefinitely plans for a
DM1bn truck plant at Ahrensdorf in former east Germany underlined both the
high cost of making trucks in German plants and a far more cautious
assessment of future growth in the European truck market.
But it also sent shivers of apprehension wider afield, and especially in
Czechoslovakia where the German truck maker's plans to take a significant
stake in two of Czechoslovakia's three big truck producers, Avia and Liaz,
have still not been finalised.
This is partly a reflection of the general delay in closing deals following
the June elections and pre-occupation with the forthcoming divorce between
the Czech lands and Slovakia. But it also reflects government reluctance to
grant the tax concessions and set up the tariff barriers sought by Mercedes
to protect its investment. There has been no hint that a deal will not
eventually be signed, but the prospect of lower than expected sales in both
eastern and western Europe has certainly reduced the urgency.
Mercedes announced its intention to take a 31 per cent stake in Avia,
Czechoslovakia's principal manufacturer of small trucks, followed by a 20
per cent stake in Liaz, the main producer of heavy, on-road trucks in
January. The statement followed an 18-month competition with Renault
Vehicules Industriels (RVI) for Avia, and competition with Iveco of Italy
which was interested in taking a stake in Liaz.
Iveco subsequently turned to Tatra, Czechoslovakia's famous producer of
heavy off-road vehicles. But a planned Iveco-Tatra link has been put on
hold. The original plan was to invest an initial Dollars 20m in a 51 per
cent joint venture.
Iveco's interest in Tatra is part of a long-term strategy to develop its
presence in the heavy, off-road truck niche which the Italian company sees
as an area with big growth potential.
Demand for heavy duty vehicles suited to harsh terrains and bitter
temperatures is expected to rise dramatically as the tempo of oil and gas
exploration rises in the former Soviet Union. Robust vehicles such as these
will also be needed once long neglected infrastructure, mining and other
resource projects get under way.
The timing of such a recovery remains obscure, but it could be sooner rather
than later as the privatised Russian economy, and other resource-rich
republics like Kazakhstan, build up a growth momentum and open up to foreign
investment.
Tatra already has an enviable reputation throughout the former Soviet Union
and recently sold more than 1,000 vehicles to Saudi Arabia during the Gulf
war. But Iveco also sought a commercial, production and engineering
agreement with Uralmash, builders of the tough Ural-5323 and other off-road
trucks.
The deal with Uralmash, based on President Boris Yeltsin's former power base
of Yekaterinaburg, (formerly Sverdlovsk) should give Iveco access to the
Uralaz plant at Miass, near Chelyabinsk. This means a production base close
to the Urals mining and industrial areas as well as the oil, gas and
mineral-producing areas of Siberia, precisely the main growth markets for
off-road trucks. Under the agreement Iveco proposes to assemble a
specially-adapted 'arctic' version of its Iveco-330-30 at the Miass plant
and help to develop future Uralaz vehicles.
Meanwhile, Renault, frustrated in Czechoslovakia, shifted its focus to
Poland, where it is exploring the prospects for assembling and producing
trucks and delivery vans at the Star plant in Starachowice, south of Warsaw.
Star, which at its peak turned out 14,000, 11-tonne trucks a year, was
classic communist-style vertically integrated enterprise in a typical
one-company town. It had its own steel works and foundry and dozens of
inter-connected component and motor plants feeding into the main factory.
Its market virtually disappeared overnight as state enterprises and its
military customers ran out of money. Private entrepreneurs, meanwhile, opted
for lighter and more fuel-efficient imports.
Renault, too, is seeking tariff protection and other guarantees before
converting the plant to produce the vans and light vehicles now in demand.
The question of tariff protection is becoming the deciding factor in the
approach of smaller truck companies. Scania, for example, originally planned
to sell trucks into the eastern European market from its Swedish base.
Instead, in October, it announced a joint venture project with Kapena of
Poland to assemble R113 and R143 models near Klupsk, close to the Baltic
coast.
But not only truck makers have been seeking to expand their markets. Eaton
Corporation of the US is prominent among western component manufacturers
seeking future markets in Russia and the former Soviet Union.
Some, like Cummins engines, the world's largest independent diesel engine
manufacturer, have already taken the plunge. Last year Cummins signed a
long-term joint venture agrement, Kamazdisel, to produce engines at the
Kamaz plant.
Through these, and a host of other joint ventures, licensing agreements and
other ways, western truck makers and suppliers are starting to change the
shape of the industry in the east, and busy filling what was once the
biggest gap in the emerging global market place.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (5): The party appears
to be over - Profile of Man Nutzfahrzeuge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER two years of record profits the party appears to be over for MAN
Nutzfahrzeuge, the number two German commercial vehicle maker behind
Mercedes-Benz.
Much more heavily dependent on the home market than its arch domestic rival,
MAN has been buoyed up by the extraordinary surge in truck demand in Germany
in the wake of reunification.
In its last financial year to the end of June it increased its pre-tax
profits by 29.7 per cent, the group's best financial performance.
Its record profits have been in stark contrast to the losses reported
elsewhere in the industry by the likes of DAF and Volvo, but as the wave of
demand in Germany subsides, MAN, too, is having to prepare for tougher times
ahead.
In contrast to the record production and profits achieved in the 1991/92
financial year (to June 30) the value of new orders booked in the year had
already begun to fall sharply, and MAN is now being forced to reduce output
in line with falling sales.
It has cut truck production by around 12 per cent. It has halted output for
one week during November and will also stop production for a week from
January 4. It is cutting overtime, not replacing temporary workers and not
replacing workers lost through natural wastage.
Both profits and turnover are forecast to fall in the current year. MAN has
also warned that further short-time working could be imposed in coming
months, if orders remain at a low level. Turmoil in the currency markets has
greatly increased uncertainty in European markets, it says.
While the outlook for the coming year is deteriorating, MAN at least has the
cushion of a record financial performance in the past two years.
In the 12 months to the end of June the company, a subsidiary of MAN, the
German engineering group, increased its pre-tax profits by 29.7 per cent to
DM506m, while turnover rose by 6.9 per cent to a record DM7.9bn. Sales
outside Germany were unchanged at DM3.2bn, but domestic turnover jumped by
13 per cent to DM4.7bn.
MAN raised its production of trucks and buses by 8.4 per cent to a record
41,590 with the company's plants in Germany and in Austria working at full
capacity. In contrast to the wholesale job losses elsewhere in the industry
it increased its workforce by more than 1,000 to 28,900 at the end of June.
MAN truck and bus sales worldwide rose by 7 per cent to 40,815 in 1991/92
from 38,146, helped by strong demand in Germany and in Austria. The increase
was achieved in spite of a fall in the total western European market for
trucks (from 6 tonnes gross vehicle weight) to 277,000 in the calendar year
1991 from 287,000 a year earlier.
The group's strong presence in the German market, where it accounts for more
than a fifth of all truck sales (over 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight), has
allowed it to achieve a record share of the total western European market
where Germany is the dominant force.
According to DRI, the UK-based automotive analysts, MAN has moved from last
place among the seven leading European heavy truck makers in 1990 to third
place last year behind only Mercedes-Benz and Iveco. Its share of the
western European heavy truck market (over 15 tonnes) has surged from 8.8 per
cent in 1990 to 12.8 per cent in 1991. DRI forecasts that MAN's share will
have risen to a peak of 13.4 per cent this year before weakening in 1993, as
the German market contracts.
MAN has been able to boost production to cope with the surge in demand in
Germany thanks to its 1990 acquisition of the Steyr truck operations in
Austria. MAN has moved the assembly of its M90 medium-weight truck range to
Steyr, which produced nearly 4,800 MAN trucks in the 1991/92 financial year.
Steyr also holds a market share of around 23 per cent in its domestic market
in Austria.
The German group is investing DM320m in the Steyr operations, of which
around DM89m was spent last year in part for the building of a new truck
assembly line.
MAN Nutzfahrzeuge group capital expenditure has risen rapidly in the past
five years from DM170m in 1987/88 to DM395m in 1991/92, with the focus on
creating a flexible production network between the five German and two
Austrian plants.
After its record performance of the past two years declining new orders in
recent months indicate that the coming two years will be much more difficult
for MAN. The high level of orders it is still taking for buses, is
insufficient to compensate for the rapid drop in new truck business.
Falling new orders from the domestic German market combined with stagnant or
declining demand from export markets has led to a 20.3 per cent fall in the
value of new orders booked by MAN in the 12 months to the end of June to
DM7.2bn. The value of new domestic orders fell by 28.1 per cent to DM4.1bn,
while foreign orders declined by 6.5 per cent to DM3.1bn.
The value of the order book had fallen by 22.7 per cent to DM3.49bn at the
end of June from DM4.5bn a year earlier. In the first quarter of the 1992/93
financial year (July to September) the value of new orders had fallen again
by 27.8 per cent to DM1.3bn from DM1.8bn in the same period a year ago.
The group claims it has been unable to move as quickly as it had hoped to
build up a dealer and service network in eastern Germany, often because of
problems in establishing land ownership and gaining the necessary approvals.
It now has four wholly-owned service centres in principal cities.
In Hungary, MAN has recently signed a letter of intent with Raba, the
Hungarian engineering company, and Mogurt, the trading company, to
co-operate in assembling trucks. The aim of the deal is for MAN to deliver
diesel engines and truck cabs to Raba, chiefly for all-wheel drive vehicles
exclusively for the Hungarian market.
MAN is also expanding control of its importer/distributor organisation in
western Europe and earlier this year it took over the UK MAN truck importing
business for Pounds 20m from Lonrho, the London-based international trading
group.
The German truck maker accounted for 4.9 per cent of the UK truck market
(above 3.5 tonnes) last year, where it is relatively weak compared with its
presence elsewhere in Europe. It was only in eighth place in the UK, where
it is still overshadowed by groups such as DAF, Iveco and Mercedes-Benz.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (2): Outlook remains
gloomy - Market prospects in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE

<TEXT>
THE western European truck industry is in its third year of decline, and the
short-term outlook remains gloomy with forecasts suggesting a further
significant drop in demand in 1993.
The latest forecast by DRI, the London-based automotive analysts, suggests
that truck sales (6 tonnes gross vehicle weight and above) across the main
15 markets in western Europe will have fallen by 10.5 per cent this year to
around 246,000.
There is little relief in prospect in 1993 with truck sales forecast to fall
again by as much as 8 per cent to 226,000, before a modest recovery begins
in 1994.
While truck sales have been falling in Europe overall, the extraordinary
boom in Germany in the wake of unification has masked the speed of the
decline in other markets.
The share taken by Germany in the overall western European truck market has
virtually doubled from around 20 per cent in 1989 to around 40 per cent this
year. According to DRI figures truck sales (6 tonnes and above) in Germany
increased by 22.8 per cent in 1990 to 68,000 and jumped again by 54.4 per
cent in 1991 to 106,000.
Supported by the surge in Germany, truck sales overall in western Europe
fell by only 7 per cent from the peak of 296,000 in 1989 to 275,000 in 1991.
Excluding Germany, however, truck sales in the rest of Europe have plunged
in the past two years by 29 per cent.
Since mid-1992 the market has begun to turn downwards in Germany, too, after
the last two years of record sales, however, and there has been little sign
of a recovery elsewhere in Europe to compensate for weakening German sales.
With such a wide disparity between the performance of different markets,
truck makers have been subjected to sharply contrasting changes in fortune
with most of the benefits accruing to Mercedes-Benz and MAN, the two German
truck makers which control around three-quarters of their domestic market.
Mercedes-Benz captured a third of European sales in 1991 and MAN has boosted
its share from 8 per cent before unification to more than 12 per cent this
year.
The scale of the impact of German unification on the truck industry coupled
with the decline in demand in other European markets can be judged from the
fact that eastern Germany alone has emerged as Europe's second biggest truck
market in the first eight months this year.
According to Automotive Industry Data, the UK-based automotive industry
analysts, new truck sales (above 3.5 tonnes) in eastern Germany alone
totalled 28,660 in the first eight months this year compared with 25,818 in
France and only 20,633 in the UK.
The UK, Spain and the Scandinavian countries, which led the present decline
into recession, have suffered the largest falls since the European market
peaked in 1989.
Truck sales in the UK have dropped by more than 50 per cent in the past
three years, while the Spanish market has fallen by 43 per cent, and Sweden
now has a market only a third of its former size.
According to the DRI European truck forecast report published this month
'the summer months have brought a significant deterioration in market
conditions to many of the European markets . . . turmoil in European
currency markets, deteriorating national economies and increasing
uncertainties over the prospects of any economic recovery in the short-term
have added to the mood of gloom and general unease in the truck industry.
'The glow of German unification and the boom it injected into the market is
fast fading away as the the market faces re-adjustment to lower levels of
demand.'
The prospects overall for European truck sales next year have deteriorated
as forecasts have been revised downwards in particular for France and Italy,
which are not expected to be able to compensate for the accelerating slide
in German demand.
Truck sales in France (six tonnes and above) are forecast by DRI to rise by
only 2.4 per cent next year after three years of sharp decline, with sales
falling in Italy by 10.4 per cent and in Germany by 23.2 per cent.
'With a severe contraction in the German market, and weaker demand prospects
in other European countries, truck registrations are forecast to decline by
up to a further 8 per cent in 1993, before some measure of returning
confidence and improved investment climate provide a firmer foundation for
growth in truck demand.'
The DRI forecast does see a resumption of modest growth in European truck
demand from 1994, but total sales are only forecast to reach 261,000 by
1997, still well below the peak years at the end of the 1980s.
In the UK the first signs of a modest recovery are appearing but only after
three years of deep recession have taken a heavy toll on the industry.
In July truck sales (above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) showed the first
monthly year-on-year increase in 34 months finally ending a period in which
sales had plunged by 60 per cent in three years.
The breakthrough achieved in July has been sustained for four months with UK
truck sales showing year-on-year increases for four consecutive months from
July to October. The decline earlier in the year, however, means that for
the first 10 months UK truck sales were still 4.3 per cent lower than in the
corresponding period a year earlier.
Since 1989, overall UK commercial vehicle sales have suffered the steepest
and deepest fall into recession of the post-Second World War period. Truck
sales have fallen to a level not seen since the early 1950s, and the
recovery is therefore coming from a very low base.
The recent improvement should be sustained in 1993 and 1994 according to the
latest DRI forecast, which suggests that sales of trucks (6 tonnes and
above) could increase by 13 per cent in 1993 to 32,700 and by 14 per cent to
37,400 in 1994.
It is expected that pressures in the UK to replace older trucks, which have
been retained during the recession, will become more intense. 'Many truck
operators will be experiencing rising costs as they hang on to vehicles
beyond the point at which they would normally renew them if trading
conditions were better,' says the DRI report.
An early sign of improving prospects is coming from the truck rental sector
in the UK, which operators often turn to as a means of adding capacity in
the short-term, when they are uncertain about embarking on a new truck
purchase to meet higher demand.
Despite falling sales in western Europe, truck makers in Europe managed to
increase production modestly by 2.2 per cent last year to 324,000, helped by
exports to overseas markets with important orders coming from north Africa
and the Middle East. Output fell in 1990 by 13.4 per cent to 317,000.
The latest DRI study suggests that the fall in truck production (6 tonnes
and above) will have been resumed this year with a drop of around 7.5 per
cent to 300,000, however. Output is forecast to decline further in 1993 by
5.2 per cent to 285,000. Production reached a peak of 366,000 in 1989.
In previous recessions in Europe, which had been triggered by steep
increases in oil prices, the western European truck industry had been able
to cushion demand losses at home through sharply higher exports to the
oil-producing countries.
'This time the nature of the recession is different and is accompanied by a
weak global outlook with real commodity prices remaining low, and little
prospect for exports to make up domestic shortfalls,' says DRI.
With the main impulses for recovery coming from domestic demand in Europe,
DRI forecasts the start of a modest recovery in output in 1994 with an
increase of 3.1 per cent to 293,000.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (3): In search of an
alliance - Profile of DAF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE endless war of attrition in the European truck industry Daf, the
Dutch commercial vehicle maker, appears set to be the latest victim of the
wave of restructuring that has swept through the sector.
Three months ago it admitted that it had been forced to enter discussions on
'a strategic alliance'. While still refusing publicly to identify the
hoped-for saviour, it appears that Daf is seeking shelter under the giant
shadow of Mercedes-Benz, the world's leading truck maker and the automotive
subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial corporation.
Daf, which is now in its third year of heavy losses, says that it is seeking
an alliance, where the new partner would provide fresh equity to bolster its
battered balance sheet, as well as collaboration to allow it to share
products, new product development costs and plant capacities.
Its need for an alliance is becoming increasingly urgent as truck markets
weaken across Europe, and as recovery from prolonged recession in the UK,
still Daf's biggest market, remains elusive.
In its latest setback Daf announced last month that it would have to defer
payment of a dividend in 1992 on an issue of preference shares made only a
year ago to raise Fl 250m to strengthen its creaking finances.
The dividend postponement - along with the announcement of more production
cutbacks caused the Daf ordinary share price to plunge to an all-time low of
Fl 8.80 in trading in the last month from a high for the year of Fl 26.90.
Daf was floated on the Amsterdam and London stock exchanges in 1989 at a
price of Fl 47.00 a share and peaked at Fl 58.30 shortly afterwards.
The reluctance of some Daf shareholders to subscribe to last year's share
issue has radically changed its shareholder structure.
The British Aerospace stake (a product of Daf's takeover in 1987 of the
Leyland truck operations and BAe's subsequent takeover of Rover, formerly
British Leyland) has fallen from 16 per cent to only 10.9 per cent.
At the same time three leading Dutch financial institutions have emerged as
big shareholders, ABN-AMRO Bank with 8.2 per cent, and the Dutch insurance
groups ING and Aegon with 10.6 and 6.4 per cent respectively.
While Daf seeks the support of Mercedes-Benz, it is also in advanced talks
for additional funding of Fl 210m in credits backed by the Dutch and Belgian
states. Separately it has explored potential collaborative ventures in
components with Hino, the Japanese truck maker.
Daf's fortunes have changed with alarming speed reflecting the dramatic
volatility of the European truck market. It fell into net losses of Fl 228m
in 1990 and Fl 394m in 1991 - and failed to pay dividends - after achieving
a record net profit of Fl 172m in 1989.
Daf has turned from hunter to prey in the European truck industry.
In the late 1980s it moved into high gear in a drive to acquire, itself, the
critical size that might have promoted it into the top league of European
truck makers.
In 1987 it took over the then British Leyland truck and van operations in a
move that transformed it from being essentially a heavy truck and bus maker,
into a commercial vehicle producer with a full product range from vans to
light, medium and heavy trucks and buses.
Buoyed by the record sales and profits of 1989 it then tried successively to
take over Enasa in Spain and Steyr in Austria, but each time it was
thwarted, as bigger rivals stepped in.
Among today's surviving European truck makers, DAF is exposed by having the
breadth of product range of the biggest players without their production and
sales volumes. It has entered a collaboration with Renault to develop a new
van range for the mid-1990s, but until it started its present negotiations
with Mercedes-Benz, it had failed to find a partner to share the much more
onerous product development burden on the truck side of its business.
At the same time it has lacked the depth of financial resources to allow it
to emerge unscathed from the horrors that have beset its sales in the UK,
which became its single biggest market after the merger with Leyland.
Daf has tried hard to reduce its dependence on the UK by building its dealer
network and sales in particular in Germany and in France. Its endeavours are
beginning to bear fruit in those markets, but in 1991 the UK still accounted
for 29.4 per cent of group turnover.
It was little consolation that Daf became the truck market leader in the UK
last year, narrowly overhauling its bitter local rival Iveco Ford, when at
the same time overall UK truck sales were suffering their steepest slide
into recession since the Second World War with demand at its lowest level
since the early 1950s. UK truck sales have fallen by 60 per cent in the past
three years.
According to figures from DRI, the London-based automotive analysts, Daf's
share of the western European heavy truck market (above 15 tonnes) fell to
only 7.9 per cent last year from 10 per cent in 1990 leaving it last among
the seven leading European truck makers.
It has managed, however, to cut its net loss in the first half of 1992 to Fl
97.4m from Fl 179.1m a year ago, with its operating loss reduced to Fl 27.4m
from Fl 116.5m a year earlier. It has launched this year a new heavy truck
range, the Daf 75/85, developed at a cost of Fl 550m.
Between the end of 1991 and the end of 1993 restructuring measures will take
costs of Fl 500m a year out of the business. With manufacturing operations
in the Netherlands, Belgium and the UK, the company will have cut its
workforce to fewer than 12,000 by the end of 1993 from 16,782 in 1989.
Daf's earlier forecast - conditional on various favourable developments - of
a break-even for 1992 after a loss in the first half, had to be changed, in
late August to a break-even only in the second half of 1992.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (1): Squeeze tightens as

restructuring appears to be unavoidable. Kevin Done examines an industry

THE vice is tightening inexorably on truck makers in western Europe as sales
fall for the third year in succession, with little prospect of relief next
year.
As several leading producers face mounting losses, the industry is again
cutting jobs, and a further wave of restructuring appears unavoidable in a
sector where the number of truck makers has already shrunk from 25 in 1975
to 10 last year.
In North America, demand for heavy trucks (above 15 tonnes) has begun to
rise after three years of declining sales, but margins remain tightly
squeezed, and most producers are still losing money. The heavy truck
industry in the US has been deep in loss for five of the past 11 years. It
has made net losses over the past decade, and the industry was working at
only 55 per cent of capacity last year.
The Japanese truck market has also weakened in the past two years. Sales of
trucks fell by 6.9 per cent to 179,000 in the 12 months to the end of March
this year, and Hino, a leading Japanese heavy truck maker, has recently cut
its 1992/93 forecast of overall domestic truck demand to 142,500 from an
earlier forecast of 155,000, a 20 per cent fall from the previous year.
Nissan Diesel, one of Hino's main domestic rivals, fell into loss in the six
months to the end of September and is not paying an interim dividend, while
Hino itself recently announced a 59 per cent fall in pre-tax profits in the
same period.
In all three regions truck makers are facing spiralling product development
costs and rising expenditure to meet tougher environmental regulations, a
burden which is increased by the lack of harmonisation of regulations and
testing procedures between Europe, Japan and North America.
In the European Community truck makers are also confronting the advent of
the single market, which is expected to prove a mixed blessing for the
commercial vehicle industry.
According to Werner Niefer, president of Mercedes-Benz, the automotive
subsidiary of Daimler-Benz of Germany and the world's biggest truck maker,
the volume of transport in Europe is expected to grow by 40 per cent during
the next 10 years. (Roads account for more than 65 per cent of goods
transport in Europe).
The promised growth in transport volumes in the single market should be
accompanied, however, by a far-reaching deregulation of transport markets,
which is expected to intensify competition drastically in the transport
industry, with a considerable increase in the productivity of haulage
operators rather than in the number of trucks in use. As more power is
concentrated in the hands of larger transport groups, they could succeed in
driving down prices.
The European truck industry has watched with trepidation the impact of
deregulation in the US which over the past decade has pared truck producers'
margins to the bone.
The commercial vehicle industry - and in particular the truck sector - is
notorious for its exaggerated trade cycles, and while North America appears
to be finally emerging this year from the trough of its latest recession -
heavy duty truck sales dropped by 36 per cent from 169,000 in 1988 to
108,000 in 1991 - the west European market is still on the downward slope
with an uncertain braking distance.
The alarm signals of recent weeks show how the squeeze is tightening.
Mercedes-Benz, the overwhelming leader of the western European truck market
with a 31 per cent market share last year, announced earlier this month that
it was postponing indefinitely its plan to build a new 40,000-a-year truck
plant in eastern Germany.
It blamed the decision on three main factors: the structural problems facing
the European commercial vehicle industry, which had become 'visible in all
clarity' as a result of the economic downturn; the changed medium-term
outlook with falling demand for light and heavy trucks; and the clearly
reduced prospects for the development of eastern European markets.
Last year, Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicle production reached a record
level at 296,000, but now its German plants are already facing extended
short-time working in the first half of next year.
Volvo Truck, one of the world's leading heavy truck makers, has announced
this month another package of emergency measures aimed at cutting costs by
SKr2.5bn (Dollars 425m) a year by 1995, and including the loss of another
1,980 jobs, of which 1,410 will be in Sweden.
Volvo's truck operations have slumped into loss this year in the face of
lower capacity utilisation in Europe, substantially higher product
development costs and inadequate margins in North America.
It is in loss in spite of an earlier crisis package announced in 1990 aimed
at cutting annual costs by SKr1.5bn by the end of this year.
It closed one of its US plants at Ogden, Utah, last year and cut its
workforce worldwide during 1991 by 1,150 to 18,100. French trade unions
warned this month that Renault Vehicules Industriels, the French truck
maker, was preparing to announce shortly up to 2,500 job losses, amounting
to nearly 15 per cent of the workforce. RVI has plunged into a big loss this
year from the minimal net profit of FFr23m made in 1991. The results are a
far cry from the net profits of FFr1bn and FFr930m achieved in 1988 and
1989. It has introduced temporary lay-offs, averaging seven days a month.
Scania, the Swedish heavy truck maker and hitherto the most profitable
European producer, is cutting 875 jobs at its Swedish and Dutch plants by
early next year, after already cutting the workforce at its European
production plants by 1,500 since 1989.
The loudest distress signals have come from Daf, the Dutch commercial
vehicle maker, which is now in its third year of heavy losses in the face of
the deep recession in the UK, its largest single market, where truck sales
have more than halved since 1989.
Daf is the most likely next victim of the inexorable restructuring in the
European truck industry. For more than three months it has been negotiating
with Mercedes-Benz over a potential strategic alliance.
Daf is seeking a partner to provide fresh equity to bolster its battered
balance sheet, as well as collaboration to allow it to share products, new
product development costs and plant capacities.
Mercedes-Benz has made no secret of the fact that it expects the process of
concentration in the European truck industry to proceed apace to the end of
the decade.
'By the end of the 1990s we will have three supranational strategic
alliances in Europe, each with one major company at its core,' said Helmut
Werner, chief executive-elect of Mercedes-Benz, in an earlier speech.
Much larger producers than DAF had already concluded that times were
becoming too tough to go it alone.
In the most significant realignment of forces to date Volvo of Sweden and
Renault of France have embarked on a far-reaching alliance which includes 45
per cent cross-shareholdings in each other's truck operations.
Iveco, the commercial vehicles subsidiary of Fiat of Italy which was
originally formed from the merger of smaller Italian, French and German
truck makers, added management control of Ford's UK-based truck operations
in the second half of the 1980s. Itself in loss, it is now trying to
rationalise Spain's loss-making Enasa, the formerly state-owned maker of
Pegaso trucks, acquired at the beginning of 1991.
While the big groups consolidate, the minnows continue to disappear.
The latest casualty is AWD, the small privately-owned UK truck maker, which
was forced to call in the receiver this summer after failing to make a go of
General Motors' former heavily loss-making Bedford truck operations.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Why schools may become obsolete: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have often wondered what it must have been like to hear Bernard Shaw speak
in the 1880s, before he became famous. Many of his ideas, such as the
nationalisation of industry and the creation of a welfare state, must have
struck his small London audiences as completely mad. Yet much of what he
predicted came to pass within the space of one or two generations. Last
week, listening to a sparsely attended lecture at the Cato Institute, a
Washington think-tank, I felt a kinship with the Victorians that Shaw so
loved to harangue.
The speaker was Mr Lewis Perelman, author of a recently published book,
School's Out: Hyperlearning, the New Technology and the End of Education*.
The thesis he expounded with messianic fervour - which proved too outrageous
even for his libertarian Cato audience - was that conventional education is
obsolete. Putting resources into school reform makes about as much sense as
investing in the horse and buggy at the end of the 19th century. Just as the
automobile was destined to sweep aside horse-based transport, so
'hyperlearning' will sweep aside education as we now understand it.
I am not suggesting that Mr Perelman, a former high school science teacher
and planning director for Holiday Inns, is another Shaw. But I do believe
his fundamental argument - that technological change is undermining the
foundations of conventional education - is worth taking seriously.
Teaching today is immensely labour-intensive. Hundreds of thousands of
teachers stand in classrooms delivering almost identical lectures to their
students. Yet such techniques are inherently inefficient because the
abilities of students vary so enormously - and because the competitive
atmosphere of classrooms inhibits many less able students.
With the latest computer technology, a single talented teacher can prepare
and deliver a course to an unlimited number of students. Feedback loops and
programmed instruction can allow students to learn at their own pace,
repeating difficult sections as often as necessary. In principle, electronic
lessons can move effortlessly between different media; a history course, for
example, can move from a 'talking head' lecture format to archive text, to
film footage of battlefields and finish by playing music composed during the
period.
As the cost of electronic gadgetry falls, the savings from eliminating
classroom teachers and the physical infrastructure of schools are
potentially immense. To give an idea, The Civil War, an acclaimed US
television documentary, cost about Dollars 3m to make, or about 10 cents a
viewer/learner. To convey the same information to the same number of people
through traditional classroom techniques would have cost about Dollars 6bn
and required the services of all of America's college history professors for
more than a year.
A second plank of Mr Perelman's argument was that we can no longer afford to
think of education as something we complete in our youth as a preparation
for work and citizenship. With skill requirements changing constantly, we
all have to accept the need for lifelong learning. Fortunately electronic
tools give us the ability to learn what we want, when we want - and in the
comfort of our own homes.
The revolution in learning made possible by new technology is being impeded,
Mr Perelman argues, by the entrenched power of existing, redundant
institutions. He would abolish all public grants for schools and colleges
and give the money directly to families in the form of learning credits or
'micro-vouchers'. Just as US food stamps can be spent on any kind of food,
so educational micro-vouchers could be spent on anything that nurtures the
mind, be it distance-learning courses, video cassettes, books or
conventional schooling (which would no longer be compulsory.)
The second big change he advocates are laws forbidding employers to
discriminate on the basis of academic qualifications. Employers would be
able to test recruits to determine if they have the skills actually needed
for a job, but not to require them to have served time at schools or
colleges. Mr Perelman believes that US academic education is already a
costly fraud. People pay ludicrous sums for degrees that are of no practical
relevance and which no longer even guarantee high-paid employment. If
'credentialism' were banned and replaced by tests of actual competence, the
whole edifice might come crashing down.
But if conventional schools and colleges vanished, what would happen to
young people? Well some institutions for sports, the arts and social
interaction would be needed, but they would not have to involve the
regimentation of today's schools. That regimentation was, in any case,
largely needed to discipline people for the monotony of a mass production
industrial age that is already passing.
The essence of Mr Perelman's argument is that new technology provides the
means for a far more economical, flexible and personalised form of
education. At heart a utopian, he believes learning is as natural as eating
or sex; the trouble is that most people's appetite for it is destroyed by
crude and outdated delivery systems. His ideas probably seem outlandish; but
remember, few people predict the really big social and economic changes that
transform our lives.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Re-take the refugee test: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Euro-sceptics jeer that the European Community has failed the test of the
Yugoslav crisis. They say it proves that the far-reaching ambitions of the
Maastricht treaty are wildly unrealistic. Europe could not hope to put
together a common foreign policy, and might as well abandon the attempt.
Reality will not let us off so lightly. The sceptics seem to be misled by
some school-games paradigm: the hopelessly unco-ordinated are excused from
taking part in the football team. But they should look instead at the
pitiless academic discipline of the French lycee which admits no such
excuse.
The fact that the Community has failed so far does not mean that from now on
the Europeans are excused. On the contrary, we are now paying for our
failure with a 'redoublement'; we must re-do the course again and take the
exam until we pass.
The problem is that now the exam is much more difficult, and the syllabus
has been vastly expanded. At first the military experts told us there was
nothing to gain and everything to lose by trying to intervene in this civil
war. It would involve very large forces, unpredictable but probably large
casualties, an uncertain and probably unrealisable political strategy, and a
commitment of indefinite duration.
In the face of this kind of dire risk assessment, politicians quail.
Unfortunately, they failed adequately to weigh up the costs of not
intervening in the crisis.
What we have instead is a massive flood of refugees from the war zone, which
is already threatening the political stability of German society, and which
will certainly get worse, in Germany or elsewhere. We thought we could stay
out of trouble by not getting involved. This was a mistake; the trouble has
come to us, in their hundreds of thousands, and we cannot avoid it.
We certainly cannot avoid the flood of refugees by playing cynical and
hypocritical bureaucratic games. Refugees claim political asylum because
this is their only plausible escape route. So the German political
establishment prepares to rewrite the constitution to limit the access of
asylum seekers; and the British government sets up new and Kafkaesque
obstacles to frustrate them.
If they want asylum in Britain, they must have a visa. However, they cannot
secure a visa, because Britain has no consulate in Bosnia; in any case the
government will refuse a visa if it is for asylum. But even if the consulate
in Vienna were to grant a visa, the hard men at Heathrow are empowered to
cancel it. This is Catch-22 in spades.
So when Mr John Major, the British prime minister, says in parliament: 'With
the best will in the world, we simply cannot take everyone who, for
understandable reasons, wants to leave Yugoslavia,' he is adopting a
hypocritical posture. The British government is not showing the best will in
the world, and probably would prefer to take no Yugoslav refugees at all.
This is not an option, however. All west European countries will take large
numbers of unwanted refugees, willy nilly, legally or illegally, because of
the scale of the problem. There are already large numbers of illegal
immigrants from various parts of the world in all members of the Community,
because they cannot in practice be kept out; and the numbers will
undoubtedly rise after the easing of internal frontier controls between
member states under the single market next year.
Tighter rules in Germany will be intended to keep more people out; but all
land frontiers in Europe are highly permeable, and the German government
will be deeply reluctant to incur the shame of mass expulsions. Britain is
slightly protected by geography, compared with Germany or France, but only
slightly. There is no security in the Channel.
No useful purpose is served by a myopic focus on the legal definition of
what is or is not a refugee. It may be true that most of those who are
fleeing the war, the destruction of their homes and the deaths of their
relatives, are not 'really' refugees under fear of persecution, in the
strict meaning of the term in the 1951 Geneva Convention. But the argument
is essentially beside the point. When 500,000 people are already displaced
in the rest of Europe and 2m inside ex-Yugoslavia, it is foolish of Western
governments to pretend the problem can be made to vanish by being defined
out of existence.
In any case, it is not easy to apply asylum laws as rigidly as governments
would like. Much less than a tenth of those who seek asylum in Germany or
Britain finally secure that status; but in both countries most applicants
manage to stay permanently, either legally, on some other grounds, or
illegally, by disappearing into the undergrowth.
Trying to halt the war refugees at the frontier is now no longer an option
for the rest of Europe. The longer the members of the Community insist on
limiting their military intervention in Bosnia to the minimal escort of aid
convoys, the more certain it must be that the tide will turn into a flood.
The only way of limiting the flow is to go to the source, and take
sufficient military action on the ground to make it slightly more possible
for some of the persecuted minorities to continue to live in their own
country. Europe cannot avoid responsibility, however much it would prefer to
do so.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Monday Interview: Charmed by the simple life - Heinrich von
Pierer, chief executive of Siemens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heinrich von Pierer, chief executive of Siemens, Europe's biggest
electronics company, thinks the quest for perfection, one of the traditional
strengths of German industry, can go too far.
'Germans always try to do the very best that's possible. It's almost a
philosophical thing: I believe this perfectionism is not just a Siemens
characteristic; it is ingrained in every German engineer,' he says. 'It's a
very sympathetic quality . . . but I'm a businessman, and it is my job to
supply what the market wants.'
Mr von Pierer, a trim 51 with a passion for tennis and a taste for colourful
ties, is less than two months into the job. He is mulling over the
long-standing issues which exercise him in particular and which are common
throughout German manufacturing. 'We earn too little; 2.5 per cent return on
sales is too little,' he says of Siemens.
He denounces claims from some of his peers that Germany is losing its
attraction as a place to invest and manufacture. He reels off the country's
well-known educational, political and infrastructural advantages. But then
he hesitates as he considers the negative side of the picture.
Rolled together, the disadvantages lead to a single conclusion. 'Germany has
become too expensive,' he says. At Siemens, as at Daimler-Benz and
Volkswagen car groups, the result will be a tough programme of cost-cutting
and lay-offs among the company's 400,000-strong global workforce.
Mr von Pierer, formerly a leading local figure in the Christian Social Union
(CSU) conservative political party, discovered and corrected one weakness in
the group's philosophy - the perfectionist culture - when in charge of KWU,
Siemens' power plant division. There, products were sometimes
over-engineered, more sophisticated or with more features than the customers
wanted or needed, he says. Customers turned elsewhere for simpler, cheaper
products.
Similar conditions applied in Siemens' medical engineering arm and are now
being tackled. Like KWU, which does two-thirds of its business outside
Germany, 80 per cent of the division's sales are abroad. It is, therefore,
more exposed to the pressures of international competition than the group as
a whole, which still generates 46 per cent of its DM80bn (Pounds 33bn)
turnover inside Germany.
'Siemens makes excellent equipment, but the question is: has it always paid
us to do so?' Mr von Pierer asks. 'We must adapt to the market.' The
Japanese, coming in from the low-technology end of the market, have built a
successful medical equipment business with basic equipment, he says.
Naturally, Siemens' quality must not be impaired as it counters this threat,
he adds, but 'we need to learn to make things differently and more simply'.
For Mr von Pierer, this does not involve a revolution in the company. He is
no iconoclast, but he is determined to speed up the process of change. In
this respect he resembles many German chief executives. 'If you scratch just
below the top level in many companies, you will find quite a few like him,'
an associate remarks.
His training as a lawyer and economist, more than his relative youth, marks
him out in a business where the engineer has normally ruled. But he is also
a consensus-builder in the old mould (he claims his colleagues support his
perfectionism critique to a man), with real affection for the company and
undisguised respect for his mentors and predecessors.
He owes much to Mr Karl-heinz Kaske, Siemens' chief executive for 12 years
until September. Mr Kaske oversaw the acquisitions programme of the 1980s
which raised and broadened Siemens' profile in the US and other important
markets. He also opened up the group's monolithic structure, creating 17
operating divisions which encompass 300 different business activities.
It has fallen to Mr von Pierer, and others of his generation promoted under
Mr Kaske, to streamline the sprawling empire, penetrate further into foreign
markets, especially Asia, and improve the cost structure - at a time when
the international and domestic economies are barely growing.
The axe has already fallen on thousands of jobs, notably in Siemens'
loss-ridden semiconductor and computer businesses. The group, with a staff
turnover of about 10 per cent a year, is coming to the point where
non-replacement of voluntary leavers and other 'pain-free' payroll reduction
methods - early retirement, non-renewal of short-term contracts - are no
longer enough.
While some companies are hinting that they may soon resort to forced
redundancies, anathema in Germany's 'social economy', Mr von Pierer is
trying to find other ways to cut costs. 'The hire-and-fire principle does
not exist here, and I never want it to,' he says.
So he is looking at other ways to boost efficiency. Can over-engineered
products be simplified without any loss of quality? Can tortuous
manufacturing processes be shortened or replaced? Is there a greater role
for computerised machines in a business where engineering and software
account for 50 per cent of added value?
He says there is scope for more manufacturing outside Germany: not simply to
escape the high cost base at home, but also to add value in the places where
Siemens does business, collaborating with and buying components from
customers. 'It is not just a question of costs,' Mr von Pierer says. 'If we
want to continue to develop as a global player we cannot simply deal with
our customers as importers.'
At the same time, he is contending with severe problems in two of his most
important divisions: semiconductors and computers. It is no comfort that the
semiconductor industry is making losses around the world - the figure is
estimated at about DM500m for Siemens. Much the same applies to Siemens
Nixdorf (SNI), the computer business, which is also losing heavily.
Semiconductors are the common components, the thread running through every
important business activity in the group. 'What is fundamental for me is
that we should have the technology for all our products,' he says. But the
costs are huge, and Siemens, although ranked third in European semiconductor
sales, is relatively small in world terms. Collaborations to defray
development and manufacturing charges - most recently a link with IBM and
Toshiba on the new generation 256-megabit D-Ram - help. But the lack of
European partners willing to take up the group's open invitation to
co-operate obviously chafes.
'Sometimes it is difficult to get across that we are not just doing it for
our own needs,' he complains. Access to advanced memory chip technology is
crucial in markets where manufacturers increasingly seek to tailor product
precisely to customers' needs . . . and also where Japan is on the
ascendant.
Co-operation also figures in his plans for Siemens Nixdorf, the result of an
ill-timed and ill-starred marriage of Germany's great computer rivals. But
it is still too early to talk about it, he says. 'We must first bring our
house into order.'
Bad luck has undoubtedly influenced the fortunes of a company in the throes
of reorganisation just as the computer industry was diving into a severe
structural crisis. But the fact that it has taken the best part of two years
to flush out old enmities plaguing both sides in the takeover speaks volumes
about the cautious German approach to mergers.
Siemens also fumbled the assimilation of the US Rolm business, bought from
IBM in 1989, into its private communications business. 'We had one
telecommunications system in Germany and one in the US and found it took
much longer than we expected to integrate the businesses,' says Mr von
Pierer. But Rolm is now shaping up: its three divisions have been rolled
into one. 'And high time, too,' mutters the new chief. When business
confidence recovers and private communications markets start to improve,
Rolm will be in the front line with its competitors, he says.
However, no such difficulties attended the more recent absorption of Texas
Instruments' industrial control activities, and plugging in the Sylvania
lightbulb business to Siemens' Osram subsidiary promises to be profitable.
Siemens, it seems, is gradually coming to terms with cost-conscious global
markets and starting to appreciate the benefits of doing things more simply.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE WAKE of last week's turmoil in the European exchange rate mechanism,
dealers will pay even more attention to the prospects for a reduction in
official German interest rates this week, writes James Blitz.
The markets have recently tempered their optimism about an easing in German
monetary policy, and money markets continue to doubt whether there will be
another cut in the discount rate this year.
However, the after-effects of Sweden's float of the krona pushed weaker ERM
currencies nearer their floors last week, and the earlier optimism about a
rate cut is again taking hold.
An important indication of whether the Bundesbank can afford to ease policy
will come in the M3 money supply figures for October due out this week. Mr
Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, believes the figure
will rise to 9.5 per cent from a previous 9.3 per cent. This falls well
outside the current annual target range of 3.5-5.5 per cent.
Mr Mackinnon points out that the Bundesbank is due to revise its target for
M3 growth next month. The 5 independent economic advisers to the German
government - the 'five wise men' - said last week that the M3 target should
be revised up from 6 per cent to 8 per cent.
In the US, the main focus will be on this week's preliminary figure for 3rd
Quarter GDP, due on Wednesday, and the figures for Durable Goods orders and
Consumer confidence in September and October due out tomorrow. Both will
give further indications of the strength of the upturn in the US economy.
However, analysts believe that the economic appointments of Mr Bill
Clinton's new administration are certain to have a more immediate impact on
dollar/D-Mark trading.

COMPETITIVE pressures in the food industry have worsened over the summer
period, and will be commented on this week by both food manufacturers and
retailers.
Argyll, the Safeway supermarket group, should still show a good increase in
interim pre-tax profits when it reports on Tuesday.
Estimates are for a rise from Pounds 177.8m recorded a year ago to Pounds
200m or so this time.
Argyll is expected to have achieved better sales growth than its main
competitors and margins are rising.
On Wednesday Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugar and sweeteners group, will reveal the
damage caused in the US from overcapacity in the sweetener market and the
delay in getting approval for Sucralose, its calorie-free sugar substitute.
Provisions, redundancy costs and the start-up costs for Sucralose will cut
profits for the year to end September from Pounds 234.6m to around Pounds
190m.
Northern Foods by contrast, will on Thursday announce higher interim profits
of Pounds 67 to Pounds 68m against Pounds 55.2m, despite higher interest and
depreciation charges and a competitive squeeze on some divisions.
Growth in earnings per share will be limited after last year's rights issue
to pay for the Express acquisition.
Kwik Save is expected on Wednesday to report an increase of about 10 per
cent in pre-tax profits for the year ended August to about Pounds 112m from
Pounds 101.7m.
Its market share is thought to have increased from 7.6 per cent a year ago
to around 9 per cent.
Interim results from Thorn-EMI on Tuesday are expected to provide little
excitement as the music business has been in the doldrums.
Thorn itself has warned the City not to expect too much while the newly
acquired Virgin music business will have made virtually no contribution in
the first half.
The rental business, however, has remained fairly resilient and forecasts
for the interim are for around Pounds 95m (Pounds 94.9m).
Earnings are likely to be diluted by about 17 per cent to 15p due to the
Virgin acquisition.
Thorn is likely to face questioning from analysts about the impact of the
slowdown in the music market, particularly in Europe.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Economics: All eyes on German inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPORTANT indicators on German inflation this week could have significant
ramifications for European countries locked into the exchange rate
mechanism.
Another big jump in the November consumer prices index will delay further
easing of German interest rates by the Bundesbank, which will force other
ERM members to keep their lending rates high.
Last month, the annual rate of consumer price rises shot up to 3.7 per cent
from 3.5 per cent, reversing an almost continuous downwards direction which
began in the spring.
So this week's data will be watched carefully to see whether the October
figure was an aberration, or the beginning of an upwards turn.
'If November does not see a substantial declaration in the inflation rate,
the chances of the Bundesbank tolerating any further easing - in official or
unofficial interest rates - is approximately zero,' says Ms Alison Cottrell,
international economist at Midland Global Market research.
Figures for German M3 growth in October are also out this week.
The data will inevitably be distorted by the extensive foreign exchange
intervention that took place in September as the ERM came under severe
strain.
In the UK, the most important figures are the trade statistics, released
today. These are expected to show a rise in the visible trade deficit to
around Pounds 1.2bn, from Pounds 1.1bn in September.
Other economic highlights of the week follow.
The figures in brackets are the median of City economists' forecasts, from
MMS International, a financial information company.

FT  23 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Gilts slip on worries over UK
funding needs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GILTS edged down last week amid funding worries and signs that the UK
economy may be flickering into life.
Against German bonds, gilts also suffered due to last week's strains on
European currency markets which pushed funds out of weak currencies into the
D-Mark and led to the weekend's ERM realignment.
The falls in prices along the yield curve had been widely anticipated. The
turnround brought to an end a generally healthy period for gilts since the
devaluation of sterling in mid-September. Short-dated gilts turned down
partly because of the perception that further cuts in UK base rates are
unlikely by the end of the year, while longer-dated securities fell on
inflation worries and concern about funding.
The short-dated Treasury 8 3/4 per cent stock maturing in 1997 lost ground
by about a third of a point during the week, being quoted on Friday night at
106 7/32 . The yield was pushed up 8 basis points during the week to 7.18
per cent. At the other end of the yield curve, the 8 3/4 per cent Treasury
bond due in 2017 lost about 1 point to 98 31/32 , with the yield rising 9
basis points to 8.85 per cent.
According to calculations by Mr Nigel Richardson of S. G. Warburg
Securities, the government will need to issue Pounds 5bn worth of gilts by
the end of this financial year - even taking into account the auction of an
expected Pounds 2bn or so worth of gilts on December 2.
This estimate is much higher than that of many economists prior to the
Autumn Statement on November 12, which said the government would need to
borrow Pounds 37bn this financial year, rather than the Pounds 28bn forecast
eight months ago. The escalation is almost totally due to higher spending
and weaker tax revenues triggered by the longer-than-expected recession.
While more than Pounds 1bn a month of gilts seems likely to be on offer to
institutions until next April, the funding needs in 1993-94 will be even
greater. About Pounds 55bn of new securities could find their way into the
market, driving up yields and pushing down prices along the yield curve.
As funding became a talking point, scraps of evidence last week pointed to a
faint improvement for the UK economy. Some believe this means inflationary
pressures could become a problem next year. The 0.9 per cent increase in
retail sales volumes in the three months to October compared with May-July
may signal increased consumer spending, while October also saw a Pounds
5.1bn rise in bank and building society lending.
While no-one is trumpeting an end to the recession, many gilt investors are
reasoning that the worst may be over. This points to a period of relative
decline for gilt prices.
As strains emerged in the ERM last week, gilt yield spreads over German
bunds widened. Two weeks ago, yields for 10-year gilts were 78 basis points
above their German equivalent which widened to 114 basis points on Friday.
Over the same period, the yield spread between 10-year gilts and the
comparable French bonds rose from 8 to 38 basis points. According to Mr
Sanjay Joshi, an analyst at Daiwa, the trend to higher gilts yields will
continue as investors 'look more at the fundamentals of what is happening to
the UK economy compared to other parts of Europe'.

FT  23 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Floating krona leads to rapid
readjustment in Sweden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S bond market has entered a period of rapid readjustment following
the government's decision on Thursday to let the krona float. For the first
time in four years, the country ended the week with a positive yield curve,
and the expectation is that it will steepen, at least in the short term.
Yields responded immediately to the flotation news, falling sharply on
Thursday and continuing their decline at the short-end on Friday.
On Friday night, the yield for benchmark five-year government bonds stood at
9.90 per cent, compared with 10.20 per cent on Thursday and 11.85 per cent
before the krona was set free, while the bond due 2003 closed at 10.29 per
cent.
At these levels the market is already discounting cuts in short-term
interest rates. Those hoping for an early move by the Riksbank, the central
bank, on Friday may have been disappointed, as the overnight rate was held
at 12.5 per cent, but rates are expected to come down to 10 - 11 per cent in
the near future.
Further ahead, the betting is that Sweden will follow Finland by bringing
rates down cautiously, rather than relaxing monetary policy substantially as
the UK has done since it left the ERM.
Mr Bengt Dennis, Riksbank governor, made it clear late last week that
keeping inflation under control remained a top priority. Not only that, but
the government would be anxious to re-establish some credibility by not
allowing the currency to weaken unduly.
No doubt a firm statement on future monetary and fiscal policy will emerge
in due course. Meanwhile, Sweden's spiralling budget deficit, aggravated by
the domestic recession and the bail-out of the banking system, will be a key
influence on market sentiment.
The budget deficit will reach SKr166bn (Dollars 24.75bn) in 1992-93,
according to the latest government calculation, but others put the figure
much higher. Some suggest the public sector borrowing requirement in the
coming year might be as much as 18 per cent of GDP.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the government has decided to widen
its funding possibilities, using the occasion of last week's crisis to
announce plans to scrap an eight-year-old restriction which had previously
prevented it from borrowing abroad to finance its debts.
This proposal could be positive for the domestic market, if it results in a
significant switch in the government's funding strategy.
Mr Lars Boman, deputy director of the National Debt Office's international
market department, said: 'The major part of the budget deficit will still be
financed in the Swedish market.' If so, domestic players will predominate.
Local dealers do not expect much foreign participation in krona-denominated
issues, given the uncertain direction of the Swedish currency.

FT  23 NOV 92 / European Government Bonds: Investors favour safe haven of
D-Mark bloc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE weekend realignment of the European exchange rate mechanism, which saw
the devaluations of the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo by 6 per
cent each, is unlikely to relieve the tensions in Europe's currency grid
unless German rates are cut soon.
Economists expect further weakening in some of the high-yielding European
government bond markets as dealers and investors continue to favour the safe
haven of the D-Mark bloc.
While Spain and Portugal may escape further speculative pressure in the
foreign exchange markets this week, the other weaker EMS currencies - the
Irish punt and the Danish krone - could still come under attack, analysts
warn.
'The changes (at the weekend) were too piecemeal to be sufficient to
forestall further pressures,' said Mr Avinash Persaud, senior currency
economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
Last week's currency turmoil started in Sweden, and as the Swedish krona
buckled, the wave of speculation spread to the lira - no longer in the ERM -
peseta, escudo, Danish krone and punt. In the bond markets, investors
continued to favour the safety of the D-Mark bloc at the expense of
peripheral European bond markets.
While the decision by Spain and Portugal to devalue within the EMS was
welcomed, bond analysts warned question marks still remained over the
ability of the Irish and Danish currencies to weather the latest turbulence.
Spreads of Spanish, Portuguese and Italian government bonds over German
bunds are likely to remain wide, as fears of further currency weakness
prevail.
Mr George Magnus, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, said Denmark may
escape further speculative pressures following Friday's decision to raise
domestic interest rates to 15 per cent. However, other economists warned the
weaker currencies were likely to remain under pressure in the next few days,
particularly if German interest rates are unchanged.

FT  23 NOV 92 / US Money and Credit: Markets cast a wary eyeover money
supply figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a long absence, the money supply is back in focus. Although it never
really went away, it did in the minds of bond market investors, who in their
eagerness to embrace the Federal Reserve's more relaxed monetary stance,
stopped worrying about the money supply earlier this year.
Now that M2 - which includes currency in circulation, bank accounts, money
market funds and certificates of deposit, and is the broadest and most
closely observed measure of money - is growing faster than anyone expected,
the market is once again casting a wary eye on the money numbers.
The latest data, showing a Dollars 6.6bn increase in M2 during the first
full week of November - well above analysts' forecasts of a Dollars 1bn
increase - and an annual rate of 2.5 per cent growth, meant that money
supply growth was back in the Fed's target range of between 2.5 per cent and
6.5 per cent for the first time since early May. Taking more recent data, M2
has grown at a healthy 5 per cent annual rate since it hit bottom in July.
What this means is that monetary policy is more likely to stay on hold.
Moreover, those who are betting on the next move in interest rates being up,
rather than down, may prove to have backed the right horse.
While no one is suggesting that money growth is getting out of hand, recent
indications of reviving consumer confidence - although it may prove to be a
short-lived post-election burst - and the likelihood of a fiscal stimulus
package in the early days of the Clinton presidency, suggests expectations
that the money supply will expand at more rapidly over the next six months
can only gather pace.
This, says Mr Mitchell Held, credit market economist at Smith Barney in New
York, could spell trouble: 'Inflation remains only a distant concern for the
market at the moment, but rising growth expectations combined with
above-target monetary growth could make for a revival of inflation fears,
and for shaky market conditions, later this year or in early 1993.'
Analysts believe rising loan demand is behind the resurgence in money
growth. Both commercial and industrial loan volume has picked up recently,
while third-quarter bank earnings reports suggest that consumer loan
activity has been on the increase. Fed surveys, meanwhile, have spotted
signs that small business loans are also up. The evidence has led some
observers to claim that the credit crunch is over.
However, before the inflation hawks get too excited, there are important
factors to consider which some economists believe will ensure that money
growth and inflation do not take off into the stratosphere over the next few
years.
According to Mr Held, some of those factors are:
The likelihood that the consumer sector of the economy, still debt-averse
and facing higher local taxes and rising health and education costs, will
not perform as strongly as in previous post-recessionary periods;
A residential housing sector that will remain subdued because of demographic
changes that will limit growth in the first-time home buying population;
Below-normal growth in the commercial property sector;
Continued corporate downsizing and restructuring;
Only a modest fiscal stimulus package from the Clinton administration; and
Continued cuts in defence spending.
Taken together, these structural forces should keep economic growth in a
non-inflationary range of between 2 and 3 per cent, says Smith Barney.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Risk and Reward: Borrowers take a chance on 'diffs' as
swaps' allure dims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUGH conditions in the swaps market have made it harder than ever for
companies to borrow cheaply, encouraging some to opt for more radical
solutions. In the process, some companies - and their financial
intermediaries - are taking on substantially bigger risks.
During the 1980s, companies were able to borrow at levels well below the
London interbank offered rate (Libor) by swapping the fixed-rate money they
raised through bond offerings into floating-rate financing. Now, only the
best-rated borrowers can hope to do this.
Falling US interest rates have squeezed the availability of swaps in the
dollar market. Borrowers have been unwilling to lock themselves into
fixed-rate interest costs, while rates are expected to ease further. The
result: fewer people willing to pay the fixed-rate leg of a swap agreement.
Other factors have also contributed to the decline in the swap market's
attractions. The growing sophistication of investors and intermediaries and
a breakdown of the barriers between domestic markets have eroded the
opportunities for arbitrage between markets. At the same time, bond and swap
markets have become tightly linked, so that price movements in one are
quickly transmitted into the other.
'Swaps and bonds have become much more closely correlated. Those who want
cheap funding are now having to take risks to get it,' said Mr Nick Burge,
executive director at Nomura International.
The most successful product this year has been the differential or 'diff'
swap, also known as the 'quanto' swap, which allows a borrower to separate
currency and interest rate exposure, by paying interest rates based on one
currency while taking the currency risk of another.
For example, a company with D-Mark liabilities, paying say 8 per cent
interest, may look enviously at dollar rates of 3 1/2 per cent. Under a
differential swap agreement, the company agrees to receive D-Mark Libor in
D-Marks, and to pay a margin over dollar Libor in D-Marks.
The structure takes advantage of different-shaped yield curves to create
immediate cost savings for the borrower. Such an agreement typically runs
from three to five years, so the borrower is essentially betting that the
shift in interest rates will be slower than the yield curve suggests.
'There are monetary policy pressures to keep short-term interest rates low,
and supply fears to keep rates high at the long end (of the dollar market),'
says Mr Ron Tanemura, head of fixed-income derivatives products at Salomon
Brothers.
The risk for the company is that if US interest rates rise or D-Mark
interest rates fall more quickly than expected, planned cost savings could
soon be replaced by losses. Because it is more complicated than a
conventional swap, a diff swap is also more difficult to unwind.
The financial intermediary assumes substantially greater risk than in a
normal swap. Currency risk, artificially separated from interest rate risk
in this way, is very difficult to hedge, since there is no direct
correlation between currency and interest rate movements.
'Diff swaps are more difficult to manage than a straightforward swap,' says
Mr Malcolm Basing, who heads the International Swaps Dealers Association.
'It's not something you can put into the top drawer and forget about.'
Diff swaps require what is known as dynamic hedging, which means that hedges
must be constantly adjusted in line with the latest market moves.
Even then, there is the risk that assumed correlation between interest rates
and currencies will suddenly disappear.
According to swap specialists, the structure of differential swaps is now
widely understood, but the methods of hedging residual exposure remain
proprietary.
Diff swap technology has also been applied to suit investors' requirements.
Credit for the concept is claimed by Credit Suisse Financial Products, which
began marketing diff swaps to Japanese investors in early 1991.
There could be room for further product expansion. According to Mr Chris
Goekjian, head of risk management at CSFP, it may be that 'not all the
applications (of diff swap technology) have been developed yet.'

FT  23 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Flood of Eurosterling debt fails to
reach market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CASUAL glance at the international bond market at the end of last week
would have left the impression that sterling corporate debt was all the
rage.
The UK government had just sold more than Pounds 1.3bn of the stuff, and
British Gas had raised Pounds 300m through a 25-year bond issue. Surely the
bond markets were not that hungry for Eurosterling - and from corporates in
particular?
In reality, very little of this wave of debt actually found its way - or is
likely to find its way - on to the market. In fact, just Pounds 229m of it
is thought to have been put up for offer straight away.
Nearly Pounds 500m more was reportedly being restructured by investment
banks before onward sale. The remaining Pounds 728m was bought back for
cancellation by the companies which had issued it - though at least some of
this could have an effect on the market eventually if the issuers seek to
refinance.
The government's sale was instantly declared a success by the market, and a
significant coup for Baring Brothers, which had masterminded the process.
The bank organised a single auction in which different tranches of debt with
different maturities and coupon rates were put up for sale - a bit like
trying to weigh bids for apples and oranges against each other.
Also, it wanted to harness market competition for the auction, even though
only BT's debt could be bid for by outsiders. Covenants prevented the debt
of the 12 electricity companies which was being sold, from being offered to
anyone other than the companies themselves.
Baring's answer was a baseline for each tranche against which bids could be
compared.
For each slice on offer, this was taken to be the yield that the issuer
would have to pay to refinance the amount in the bond market, with a premium
added to reflect the fact that the debt being sold off carried high interest
rates - the debt eventually sold had paid interest of between 11.5 and 12.25
per cent.
The baseline was then reduced to make the whole exercise tax-neutral for the
issuers. Otherwise, they would have suffered an extra tax charge when buying
and cancelling debt at a premium.
Of the Pounds 1.3bn eventually sold, only the Pounds 229m slice of BT debt
bought by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew - the largest single allocation and, at 2006,
the one with the longest maturity - was reoffered for immediate sale. UBS
confirmed that the debt, which carried a coupon of 12.25 per cent, was being
offered at a yield of 48 to 50 basis points over gilts. It refused to
comment on market rumours that it had acquired the debt at a yield spread of
55 basis points.
Given the rarity of longer-dated BT paper - in fact, the rarity of any
long-dated Eurosterling recently - it was not surprising that good demand
was reported.
P&amp;D's slice may have been the largest, but all of the debt sold in the
auction was at maturities stretching to the year 2000 or beyond.
Bids had been more aggressive at that end of the yield curve, reflecting
demand for higher-yielding paper as the sterling yield curve has become
steeper. It is no surprise that the next gilt auction, due shortly, is
expected to be of bonds maturing in 2003.
Goldman Sachs, the only other bank to bid successfully, was said by rivals
to be stripping the coupons from its Pounds 180m of BT debt with a coupon of
12.25 per cent, to be sold separately as a series of zero-coupon issues.
This is a technique in which Goldman is the acknowledged leader in London.
According to one rival, this structure could squeeze up to 20 basis points
more in yield terms out of the bonds.
Outside competition from these and other banks - and bidding from seven of
the companies whose debt was up for sale - helped ensure what Baring and
others said was a good price for the UK taxpayer. The average yield on the
debt sold was a substantial 17 basis points lower than Baring's baseline -
though no actual sale prices were published to enable the market to make up
its own mind about the outcome.
Goldman was not the only bank rumoured to be preparing a stripped
Eurosterling issue on Friday. BZW announced a 25-year private placement for
British Gas which was seen by the market as a carbon copy of an issue for
Boots earlier this year.
Neither BZW nor the issuer would disclose how the bonds were structured.
However, rivals said both the Boots and British Gas deals had involved early
coupons being stripped and sold separately.
Payments to meet these coupons, though treated for tax purposes as interest,
would effectively be equivalent to capital repayments.
The announcement of the British Gas deal, though not of its terms, prompted
other banks which claim to have created similar structures to warn of
possible retaliation from the taxman. 'If we were doing it, we would keep it
extraordinarily quiet - the Inland Revenue has screens too,' one bank said.
British Gas itself - in common with other sterling issuers - has no plans at
the moment to borrow long-term money.
The company expects short-term rates to continue to fall, with another half
a point off five-year yields, said Mr Arthur Burgess, treasurer.
He expects longer-dated yields, on the other hand, to rise. British Gas,
which is just entering its peak borrowing period of the year, plans to meet
all its extra requirements through short-term credit lines and commercial
paper.
Another structured deal did not even get out of the blocks last week:
Kingfisher, the retailing group, had retained UBS to raise money in the
Eurosterling market. However, problems with timing have now led to the issue
being postponed until after Christmas, according to one source close to the
deal.

FT  23 NOV 92 / International Company News: Mercedes excess stocks total
35,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCEDES-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, has excess stocks
of around 35,000 cars worldwide, according to Mr Gerhard Liener,
Daimler-Benz finance director.
Mercedes is holding stocks of around 130,000 cars worldwide in its own
inventories and at its dealers, said Mr Liener, compared with a normal level
of around 95,000. 'Our sales are going down, our stocks are too high and
therefore we are cutting production.'
The German car and commercial vehicle maker is being forced to close its
domestic plants from December 21 to January 8 with the elimination of 10
production days in order to reduce output.
Last week it stopped production at its German commercial vehicle plants with
the loss of four production days, in addition to a public holiday.
Extensive short-time working has been agreed for the commercial vehicle
plants for the first half of 1993, and negotiations have started for
short-time working at the Mercedes car plants in the first quarter of 1993.
A total of 32 production days are to be eliminated at the main van and truck
plants at Dusseldorf and Worth in the first six months of next year, while
19 production days will be cut at the Mannheim bus plant.
Mercedes car workers are taking the extended Christmas break in lieu of part
of the summer holiday, so that the company can speed up output of the new
generation Mercedes-Benz 190 executive car range, when it is launched next
June, Mr Liener said.
By the end of this year the Mercedes workforce would have been reduced by
12,500, he said, and a further 15,000 job cuts were planned in the next two
years - a total reduction of around 10 per cent.
Mr Liener said that the company had suffered a 'dramatic' fall in commercial
vehicle orders booked in Germany since July of between 30 and 50 per cent.
He said that Mercedes car production was expected to fall by 7 per cent this
year to 538,000, from 577,990 in 1991. He forecast a further decline next
year to 520,000-530,000.
Mercedes' commercial vehicle production worldwide would fall to 280,000 this
year from 296,000 in 1991, and it was expected to fall to 270,000 next year,
he said.
Mr Liener said a 'fierce battle' for market share was being fought in some
European truck markets, particularly in France. 'This is a price war and the
fiercest war is in France,' he said.

<TEXT>
KOREA Electric Power (Kepco), the largest capitalised company on the Seoul
bourse, yesterday lifted its ban on foreign shareholders.
Overseas investors will be able to acquire up to 8 per cent of Kepco shares
from tomorrow, with individual investors limited to a 1 per cent holding.
The shares have risen by 140 per cent since August in anticipation of
foreign investment.
The government, which owns 79 per cent of Kepco, decided three months ago to
open Korea's electricity monopoly to foreign investment in an attempt to
revive the flagging Seoul stock market. Kepco's size - it accounts for 12.5
per cent of Seoul's market capitalisation - and its sharp share price rise
has pulled up the rest of bourse.
The foreign investment ceiling of 8 per cent of Kepco represents 38 per cent
of the Kepco shares traded on the Seoul bourse.
The government sold 21 per cent of Kepco to the public through a share issue
in 1989. Kepco last year reported net earnings of Won719bn (Dollars 914m) on
sales of Won5,702bn.

MISAWA Homes, the Japanese housing company, posted a 39 per cent fall in
first-half taxable profits due to the faltering domestic housing market.
Non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the six months to September fell to
Y6.4bn (Dollars 51.61m) from Y10.5bn a year earlier. Sales fell 14.7 per
cent to Y110.9bn and after-tax profits plunged 53.6 per cent to Y2.4bn. The
company was hit by a sharp fall in urban development projects, while
revenues from its golf course membership businesses also fell. Orders
received during the first six months slid 15.5 per cent to Y117.8bn.
For the year to March, Misawa expects parent sales to rise 1.4 per cent to
Y255bn and pre-tax profits to fall 29.5 per cent to Y13bn. It said profits
were likely to be hit by losses on the planned sale of land originally
earmarked for development.
Kumagai Gumi, the Japanese construction company, reported a 22.7 per cent
fall in unconsolidated pre-tax profits to Y12.1bn for the first half to
September, due to weak capital investment by corporations.

FT  23 NOV 92 / International Company News: Tortoise catches up with the
hares - NAB has emerged as Australia's strongest bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS all in the body language. In Melbourne, Mr Don Argus, managing
director of National Australia Bank (NAB), was relaxed and chatty as he
outlined the reasons for his bank's growing success.
A few hundred kilometres away in Sydney, Mr Frank Conroy, chief executive of
Westpac Banking Corporation, was determined but tense as he toughed out
questions on Westpac's failures.
The two men had just announced sharply contrasting results for the year to
end-September, confirming the dramatic upheaval in Australian banking as a
result of the fall-out from economic recession and the loose lending
practices of the 1980s.
As Mr Conroy was forced to admit, Westpac is the big loser. Only a few years
ago it was the country's biggest and most profitable bank. Boasting the
slogan 'Australia's World Bank', it set out to fight the big banks of
Europe, North America and Japan on their own ground.
Now Westpac is pulling in its horns, and Mr Conroy openly admits that the
bank would be vulnerable to takeover but for federal government regulations
preventing mergers between the top six financial institutions. Even that
defence will disappear if the opposition conservatives win the election
which must be held by June.
If the rules do change, the most likely bidder is NAB, though Mr Argus is
playing down the prospect. He said last week that NAB was too busy digesting
its recent ADollars 1.1bn (USDollars 750.85m) takeover of the Bank of New
Zealand.
However, NAB is known to have looked at both Westpac and the almost equally
weakened Australia and New Zealand Banking Corporation (ANZ) as possible
targets.
Most bankers and banking analysts think some rationalisation is inevitable.
Even Mr Conroy says the four trading banks are likely to be reduced to
three, though he thinks ANZ is the more likely target. The Commonwealth, the
fourth trading bank, is still in majority government ownership.
The irony is that five years ago, NAB looked likely to be left behind by its
more aggressive rivals. Under the conservative guidance of Mr Argus, then
credit manager, and Mr Will Bailey, chief executive, the bank largely
eschewed the rush into high-risk corporate lending which fuelled Australia's
late 1980s boom.
Mr Argus and Mr Bailey were suspicious of the large-scale treasury
activities which dominated the other banks, preferring to stick to small
loans, especially in the housing sector. They did not get everything right,
however; NAB was exposed to several high-profile corporate casualties,
including Mr John Spalvins' Adsteam group, Mr Alan Bond's Bond Corporation
Holdings, and Mr John Elliott's Harlin Holdings, formed to take a large
stake in Foster's Brewing.
But NAB has been able to extricate itself with less damage to its balance
sheet than the other banks, largely because it has stuck to a policy of
loaning against cash flow rather than against commercial property assets.
This policy looked cautious five years ago, but it has paid dividends since
the property market began to crash in 1990. 'We are not a property bank,'
says Mr Argus with almost palpable relief. 'We are not interested. We never
have been.' Ironically, NAB's largest single write-down, taken in this
year's second half, was ADollars 126m against its 5 per cent shareholding in
ANZ.
NAB reaped the benefit of its conservative strategy this year, when it
reported a net profit after abnormals of ADollars 675m, maintaining its
consistently profitable record. The bank was able to increase interest
income and cut bad debt provisions in Australia in spite of slow economic
growth, and would have reported substantially higher profits but for
recession-related bad debt charges in the UK and Ireland.
NAB's result was in sharp contrast to ANZ, where Mr Don Mercer, the
Scottish-born chief executive who took over recently from Mr Will Bailey,
was reduced to drawing attention to his accent as an indication that he was
unlikely to squander shareholders' money. ANZ reported a net loss of
ADollars 579m after writing off ADollars 1.9bn against bad and doubtful
debts, and analysts say the bank faces a long, hard slog back to
profitability.
'I guess you could say we partied long into the night (in the 1980s)' says
Mr Mercer. 'What you are seeing today is a bank with a bad hangover. Some of
the guests partied so hard that they didn't survive, but those who did
survive have a thumping headache.'
The bank with the sorest head is undoubtedly Westpac, which has had a truly
awful year. Westpac lost a net ADollars 1.56bn after writing off ADollars
2.66bn against bad debts in an attempt to draw a line under several years of
poor performance. The loss followed the resignation of five directors,
including Sir Eric Neal, the former chairman, who was replaced by Mr John
Uhrig, the no-nonsense chairman of CRA, the Australian mining group.
Mr Uhrig and Mr Frank Conroy, who replaced Mr Stuart Fowler as managing
director earlier this year, have launched an attack on the expense-to-income
ratio, and formally reversed the bank's growth strategy by promising to
reduce assets by ADollars 10bn over three years.
Both Westpac and ANZ went to great lengths to persuade the market that the
worst is over, and both offered evidence to support their case. Westpac, for
example, was able to announce a net profit of ADollars 104m for the second
half, together with a small reduction in gross non-performing loans.
At the very least, the healthy capital adequacy ratios of all three banks
indicate that Mr Bernie Fraser, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia,
was right to reassure US investors recently that none of the banks is in any
danger of collapse. However, both Westpac and ANZ say that NAB is using its
financial strength to increase its market share, suggesting that 1980s
tortoise is now firmly among the hares.

<TEXT>
AEGON, the Dutch insurance group, reported a 6.3 per cent increase in
third-quarter net profits and a 9.4 per cent rise for the first nine months
of the year.
Net profits - which consist of operating profits and realised profits on
investments - totalled Fl 235m (Dollars 130.5m) in the third quarter,
against Fl 221m a year earlier, helping to lift nine-month results to Fl
698m from Fl 638m.
Aegon, whose main business is life insurance, described the results as very
satisfactory, given the difficult conditions in insurance markets.
Operating profits in the first nine months were up by 9.7 per cent at Fl
571.3m, while after-tax profits on investments rose by 7.9 per cent to Fl
127.0m.
Aegon repeated earlier forecasts that operating profits would show a clear
rise in 1992 as a whole.
The number of outstanding shares is also expected to increase markedly
because of stock dividends, options and a 1991 convertible bond issue,
leading Aegon to predict that operating profits per share would at least
match the 1991 result.

Lipton India, which blends and packages tea as well as producing animal
feeds and edible oils, will use the fresh capital to develop its food
processing lines, it said. These include instant tea, fish feed and
margarine. The company will convene an extraordinary general meeting in
Calcutta on December 23 to approve the proposed majority holding.
Unilon, the Anglo-Dutch group's wholly-owned subsidiary, will pay Rs105 per
Rs10 share for the additional 3.53m shares, Lipton India said.
In 1991 Lipton India earned net profits of Rs115.3m on turnover of Rs6.56bn.

terms for banks

   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY is today expected to announce details of a recapitalisation package
for the country's three biggest banks.
It emerged at the weekend that the ordinary share capital of Den norske Bank
(DnB), Norway's biggest bank, has been wiped out and will have to be written
down to zero, according to Mr Tormod Hermansen, the head of the state-backed
bank insurance fund.
The fund and top executives of the three banks remained locked in
negotiations late last night over further state cash to prop up the banks.
Last year the state injected more than NKr20bn (Dollars 3.1bn) into the
banking system, which had come close to collapse.
Mr Jarl Veggan, a DnB executive, refused yesterday to comment on the fund's
statement that the bank's ordinary share capital had been wiped out. DnB's
A-shares have recently been trading at NKr0.90 on the Olso bourse.
Mr Veggan said negotiations with the fund were likely to continue through
the night and that a meeting of DnB's board could then be convened to settle
how much cash the bank would be forced to seek from the state.
Mr Hermansen said the banks would be given sufficient state capital for
their capital adequacy to exceed the 8 per cent BIS minimum required by the
end of the year. The banks are believed to be seeking enough cash to shore
up their capital adequacy to at least 10 per cent of risk-weighted assets.
Mr Hermansen said further state capital transfers, which would have to be
approved by parliament, would be subject to stringent terms and conditions.
He called on the banks to cut costs drastically and take steps to boost
profitability.
However, the banks' fourth-quarter earnings are likely to suffer from the
turmoil in the foreign currency markets which forced Sweden last week to
float its currency and put heavy pressure on the Norwegian krone.

FT  23 NOV 92 / International Company News: Western &amp; Pacific delisting -
Vancouver quotation ended after inquiries into UK share pledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPANY closely associated with natural resources entrepreneur Mr Clive
Smith has left the Vancouver Stock Exchange following inquiries from
officials over transactions involving its shares in the UK.
Authorities in Vancouver suspended trading in the company, Western &amp;
Pacific, in October, pending clarification of the pledge of Western shares
as security to a UK company.
They were concerned following articles in the British media stating that a
substantial shareholder in Western had pledged the shares following a loan
transaction involving cooking manufacturer, Belling, which went into
receivership in May.
The stock was security for a Dollars 2m advance fee payment made by Belling
last year, in return for a promised loan of Dollars 50m from a third party,
Global Prospect Funding, a Newcastle-under-Lyme company. Belling borrowed
the Dollars 2m from its own pension fund.
The Dollars 50m loan was never made, and the Western shares were eventually
given as collateral for the Dollars 2m in April. Soon after they were
pledged, the value of the shares fell from an estimated CDollars 1.75m to
about Pounds 200,000.
The shareholder which pledged the stock was Finchley Investments, an Isle of
Man company administered from Jersey, which Mr Smith has often used to
handle some of his investments. Western &amp; Pacific is also 18.6 per cent
owned by Newsham Investment, another vehicle for the Smith family interests.
The Vancouver authorities also questioned the company as to the extent of Mr
Smith's involvement with Western &amp; Pacific.
After several meetings towards the end of October, Western &amp; Pacific
eventually decided to delist from the VSE. It retains its listing on NASDAQ
in the US, where most of its shares are traded.
Western &amp; Pacific came to the VSE in 1991 through the reverse takeover of a
shell company Nor-Quest. Some months later Western purchased Montana Mining
Properties, one of the founders of Butte Mining. Cash-strapped Butte has
launched litigation alleging fraud and misrepresentation by more than 70
defendants, including Mr Smith, who is contesting the action.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOSTER Menswear, owned by its management after a Pounds 1 buy-out from Sears
last September, has given Your Price, its loss-making chain of discount
clothing stores, to Mr David Tucker, chairman of Be-Wise, another discount
retailing chain.
'I didn't pay anything for it. I got given it,' said Mr Tucker as he
explained that the 85 stores of Your Price would be run as an independent
company. He set up a new company, funded by himself with Pounds 100,000 of
equity, to take over Your Price.
Mr Tucker is buying from Sears, for Pounds 2.2m, the freehold of 20 Your
Price stores. Ownership of the remainder is in the hands of institutional
landlords. But the Your Price leases on the stores have been assigned to Mr
Tucker's new company at a reverse premium - that is, Foster paid Mr Tucker
to take them.
Mr David Carter-Johnson, managing director of Foster said: 'In six weeks we
have successfully sold on the only fringe business we have.' Your Price
stores, with turnover of Pounds 18m, are generally half the size of the 250
Foster clothing stores, which collectively produce yearly sales of Pounds
100m.
Passing Your Price on to Mr Tucker means that Foster has cut off a
loss-maker. 'The major basis of the mbo is cost reduction,' said Mr
Carter-Johnson.
The combined Foster-Your Price business cost Sears Pounds 30m in two and a
half years. But Mr Carter-Johnson said the mbo company should make a small
profit in its first year.

L&amp;M, which reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 100.3m in 1990 and Pounds 26m
in 1991, underwent a financial restructuring in March 1991. This summer its
banks extended their loans and working capital facilities until June 1993.
Its latest accounts, which revealed a negative net worth of Pounds 44m, were
qualified by its auditors, Touche Ross. They were prepared on a going
concern basis which was dependent on the group's ability to meet working
capital projections in the UK and to secure a refinancing of leisure
development in the South of France.
In the half year there was an operating profit of Pounds 2.35m, compared
with a loss of Pounds 10.5m. The company said the improvement will not be
representative of the full year, since it does not anticipate any large
disposals.
The results benefited from the completion of the sale of part of a site in
Reigate to Safeway. The company also sold three office buildings in
Manchester to an Enterprise Zone Investment Trust for Pounds 4.1m and a
51,000 sq ft Chancery Chambers city centre office site to an overseas
investor.
Further, unspecified provisions were made against the carrying value of
other properties in the portfolio.
Losses per share fell from 26p to 6.8p.

FT  23 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Restructuring on the cards at John Foster
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Foster &amp; Son, the mohair and worsted spinner, reports a substantially
increased loss for the first half, sees further losses in the second, and is
making management changes.
On the news on Friday the share price fell 6p to 32p.
Mr Barry Spencer, who joined the board in September, is to become chairman
with immediate effect in place of Mr VIctor Watson, who remains a
non-executive director, and Mr Peter Giles has become a director and chief
executive.
Mr Spencer was formerly chairman at Parkland Textile and Mr Giles has
considerable experience in turn-around situations. They will undertake a
review of all operations which will lead to a significant restructuring.
In the half year ended August 28 1992 turnover came to Pounds 10m (Pounds
10.4m) and the operating deficit to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 1.04m). Profit on
sale of land was only Pounds 66,000 (Pounds 1.02m) and there were
restructuring costs of a subsidiary of Pounds 249,000 (nil), pushing the
pre-tax loss up from Pounds 23,000 to Pounds 1.9m.
Losses per share rose to 16.9p (0.2p).

FT  23 NOV 92 / UK Company News: McInerney losses reduced to IPounds 1.2m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
McInerney Properties, which builds private houses in Ireland and leisure
related activities in Spain and Portugal, cut its pre-tax loss from IPounds
2.45m to IPounds 1.2m, or Pounds 1.3m, over the first half of 1992.
The second half will show some loss. Expectation of more stable markets in
1993 should enable the group to reap the benefits of the recent financial
restructuring and hasten the return to profitability, which should come in
1994.
Exceptional charges of Pounds 300,000 were made this time. Provisions
covered possible increased future costs which might arise from recent
currency movements, and costs relating to the financial restructuring.
Turnover in the half year came to IPounds 15m (IPounds 14m), while losses
per share declined to 2.13p (3.93p).

Mr David Thomson, chairman, said that although Germany performed better than

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After reorganisation costs of Pounds 151,000, Clyde Blowers ran into a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 141,000 in the year ended August 31 1992, against a
profit of Pounds 254,000.
Although turnover rose to Pounds 4.63m (Pounds 4.34m) there was a swing from
an operating profit of Pounds 93,000 to a deficit of Pounds 253,000.
However, increased investment income of Pounds 263,500 (Pounds 161,000) cut
that to Pounds 10,000, before the reorganisation costs.
The overall result was 'very much as anticipated' considering the scale of
the reorganisation, said the directors.
The year past had been, and the current term would continue to be, a period
of significant change for the company.
Losses per share worked through at 4.76p (earnings 18p). However, the
dividend is held at 7.9p, the final being 7.07p, payable January 13.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Economics Notebook: From crisis management to the next
Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERHAPS, just perhaps, Mr Norman Lamont is freeing himself from months of
crisis management.
The rebalancing of economic policy forced by Britain's exit from the
European exchange rate mechanism reached a politically satisfactory
conclusion for the chancellor with the unveiling of the government's
spending plans and emergency fiscal package in the Autumn Statement.
Monetary policy is being conducted in calmer conditions, with both the
financial markets and UK authorities seemingly content to wait and see how
sterling's large devaluation and the sharp 300 basis point cut in bank base
rates since September will affect activity and inflation.
Although each day seems to bring a succession of gloomy announcements about
redundancies, there is a sense that the worst may be over. Last Friday,
Gallup, the market research company, suggested that the recent steep fall in
consumer confidence had bottomed out.
So, assuming he is not preparing to leave the Treasury in an end-year
cabinet reshuffle, Mr Lamont should now be looking ahead to his next Budget
in March. It would be odd if he were not weighing the pros and cons of tax
reform.
When Mr Lamont became chancellor two years ago, it was widely expected that
he would follow in the footsteps of Mr (now Lord) Nigel Lawson as a reformer
of Britain's complex tax system.
He showed an interest in taxation when responsible for the Inland Revenue as
financial secretary to the Treasury in the 1980s. One of his first acts as
chancellor was to appoint Mr Bill Robinson, the former head of the
independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, to be his special adviser in the
Treasury.
The chancellor is known to be a supporter of fiscal neutrality: that is a
tax system that does not distort the workings of market forces or
discriminate against specific groups. Over the past two years, he has also
shown himself to be a keen fiscal innovator.
He decided that the spring Budget, which is concerned with revenue raising,
and the Autumn Statement, covering government spending, should be merged
into a unified annual budget from December 1993. Although fraught with
administrative difficulties, this move brings Britain's budget practice into
line with that of other countries and should make the UK's public finances
more transparent to the voter.
Mr Lamont also reformed the annual public expenditure round this year. By
introducing a new 'control total' for government expenditure, which could
not be breached in the negotiations on spending between the Treasury and the
spending departments, he imposed a tougher discipline on the spending round
and probably helped ministers to channel spending more effectively to
priority areas.
But the chancellor's record on reforming taxes has been patchy. 'The past
two years have seen tax policy appearing to be determined by pressure from
interest groups rather than Lawsonian principles of tax neutrality,' says Mr
Andrew Dilnot, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
Mr Lamont's new 20 pence income tax band in this year's pre-election budget
offended purists. Although politically astute, it added to the complexity of
the tax system. The chancellor's decision this month to raise for a limited
period allowances for investment in plant and machinery to 40 per cent from
25 per cent drew criticism for benefiting only those companies that pay
corporation tax.
In one respect, next March would be a good moment for Mr Lamont to put his
stamp on the tax system. As Lord Lawson has noted in his memoirs (The View
from Number 11, Bantam Press Pounds 20), the first budget after an election
is a good time to bring in sweeping changes. The chancellor of the day has
an opportunity to introduce reforms which might be difficult later, either
because they would be too controversial or because it would take too long
for their beneficial effects to be felt before voters again go the polls.
The classic objectives of the tax reformer should be to promote economic
efficiency, fairness and administrative practicality. On this basis, there
is no shortage of scope for reform in Britain.
Britain's corporation tax system, for example, penalises many companies by
requiring them to pay the equivalent of basic rate income tax on dividends
paid to shareholders. Not all companies can fully offset these payments to
the Inland Revenue against their UK corporation tax liability.
The interaction of the income tax and national insurance contributions is
another area where reform would be desirable. The co-existence of the two
systems means that someone earning, say, Pounds 27,000 a year pays a lower
marginal tax and average tax rate than someone earning Pounds 20,000.
Anomalies also arise in the tax treatment of savings and from the relatively
narrow range of products on which value added tax is levied.
But manifesto commitments and election promises have ruled out many moves
such as broadening the VAT base to items such as food or children's
clothing. A more pressing problem facing Mr Lamont is lack of cash.
The Autumn Statement suggests that the public sector borrowing requirement
could reach Pounds 44bn in 1993-94. Many independent forecasters are more
pessimistic.
Certainly, no one should put too much faith in the medium-term assumptions
for the UK economy which are tucked away in the footnotes of the Autumn
Statement. The figures, implying that Britain could grow by a real 3.8 per
cent in 1994-95 and 3.5 per cent in 1995-96, are not based on an up-to-date
judgment of economic conditions. They are projections taken from the Budget
'red book' of last March and adjusted for changed inflation expectations
following sterling's float.
Tax reform is best carried out when the state is flush with funds and able
to compensate the losers from any change. Mr Lamont will not be in that
position next March. Indeed, his first Budget after the election will more
likely be a test of whether the chancellor's tax reforming instincts can
overcome his need to raise revenue.

FT  23 NOV 92 / NatWest Bancorp sees record profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATWEST BANCORP, the US subsidiary of National Westminster Bank, is likely
to make a profit after tax of more than Dollars 130m (Pounds 86m) this year,
according to Mr John Tugwell, chairman of the US business. That would be the
US business's highest yearly profit after tax.
Mr Tugwell also dismissed widespread expectations that NatWest may soon sell
its US subsidiary. He said that National Westminster was unlikely to sell
NatWest Bancorp in the short-term, and would instead build it through
selected acquisitions. 'Now we are making more money than in the UK, why
would you sell your profit jewel?'
Mr Tugwell said NatWest Bancorp, which has been recovering after two years
of substantial losses due to bad debts in 1989 and 1990, was likely to
outstrip the net profits of Dollars 130m made in its most profitable year of
1987. Between 1989 and 1991, it incurred cumulative losses of Dollars 860m.
It is paying a reduced federal tax charge on its profits, because it is able
to bring forward for tax purposes Dollars 700m of losses made in earlier
years.
Although Lord Alexander, National Westminster's chairman, has made it clear
that the bank may eventually sell the US subsidiary, Mr Tugwell said a
decision on whether to sell or remain in the US market was likely only when
NatWest Bancorp had been expanded.
He said NatWest Bancorp would have to expand to exploit economies of scale
in the consolidating banking industry of the north-east American coast.
'We will acquire one or two branches to infill, and down the road we have
got to do something more because I would say we are not really at the right
size to provide the parent company with a steady level of return,' he said.
Mr Tugwell said a Dollars 130m profit would represent a 16 per cent return
on equity, which meets his earlier-stated target rate of 15 per cent.
However, the tax loss is likely to be eliminated within two to three years
and this will once against cut the return.
The bank made a total net profit of Dollars 105.5m in the first three
quarters of this year, including Dollars 39.4m in the third quarter. Its
assets have been expanding gradually as it has made a series of small
acquisitions, and they now stand at Dollars 22.3bn.

FT  23 NOV 92 / GPA to ask banks to change covenants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA Group, the aircraft leasing company, will today ask more than 100 banks
to change the covenants in its borrowing agreements so that they are
cash-flow related instead of being linked to equity and profits.
The request is part of the group's financial reorganisation, which also
includes a request to its banks to defer repayment of up to Dollars 900m
(Pounds 596m) of bank debt until September 1996.
GPA's bank creditors, who meet today at the InterContinental Hotel in
London, will hear that Mr Maurice Foley, deputy chairman, has put off his
retirement for a second time, to become GPA's project co-ordinator.
Bank creditors - whose loans are fully secured on aircraft - may be relieved
that they are being asked to make relatively modest concessions in the
restructuring.
However, holders of GPA's Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 900m) unsecured debt, mostly
in the form of bonds and medium-term notes, are not expected to be asked to
make any substantial sacrifices in the restructuring.
One banker said he thought it would be fairer if both the banks and the
unsecured creditors made sacrifices. However Mr Foley said: 'It is important
that we honour our commitment to them (the unsecured creditors) since we may
wish to tap the capital markets next year.'
GPA expects to breach borrowing covenants because of the deterioration in
its trading performance and the company's failure earlier this year to raise
Dollars 800m in its aborted flotation. It therefore wants the covenants in
its borrowing agreements to be based on cash flow. GPA reported Dollars 285m
net cash flow from leases - after the deduction of interest - in the year to
March 1992.
A number of GPA's bankers, contacted by the Financial Times, said they
recognised they would have to take the first step in restructuring the
group. However, some bankers are concerned about how GPA intends to deal
with its obligation to make a Dollars 1.5bn repayment in September 1996.
GPA said agreement with banks is partly dependent on agreement with
manufacturers to postpone deliveries of up to 200 aircraft due in the next
two years.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Chemicals group FFr3bn share sale imminent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RHONE-Poulenc, the French chemicals group, yesterday reported a fall in net
income only days before it is due to announce details of the sale of 10.6
per cent of the government's stake in the company.
Rhone-Poulenc's forthcoming share sale will raise between FFr3bn (Pounds
360m) and FFr4bn.
It will be a watershed in French industrial policy because it would be the
first time that France's socialist government allowed its holding in a
state-controlled company to fall below 50 per cent.
The group, the flagship of the French chemicals sector, suffered a modest
2.5 per cent fall in net income to FFr1.58bn from FFr1.62bn in the first
nine months of 1991.
The group managed to increase operating income by 23.5 per cent to FFr5.65bn
from FFr4.57bn on sales which rose by 0.7 per cent to FFr62.48bn from
FFr61.95bn.
Net income was hit by exchange rate fluctuations, although net income per
share increased by 6.6 per cent from FFr17.57 to FFr18.73.
The chief currency problem for Rhone-Poulenc was the US dollar's decline
against the French franc.
After the share sale, the state's direct voting rights will be reduced from
77.5 per cent to 45 per cent.
However the government will still exercise indirect control through stakes
owned by other state-controlled institutions, such as Credit Lyonnais bank
and Assurances Ge-nerales de France insurance group.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Creditors shake Olympia &amp; York to its foundations: The
property developer is shrinking almost to insignificance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some traditions at Olympia &amp; York's elegant head office on the 28th floor of
Toronto's Exchange Tower have been maintained since the world's biggest
property developer filed for bankruptcy protection seven months ago.
A small kitchen still prepares lunch for Paul and Albert Reichmann, O&amp;Y's
founders, and a waitress still delivers the meal to their offices on a
silver tray.
But much else has changed. O&amp;Y, known in its heyday as an aggressive,
family-run developer always on the lookout for the next pioneering deal, is
rapidly shrinking to an inconspicuous property manager controlled by
penny-pinching creditors.
Creditors' influence is pervasive, from the welter of information which has
been prised out of the once-secretive Reichmanns, to the absence of the
fresh flowers which used to adorn the receptionist's desk at head office.
The full extent of creditors' power became clear last week when O&amp;Y agreed
to what amounts to an orderly liquidation of some of its most prized assets.
Responding to a groundswell of protest against its latest debt-restructuring
plan, the company asked creditors to postpone of a series of meetings due to
start on November 25.
Thirty-four creditor groups with claims totalling CDollars 8.6bn (Pounds
4.5bn) were due to vote on the restructuring proposals at the meetings.
But it was clear by early last week that several key groups, notably those
with well-secured claims against specific O&amp;Y buildings, would reject the
plan outright.
The creditors agreed to put off the meetings until mid-January, but only on
condition that if they then turn down any revised proposals O&amp;Y comes up
with, they will be free to seize their collateral.
Some groups of lenders have already begun interviewing new managers to take
over the maintenance and letting of buildings from O&amp;Y. Among those likely
to be seized in coming months are the 72-storey First Canadian Place in the
heart of Toronto's financial district, and the nearby 68-storey Scotia
Plaza.
Under the next restructuring plan, to be filed by December 15, the
Reichmanns are expected to cede control of the company's equity to its
unsecured and under-secured creditors.
These creditors' hopes of getting their money back rest on an upturn in the
North American commercial property market, especially in New York and
Toronto, and an improvement in the fortunes of O&amp;Y's key non-property
investments, newsprint maker Abitibi-Price and Gulf Canada Resources.
The past seven months have been humiliating for the Reichmanns. They have
lost the bulk of their fortune and their reputation as far-sighted
businessmen has taken a battering.
O&amp;Y in its heyday had an image of a prudently-managed company whose owners
combined vision and flair, and made a point of keeping their promises.
But the light shone on to O&amp;Y since May has revealed something different: a
disorganised tangle of companies with a highly centralised management.
As a result, creditors' attitudes towards the Reichmanns have hardened. Much
effort over the past seven months has gone into tracking down the family's
assets and making sure that they pay as much as possible towards the costs
of keeping O&amp;Y afloat.
As one creditor's lawyer put it a few months ago: 'We don't want their
houses, but we want just about everything else.'
The disillusionment of O&amp;Y's lenders has also cast a pall over the rest of
the North American property finance market. Investors now insist on tighter
protection in loan covenants, such as channelling rents to a trustee who
would be responsible for debt-service payments.
The Reichmanns' worth now consists largely of a 20 per cent equity stake in
their debt-burdened US properties, some smallish privately-held Canadian
buildings and their original Toronto floor-coverings business.
Paul and Albert Reichmann still come into the office on most days. Mr David
Brown, O&amp;Y's chief legal adviser, says: 'We're bouncing ideas off them all
the time, almost on a daily basis.'
O&amp;Y is now run however, by Mr Gerald Greenwald, the former Chrysler

OLYMPIA &amp; YORK'S efforts to keep its US operations out of bankruptcy
protection are again being threatened by disgruntled creditors.
Swiss Bank Corporation has extended until tonight a deadline for O&amp;Y to pay
USDollars 8m (Pounds 5.2m) which it owes under a letter of credit related to
one of its New York properties.
The bank had earlier set a deadline of 1pm last Friday.
In a separate action, Battery Park Holdings (BPH), which is partly owned by
Toronto's Bronfman family, has filed a suit to recover USDollars 8.5m in
overdue debt-service payments from the World Financial Centre, O&amp;Y's
flagship development in lower Manhattan.
BPH is also claiming USDollars 75m in capital which it alleges was
improperly withdrawn by O&amp;Y from the World Financial Centre to support less
healthy operations elsewhere within its empire.
O&amp;Y's 25 US buildings, most of them in New York, are the only part of the
Reichmann empire which remain outside court protection.
The company has indicated that it will file for protection under Chapter 11
of the US bankrutpcy code if either Swiss Bank Corporation or Battery Park
Holdings attempt to enforce their claims.
Other creditors have so far stopped short however, of forcing O&amp;Y into the
time-consuming and complex Chapter 11 route.
Most have preferred either to resolve their claims through negotiation or
have decided to adopt a wait-and-see attitude.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Single City regulator proposed: Bank chief calls for fraud
tribunals in memo to SIB chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGULATION of the financial services industry should be the responsibility
of a single body with sweeping new powers, according to Lord Alexander,
chairman of National Westminster Bank. The present collection of
self-regulatory bodies should be abolished, he said yesterday.
The single regulatory body suggested by Lord Alexander would have two
divisions. One of these would police the market serving retail investors. It
would adopt a rigorous approach to the enforcement of detailed rules
designed to protect investors.
The other division would concentrate on the professional market and would be
more laisser faire in its regulatory methods.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Lord Alexander, a former Takeover
Panel chairman, has joined the debate on the future of financial regulation
which was triggered by the government's decision in July to review the
regulatory structure. The review is being carried out by Mr Andrew Large,
chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, the senior City regulator.
Lord Alexander is sending a memorandum to Mr Large outlining his views. But
he emphasised that he was not being dogmatic and that Mr Large's eventual
recommendations should command City and public support.
Along with many other City executives, Lord Alexander believes the burden of
rules for the professional market should be reduced, so long as there are no
detrimental effects for personal investors. The NatWest chairman's proposal
contains two other radical innovations:
He wants the new regulatory body to operate a 'system of tribunals', which
would be City courts to punish fraudsters and other financial wrongdoers.
These would, for example, deal with cases of insider trading and
manipulation of share prices.
City practitioners should have the right to consult the regulatory body for
advice on the legality of their business dealings. Lord Alexander said it
was important if sanctions against wrongdoing were increased, that City
practitioners should be able to receive reliable guidance about the legality
of their actions.
Lord Alexander said the current system of prosecuting suspected wrongdoers
was 'slow, expensive and unpredictable . . . It is unfair both to the public
and the accused'.
He stressed, however, that the new regulatory body should not acquire the
'vast bureaucracy' of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US.
There is widespread criticism of the current system. Mr Mick Newmarch,
chairman of the Prudential Corporation, a leading insurance company,
recently said the UK self-regulatory system - regulation by financial
practitioners - had failed.
Lord Alexander believes practitioners have an important part to play. He
believes the prestige of his new body would mean high calibre practitioners
would join its council. Younger high-flying practitioners might also be keen
to be seconded to the new regulator as executives.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Deal on Russian reforms near
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DEAL to modify Russian economic reforms and defuse political attacks on
the government is near to agreement between Mr Boris Yeltsin, the president,
and centrist opposition leaders.
An agreement would allow the government to retain much of its reform team,
while industrialists would secure the centrally-directed slower pace of
economic change they have long sought, say sources close to the talks.
The deal would concentrate on improving as rapidly as possible the
extraction of oil, gas and precious minerals. In these sectors, and in oil
in particular, lack of investment and the disintegration of industrial links
have wreaked havoc in the past few years. Privatisation of large companies
would be narrowed to about 30 large companies, mainly in the defence field,
with the emphasis on switching to the production of oil drilling equipment
and other related technology.
Mass unemployment would be avoided by continuing subsidies to heavy
industrial plants and a high budget deficit would continue to be run,
perhaps amounting to as much as 20 per cent of gross national product a
year. However, as export earnings rose, a new Russian rouble would be
introduced, probably within two years.
The plan would destroy much of what is left of the government's 'shock
therapy' programme. However, this is almost at a standstill and the new plan
with its focus on energy, which is of most interest to foreign companies,
would probably receive outside support.
The International Monetary Fund and western countries will have little
choice but to continue to support Russian reform. However, there will be
limits to the IMF's continued backing for a programme which departs
radically from its recommendations.
The compromise programme is under discussion between the government and
Civic Union, the main centrist group.
The deal will mean cabinet changes, although it is not expected at present
to include Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Airbus sets long distance passenger flight record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONOLULU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN AIRBUS A340 - the new flagship of the European aircraft consortium - set
a record for a non-stop passenger flight from Europe when it touched down in
Honolulu at the weekend after 16 hours and 12,500km.
The Lufthansa flight was part of an exhaustive airworthiness certification
exercise for the new aircraft.
To help pass the time during the flight, passengers were treated to what
seemed an unending banquet of food, a wine tasting, and live music by two
Hawaiian minstrels accompanied by a Hawaiian dancer. This sort of special
treatment is unlikely to be available when regular Lufthansa and Air France
flights with the A340 begin next year.
The introduction of the wide-bodied, four-engined A340 is expected to usher
in a new era of long distance non-stop flights. In its Dash 200 version, it
has the longest range of any civil aircraft. It can carry 263 passengers up
to 14,500km on 16- to 17-hour non-stop flights. It will also enable Airbus
to challenge more aggressively the dominance in this market of US
manufacturers.
At the end of the Lufthansa flight, Mr Jean Pierson, Airbus chief executive,
warned that the commercial aircraft industry would remain under intense
pressure well into next year and probably into 1994.
In spite of the deep recession in the airline industry, he said he still
expected the consortium to show an operating profit this year. But net
profit was threatened by financial provisions to cover future aircraft
delivery risks as well as possible order cancellations and deferrals by
financially troubled airlines.
Airbus, whose partners include British Aerospace, Deutsche Aerospace,
Aerospatiale of France and Casa of Spain, last year reported its first
operating profit, totalling about Dollars 220m (Pounds 145m).

FT  23 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The gossip in the Swiss equity market is that investors are discounting a
'no' vote in next month's referendum on joining the European economic area.
The market has fallen more than 3 per cent since early November, ostensibly
on worries about the threat to investment, jobs and growth from remaining
outside. On closer examination this theory looks a little flawed.
The vote will have little impact on the earnings prospects of large Swiss
companies and banks which are well-implanted within the EC. At greater risk
are small and medium-sized companies in the engineering sector, particularly
those which rely on government procurement contracts. Yet even these worries
are easily exaggerated.
More important for equities, though, may be the interest rate trend. The
market was discouraged by an uptick of about half a point in Eurofranc rates
since late October as the Swiss National Bank responded to franc weakness
against the D-Mark.
Significantly, share prices recovered towards the end of last week as the
central bank, which is increasingly pessimistic about the domestic economy,
injected liquidity into the money market. It may have further opportunities
to do so if turmoil in the ERM keeps the franc strong. From this
perspective, a 'no' vote which emphasised Switzerland's distinctiveness
might even help the equity market.

FT  23 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: UK utilities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With strong balance sheets and improving cash flows, UK utilities have very
different finances from their foreign counterparts. Gearing for the UK
regional electricity companies varies between 5 per cent and 30 per cent,
while US electricity utilities typically have gearing between 50 per cent
and 100 per cent. Interest cover is also higher in the UK than elsewhere.
BT's operating income covers its interest payments more than 11 times, that
for the US 'baby bells' only between 3 and 4 times. Comparisons with
continental firms are even more startling.
By the second half of the decade many UK utilities will have substantial net
cash and while privatised UK firms arguably face competition, they could
still run happily with higher levels of debt. The anomaly arises because the
companies were sold as though they were conventional businesses expecting to
earn reasonable returns in a competitive market. Their restructured balance
sheets reflected this, but profits have increased much faster than expected
partly because competition has evolved slowly and their capacity to cut
costs was higher than had been thought. BT's return on capital employed is
now 21.4 per cent, compared to an average 11.4 per cent for the 'baby
bells'.
Higher gearing might improve returns for shareholders, but that would depend
on what the companies did with the borrowed money. British Gas and the
electricity generators can make a case for investing in areas of expertise
such as exploration and production and power generation overseas. BT and the
regional electricity companies might consider returning the cash to
shareholders before it burns a hole in the directors' pockets.

FT  23 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: ICI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'Z' in Zeneca - as ICI's bioscience side was christened last week - is
the alchemists' symbol for solution. But it will take more than hocus-pocus
to get bulk chemicals in a fit state to stand alone next year. If nine-month
results from BASF and Hoechst are anything to go by, petrochemicals markets
have deteriorated since the end of ICI's third quarter. Even allowing for a
peculiarly German perspective on the cycle, there seems to be little hope of
an upturn much before the end of 1993.
True, ICI will benefit from sterling's devaluation; overseas profits will be
flattered on translation. More importantly, it will earn a higher margin on
chemicals exported from the UK. Some of that advantage will be lost, though,
if continental Europe slides into recession. The translation effect on
earnings, moreover, does not make any more cash available to pay the
dividend. On a conservative assumption the demerged chemicals business would
have to bear a little under half of ICI's Pounds 400m dividend bill next
year.
ICI is less dependent on commodity chemicals than last time around the
cycle. The recent asset swap with Du Pont, for example, leaves it well
positioned in acrylics. Some cash might also come from disposals next year,
the polypropylene business being an obvious candidate. But given the regular
capital expenditure demands of petrochemicals - and the deeply uncertain
outlook - ICI can hardly float the chemicals business while its depends on
divestments to keep in shape. It might always be tempted to push more of the
dividend on to Zeneca, but reducing dividend cover on the other side of the
business will hardly pave the way for a rights issue.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps European monetary officials secretly enjoy spending the weekend in
Brussels. They certainly seem to have left themselves an opportunity for a
repeat visit after yesterday's ERM realignment. The escudo still looks
overvalued; the Irish punt is untouched despite appreciating nearly 15 per
cent against sterling since mid-September. More importantly, the effective
appreciation of the D-Mark appears too small for a further cut in German
interest rates.
Without some prospect of lower German rates, the residual tensions in the
system will not easily be unwound. True, Portugal and Ireland are shielded
to some extent by exchange controls. The latter, along with Denmark and
France, can boast stronger economic fundamentals than Germany. Yet Paris can
scarcely relish a continuing period of enforced tight money. Its reluctance
to endorse the EC-US farm trade agreement is a sign of insecurity which may
encourage the foreign exchange markets to attack. The European authorities
must hope a changing perception of the D-Mark itself will save the day.
Economic weakness and the social strains from unification have reduced the
D-Mark's attraction against the dollar and the Swiss franc. The trouble is
that a stronger dollar may give the Bundesbank one more reason for not
cutting rates. Sooner or later, however, the tension will have to be
resolved through a shift to easier money. If this realignment helps European
equity markets to look forward to that point, they may even have grounds to
feel encouraged.

Airbus reported last year the first operating profit in its 20-year history
totalling about Dollars 220m (Pounds 145.4m). It is expecting to report a
similar operating surplus this year. This reflects a steady rate of
deliveries during the current year which are expected to reach about 160
aircraft, similar to the 1991 figure.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is there anybody, anywhere, with a good word to say about the government's
plans for the privatisation of British Rail? This is the question posed by
Robert Adley, the train-spotting Tory who chairs the cross-party Commons
transport committee.
At a time when the government is looking for all good men to come to the aid
of the party, Adley has come steaming up the track with a declaration that
his committee, currently embroiled in an examination of rail privatisation,
has been unable to find a single independent witness prepared to stand
four-square behind the government's proposals.
Explaining his anxiety that the committee's report should be based on
evidence that reflects all shades of opinion, he implores anyone with a kind
word to say about privatisation to drop him a line so that their views can
be taken on board.
The outburst will come as no surprise at the Department of Transport where
Adley is as much a bete noire as Nicholas Winterton was to the Department of
Health. There are dark mutterings at the Transport Department that the
government whips were so busy ensuring that Winterton was booted off the
cross-party health committee that they failed to notice that Adley was
chugging to election as chairman of the transport committee.
The government's choice would have been Alan Haselhurst, a trusted
backbencher with a long-standing interest in transport, but such is the
distress at Adley's appointment (he memorably described rail privatisation
as a 'poll tax on wheels') that ministers would even have settled for Terry
Dicks, the right-wing Tory MP for Hayes and Harlington, best known at
Westminster for his distrust of all things cultural.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Once upon a time it was bankers who were always falling out with each other
on who was the biggest in the world. Now Observer hears that corporate egos
at Merck have been dented following a report suggesting the US group had
been stripped of its title as the world's biggest drugs company.
Scrip Reports, a highly respected UK-based market research company, reckons
Merck's arch-rival, Glaxo of the UK, has overtaken it in terms of
pharmaceuticals sales. According to Scrip, Glaxo's turnover was Dollars
7.247bn last year compared with Merck's Dollars 7.225bn, giving the British
group a margin of victory of Dollars 22m.
Officially, Merck says size doesn't matter. Besides, it's still more
profitable than Glaxo. But privately it's more than irritated. The group is
now challenging Scrip's methodology, although it has never done so before.
Glaxo is clearly pleased by the figures although it is playing them down.
But with sales growth of 19.5 per cent last year, compared with Merck's 13.5
per cent, it is only a matter of time before Glaxo assumes the title
officially.

Even ministerial speechwriters are not immune to spending cuts and job

Last Wednesday, he skilfully negotiated the annual dinner of the Machine
Tool Technologies Association - a minefield if ever there was one, given
current events. A day later he was on safer ground at the Institution of
Mechanical Engineers' bash. Somebody, perhaps, should have told the great
communicator that machine tool men and mechanical engineers are not as
different as they sound.
Most of the jokes and stories were the same. In the good old days, Hezza
told both audiences, it used to be easy to write a speech because you could
simply ring up the Conservative Central Office joke department. Now, sadly,
the department has been closed because there's nothing to laugh about any
more.

Every one knows that De Beers' chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson is the most
powerful man in the diamond business. So obviously he was top of the list
when the Diamond Insight newsletter carried out a light-hearted survey
asking people in the trade: 'What is the first thing that comes to mind when
you hear the word diamond? And what is the second?'
Alas, we shall never know what Ogilvie Thompson thinks. While others
replied, loading their comments with words such as love, beauty, and
eternity, a De Beers' PR flunky took the matter much more seriously.
'Having discussed the contents of your letter with my colleagues, it would
appear that the answer which Mr Ogilvie Thompson would give to your question
would distort the result of your survey, given his position and contact with
diamonds and the diamond industry. It is, therefore, with regret that we are
unable to participate in your survey.'
Things may be gloomy in the diamond market, but surely they are not bad
enough to rob De Beers of its sense of proportion.

</HEADLINE>

   From Mr WALTER GREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Thomas Welsh (Letters, November 17) is not alone in endorsing the
'convincing' case for an independent central bank conducting monetary policy
in place of vote-seeking politicians.
Such an institutional reform, however, is not sufficient for greater price,
and hence general economic, stability. What, at the official level, is also
necessary is fiscal balance, or neutrality, maintained over the length of
the business ('economic') cycle - if an independent central bank, dedicated
to the maintenance of price stability at all stages of the political cycle,
indeed permits the business cycle to persist. Without this, and without an
appropriate fiscal/monetary policy mix, the goal of economic stability,
including sustainable growth, is hard to achieve.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial ('The gamble on UK pay', November 15) is correct to
identify wage growth as the source of the economy's current weakness. You
suggest that determination from management in the private sector is needed
to contain wage rises. This downward pressure has, over the last two years,
been much in evidence as private-sector companies, particularly those in the
traded sector, contained costs under the discipline of the ERM. With this
constraint relaxing, talk of initiatives directed at co-ordinating wage
outcomes and an 'incomes policy by exhortation' is already re-emerging.
The experience of the last decade suggests that such proposals would be
judged as unacceptable by management in the private sector, anxious to
retain control of the vital lever of industrial relations that wage
movements represent. As a result, any proposed initiative designed to
moderate wage growth must allow for the flexibility of outcomes required by
differing company circumstances. The best opportunity to enjoy this
dispersion in wage settlements, but around a lower nominal average increase
in earnings, might best be provided by pressure applied through pension fund
managers and insurance companies. At this level any benefits of a collective
approach might be better appreciated while the institutional investors would
also be best placed to regulate such a mechanism through the application of
pressure on their shareholdings.
Given the structure of corporate control in Britain, if there exists a need
for exhortation on pay or co-ordination of wage awards, it should emerge at
this level. This would provide the attraction of economically consistent
wage awards combined with the scope for flexibility while enabling the
private sector to control itself.

FT  23 NOV 92 / After-shocks shatter currency union illusion: Yesterday's
realignment of Europe's exchange rates emphasises the split between hard and
soft currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If there were still any optimists who thought the European exchange rate
mechanism (ERM) provided a quick route to monetary stability, yesterday's
currency realignment has now buried this illusion for good.
Shattered, too, has been the notion - still entertained by some European
finance ministers during last year's Maastricht treaty negotiations - that
all 12 EC countries would somehow arrive at economic and monetary union
(Emu) at once.
The 6 per cent devaluation of the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo
follows two realignments of the ERM in September, resulting in the floating
of sterling and the lira and the first devaluation (by 5 per cent) of the
peseta.
The renewed upheaval emphasises how the system of European exchange rates
has been split into a 'hard' nucleus built around the D-Mark, and outer
layers of 'softer' currencies. It has confirmed a central precept: Emu, it
comes about, will take place at two (or several) speeds.
The degree of European disarray also places a question mark over whether
even a smaller group of hard currency countries - France, Germany and the
Benelux countries - will accomplish a scaled-down Emu by the Maastricht
target date of 1999. Scepticism about the Emu timetable has been underlined
in the past few days by the man who, more than any other, holds the key to
the ERM's future, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank.
Mr Schlesinger's hold over Bundesbank decision-making has recently been
strengthened. This reflects organisational changes lowering the number of
seats on the Bundesbank's sometimes fractious council, shifting the balance
of power firmly towards Mr Schlesinger's Frankfurt-based directorate and
away from the regional board members.
Mr Schlesinger's overriding goal is to ensure that, by the time he retires
next September, Germany is firmly on track for a 2 per cent inflation rate
in 1994. The present underlying level of German inflation, Mr Schlesinger
believes, is still 4 per cent.
The central bank president wants to avoid a repeat of the September
experience, when the Bundesbank explicitly traded a cut in interest rates
for the lira devaluation at the weekend of September 12-13. The Bundesbank
seems likely, therefore, to keep its discount and Lombard rates unchanged
until the end of the year.
Mr Schlesinger's toughness has implications for both the 'hard' and the
'soft' European currencies. The ERM member most likely to come under
immediate pressure is the Irish punt, left unchanged yesterday ahead of this
week's Irish general election. Additionally, the French franc will not be
immune to fresh jitters during the run-up to France's March parliamentary
elections.
The franc benefited greatly from Bundesbank support during the previous ERM
turmoil, weathering the storms after the expenditure of FFr160bn (Pounds
19.6bn) in currency intervention. However, in contrast to previous ERM
realignments in the mid-to-late 1980s, speculators recently have earned
sizeable profits by forcing governments to make relatively large changes in
currency parities.
The strength of the speculators increases the franc's vulnerability -
especially if doubts grow about the effect on French competitiveness of the
devaluations by some of France's biggest trading partners. Since the lira
realignment on September 12-13, the French franc has registered an
unprecedented effective revaluation (as of last Friday) of 16 per cent
against sterling and of 13 per cent against the lira.
In a climate of shrinking European growth, this represents a substantial
challenge for French exporters - adding to fears that the devaluation round
may not yet have run its course.
The ERM upsets mark a contrast to the calm which went before. During the 5
3/4 years before the September lira devaluation, the ERM experienced only
one, technical, realignment. Since 1989, three countries - Spain (June
1989), Britain (October 1990) and Portugal (April 1992) - joined the ERM
with 6 per cent fluctuation bands. Two non-EC countries, Sweden and Finland,
pegged their currencies to the European currency unit (in May and June 1991
respectively) backing up efforts to join the EC.
Now, the landscape has changed drastically. Since September, four currencies
 -those of Britain, Italy, Sweden and Finland - have been forced to float.
The five EC countries whose currencies have either been devalued or are
floating (including Greece, not part of the ERM), make up collectively about
45 per cent of EC gross national product.
The autumn devaluations have had a big effect on EC competitiveness. The
seven European countries now effectively making up the 'soft currency' club
 -Britain, Finland, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Sweden - account for
26 per cent and 30 per cent of the total exports of Germany and France
respectively. The challenge of foreign devaluations is even greater for
Ireland, which sells 42 per cent of exports to the seven-member 'soft'
currency club.
The immediate cause for the unrest leading to the weekend devaluation was
Sweden's decision last Thursday to float the krona, leading to an effective
devaluation of 9 per cent against the D-Mark.
The underlying reason for the turbulence, however, was that the September
changes, rather than correcting problems, had left some European currency
relationships looking still further out of line with reality. Between
September 11 and November 20, the lira and sterling were effectively
devalued 12 per cent and 13 per cent respectively against the D-Mark -
giving a susbstantial fillips to Italian and British exporters. During this
time, the peseta, on account of its devaluation in September, rose by about
4 per cent against sterling, while the escudo climbed 10 per cent. For two
countries which last year ran trade deficits of Dollars 13.3bn (Spain) and
Dollars 6.5bn (Portugal) against the rest of the EC, this scale of
revaluation was untenable.
The main dilemma facing the ERM is that Germany, because of reunification
strains, is straying from its traditional fiscal discipline. Additionally,
German inflation is now higher than in several other European countries.
Yet the Bundesbank's four- decade-old anti-inflation track record bolsters
the foreign exchange markets' belief that, while other ERM currencies fall
by the wayside, the D-Mark will remain strong. The Bundesbank is pleased
that signs of a marked economic slowdown are already starting to damp
inflationary pressure on the wage bargaining and budgetary fronts. But only
when these pressures show stronger signs of diminishing will the central
bank significantly relax its stance. Although the Bundesbank could start
easing interest rates quite sharply from next spring, the ERM's bumpy ride
may last for several more months.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Letter: Exactitude in home improvement pay-back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IVOR DUARTE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I must take David Lascelles to task for a serious arithmo-economic
inexactitude (Energy Efficiency survey: 'Overheated and under-insulated',
November 17). In assessing the pay-back time on his potential home
improvements, he has completely ignored 'opportunity cost' - that is, the
loss of interest on the capital expended. This is a basic economic factor,
and while one might tolerate such a naive approach from a DIY magazine, not
the FT please]
In the examples given, if his total investment is Pounds 3,010 then the lost
interest, even at only 7 per cent, amount to Pounds 210 a year. This means
that the true saving is Pounds 306 at the moment, not Pounds 516, and the
pay-back time is not less than six years, it is more than 10. If capital is
borrowed, the return will probably be negative.
Reasonable insulation improvements are indeed desirable and usually
economical, the notable exception being double-glazing, for which the
pay-back time - after opportunity cost - is never.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Letter (2): East Europe: A 'remarkable lack of vision' shown
by the west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STANLEY CROSSICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Mortimer was right to criticise western Europe's failure to
respond to the challenge of events in the east.
A Marshall Plan type of initiative is, of course, needed to help the eastern
Europeans achieve economic and political stability. Such an initiative is
also needed in the interests of western Europeans. Without it, further
disintegration in the east will inevitably lead to mass immigration to the
west.
The success of American companies in Europe owes much of its origins to the
post-second world war Marshall Plan, a combination of brilliant conception
and execution by government in partnership with industry. A concerted and
co-ordinated approach to eastern Europe could lay the foundations of western
 -and indeed global - economic recovery.
To achieve this, the present western leaders must match those earlier
American leaders in their far-sightedness and willingness to take a
long-term view.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is all very well for Edward Mortimer (Foreign Affairs, November 18)
and his American colleagues to denigrate west Europeans for failing to
respond to the challenge of events in the east. US condemnation of the lack
of west European leadership may be fully justified in the case of the
Yugoslav crisis. But after being the dominant western partner in east-west
affairs for decades, the US, too, has shown a remarkable lack of vision in
the face of the collapse of communism.
True, President Bush cleverly 'steered' through the disintegration of the
Soviet Union. This meant doing absolutely nothing in the face of the
collapse of Soviet power.
The general passivity paid off in 1989-90. In those 'glorious' days,
Chancellor Kohl's warnings of Soviet economic collapse and the widespread
repercussions this would have in the world economy fell on deaf American and
Japanese ears. Let us not forget that, between 1989 and 1991, Germany
provided an estimated 56 per cent of all financial aid to the Soviet Union
and 32 per cent of all aid to the rest of eastern Europe. German calls for
G-7 'burden-sharing' in the reconstruction of the east were continuously
blocked by the Americans and the British who argued that Gorbachev had holes
in his pockets.
The resulting inaction has created even larger holes in President Yeltsin's
pockets. As Russia appears to slide into chaos, the pursuit of the US
'non-policy' toward the former Soviet Union (and I include here the work of
the International Monetary Fund which set the Russian government impossible
targets) is not only callous but extremely short-sighted. It is now left to
Jeffrey Sachs, Harvard professor and foremost western economic adviser to Mr
Yeltsin's government, to accuse President Bush of conducting a 'vacuous'
foreign policy.
Short-sightedness in politics appears to be a general western malaise.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Leading Article: A new policy for housing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROVISION of Pounds 750m in the Autumn Statement for housing
associations to buy up 20,000 empty homes is good news for the homeless
families who will move into them. But the measure is unlikely to be enough
to resuscitate the UK housing market which has 200,000 empty homes unsold.
It is certainly not evident that house prices have yet stopped falling, a
pre-requisite for a successful market-clearing operation.
However, the nationalisation of 20,000 homes exposes an absurdity at the
heart of the government's housing policy. On the one hand, the chancellor
provides funds to increase the supply of rented housing by buying in homes
(many of which have been repossessed because their former owners could not
afford the cost of home ownership).
On the other, the government is continuing to do all that it can to increase
still further the level of owner-occupation. Local authorities are being
encouraged to sell more of their housing stock into owner-occupation, so
that they can spend the receipts on capital projects. To make it even easier
to sell council homes, the government is promoting rent-to-mortgage schemes
which allow tenants to become part-owners of their homes if they cannot
afford owner-occupation.
Downside of ownership
Boosting home ownership while spending money to buy the homes of people who
have failed to make a go of owner-occupation is not a rational housing
policy. The level of home ownership in the UK - at 67 per cent of housing -
is already higher than in most other advanced economies. The down-side of
this has become evident with the collapse in house prices. Over 200,000
homes have been repossessed in the last three years. More than 300,000
home-owners remain over six months in arrears with their mortgage payments.
And there are 1.2m owners trapped in homes worth less than their mortgages.
The growth in home ownership has been at the cost of an alarming rise in
housing insecurity.
At the same time, the privately rented sector has continued to decline. At
7.5 per cent of homes, private renting has sunk far below levels in most
other advanced economies. That leaves most people with a stark choice
between owner-occupation and the serfdom of council housing, often badly
managed, in poor condition and rationed by queueing. It is hardly surprising
that, faced with this choice, so many have become owner-occupiers.
Greater balance
The government needs a new policy for housing that would create a more
balanced market and offer real choices in tenure. Central to this would be
to deal with the tax breaks which make owner-occupation so attractive,
principally mortgage interest tax relief and the exemption from capital
gains tax for homeowners. These tax subsidies for owner-occupation make it
all but impossible for the private sector to charge rents which would give a
reasonable return on capital.
Getting rid of mortgage interest tax relief would be politically acceptable
only if it was phased out when interest rates were falling, so that - in the
short term, at least - no-one had to pay higher mortgage payments than
before. Sadly the opportunity to begin that process has been lost as
interest rates have more than halved in the last two years; but further
falls in rates should begin the phasing-out process.
Rather than eliminating the exemption on capital gains tax for homeowners,
it would be simpler to extend the same treatment to the private rented
sector. Other changes to the taxation of rent - including greater scope for
claiming allowances and setting off business losses against rental income -
might also be necessary to revive the private landlord.
Spending Pounds 750m on such incentives for private renting might not
immediately rehouse 20,000 homeless families. But by addressing the fiscal
imbalance in favour of owner-occupation, it would be a step towards
improving housing choice, the absence of which is a leading cause of the
present housing crisis.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Last push for Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY and US farm trade negotiators, not to mention their
leaders, deserve credit for last week's agreement on farm trade. After six
years, the most controversial single topic in the Uruguay Round has almost
been settled. Much needs to be done, not only in farming, but still more in
other areas of the negotiation. Yet the agreement on farm trade shows that
where there is a will, a way can also be found. The remaining obstacles
should yield to comparable determination.
US and EC negotiators will now need the support of the so-called Cairns
Group of agricultural exporters. This they should obtain. Agricultural
exporters may not see this agreement as a giant step for farm policy, but it
is a significant one for the trading system. After 45 years of failure, farm
subsidies are at last subject to internationally agreed limits.
Pressure will now fall on Japan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea. These
hugely successful exporters of manufactures will point to the central place
in their culture played by the cultivation of rice. Negotiators who have
given short shrift to the sensibilities of la France rurale must ignore this
special pleading.
Completion of the farm package is almost the least of the problems. Less
than two months remains if these negotiations are to be completed by January
20, when the American side leaves office. Little more than another month
would remain before the package must be notified to Congress under the
administration's 'fast track' authority.
Acceptable package
It is important that nobody questions the 'draft final act' put forward by
Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director general, a year ago. The US should, for
example, avoid reopening protection of intellectual property. What would
then be left is market access in goods and services, the core of trade
liberalisation. Complex bilateral negotiations have to be completed. But the
chances are good that a one-third cut in tariffs, plus significant
liberalisation of services - both, for the first time, on a global basis -
can be achieved.
The question now is not so much whether negotiators can reach the end of
their negotiation. They can, at the price of giving up their holidays over
Christmas and New Year. The question is rather whether a politically
acceptable package can be agreed.
In the first place, an enfeebled Japanese government might fail to agree to
the required liberalisation of the market for rice. The question, however,
is not whether the Japanese establishment wants to refuse, but whether it
will dare to do so.
In the second place, the job of selling any package to Congress will fall to
Bill Clinton. But he will almost certainly be able to do so if he wants and,
in all likelihood, he will want to. If the worst came to the worst, Mr
Clinton would probably be able to obtain an extension to the 'fast track'
authority as well.
EC agreement
In the third place, the EC might fail to agree to the package at all. In
particular, France might decide that farm liberalisation should be vetoed
under the 'Luxembourg compromise'. The constitutional status of that veto is
uncertain. Yet without it, the deal will be subject to qualified majority
voting. France would lose, unless it were to gain German support, which
seems most unlikely.
Nobody can be unaware of the difficulties the French government faces.
Nevertheless, it must know that this deal will demand few, if any, changes
beyond those already agreed in reforming the common agricultural policy.
Attempting a veto would also be against the interests of France.
Economically, excessive subsidies to agriculture are as costly to France as
to most other EC countries. Politically, veto of an agreement wanted by the
majority of its partners would deal the EC a blow from which it might not
recover. Ratification of the Maastricht treaty by the UK might be
impossible. If the principle of qualified majority voting were flouted in
traditional areas of EC responsibility, Mr Mitterrand's European policy
would be in tatters. Europe is worth a farm deal.
With the end of the Uruguay Round at last in sight, success is desperately
needed. This is not because the round will go near to solving all the
problems of the trading system. Nor is it because figures of Dollars 200bn
for the increase in world trade are more than educated guesses. It is
because a world with a functioning trading system offers hope of a better
future to billions of people. What is needed now is a last big push.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Lessons of Iraqgate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The clearest aspect of the Iraqgate affair is the abuse of executive power,
all too characteristic of the oversecretive and overcentralised UK
government machine. Corporate executives of Matrix Churchill risked a
criminal conviction and possible imprisonment because ministers tried to
prevent official documents being used in their defence. We shall need to
wait for Lord Justice Scott's report to know who bears the main
responsibility. Meanwhile there is an aspect of the affair which does not
depend on the law and which was pointed out by Mr David Sawers in a letter
to the Financial Times published on November 18 ('Arms to Iraq: complex
objectives and high costs'). This is that Mr Alan Clark, who blew the
whistle on the whole affair, stated that his job as a minister of trade was
'to maximise exports despite guidelines which I regarded as tiresome and
intrusive'.
The full fatuousness as well as immorality of the policy was brought out in
the letter underneath by Mr Colin Grant-Wilson, who observed that 'Britain
almost certainly did not sell the arms, but in effect gave them to the
Iraqis'. For there is virtually no prospect of the payment by the Iraqis, in
which case the Export Credit Guarantee Agency would have to foot the bill.
Some economic fallacies mainly involve a waste of national resources.
Others, such as the obstinate defence of agricultural subsidies in the Gatt
round, are a threat to international prosperity as well. But the ones
involved in the government support for the arms trade are of an altogether
different degree of evil. For they lead to the arming of rival dictators,
enhancing their power of aggression and threatening both international peace
and eventually bringing about the death and mutilation of young soldiers
from the arms-exporting countries themselves.
Yet it all arises because of the fundamental mistake of supposing that it is
the government's job to maintain not merely full order books and jobs in the
whole economy, but in specific industries as well - the belief that if the
government does not ensure orders for industry X by hook or by crook, the
men and women employed will be thrown on the scrap heap and the other
resources involved permanently wasted. It is a first cousin of the 'lump of
labour' fallacy which maintains that we are always on the verge of economic
saturation and that there will soon be nothing left for the available labour
force to do.
State support of the arms trade is a near perfect fusion of the right-wing
belief in 'my country right or wrong' and the left-wing belief in industrial
intervention and subsidy. Some would say that this is an exact description
of French foreign and economic policy; but the English-speaking countries do
not have much to shout about either.
Obviously unregulated markets will not produce international harmony where
weapons of destruction are concerned. If businessmen find it pays to sell
arms to unscrupulous rulers, they will do so. The role of government
intervention - which as in so many other areas needs to be internationally
organised by the principal industrial powers to be effective - should be to
reduce the scale of such arms sales. Yet in practice its role is often to
stimulate sales further than would be the case under pure laissez-faire.
The industrial support fallacies are less obviously fallacies during a
recession. But it still remains true that 80 to 90 per cent of the workforce
have jobs and that most of those who lose them eventually find alternative
occupation of one kind or another. Moreover arms support is not an emergency
anti-recession policy, but is all-too-often long term in nature and does not
ease off when the danger is overheating and inflation.
Indeed, it is even worse than that. No sensible market liberal would deny
that there are human, economic and social costs in running down particular
industries rapidly and relocating employees. But these costs are magnified
when the sectors in question are inflated by government support to much
higher levels than would otherwise obtain. So the more that arms-exporting
industries are artificially puffed up, the more painful the process of
reducing them to normal size.
Above all, politicians and officials who see international trade as itself a
form of warfare between Western countries do not appreciate that exports are
 -like investment - a cost and not a benefit. They only do good if they
bring returns. If the exporting countries have to provide the money to pay
themselves, then it is a ludicrous form of employment support. It would be
much better for governments to use the money to make direct cash payments to
people who would otherwise be working in the arms industry.
So far from being a symptom of untrammelled market forces, much of the
international arms trade is interventionism gone mad. Do I need to underline
the moral any further?

FT  23 NOV 92 / Arts: Sought after troupe - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three years ago its tours were banned because so many directors defected to
the west; now Bucharest's Bulandra Theatre is among the most sought after
troupes in the world. Shakespeare is its special strength, and after a
realpolitik Hamlet in London two seasons back, we now have a Midsummer
Night's Dream, which I caught at the European Theatre Festival, whose
Bulandra hallmarks of originality, frenzy and up-to-date reanimation place
it among the best Shakespeare productions anywhere in recent years.
Forget politics or Transylvanian fairy tales. This is a raw, sexy,
intoxicating show with a kernel of pure lyricism. The mood recalls the magic
light-heartedness of Peter Brook's famous 1970 Dream reworked through 1990s
images and sounds. A huge yellow moon is suspended above a shiny red floor
and reflecting red panels. Mortals come in white cotton dresses and suits,
fairies disco-dance in black T-shirts and leggings, Oberon and Puck are
bikers in crinkly leather with metal-studded bracelets and striped
headbands. The shimmering, hypnotic repetitions of Philip Glass's music echo
the rhythmic pattern of the setting.
What gives Liviu Ciulei's staging its effervescent sensuality is a series of
rapid vignettes based on conflict and polarity. Titania floats up to the
moon on a translucent glass bed from where she writhes with desire for the
earth-bound Bottom in his asses head. Helena, a dreamy blonde bimbo who at
once hugs and fights her rival, the spiky-haired, dark, woman-of-action
Hermia. Titania and Oberon argue across an empty dinner table stretching
from opposite ends of the stage.
This is the imagery of a tense, dynamic Dream. Sex means sex - from the
first shiver of eroticism when Amazon Hippolyta is divested of her Kate Adie
commando jacket into a svelte bridal number and Theseus gasps with desire.
Violence is violence - Demetrius kicks Helena around like a dog ('Use me but
as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me') in a sado-masochistic dance ending
with a flick of knives. Lysander reacts so painfully to the love potion that
he sleepwalk-assaults Puck, who limps off with a broken ankle.
Movement, gesture, looks of menace or desperation, camp little kicks of
Bottom's fat legs, for example, are the more immediately effective as we do
not understand the language. Desire governs character in this tenderly
defined rendering. Puck is a podgy tomboy girl who giggles fearfully at sex.
Demetrius is a narcissist in love with power, Lysander is older, troubled,
urgent. The detail is a joyous affirmation of the individual, yet the bold
outline is never lost.
Ciulei co-ordinates his star troupe brilliantly. Brittle wills and spirits
clash with just controlled energy, each touch or glance is acutely timed,
the slapstick of the mechanicals, wryly dignified in their incompetence, is
a masterstroke of precision. Ciulei's genius is to place human detail within
a powerfully sustained dramatic vision, so that the whole is greater than
the sum of parts - surreal setting, minimalist black and white costumes,
Glass's haunting crescendos - all of which alone enchant.
This production, Heiner Muller's Mauser, and the fabulous ensemble playing
of Budapest's Katona Josef Theatre in Platonov, assure triumph for Giorgio
Strehler's first European Theatre Festival in Dusseldorf and his bold choice
of eastern companies - five of the ten participants were once behind the
Iron Curtain.
A quick rave. Platonov, the early Chekhov tragi-comedy about a village
school-teacher, seen at the National Theatre in 1984 as Wild Honey, is here
set by veteran Chekhovian Tamas Ascher in a sumptuously light, creamy world
of wooden villas, rattan furniture and white suits and directed at a
galloping, hysterical pace.
It stays just within Chekhov's mix of irony, melodrama and elegy and shows
extraordinary sensitivity and exhilaration.
The European Theatre Festival, to November 27, Dusseldorf Schauspiel-haus.
0211 36 87 136. A Midsummer Night's Dream continues at Teatrul Lucia Sturdza
Bulandra, Bucharest; Platonov at Katona Josef Theatre, Budapest.

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Without having had a premiere in the West End, or at the National or RSC,
Louise Page has become one of our best known younger playwrights. She is
author of Salonika, Golden Girls, Real Estate and more; last year, her Adam
Was a Gardener premiered at Chichester. Her work has been performed in 21
countries and it is usually intelligent, sensitive, touching, adult and
absorbing.
Last year's Adam Was a Gardener was subtitled 'an evocative love affair
between the past and present'; Hawks and Doves, her new play now at
Southampton's Nuffield Theatre, is subtitled 'a love story for the '90s.' In
both plays, love commences between a man and woman from different
backgrounds, a love based on shared values, not least on affection for the
English countryside. But here the love is between an upper-class Southerner
and a lower-class Northerner; and it goes wrong.
So, unfortunately, does the play. It begins promisingly, like some law court
near-plotless modern version of the attraction between Jane Eyre and
Rochester. But it becomes increasingly like a North/South adaptation of
Howard's End - a too-simple-by-half depiction of heartless toffs (ie. hawks)
exploiting honest working or unemployed folk (ie. doves) and a
skeleton-in-the-cupboard melodrama to boot. The toffs breed peregrine
falcons, one of the working-class Northerners fancies pigeons.
Both classes admire open countryside, wild birds and Mozart. These shared
sympathies are enough to get Otto out of his upper-class marriage to Julia
and into a new one with working-class Marie - but that isn't far enough.
When it comes to croquet, Julia and Otto insist 'You can only learn the
rules as you go along,' as they win. Marie, refusing to play any more,
replies 'Some people are born knowing them.'
Well, croquet is enough to wreck any marriage, but worse is the fact that
Otto is hiding from Marie his complicity in - well, in the plot;
professional discretion forbids me to say more. Suffice it to say that Marie
finds out, and the play ends - fatuously - on her reaction (vengeful) and
his (terrified).
Gillian Bevan, playing Marie, has a charming housewife-Cinderella manner,
but also has an unbecoming hairdo and too many dropped syllables. Michael
Simkins carries off Otto's mixture of wimpish sensitivity and lordly
authority well, but he can't stop the final moment of terror from seeming
risible. But everybody is wrestling with a poorly-paced script and weak
direction.
Remarkably, only young Alex Scott, as Marie's son Paul, creates a fully
three-dimensional character. He is as first-rate as he was last year in Adam
Was a Gardener: spontaneous and vivid.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Arts: Vision in a visitors' building - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent death of Sir John Summerson leaves a colossal gap in the world of
architectural history and writing. For me and many others in the arcane
world of architectural criticism, he was both mentor and model. He was
simply the very best writer in English on architecture.
But he was more than a writer because for many years, as curator of the Sir
John Soane Museum, he protected and nurtured both the atmosphere of the
museum and the thinking of England's most original neo-classical architect.
One felt, on seeing Sir John Summerson in his silent and empty office on the
top floor of the museum, that you might almost have visited Soane himself.
Summerson was 87 when he died, having suffered from Parkinson's disease for
some years. He will be remembered for his major writings. The Classical
Language of Architecture explains in the most lucid way how the elements of
classical order began and how they can be used and interpreted. This slim
book began life as a series of Third Programme talks and perhaps it was the
discipline of using just words to make architecture visible that gives this
book such power.
All lovers of London will know his Georgian London; it expanded the
boundaries of architectural history by looking beyond architectural style to
economics, patronage and social mores. His volume on the history of English
architecture in the Pelican History of Art series remains a bible, but the
book I re-read most often is the volume of essays, Heavenly Mansions. Here
he writes about architectural ideas from Soane to Le Corbusier in ways that
are positively exciting. I felt that Sir John condensed many of the ideas
from this book into one of his best essays when he wrote about the design
for the unbuilt Liverpool Cathedral by Sir Edwin Lutyens for the catalogue
of the Lutyens Exhibition at the Hayward Gallery a few years ago. He was so
skilled a writer and interpreter of architectural thinking that the whole
cathedral now lives in those pages as though it had been built.
This year has seen the loss of three great architectural Englishmen: Sir
James Richards, John Piper and Sir John Summerson. They all influenced my
generation and demonstrated that architecture can, above all the arts, bring
intellectual and visual satisfaction. They were all marvellous mentors - but
it was always the few well chosen words by Summerson that gave any
architectural debate its cutting edge. His pellucid prose is his finest
monument.
*****
The deaths of prominent and distinguished men always prompts thoughts about
the values they represented in English life. There is a distinctive English
vision in the work of the three men who have died so recently. Pondering on
that vision, I felt that one of the bodies in England t which does so much
to sustain it, and is relatively unsung, is the National Trust. I visited
Chartwell last week - where Churchill contemplated the Kentish Weald and
English values - to see one of the Trust's new visitors' buildings.
The National Trust takes enormous care over all its buildings, and that
includes the relatively minor additions, shops, restaurants, kiosks and car
parks. At Chartwell, the new shop is designed by a local Sevenoaks
architect, Richard Reid. The Trust is prepared to be quite adventurous, and
believes that it should patronise the best contemporary architects.
Mr Reid has given the Trust a simple and elegant modern building from which
to sell its wares. It is a cross between a barn and an oast - the tall tiled
roof culminates in a curved oast funnel that lets a shower of top light into
the centre of the shop. From a distance the new building groups well with
the (much less satisfactorily designed) restaurant.
There are oasts on the skyline in this part of Kent and so the new roof
looks at home. The Flemish bonded brickwork and warm clay tiles lend what
could be a mundane shop a considerable architectural presence.
I liked the open arcades at each end and the loftiness of the interior.
The roof of the shop is tall and steep and filled by a web of openwork
timber trusses. There is a rewarding sense of high light that elevates the
whole shop. There are fine views from well placed large windows - a bonus
for staff working indoors all day. The quality of the shop furnishings is
high. National Trust shops have sometimes been criticised for the cosiness
of the goods they sell, but that is another story.
The Trust's commitment to good new architecture is borne out by Richard
Reid's pleasing interpretation of vernacular Kentish architecture at
Chartwell, and I am looking forward to reviewing the much larger new
visitors' centre at Fountains Abbey in Yorkshire which has recently opened,
designed by Edward Cullinan for the National Trust. Cullinan has just won
the competition for the new visitors' centre at Stonehenge in a competition
organised by English Heritage. It will be largely underground.
In these recessionary times I suppose it is inevitable that there should be
an enhanced appreciation of small buildings. It was John Summerson who
pointed out the crucial importance of the aedicule. He would have
appreciated the care that the National Trust is taking to make its smallest
new buildings of the highest quality.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Arts: A Nielsen experience - Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The symphonies of Sibelius and Nielsen must sit at the very centre of any
celebration of the music of Scandinavia and Finland. The Barbican's 'Tender
is the North' festival naturally has cycles of both; on Thursday this week
Colin Davis will set out on his Sibelius pilgrimage with the LSO, while
Simon Rattle and the City of Birmingham Symphony are currently offering the
Nielsen canon in three weekly programmes.
In Friday's concert Rattle conducted the Second and Fourth Symphonies,
separated by an account of Mahler's Kindertotenlieder with Olaf Baer as
soloist that was an unfortunate distraction; his voice sounded so
distressingly threadbare and out of condition it cast a pall over the
performance. Rattle's virtues in Nielsen, though, are joyously
straightforward and correct. He takes no liberties, never attempts to lard
Nielsen's melodic lines with extra expressiveness, and drives the music from
start to finish with unflagging energy and pinpoint architectural logic,
relying upon the CBSO deliver it with maximum vividness.
Just why Rattle's Nielsen seems so convincing was partly explained in a
television documentary on BBC2 on Saturday. The conductor wrote and
introduced Carl Nielsen: A Life in Six Symphonies, guiding viewers with
great lucidity through each of the works with the help of Robert Simpson,
most faithful of Nielsen's advocates, a smattering of archive film, and
extracts from the symphonies performed by the CBSO. The programme ended with
a magnificent account of the Third, Sinfonia espansiva.
Along the way there were fascinating points that one longed to be amplified
 -Rattle's description of the Fifth Symphony as the greatest work to come
out of the experience of the First World War, and the Sixth as a response to
the modernism of Stravinsky and Schoenberg; most challenging of all,
perhaps, Simpson's admiration for Nielsen as the sanest of 20th-century
composers.
Certainly there is a triumph of tonality in these symphonies, a close
kinship with and extension of the tradition of 19th-century romanticism. As
Rattle's performance of the Second on Friday made plain, there is a great
deal of Brahms and Dvorak in its make up, just as the finale of the Fourth
seems Nielsen's nearest approach to his exact contemporary Sibelius. If
abandoning of tonality is regarded as a symptom of neurosis, then ergo
Nielsen becomes a model of mental stability. But if musical psycho-history
is not as straightforward as that, then his music is harder to place, and
more intriguing; the autobiographical relationship between his life and his
symphonies becomes central and unresolved. These are great symphonies, the
Third, Fourth and Fifth especially, and like all such products of a
post-symphonic age especially troubling and teasing.
City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra: Barbican Hall; final concert 28
November. 'Carl Nielsen: A Life in Six Symphonies': BBC2 television.

We can hardly complain at present about the amount of current affairs on
offer in peak viewing time. Many believe that once the new franchise
arrangements really begin to bite in 1993, ITV's current affairs (other than
tabloid-TV series) will be driven to the margins.
If that happens and Channel 4 finds life and therefore competition tougher
once it is selling its own air time, we may find ourselves limited to BBC
current affairs during normal waking hours.
Mondays bring World In Action (8.30 ITV), Cutting Edge (C4 9.00) and
Panorama (9.30 BBC1). Respectively they deal with 'The Crack Connnection',
which suggests that some police are planting evidence and dealing in drugs;
'tug of love' children; and the Matrix Churchill affair.
Drugs and abducted children are two 'banker' subjects. Any aspect of sex is
another, and today C4 starts a series called Catholics And Sex (11.00) with
a look at the celibate priesthood which hands down diktats from the Holy See
and the ordinary people who pay the price.

FT  23 NOV 92 / People: Change of gear at Fiat in UK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Enter James Blades on December 1 as the next managing director of Fiat Auto
(UK) - and with him a new management approach by the Italian industrial
giant to its single most problematical car market in Europe.
Blades, 44, comes from senior sales and marketing positions within Rover
Group. He is also a dyed-in-the-wool Brit. Both factors, in Fiat's eyes,
make him an ideal candidate to succeed current md Mario Massara, who will
return to Turin HQ at the end of the month.
Massara, effectively, represents the last gasp of Fiat's long-standing
'touring' Italian management approach to the perversities of the UK market,
where Fiat has seen its market share dwindle from around 5 per cent in its
late-1970s heydays to 2 per cent this year.
Fiat has never quite been able to understand why its market appeal has been
fading in recent years. So it is now working on the basis that the British
market is perhaps best understood by a British md, backed by other
directors, also overwhelmingly British.
Blades, (left), who left Ford to join Rover back in 1976 when it was still
British Leyland, is seen as a particularly appropriate appointment. This is
because he has been an integral part of Rover's own transition in image from
automotive lame duck to relatively 'prestige' marque. Fiat will be more than
happy if Blades can lead a similar image transformation at
Slough-headquartered Fiat Auto.
His appointment, however, also needs to be seen in a wider context. Fiat,
Italy's largest industrial group, has increasingly grown into a global
operation. Even if it wanted an Italian at the head of each national
activity, there is no longer enough Turin management to go around.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Allan Gormly is no stranger to corporate crises. Only a month after he was
appointed chief executive of the troubled Trafalgar House group, he is to be
made deputy chairman of Royal Insurance Holdings, the weakest of the big
composite insurers, from January 1.
Gormly, 54, has been a non-executive director of Royal for two years; some
observers will see his promotion as very much the handiwork of Sir John
Cuckney, Royal's chairman. Sir John, one of the City's best-connected
financiers, first came across Gormly when he was brought in to rescue John
Brown, the once-proud flagship of British engineering, in 1983.
Gormly, a Scottish accountant who joined John Brown in 1965, was plucked
from obscurity by Sir John and made chief executive. The two of them made a
good job of turning the company round; in 1986 it was sold to Trafalgar
House.
Although Sir John has been shedding some of his City responsibilities, such
as the chairmanship of 3i, he is spending a lot of his time on trying to
restore the fortunes of Royal Insurance, one of the grand old names of the
British insurance industry. Last year it reported a loss and had to cut its
dividend. There have been several changes in Royal's senior management team
and although the group's capital ratios need strengthening, analysts believe
its fortunes are on the mend.
Gormly's appointment as deputy is bound to fuel speculation that he could be
a future chairman of the Royal. Sir John, who took over the chairmanship
from Daniel Meinertzhagen seven years ago, is 67, and his other deputy
chairman, Sir Max Williams, a former senior partner of Clifford Chance, is
of a similar age.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Management: Exploring new construction contracts - BP is
seeking to cut the cost of gas exploitation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum is pioneering a new type of contract that could
significantly cut the cost of construction work in the North Sea.
The new contract heralds much closer co-operation between North Sea
contractors and their oil company customers at a time when rig orders are
thin on the ground.
BP has entered into partnership with two contracting companies, UIE Scotland
on Clydeside and Glasgow engineers, Kvaerner HG Offshore, to share the cost
of building a Pounds 50m rig to develop the Hyde gas field.
The three companies have created an alliance that aims to get away from the
traditionally adversarial relationship between contractor and client.
By clubbing together, the companies are hoping to eliminate any overlap in
the work of designing and building the gas rig.
This should cut down on excess costs which often build up when a contractor
is working on a project.
The idea of a partnership between oil operators and contractors is driven by
the changing needs of the North Sea where future developments will be small
and extremely cost-sensitive.
Brian Divers, managing director at UIE Scotland, estimates that the Hyde rig
should be completed 20 to 30 per cent below the budgeted figure.
'The common objective is to come out below target, whereas contractors often
boost costs in order to make a profit,' he says.
The design, engineering and construction team working on the Hyde contract
consists of around 30 people when, typically, a similar project would have
employed three times that many.
Layers of inspectors and supervisors have been eliminated although the
project managers stress there is still a fine balance to be struck between
cutting costs and maintaining quality and safety.
If the rig is completed below cost, the cash left over will be used to pay
out pre-set profit levels to the two contractors. Once that has been paid,
any remaining funds will be split on an agreed percentage basis between all
three partners.
This means the contractors stand to earn higher profit margins than on
traditional contracts, but since they carry part of the risk they could also
end up with nothing.
If the project is subject to any cost overrun, additional funds are provided
by all three companies on an agreed percentage basis up to a certain cap.
Chris Rhodes, manager of the southern North Sea exploitation and development
at BP, explained the necessity of cutting costs: 'Maybe for the Forties
development (one of the first flagship North Sea fields) you could afford a
bit of gold-plating and still make money, but you can't do that on these
smaller fields.'
The partnership idea also builds a closer, more long-term relationship
between contractors and oil operators in the current uncertain climate.
'There is a growing recognition that if we continue to do things as we've
always done in the North Sea, the life expectancy of contractors and
operators is limited,' said Rhodes.
BP is applying the general principles behind a partnership deal in its
negotiations with other contractors and other North Sea operators are
looking at the concept with interest.
But some oil executives believe the idea works only with smaller, less
complicated construction projects and will take some time before it can be
applied to large-scale deals.

an approach to data processing which may presage a new era in electronic
banking.
Led by Banque Cantonale Vaudoise (BCV), a medium-sized retail bank serving
the canton of Vaud from its Lausanne headquarters, the group is pooling its
computing resources in a separate organisation owned equally by five founder
members.
The collaboration has come about principally through BCV's need to share the
estimated Pounds 100m costs of developing new and more competitive computer
systems.
The Financial Times first examined the project when it was on the drawing
board; three years on, it seems to be going well with cost reductions of up
to 30 per cent a year expected by 1995 on what would have been total running
costs for individual members of the consortium
The new company, Unicible, is now planning to recruit more members and sell
its services outside, doubling the number of accounts it is processing to 2m
within five years. Its management considers this the minimum to survive. The
Union Bank of Switzerland, one of the country's big three international
banks, is among the organisations which has already talked to Unicible about
possible co-operation.
Unicible began operations formally at the beginning of the year, causing a
stir in staid Swiss banking circles.
The development is controversial because it provides identical data
processing services to each member, operating computer hardware on behalf of
shareholders from two mainframe sites.
A bank's computer system these days contains as much of value as its vaults.
Accounting information, lending records and so on, are filed away on
batteries of capacious disc drives.
It is the kind of data which can be used to compile marketing profiles of
customers, opening the door to the cross-selling of a wide variety of
financial products. Bankers conventionally see such information as their
crown jewels and guard it jealously.
Yet the Unicible shareholders - BCV and Credit Foncier Vaudois in Lausanne,
Banque Hypothecaire du Canton de Geneve and Caisee d'Epargne de Geneve in
Geneva and Banque Cantonale du Valais in Sion - are not only sharing
processing services, but developing applications software on a common basis,
using a single software development method.
This includes software designed to give institutions a competitive edge,
again an area companies traditionally reserve for their own computing
specialists.
The Unicible initiative is a form of facilities management, or
'outsourcing', which is becoming an increasingly credible option for
companies anxious to concentrate on what they do best, leaving essential,
but non-core, activities to outside specialists.
But it is still highly unusual in the banking community. Barclays Bank in
the UK, for example, recently hived off its data processing department as a
subsidiary, Barclays Computer Operations (BCO), which sells computing
services to outside customers in addition to members of the Barclays group.
BCO is wholly owned by Barclays, and its outside customers - while in
financial services - are not competitors.
Unicible has its origin in decisions taken in the late 1980s by BCV. Then a
moderately successful cantonal bank, it was concerned about its continuing
ability to hold its own with its big Swiss competitors - Union Bank of
Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corporation and Credit Suisse - and, with the advent
of the single European market, foreign banks as well.
Like many cantonal banks, its strength lay in its local business - personal
savings and mortgages - and it lacked the business expertise and computer
systems flexible enough to exploit newer, more profitable banking products.
The bank had two iconoclasts among its senior executives: Francis Randin,
then senior vice-president for organisation and information systems, and
Pierre Pennone, head of information systems development. Randin, the
youngest-ever member of the Swiss Bankers Association, has now given up his
banking career to run Unicible. Pennone has taken charge of systems
development there.
Randin and Pennone persuaded BCV to re-engineer its business processes and
its information systems using special computer software developed by Texas
Instruments, the US-based electronics company, and new International
Business Machines' file system, DB2.
Business process re-engineering - changing the way a company does business
to focus its responsiveness to fast-changing markets - is a hackneyed term
today but, back in 1988 it was very new, as was the Texas Instruments'
software Information Engineering Facility or IEF.
BCV became its first commercial site; it still has more experience of the
technology than any other customer.
IEF is a very large and sophisticated form of computer-aided systems
engineering (Case); it uses computer power to design business processes and
automatically write the computer systems to underpin them. According to the
US technology consultancy Gartner Group, it has proved itself the most
successful Case system in a difficult market.
But the entire strategy, planned to take up to 10 years to complete, was
certain to cost more than BCV could afford alone, hence Unicible. Three
years into implementation of the transformation strategy, both Randin and
Pennone agree that IEF has proved an effective re-engineering tool.
One-third of the five banks' application programs - some 2,000 operational
procedures - have been rewritten; another third will be ready in 18 months.
That leaves what Pennone describes as 'decision-making' programs - software
for competitive advantage but in areas outside the banks' present expertise.
For these topics it is seeking outside know-how: for investment portfolio
management, for example, it has bought a Belgian product which it is
rewriting, using IEF to offer to its shareholders.
Pennone explains that Unicible works because its shareholders have the same
processing needs and the same global strategy; they are not in competition
with each other although they face the same threats from bigger banks.
And they have the same need to keep up with technology. Pennone is already
beginning to think about open systems and multimedia which he says represent
a 'tremendous opportunity'.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Bucking the Trend: A leap from doom to boom - How Club 24
found a way to survive by redefining its business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE DAY last year, after Mr Iain Kendall had agreed his severance terms,
cleared his desk and said farewell to his colleagues in Club 24 - then the
financial-services arm of Next, the clothing retailer - he was driving to
Scotland to buy a small business.
Then his car phone rang with a message from Mr David Jones, the chief
executive of Next. The new customer Mr Kendall had been working on for
months wanted to go ahead. Plans to shut down Club 24 were going into
reverse.
Would Mr Kendall please return to his job as sales and marketing director?
Mr Stephen Fairbank would be continuing as managing director and they would
be fully backed to redevelop the business.
The gloom lifted at Club 24 headquarters in central Leeds as news spread of
the change of mind. The 300 jobs had appeared doomed and management had been
struggling to maintain morale.
Last week staff numbers were up to 605. More jobs are almost certainly on
the way as the business bustles into new territory.
Club 24 started life more than 20 years ago, managing customers' budget
accounts for Hepworth and Burtons. Hepworth's warehouses and tailoring shops
in Leeds were full and busy in those days. Fashion-conscious young men
regularly updated their made-to-measure suits as trousers flared and
straightened and lapels broadened and slimmed.
By the mid 1970s Hepworth incorporated the credit management operation as
Club 24, in a joint venture with Forward Trust. The name came from the
formula for calculating credit limits - 24 times the monthly sum any
customer was prepared to pay.
In 1985 Hepworth took full control and three years later - when Hepworth had
become Next - Club 24 was operating store credit for several high-street
chains and handling 2.3m accounts. A joint venture with Kingfisher added the
credit management business of Comet, B&amp;Q, Charlie Browns and Woolworth.
But the business was a product of the late-1980s credit boom and started to
come unstuck as recession bit. It was increasingly dangerous for retail and
mail-order operators to carry the debts from such operations on their
balance sheets.
Next put the business up for sale. Last year, with no buyer in sight and a
management buy-out ruled out because of the difficulty of transferring the
debt, closure seemed inevitable.
Mr Fairbank and Mr Kendall asked the classic marketeer's question: 'What
business are we in?' They decided it was not financial services, but the
efficient management of millions of small transactions day in, day out,
round the clock and 365 days a year.
Why not try to turn Club 24 into a bureau, managing credit or any other type
of high-volume, telephone-based operation for other companies, but not
carrying the risk of debt on their own books?
Staff were already skilled at computer-based, telephone reception
operations, and Hepworth House, Club 24's tower block, was wired up to take
the calls.
The crucial issue was whether the concept was marketable. Mr Fairbank and Mr
Kendall started a race against time to sell the idea before Next shut them
down.
With the race apparently lost, Cellnet said yes. The British
Telecommunications subsidiary had decided to expand into the consumer mobile
telephones market but to farm out - or 'outsource' - the administration of
the tens of thousands of accounts through various service providers.
Cellnet has given Club 24 a Pounds 2m, four-year contract as sole supplier
of support administration systems. The deal includes development of bespoke
software by Club 24's research and development department.
The services include a rapid system for clearing creditworthiness and
setting up a line and account within 15 minutes of a new customer buying a
handset, so a phone becomes usable almost immediately. Club 24 will also
handle customer queries.
The Cellnet contract stimulated surging growth, with turnover leaping from
Pounds 9m to Pounds 15m this year. Kingfisher retains Club 24 to manage its
credit business and the Co-operative Bank uses Club 24 to process the
fixed-term loans it sells through retail outlets.
New business includes a third of BT's radio paging and credit management for
Yorkshire Electricity. Debt collection - for other people - is also a
growing business. The old Club 24 debt, now transferred to Next's books, is
diminishing as part of this.
Indeed, Next almost certainly over-provided for bad debt in getting out of
financial services, so every pound Club 24 collects for its parent above the
provision will benefit Next shareholders' funds.
Ironically, Club 24 has bucked recession because of it. It makes sense for
its customers to outsource high-volume, low-value operations to a specialist
offering an economy of scale. Many companies appear to be doing so, so
white-collar jobs have been lost elsewhere.
Not that they mind that in Leeds, where Hepworth's old warehouses and
tailoring shops stand empty. Mr Fairbank and Mr Kendall are already talking
to a large computer company about using the warehouse's wide open spaces as
an envelope-stuffing and mailing bureau.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Retailers may branch out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAILERS are increasingly likely to penetrate each other's markets and move
into non-traditional areas in the competitive era after the recession, a
report by Manchester Business School and Cambridge Econometrics says.
The report, on prospects for UK retailing until 2005, says sales growth in
the sector has failed to keep pace with consumer spending. Discretionary
spending has been directed at leisure activities and at goods and services
not traditionally supplied through retail outlets.

FT  23 NOV 92 / 'Low' chance of inflation rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE probability of a significant rise in inflation over the next 12 months
is low, even though the pound has been devalued by about 15 per cent since
suspension from the ERM, a London Business School report says today. There
might be an adverse effect on inflation by 1994-95.
The report suggests that 'on monetary policy, the government may have done
too much and on fiscal policy it may have done too little in the short
term', while providing no credible medium-term policy to cut the budget
deficit.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Judges too old and 'out of touch'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUDGES ARE too old, too male and too out of touch, according to a survey of
public attitudes to the legal system published today, Robert Rice writes.
More than 65 per cent of 1,000 people in England and Wales surveyed for the
magazine Solicitors Journal agreed that 'judges are out of touch with
everyday life and everyday people'.
Almost 80 per cent said there should be more female judges. At present only
four of the 83 High Court judges are women and there is only one female
Appeal Court judge.
Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor, and Lord Taylor, the lord chief justice,
have both said that judges must be appointed on merit and the sex of the
applicant is not a consideration.
More than 85 per cent of respondents thought judges should retire earlier. A
total of 23 per cent of those surveyed said that the retirement age for
judges should be 60.
The survey shows that the public does not have strong feelings either way
about whether judges should continue to wear wigs in court. But more than
half said they were opposed to the televising of court cases, and most said
they feel that awards for libel were too high.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Lloyd's letters of credit in dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TWO CANADIAN banks
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the Toronto Dominion Bank and the Bank of Nova Scotia - are refusing to
honour letters of credit they gave to Lloyd's Names until English courts
rule on allegations of fraud at the insurance market.
Both banks wrote to Lloyd's on behalf of two Lloyd's Names earlier this
month. The Names are among about 80 Canadians who face losses as a result of
their membership of syndicates managed by Feltrim, Gooda Walker and others.
Lloyd's is playing down the row, which comes amid a mood of growing optimism
about prospects for relations between Lloyd's and its 20,000-plus Names, the
individuals whose wealth backs the market. Lloyd's said yesterday that
allegations of fraud 'are unfounded.'
In the first of the two letters, Toronto Dominion Bank wrote to Lloyd's on
November 10 to say it was not prepared to make a payment until 'a ruling has
been made by an English court on the allegations of fraud made by our
customer against Lloyd's'
Separately, the Bank of Nova Scotia wrote to Lloyd's on November 13 to says
that one of its customers claimed his contracts with Lloyd's were 'tainted
with fraud and are void and unenforceable'.
Like other overseas banks extending letters of credit on behalf of Names,
the two Canadian banks have 'back to back' agreements with correspondent
banks domiciled in the UK. Lloyd's said it would draw down letters of credit
from the correspondent banks so that any dispute would be between the two
Canadian banks and the correspondent banks.

FT  23 NOV 92 / NHS may seek links to private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS OF opening the National Health Service's internal market to
greater private-sector involvement have been signalled by Mrs Virginia
Bottomley, health secretary.
She told the Healthcare Financial Management Association conference in
London that, after measures announced in the Autumn Statement, she was
interested in examining joint ventures to improve and extend patient
services. 'Joint ventures should mean additional resources for the NHS,' she
said.
Before the general election, the government faced repeated allegations that
its health reforms were a prelude to privatisation, and ministers are
anxious not to revive those. Mrs Bottomley will therefore proceed
cautiously.
NHS health authorities and hospitals are already involved in some joint
ventures with the private sector. The Health Department sees scope for
extending those in areas such as hospital waste disposal and energy
conservation, as well as in clinical services.
In addition to joint ventures, new arrangements for equipment leasing will
enable trust hospitals to acquire expensive items such as scanners without
exceeding their funding limits.
Organisations including Bupa, Britain's biggest private healthcare group,
would be interested in increasing their involvement with the NHS and will
seek meetings with the Health Department.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Skoda to expand import business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SKODA, THE Czech carmaker now under the management control of Volkswagen, is
setting up a replacement importer to quadruple UK sales to 40,000 a year by
1996.
The new company will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Skoda Automobilova, in
which Volkswagen is building a 70 per cent stake. VW already holds 31 per
cent, with the balance in the hands of the Czech government.
Skoda Automobile UK will take over on January 1 from London-based Skoda
(Great Britain). The latter was set up many years ago by the Czech state
foreign trade corporation.
Skoda says the management structure and location of the new company will be
made known 'in the near future'. Its managing director will be Mr Robin
Woolcock, a former managing director of MAN Volkswagen Truck and Bus, the UK
importer of Volkswagen and MAN commercial vehicles. Mr Woolcock has been
managing the negotiations with Skoda GB and the creation of the new company.
He is expected to oversee an expansion of Skoda's presence in the UK as new
models come on stream. They are being developed under a planned DM8bn
(Pounds 3.3bn) investment programme designed to more than double Skoda's
capacity to 460,000 cars a year by the mid 1990s.
Skoda is adopting a more aggressive export marketing stance to reflect the
expansion.
The switch of importer comes as no surprise either to Skoda (GB) or its
network of 250 dealers. Mr Peter Titterton, director of car sales operations
for Skoda (GB), said negotiations had been going on for 13 months and
dealers had been assured that there would be no disruption to vehicle and
parts supplies or to warranty arrangements.
Cars are shipped from Hamburg and imported through Kings Lynn, Norfolk.
Some Skoda (GB) staff are likely to transfer to the new company.
With the Czech economy still in transition, Skoda (GB) will continue to
handle imports of Jawa and CZ motorcycles, Zetar tractors, Desta fork-lift
truck, Varum tyres and other agricultural equipment.
The expansion of Skoda sales in Europe is a main part of a determined effort
by Volkswagen to become Europe's car-market leader. The group includes Audi
and Seat.

A PROGRAMME for lifting the UK out of the recession will be launched today
when the Engineering Employers' Federation announces its keenly awaited
proposals for an industrial strategy.
The EEF, which has 5,000 member companies and is the UK's largest federation
of engineering companies, will argue that greatly increased investment is
the key ingredient for economic success.
The foreword to the document, which has been hammered out over the past few
weeks as the troubles of the manufacturing sector deepen, paints a gloomy
picture of the UK industrial scene.
It says: 'Unemployment is increasing by the day, businesses are closing at
an alarming rate and confidence is at an all-time low.
'Something must be done. There is an urgent need to start rebuilding our
manufacturing base while there is still time.'
In recent months the EEF has been increasingly critical of government
policies and, under Mr Neil Johnson, its new director-general, has been
beefing up its public profile.
Earlier this month, along with other industrial associations, the EEF
welcomed the chancellor's Autumn Statement as 'a great improvement' on the
government's previous industrial policies. But Mr Johnson said then that
rebuilding the UK industrial base was a job that demanded much longer-term
policies.

short-term recovery will lead to longer-term prosperity and more jobs.
Apart from urging increased investment, the EEF is expected to argue that
financial investment in industry should be viewed against achievable, rather
than illusory, rates of return.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Fears over Pounds 2bn gas power scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPERS behind a Pounds 2bn project for four offshore oil and gas fields
and the building of a gas-fired power station in north Wales fear the scheme
may fall victim to the government's energy review.
PowerGen, the privatised generator, plans to build a 1,360MW power station
at Connah's Quay, Clwyd, that would use gas from new fields in Liverpool
Bay. The project would create thousands of jobs.
Consent has been delayed, and the project's partners are concerned that the
backlash against gas-fired generation prompted by the decision to close 31
deep coal mines may persuade the government to 'save face' by withholding
consent.
Preliminary consent for the station was given last year but the project has
still not received a final go-ahead, partly because of delays to a public
inquiry into a proposed gas terminal at Point of Ayr on the Clwyd coast.
The inquiry was completed in June but the project's partners have been told
that the report will not be ready until January, which is also when the
energy review is due to be completed.
Cancellation of the project might jeopardise more than 4,000 new jobs and
the development of Liverpool Bay as an oil and gas province.
The three development partners - Lasmo and Monument, the UK independent oil
companies, and Hamilton, the US oil company - say they have already invested
more than Pounds 60m.
Mr Jim Riemersma, UK vice-president of Hamilton, said: 'In the middle of a
recession, we are proposing to make the largest investment that sector of
Wales has ever seen.'
Hamilton has operated in the UK since the early days of production from the
North Sea. It has warned that the loss of the Liverpool Bay and north Wales
development would 'certainly be a disincentive for future investment'.
Two bodies representing offshore oil and gas companies are preparing
submissions to the Commons trade and industry committee, which is carrying
out part of the government's energy review, warning that attempts to halt
gas projects might put at risk billions of pounds of investment in UK
waters.
The Connah's Quay project says it is a special case as there is a former
coal-fired power station on the site, with lines linking it to the national
grid.
Moreover, Liverpool Bay gas contains too much nitrogen to be accepted into
the national gas grid without expensive treatment. The gas can, however, be
burned in industrial plant, and Connah's Quay - only 20 miles from Point of
Ayr - seemed an ideal customer.
It is estimated that the project might create up to 4,000 jobs during
construction and 200 during the operational phase, as well as 750 spin-off
jobs.
The four fields in Liverpool Bay have a total of 1,000bn cu ft of gas and
200m barrels of oil.
Mr Tony Craven-Walker, Monument's chief executive, said: 'Coal and gas can
co-exist. Gas should not be penalised in view of the benefits it has
brought. There is not much point looking for gas reserves if the market is
going to be denied.'

FT  23 NOV 92 / Windsor loss less than feared
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS SMOKE and steam lingered yesterday over the ashes of what were once some
of the most stately of Windsor Castle's 1,000 rooms, it became clear that
the art treasures had been less damaged by Friday's fire than had previously
been feared.
Last night, Buckingham Palace and Department of National Heritage officials
agreed that the biggest task arising from the blaze, which raged through the
800-year-old castle for several hours, is the restoration of the building's
fabric.
Some of the worst-damaged rooms had been stripped of most contents as part
of a three-year renovation programme which had been under way for months.
Buckingham Palace said: 'With all the help available to us and with the
royal collection's own team of conservators available, we will be able to
restore pretty well all the items to their former condition. It is clearly a
long haul but we are confident of success.'
Only a handful of works of art have been lost, although they include Sir
William Beechey's portrait of George III.
Some calls, particularly from Labour MPs, were made yesterday for the Royal
Family to contribute to rebuilding costs, although the government has
already acknowledged its responsibility for maintaining the fabric of
Windsor and other royal residences.
Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, is expected to make a
statement in the Commons today setting out when and how reconstruction will
start.
Other than the certainty of department officials that reconstruction will
cost 'tens of millions' of pounds, the eventual bill is still in the early
stages of being estimated. Various reports of Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m being
required were indicated by officials as little more than 'guesstimates'.
Reports of how the fire started, ranging from a workman's cigarette to a
welding torch, were also dismissed as speculative. A team of forensic
experts arrived yesterday to investigate the cause.
Senior officers of the Berkshire fire brigade also rejected reports that
cost-cutting measures by the royal household had reduced fire cover at the
castle and had been a factor in the fire's early spread.
Mr Maurice Doyle, divisional officer, said that while the fire had shown it
was necessary to improve salvage expertise, 'we work with the castle fire
service all the time'.
Establishing the precise losses and damage to art treasures, furniture and
artefacts is likely to take time because of the need to cross-check the
inventories of items previously removed for the renovation and those piled
on the lawns by a human chain that included the Duke of York.
Tourists were still being allowed into unaffected lower grounds of the
castle yesterday but it is unclear as yet how tourism will be affected.
The 200-ft-long St George's Hall is devastated and roofless. The Waterloo
Chamber, scene of state banquets, is ruined and both the Grand Reception
Room and the great corridor are badly damaged.
They were among the greatest attractions of the state apartments which,
according to the English Tourist Board, were visited by nearly 650,000
visitors last year.
The state apartments were already closed to the public for the winter when
the fire struck. But there is no doubt that the fire is seen by the Royal
Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead as another blow to tourism on which the
area is heavily dependent, and which has been battered by recession.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Further 3,000 jobs to go at Barclays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS BANK will today announce that the number of UK based jobs it is
planning to shed in its four-year redundancy programme is being increased
from 15,000 to 18,000, Robert Peston writes.
The increase is linked to an acceleration in its branch closure programme.
Barclays told employees on Friday that it was planning to reduce the number
of its branches from 2,280 to 1,900 by the end of 1995. Last year Barclays
closed 110 branches and 120 are expected to go this year.
The job cuts may involve some compulsory redundancies, although the bank
will seek to use a voluntary redundancy scheme where possible.
Barclays' four-year redundancy programme began nearly two years ago. Last
year staff numbers in its UK banking operations were reduced by 5,000 and a
further 3,500 are expected to go this year. The UK banking operations now
employ 56,000.
The axe will fall predominantly on smaller suburban branches.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Cook seeks 'straight' answers: Pressure over Iraq arms
affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party yesterday demanded 'straight' answers to the evidence of
government complicity in the build-up of Saddam Hussein's military machine
as MPs prepared for today's full-scale Commons debate on the Iraq arms
affair.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said that over the past
two weeks his party had demonstrated that the government had consistently
misled parliament over the controls applied on defence-related sales to
Iraq.
He added that it was now up to ministers to provide straight answers as to
why equipment used in the Iraqi arms build-up was sold to Baghdad in breach
of the government's own guidelines - and why those guidelines were changed
without parliamentary notification.
Mr Cook said that Mr John Major, the prime minister, had told parliament
that the embargo on defence sales to Iraq imposed in 1985 had remained in
force until the invasion of Kuwait in 1990. But he added: 'We know that in
1988 they first relaxed the guidelines and then watered them down.'
Mr Cook, who again questioned whether Mr Major could have been unaware of
the controversy during his spells in the late 1980s as foreign secretary and
chancellor, said that British taxpayers were now footing the bill for
breaches of stated policy.
He said that the Export Credits Guarantee Department had provided insurance
for defence-related sales worth up to Pounds 200m on which the Baghdad
government had subsequently defaulted.
The Labour motion for today's debate says that the conduct of ministers in
the affair has been 'inconsistent with the security of British troops, with
open government, and with the just administration of the legal process'.
But a government amendment says that the issue of whether any rules were
breached must be left to the inquiry headed by Lord Justice Scott and
accuses Labour of 'sensationalism'.
Ministers said yesterday that it was clear that Mr Cook, who has been
harrying the government on the issue for two weeks, had run out of
'ammunition' to substantiate his charges.
The ministers said the papers to be made available to the Scott inquiry
would fully support the government's case that there had been no conspiracy
to arm Iraq.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Broadcasters baffled by the sounds of silence: The effect of
management secrecy on the BBC's morale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government green paper on the future of the BBC, expected later this
week, comes as most staff have more pressing things to worry about than the
grand strategic questions of the financing of the corporation and the role
of public-service broadcasting in an age of multi-channel television.
Mr Tony Lennon, joint president of Bectu, the broadcasting union, which has
suffered a steady stream of job losses at the BBC, expresses a widely held
view succinctly: 'Our great apprehension is not about what the government is
going to do to the BBC but over what the BBC is manifestly doing to itself.'
For 45 dressers at BBC Television - people who adjust, look after and
launder costumes - the debate with the government is academic. They were
told last week that their function was being contracted out and they were
losing their jobs next month.
There is greater uncertainty and insecurity about Producer Choice, the new
BBC policy of giving producers the right to buy-in services, than about the
activities of Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary.
Using a cricketing mataphor, Mr Brooke has described the BBC debate as more
of a five-day test than a one-day match. He will be looking for greater
efficiency from the BBC, but there is little chance of a frontal assault on
the corporation of the sort that might have happened had Mrs Thatcher still
been in power.
The effect of Producer Choice on morale, with the loss of jobs as internal
resources are slimmed down to correspond with the anticipated fall in
demand, has been made much worse by several other factors.
One is that the top management has been saying nothing in public, or even
much to its own staff, about the strategy, in spite of months of committee
meetings. The reason is that a deal was done with Mr David Mellor, the
former heritage secretary, that the BBC should stay silent until after the
green paper was published.
It was clear at the time that Mr Mellor planned to exclude some of the more
baroque ideas - such as proposals for an arts council of the airwaves to
which any broadcaster could apply for public funds. Mr Mellor's resignation
has not only caused delay, but it is believed that the arts council idea has
crept in again. Meanwhile the top brass of the BBC says little.
Asense of drift and inertia has been heightened by the 'two
director-generals problem'. When Mr John Birt takes over from Sir Michael
Checkland after Christmas it will be after 18 months as director-general
designate. During that period he has felt the need to behave like a Trappist
monk. Nobody knew what Mr Birt was thinking, while everyone knew Sir Michael
was on the way out.
A third level of uncertainty has been caused by one of the few things the
BBC has been saying - that its future lies in producing distinctive
programmes that the market finds it difficult to provide. Some fear that is
a strategy of planned retreat, and what is really needed is a fight for
audience share across every genre of programming.
The intensity of fear and uncertainty increases as you go down the
hierarchy.
A department head believes that the BBC is adopting 'absolutely the correct
strategy' and that a greater understanding of the logic of Producer Choice
is becoming more common among senior producers. The executive believes a
deal has been done with the government: real pain for a continuation of the
licence fee.
One producer describes the mood as caution rather than threat. The producer
is being bombarded with glossy brochures soliciting work, not from outside
companies but from internal departments eager to retain their work.
The producer said: 'There has been too little consultation (on Producer
Choice) too late', fearing that the most important resource at the BBC, its
technical craft tradition, will be eroded. There are concerns about
'contract culture' - being employed on a series of short-term contracts
rather than having staff rights. 'I think there is a crisis of morale. All
these changes are taking place and no real sense of where we're going.'
The view looks much bleaker to a videotape editor: 'Things are really bad.
There is no sense of job security at all. We're just keeping going as long
as we can.'
He fears there is a long-term, hidden agenda to withdraw from internal
production and become increasingly a commissioner rather than a maker of
programmes. He said editing capacity was being artificially reduced to force
producers to go outside. 'BBC management . . . It's a joke.'

FT  23 NOV 92 / Taxation of child benefit ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER LILLEY, social security secretary, yesterday in effect ruled out
taxing child benefit to make future savings in the social security budget.
But Mr Lilley signalled that in considering scope for savings the government
would look at benefits where spending was rising sharply without being
related to the recession.
Mr Lilley told the BBC's 'On the Record' that while the basic retirement
pension - the only universal entitlement apart from child benefit - was
taxable, he saw formidable difficulties both practically and in principle in
taxing child benefit. The benefit is paid direct to the mother, and taxing
it on the basis of the father's income as well would fly in the face of the
independent taxation of women.
Mr Lilley said that his first priority had to be ways of saving money that
did not impinge on benefits, such as cracking down on fraud. But some
benefits themselves also required attention, he said.
'You have to look at benefits which are growing rapidly, and ask yourself if
that growth is accounted for just by the recession or some other factors. We
looked at, for example, invalidity benefit - one of the fastest growing and
largest benefits - and we thought it right to tighten up on the medical
procedures so that we made more efficient use of our resources to ensure it
isn't going to people who aren't entitled to it.'

FT  23 NOV 92 / Audit law remit may be reduced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is considering the abolition of the requirement for small
limited companies to have an annual audit.
The Department of Trade and Industry is soon to issue a consultative
document which is likely to recommend dropping audits at least for companies
with turnover below the VAT registration threshold of Pounds 36,600.
The move would be one of the most radical changes since compulsory annual
audits for all limited-liability companies were introduced in 1900. It would
reduce costs for at least 250,000 of the 1.1m limited-liability companies.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said: 'As the deregulation
minister, I am very keen that we should get rid of requirements which serve
little purpose. For the smallest companies we do have some scope for some
liberalisation.'
The move follows substantial lobbying for reform by parts of the accountancy
profession and from small-business organisations.
The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants is against abolition of
small-company audits, arguing that they help to ensure accuracy of financial
information and accompany the privileges of incorporation. The Inland
Revenue and several banks have also expressed reluctance to see the audit
abolished.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Before making the world's longest commercial flight first
fire frozen chickens at the aircraft: The Airbus A340 will take passengers
further in one hop than ever before but what strains will that put on the
aircraft and travellers?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'jet age' entered a new dimension on Saturday when an Airbus A340
four-engine widebody airliner in Lufthansa colours flew 12,500 kms non-stop
from Frankfurt to Honolulu. At 15 1/2 hours, it was the longest non-stop
passenger flight ever undertaken under scheduled airline conditions from
Europe and ushered in a new era of long-distance air travel.
But the journey was only a small, if spectacular, part of one of the most
exhaustive test programmes ever undertaken for a civil aircraft. And it
comes in the wake of the long-running controversy that Airbus has faced
after three A320 crashes, two in France and one in India.
Against that background, the European aircraft consortium has spent about
Dollars 1.5bn on testing the safety and performance of the A340. That is two
fifths of the aircraft's total Dollars 3.5bn development cost, and it has
taken the group two years to prepare its airliner, which claims the longest
range of any aircraft in aviation history and will enter commercial service
next January.
So what testing efforts have been made by the group, which is still
struggling to win broad public acceptance for the fly-by-wire system it
introduced in its A320 narrowbody twin-engine aircraft and is adapting to
the A340 and its shorter-range sister aircraft, the A330 twin?
All new commercial aircraft undergo gruelling testing to meet increasingly
tough airworthiness certification requirements. But Mr Bernard Ziegler, the
head of Airbus engineering and a test pilot himself, says Airbus has had to
undertake more extensive development testing than its US competitors, Boeing
and McDonnell Douglas, not only because it is a relative newcomer to the
airliner market but because its aircraft have introduced new - and at times
highly controversial - technology to commercial aviation.
Such is fly-by-wire, a system of flying an aircraft through computers, but
which Mr Ziegler insists is a safer and more efficient way of controlling an
aircraft. Boeing, he notes, is introducing such systems in its 777 widebody
twin-engine airliner. 'The technology is not at stake and all three A320
accidents were crew-related,' he says.
He acknowledges, though, that with the A320 Airbus may not have sufficiently
understood and addressed the task of training crews to fly using the new
flight computer system. To test the safety of the fly-by-wire system on the
A340, the aircraft - like the A320 - has undergone rigorous testing for
electromagnetic interference. 'The problem is: what happens if an airliner
flies by mistake over a secret military base equipped with special radars
which could interfere with the electronics on board?' another Airbus
executive explains.
'To study electromagnetic interference to the extreme, we stuck an aircraft
in a French naval base, where it was bombarded by radio and radar waves of
various intensity.'
Lightning strikes can also cause serious electromagnetic interference, so
the A340 was flown into a storm to seek out lightning. After 17 strikes, all
systems continued to operate normally. The A340 also flew over the North
Pole to test its navigational equipment when everything suddenly points from
north to south. It was the first flight by an Airbus aircraft over the pole.
At the other end of the sophistication table comes the method used to test
the A340's resistance to birdstrikes. Here a cannon was loaded with dozens
of frozen chickens which were fired at the aircraft's windshield and engine
fan blades.
The runway at the French military base of Istres had to be lengthened by
about 120 metres to test aborted take-offs and the aircraft's brakes. Mr
Robert Alizard, Airbus public-affairs manager, says: 'We needed the
additional runway length to give ourselves sufficient margin for these tests
when brakes become red hot and tyres sometimes burst.'
Structural and fatigue tests have taken place on the ground as well as
flight tests using six aircraft costing Dollars 100m each. During this
process, Airbus has made 1,200 modifications to the aircraft, many costing
millions of dollars.
In ground tests, the structure of one A340 was stressed to breaking point.
The wings were bent by 240 hydraulic jacks four metres up before the first
damage appeared. Another aircraft was used for fatigue tests, when
vibration, landing impacts and pressure variations are simulated.
'We test all our aircraft for fatigue up to three times its planned service
life and for some components up to five times,' Mr Ziegler says.
One difficulty the A340 ran into in testing was vibration on the wings. 'We
had to make a slight modification in the wing profile in one local area but
it still cost Dollars 40m,' Mr Ziegler says. Another snag arose when the
aircraft's landing gear refused to lock properly.
While static tests were performed, Airbus ran flight tests. Two prototype
aircraft loaded with computers studied the behaviour of the airliner at all
speeds and altitudes, including the worst-case scenario: finding out how the
aircraft reacted when various systems failed.
For the first time, Airbus conducted flight tests on the A340 in real time.
The information from computers in the back of the aircraft monitoring all
aspects of test flight was directly beamed down by satellite to the Airbus
Toulouse test centre.
The aircraft was thus constantly linked in real time to Toulouse, which
could itself monitor the tests and instruct the pilots to conduct particular
tests or repeat them immediately. In the past, the data from the test
computers on board had to be deciphered after the aircraft had landed. That
can take up to four days.
Mr Ziegler says about two thirds of the test programme related to safety;
the rest involved the performance of the aircraft in airline operation.
'Today all the safety issues are resolved and closed; we are in the final
route-proving programme to test the aircraft's operational reliability in
commercial airline conditions,' he says.
The two launch customers, Lufthansa and Air France, are taking part in the
three-week route-proving tests involving long-distance and shorter-haul
flights around the world using two aircraft: a longer-range A340-200 in
Lufthansa colours and a shorter-range but higher-capacity A340-300 in Air
France livery. The two aircraft are fitted out for commercial operations but
also carry flight test instruments to measure not only aircraft performance
but also cabin systems and passenger comfort.
'Although less significant for the manufacturer, it is extremely important
for the airlines to start up operations with as mature an aircraft as
possible,' Mr Ziegler explains. 'This involves chasing all the snags and
teething problems you get when you introduce a new airliner. We plan to
avoid with the A340 about three quarters of the introduction problems we had
with the A320.'
The first delay suffered during the present route-proving exercise by the
Lufthansa A340 was on a short hop between Frankfurt to Madrid. 'The coffee
machine did not work,' Mr Ziegler said. 'My flight engineers couldn't care
less - but the airline does . . . '

FT  23 NOV 92 / Ozone hole rescue moves lead to a tussle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL agreements to prevent damage to the earth's ozone layer have
been one of the past decade's most successful responses to environmental
threats. Today in Copenhagen representatives of some 100 countries meet to
try and tighten safeguards further - but critics fear the new measures may
represent a weakening of the rules.
The 1987 Montreal Protocol committed 91 countries to phasing out by the year
2000 all production of chemicals that could damage the ozone layer, notably
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used in aerosols and airconditioning.
Since then consumption of ozone-depleting chemicals has fallen, largely
because aerosols use substitutes.
Industrialised countries saw consumption of CFCs and halons, a second
regulated class of chemical, fall by 33 per cent between 1986 and 1990. But
consumption rose by 50 per cent in developing countries in the same period,
although total levels are still more than 20 times less than the total in
developed countries.
The protocol's signatories are wrestling with three main ways of tightening
commitments further at the meeting:
Accelerating the phase-out dates. This is likely to be agreed, with the
phase-out of CFCs, trichloroethane and carbon tetrachloride production
brought forward from January 2000 to January 1996, and the phase-out of
halons from 2000 to either 1996 or 1995.
Unlike the present form of the protocol, the new commitments will make
exemptions for 'essential industries', and those will not be defined until
the next meeting in 1994. Environmental groups have been concerned that
although the measures appear to represent a tightening of the rules, the
'loophole' will allow much production to continue.
Adding new chemicals to the controlled list. This is proving more
controversial. HCFCs, increasingly used as a less-damaging substitute for
CFCs are one target, but environmental groups are concerned that the
permitted levels will be set too high. Proposals to freeze production of
methyl bromide, a pesticide widely used in preserving and transporting fruit
and grain, look set for an even rougher ride. Developing countries and
others who export a lot of fruit have questioned the evidence for its
damaging effects.
Establishing on a firmer basis the fund to pay for developing countries'
adaptation. This is likely to be the biggest area of controversy.
There is general consensus that the present interim fund of Dollars 200m for
1991-1993 has not been working well. Some countries, such as the UK, have
been criticised for not paying up their full commitment. They in turn have
criticised the fund, which is implemented by the United Nations' development
and environment programmes (UNDP and UNEP) and the World Bank, for its
slowness in finding projects.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Germany offers Hungary free military spare parts
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY will give Hungary free military spare parts from the former East
German army, it said at the weekend, in spite of concerns that such
deliveries might fuel tension. Mr Bernd Wilz, state secretary at the German
Defence Ministry, said the equipment was necessary so as not to leave
Hungary 'undefended'.
Bonn's decision comes after much hesitation and nervousness that military
support for Hungary, which borders the warring Yugoslav successor states,
might infringe Germany's rules against providing arms to areas of crisis.
Mr Wilz emphasised that Germany would not supply lethal equipment, and Mr
Erno Raffay, his Hungarian counterpart, denied that the announcement marked
a Hungarian military build-up. But the announcement closely follows a visit
to Budapest by Mr Boris Yeltsin during which the Russian president approved
the delivery of Dollars 800m (Pounds 530m) in supplies of military spares
and air-defence equipment to Hungary in partial repayment for Russia's trade
debt of more than Dollars 2bn.
The latest arms deals reflect an attempt by Budapest to maintain military
strength while a budgetary crisis precludes higher military spending. The
effort to shore up the armed forces comes against the background of
deteriorating relations with neighbouring Slovakia, Romania and Serbia,
which all contain large Hungarian ethnic minorities.

FT  23 NOV 92 / High life has hazards for the long-range flyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRCRAFT ARE built to cope with marathon flights, but how does the human
body cope? Mr Hans Mirka is the ultimate high-flying businessman. He left
London on Tuesday for Dallas, flew on to Tokyo on Wednesday, was back in
Dallas on Saturday and is returning home to London tonight. He does this
sort of trip about once a month.
Head of international operations at American Airlines, the world's largest
carrier, he was moved from the group's Dallas headquarters to London this
year because his chairman, Mr Bob Crandall, felt London was the perfect
jumping-off spot for a globe-trotting executive.
'Hans can leave London on a Friday, be in Tokyo on Saturday, leave for
Dallas on Sunday, attend our Monday board meeting and then catch the night
flight to be in his office in London first thing on Tuesday,' Mr Crandall
explained during a recent visit to London.
Mr Mirka, who has already done several of these round the world weekend
business trips this year, is an extreme but by no means unique example of
the globe-trotting executive. And with the start next year of 16-hour 'hops'
with the A340 very-long-range airliner, the world will shrink further.
The A340 is expected to open up a whole series of new long-distance
connections that would be uneconomical to serve with a 400-seater Boeing
747-400. But the new era of long-distance flying raises a number of health
and safety implications for passengers and airline crews.
So far, there has been no real evidence that flying over many different time
zones damages your health. But Dr Rory Barnes, a medical adviser for the
UK's Civil Aviation Authority, recommends travellers to get up and exercise
their legs during very long flights and restrict alcohol consumption to a
minimum. 'If you can sleep on an aircraft, try to plan a nap to put yourself
in a new time zone,' he advises, as well following an eating pattern on
board to help the body change rhythm as it crosses different time zones.
One controversial issue is the possible risks of radiation. Dr Barnes says
that very frequent fliers may face some radiation hazards. Their exposure is
less than for workers regularly exposed to radiation on the ground, but
higher than for the normal population.
The higher and the closer to the North Pole you fly, the greater the
radiation risk. On Concorde, which flies at 50,000 ft, a radiation meter is
carried on board. New long-distance subsonic aircraft also fly high, with
the A340 able to cruise at heights of up to 41,000 ft.
In contrast to pilots and cabin attendants, who go off duty after a long
flight, business people usually have to start work.
Probably the biggest drawback of very long flights for businessmen is that
they can reduce their overall performance on arrival.
Several studies have shown that jumping off an aircraft after a long flight
straight into a meeting often leads to lower efficiency and poor
decision-making.
'People often don't allow enough time to travel: businessmen would do better
to delay taking decisions until they have recovered,' Dr Barnes suggests.

TURKISH leader Suleyman Demirel takes his campaign for Turkey's membership
of the European Community to London today amid signs that Turkey's
conservative-led coalition is increasingly out of step with public opinion
on Europe.
During talks with Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Jacques
Delors, president of the European Commission, Mr Demirel will make the case
that Turkey deserves a better hearing, and that its value to the west has
become all the more vital given the political turmoil in the region.
Mr Demirel has been quick to stress that Turkey's bolstering of ties with
Black Sea and Central Asian states is no alternative to EC membership.
In turning down Turkey's application for membership in 1989, the Commission
emphasised deficiencies in Turkey's level of economic development, on human
rights and on lack of progress on Cyprus. As one EC ambassador pointed out,
the enhanced relationship now requires that the Turks address these issues
with even more urgency.
In his address to the Confederation of British industry today, Mr Demirel
will outline Turkey's commitment to customs union. From January 1 1993,
Turkey will simplify its tariff regime to re-establish the community's
preference, following legislation passed by Ankara in July.
Turkey's accord with the EC envisages eliminating import tariffs by 1996,
and adopting the community's external tariff. Yet many business groups voice
doubts about the benefits of the customs union, given the increased foreign
competition which would result from further reductions in import tariffs.

<TEXT>
A TOP military official of the Commonwealth of Independent states has warned
that CIS states were 'less and less able' to ensure their own security.
He spoke as reports came in of a massacre of 800 refugees on the border of
Tajikistan with Afghanistan and of fresh fighting yesterday near
Tajikistan's capital, Dushanbe.
Fighting also intensified in the disputed enclave of Nagorno Karabakh.
Lt Gen Leonid Ivashov, secretary of the CIS Defence Ministry council, said
in Moscow yesterday that armed conflicts were spreading in many regions and
that none of the new states was capable of ensuring its own security because
the process of forming armed forces had been so slow.
The worst example is Tajikistan, where, according to the Russian news agency
NeGa, heavily armed groups attacked a refugee camp and killed some 800
people. There was no indication as to when the attack took place.
The camp appeared to be one for the thousands of refugees from the fighting
between supporters of Mr Rakhmon Nabiyevc, the former Communist leader and
supporters of the pro-Islamic government. Fighting swept into the republic's
capital, Dushanbe, last month. Order in the country has completely broken
down.
In Azerbaijan, the Defence Ministry yesterday claimed that Armenian
self-defence forces in the north of Nagorno-Karabakh attacked two strategic
villages. Armenians said 30 Azeri and eight Armenian soldiers were killed.
Lithuanian politician Algirdas Brazauskas began talks late last night on
forming a government after a final count of votes in the November 15
election left his Democratic Labour party holding a majority of 73 seats,
down from a preliminary count of 80 seats, Reuter adds from Vilnius.

Reuter reports from Milan.
Court officials said the men received sentences ranging from one year to 18
months for paying bribes to former Socialist party official Mario Chiesa,
who ran Milan's biggest municipal old people's home. The relatively light
sentences reflected the fact the men agreed to refund some L2bn (Pounds

This latest ANC ultimatum which was repeated at the weekend by its two most

tactical advantage over the government, which has been weakened by
disclosures of a military intelligence plot to undermine the ANC. However
the government was quick to reject the ultimatum, saying that a date for

WESTERN warships yesterday began enforcing a United Nations trade embargo on
Montenegro and Serbia in an attempt to stop the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Five ships from the Western European Union (WEU) yesterday were due to join
seven Nato vessels detailed to stop and search all ships sailing to or from
Adriatic ports in Montenegro, which along with Serbia comprises the
reconstituted although unrecognised Yugoslavia.
The task force, which includes HMS Gloucester, is authorised to use force to
stop any ship suspected of smuggling goods banned by the UN resolution.
Nato announced on Saturday that ships from its Standing Naval Force
Mediterranean (Stanavformed) would begin policing Adriatic waters yesterday
with the support of maritime patrol aircraft in an operation codenamed
Maritime Guard.
However diplomats yesterday feared that the tightened oil embargo would not
stop violations along land routes and the River Danube. One diplomat said:
'The blockade addresses only part of the problem, but the major violations
concern interdiction on the Danube and the still porous land borders.'
Lorries carrying tens of thousands of tonnes of petrol cross Yugoslavia's
frontiers each day, according to police and diplomats.
The UN imposed sanctions, including an oil embargo, on Yugoslavia on May 31.
Until yesterday, however, the multinational Adriatic flotilla was only
empowered to monitor the sanctions, not to enforce them.
The sanctions have failed to curb the bloodshed in Bosnia. Serb forces
yesterday shelled Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital besieged for nearly seven
months. Four people were killed in shelling by Serb fighters of Travnik and
Turbe, a nearby village, 45 miles north-west of Sarajevo. Relief workers
yesterday warned of an outbreak of typhoid fever in Travnik, packed with
tens of thousands of refugees who have fled fighting in nearby towns.
Meanwhile, in an interview yesterday with Politika, the main Serbian daily,
Mr Dobrica Cosic, the Yugoslav president, said he would not stand against Mr
Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, in elections due on December
20. Mr Cosic, a well-known writer who wields great influence among Serbs, is
widely seen as the only candidate who could pose a serious challenge to Mr
Milosevic.

FT  23 NOV 92 / France ponders farm deal rejection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government this week faces a critical decision as to whether to
carry out its threat of rejecting the agricultural trade deal struck on
Friday night between the European Community and the US in the face of bitter
opposition from France's farmers.
The government is expected to delay taking a final decision until after a
National Assembly debate on Wednesday, the same day that France's farmers
plans to stage nationwide protests against the proposed agreement. Meanwhile
French officials will today start trying to hammer out a compromise at a
meeting in Brussels before the European Commission meets on Wednesday.
France faces an unenviable choice over the farming deal. If it accepts the
draft agreement the unpopular Socialist government, desperately hoping to
win back public approval in the four months before next year's general
elections, would almost certainly face stormy protests from the farm lobby.
However, if France rejected the agreement it would not only risk triggering
a trade war with the US but also finding itself isolated within the
increasingly fragmented EC in the throes of this autumn's currency crisis
and the acrimonious debate over the ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
Last night Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy, speaking on French television,
said Friday's draft agreement was 'unacceptable' and said it would 'involve
a reduction in exports under circumstances that would be intolerable for our
agricultural economy'. He said he hoped to secure the agreement of other EC
member states to block the proposals and it would only be after Wednesday's
meeting 'that we will know whether France is isolated'.
Mr Beregovoy appeared to be pinning his hopes of averting a domestic
political crisis on wringing a last-minute compromise from the EC by
stressing that France was chiefly concerned about the incompatibility
between Friday's deal and last May's reform of the EC's Common Agricultural
Policy (CAP). The concern here is that production cuts under the US/EC
compromise might be more than those already agreed under the CAP reform.
Mr Beregovoy has urged the EC to analyse whether the deal would contravene
the CAP.
The right-wing opposition has attempted to exploit the government's
embarassment. Mr Francois Bayrou, general secretary of the UDF, one of the
largest opposition parties, said he 'supported' the government's opposition
to the deal but criticised its handling of the negotiations.
The opposition may abstain from Wednesday's National Assembly debate thereby
ensuring that the socialists take full responsibility for the consequences.
Meanwhile there were angry protests outside government buildings in Reims,
Lille and Meurthe as French farmers started their protests against the US-EC
deal in the run-up to Wednesday's demonstrations.

FT  23 NOV 92 / The European Market: Squeezing the new European single
market for all its worth - How an Italian company with fruit juice
operations based in Verona expanded by developing a plant near Berlin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH a father called Karl and a daughter by the name of Andrea, Mr Oswald
Zuegg - until 1918 Austrian by nationality - hardly fits the bill as Italy's
biggest maker of jams and fruit juices. The family business has been
involved in fruit-growing since 1895.
But in the fruit-growing valleys of Merano, in the region Italians call the
Alto Adige but Austrians still refer to as the Sudtirol, the name raises few
eyebrows. With German the mother tongue of most locals, family names and
traditions from the era of Austrian rule stick deep.
This year, Mr Zuegg has turned into a, somewhat unwilling, champion of
cross-cultural opportunities and the need for change if Italy is not to be
left behind in a two, or even three, speed European Community moving towards
an increasingly liberalised market.
Though familiar to millions of Italian shoppers, Zuegg was hardly a name
that tripped off journalists' tongues until its travails with a local
council near Verona, one of its three production sites, came to light.
The Verona plant, which houses Zuegg's fruit juice operations, had long
outgrown its boundaries. In a situation familiar to many in Italy, plans to
expand had been thwarted by the country's notoriously slow planning
bureaucracy. Worse still, an election defeat for the local council meant
previously accepted proposals were overturned by its successor.
After years of struggling, Mr Zuegg decided to throw in the towel. 'It's a
labyrinth from which we failed to emerge for six years,' he says. 'Even in a
zone earmarked for industry, the attitude seemed to be that industry didn't
matter.'
The decision coincided with the start of production at Zuegg's new plant
near Berlin, in what used to be East Germany. Talks with the agriculture
ministry of the German Democratic Republic about VEB Fruchtsaft, a small
maker of fruit juices with around 150 employees, had started in the closing
days of the communist era. Assisting the negotiations was none other than Mr
Gregor Gysi, the lawyer turned politician who subsequently became the GDR's
last premier and now heads a small all-German opposition party.
Discussions dragged on as the East German regime fell and the
still-inexperienced Treuhand privatisation agency took over. Finally, in
June 1991 the deal was signed. Zuegg bought the plant for around DM5m
(Pounds 2m), slashed the workforce to 35 and spent DM16m on new machinery.
The timing could hardly have been better for Italians eager to point out
their country's deficiencies. Here was an 'Italian' company turning its back
on the motherland for the efficient and reliable north. Zuegg's Teutonic
traditions just added to the piquancy. The message for Italian industry was
clear: a unified Germany was bound to suck up investment previously destined
for southern Europe, and Italy was in danger of being marginalised in a
unification-dominated EC unless it could put its house in order.
Mr Zuegg sees things differently. He says the company planned to expand
abroad before matters in Verona came to a head. And the new Berlin plant -
now the group's most modern - still has to overcome the suspicions of West
German customers. Many potential western clients remain wary of the plant's
semi-finished fruit concentrates, sold to dairy companies for fruit
yoghurts. 'The problem is that West German customers are still suspicious
about things from the east.'
'We knew from the start we couldn't allow ourselves even one mistake.'
Although production started last November, early output was used internally.
In spite of having ultra-modern machinery in a plant which is 'like new,'
output built up at snail's pace. However, the local staff are dedicated.
'You mustn't underestimate these people. They have a sense of pride in
wanting to show they can produce well.' He wants to develop the plant in
east Berlin as a foothold for northern Europe with a whole range of
products.
For a company with fewer than 500 employees and sales of just L250bn (Pounds
122m) a year, Zuegg is remarkably Community-minded. Its promotional material
comes in five languages, while its message is decidedly pan-European.
Its next aim is to introduce juice from Sicily's famous blood oranges to
consumers in northern Europe, starting with Austria and Germany. The
succulent fruit, only available for a limited period and barely known
outside Italy, will be lightly frozen, concentrated, and then sold chilled
to north European customers.
Mr Zuegg is enthusiastic about the prospects. For, straddling the divide
between Teutonic and Latin cultures, the company is mindful of the potential
for Italian products abroad. 'We know we have no chance with just ordinary
fruit juices in Austria and Germany. Imitating what others have done very
well for 20 years is pointless,' he says.
'But the common European market will give us the chance to promote our
specialities. Over the years, we've seen that when we stick to what we know,
we've done well.'
Taking Sicily's deep red oranges to northern Europe's shoppers could be just
the tonic to liven up tired supermarket shelves. After all, the free market
is supposed to increase choice, not just corporate earnings.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Japan's rice import ban row likely to escalate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN looked set for a confrontation with its trade partners over Japan's
ban on rice imports following remarks at the weekend by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa,
the Japanese prime minister.
Mr Miyazawa said Japan had no intention of easing the ban.
His comments came in response to the farm trade deal worked out last week
between the US and the European Community (EC).
The deal is likely to place renewed international pressure on Japan to
liberalise the import of rice.
Mr Miyazawa said that he welcomed the deal between the US and the EC, but
that this would not prompt Japan to change its policies.
Japan will shortly repeat its opposition to opening its rice market at
meetings connected to the trade negotiations under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
Government leaders in Japan had taken some comfort in private over the
squabbling between the US and Europe over farm trade issues.
This shifted attention away from Japan's trade policies and allowed them to
argue that Japan was not the main obstacle to reaching agreement at the Gatt
negotiations.
Japan has opposed the draft agreement submitted by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt's
director-general, which would force Japan to introduce tariffs on rice
imports, rather than ban them outright.
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has been loath to open the market
because of opposition from Japan's rice farmers, who have provided the
backbone of support for the party for decades.
There is none the less widespread cynicism among Japan's farmers, many of
whom believe the ruling party is preparing to cave in to international
pressure and gradually open the rice market, as it has earlier opened the
domestic market for beef and oranges.
It is unclear whether Mr Miyazawa's remarks represent a firm position of the
Japanese government, or simply a stance for domestic public consumption.
The timing for a major change in government policy is in any case not ideal,
since Mr Miyazawa's cabinet has been weakened considerably by financial
scandal.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Onus now on Brussels to square deal with CAP: How EC
partners will regard french protests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST Friday's settlement of the subsidised food export disputes between the
European Community and the US produced a collective sigh of relief. Now, all
eyes are on France.
French ministers say they will resist a deal they insist amounts to a
cave-in to US ambitions to dominate international food markets. They are
demanding that the European Commission, which clinched the agreement on
behalf of the 12, demonstrate that the EC's new international obligations
are compatible with this year's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP).
They are adamant that this is not the case, so the debate on 'compatibility'
is set to be fierce, backed up by strong pressure from France's farmers and
parliament and the threat of a French veto. But France has been playing
uphill for at least six weeks. And there is little sign its partners are
prepared to accommodate Paris to the extent of putting a Uruguay Round deal
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in jeopardy.
To begin with, the deal Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner,
brought back from Washington, is on certain points close to France's
maximalist demands. Mr MacSharry is aggressively confident in his
achievement and will not be shy about telling France that, in the end, it
was the Americans who caved in.
On Thursday night, with an agreement all but reached, Mr Ed Madigan, the US
agriculture secretary, pulled back, for the third time in five weeks, in the
face of intense lobbying from American farm organisations. This time, senior
EC officials say, Mr MacSharry gave the US until today to reply, or the
outline agreement would be withdrawn. He flew back to Brussels and, within
13 hours, President George Bush had overruled Mr Madigan and the deal was
finally done.
France has complained that the EC was negotiating with a gun to its head:
the punitive sanctions Washington had threatened for December 5. In the
event, Mr MacSharry gave the US an earlier deadline and got away with it. Mr
Jacques Delors, the French Commission president whom he had accused of
undermining the negotiations and siding with French interests, was the first
to congratulate him when the Commission assembled on Friday afternoon to
endorse the breakthrough. This was a far cry from events a week earlier.
Mr Delors had been forced to invite Mr MacSharry back to the negotiations
after he had angrily resigned this role, putting the Commission president
and Paris under intense pressure from EC member states. But then a paper
leaked from the Commission into French newspapers, implying that what Mr
MacSharry was negotiating would require EC farmers to 'set aside', or take
out of production, more than a third of their land.
That paper, followed by a formal French presentation using similar figures,
argued for an EC 'bottom line' on the oilseeds dispute which Mr MacSharry
has trumped. The paper argued for a tonnage ceiling on EC oilseeds output of
11m tonnes, with a limit to obligatory 'set-aside' of 15 per cent. In the
final deal there is no tonnage ceiling, only a sown area limit identical to
the 5.128m hectares envisaged by CAP reform; obligatory set-aside, moreover
is 10 per cent, below the 15 per cent set by CAP reform, and with a
dispensation to grow oilseeds for non-food use. France will still insist
that the 21 per cent cut in subsidised food exports in the deal cannot be
met, product by product.
But French officials were already shifting their argument towards
'rebalancing' - demanding US agreement to restrain their cheap cereals
substitutes coming in to the EC as quid pro quo for cuts in EC export
volume. The US has only agreed to monitor any 'surges' in exports of
products like corn-gluten. Nevertheless, EC officials say, the French guns
may be spiked because the 'rebalancing' wording was drafted by Germany which
has failed to support Paris in the last three weeks.
The momentum behind the deal is likely to increase until the December 11-12
summit of EC heads of government in Edinburgh - only after which farm
ministers will reassemble. Unless, of course, France is serious about using
its 'veto'. Legally, France can be outvoted on the package. But the veto in
question is the so-called 'Luxembourg compromise'. It can be invoked when
'very important interests' of a member state are at stake.
But even French officials admit that using the 'Luxembourg compromise' would
be equivalent to using France's nuclear force de frappe - a deterrent whose
only efficacy is if it is not used. Majority feeling in Brussels is that
President Francois Mitterrand will not risk the further, already
crisis-ridden stage of integration foreshadowed by the Maastricht treaty by
pressing this sort of veto now.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Managing divorce between Moscow and Kiev
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TRY AS they might to live independent existences, the economic fortunes of
the 15 republics of the former Soviet Union are inextricably linked.
Ukraine's economic policies have been driven largely by a desire to achieve
economic independence from Russia, culminating in its departure from the
rouble zone a fortnight ago. But Ukraine will have to reach some form of
co-operative monetary agreement with its Russian neighbour if its
market-oriented reform plan, announced last week, is to succeed.
Economic relations between Moscow and Kiev have become increasingly
acrimonious over the past year. Ukraine, like some other independent-minded
republic, has been issuing coupons for cash transactions. But it has also
been granting rouble credits to enterprises in order to pay their bills. The
result has been an enormous expansion in rouble credits, making control of
Russian inflation almost impossible. Since January, Ukraine has issued
unbacked credit totalling more than Rbs400bn, over Dollars 1.5bn at current
exchange rates, while its monthly inflation has risen to 30 per cent. As Mr
Jeffrey Sachs, who advises the Russian government, argues: 'There is no
realistic possibility of controlling credit in a system in which several
independent central banks each have the independent authority to issue
credit.'
The Russian central bank has taken an increasingly tough line. In June, it
began to limit the amount of trade finance it would grant for Russian
exports to other republics. In September, it effectively ejected Ukraine
from the rouble zone by refusing to accept any further payments from the
Ukrainian central bank. Finally, on November 12, the Ukrainian government
announced it was abandoning the rouble completely and planning a fully
independent currency.
Yet this monetary divorce will not solve the underlying problem which
plagues economic inter-republican relations: the high degree of
specialisation and economic interdependence within the former USSR. Russia
trades only 18 per cent of its total output with other republics. But
Ukraine is twice as exposed to inter-republican trade, while 10 of the
smaller republics have inter-republican trade ratios higher than 50 per
cent, as the chart shows. Moreover, the concentration of energy reserves in
Russia and the low level of energy prices previously set in the USSR, means
most of the republics have effectively been subsidised by Russia. If trade
flows are calculated using world energy prices, then most of the republics,
including Ukraine, would have large inter-republican trade deficits.
Already, as energy prices have risen, the republics' central banks have been
forced to create rouble credits to finance their growing trade deficits.
A separate Ukrainian currency will preclude this inflationary form of trade
finance. The risk is that Ukraine's trade with Russia will now collapse
completely. Russian exporters are unlikely to accept payment in a new,
non-convertible, and potentially highly inflationary currency. Nor will
Ukraine be able to earn sufficient convertible currency to finance trade
equal to a third of its total output.
One solution, exhaustively discussed in a recent book published jointly by
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Royal Institute
of International Affairs, is an inter-republican payments union. Russian
exporters and importers would be paid in roubles from the Russian central
bank while the Ukrainian traders would be paid in the new Ukrainian
currency. Every few weeks, the trade balance between Russia and Ukraine
would be settled in hard currency at an agreed dollar or Ecu exchange rate,
perhaps with western financial support.
A payments union would allow Russia and Ukraine to run independent monetary
policies while preserving trade links and preventing a further collapse in
output. Ukrainian independence may make economic as well as political sense.
But a shift to autarky would be costly indeed.

FT  23 NOV 92 / The ERM Realignment: Portuguese dragged in by Spain's
devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE, PETER WISE and REUTER

<DATELINE>
   MADRID, LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PORTUGUESE do not have much time for their big, brash, deficit-ridden
neighbour on the Iberian peninsula. But Lisbon has never been able to do
much about the fact that Spain is now their biggest export market, consuming
about 20 per cent of what Portugal has to sell abroad.
This weekend Portugal paid dearly for that, as a nervous Madrid asked the
European Community's monetary committee to devalue the peseta 6 per cent in
the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. Portugal, its
exporters already squeezed by a 5 per cent devaluation of the peseta during
the EC currency crisis in September, had little choice but to let the escudo
fall 6 per cent as well to maintain the status quo.
It has left a bitter aftertaste with Portugal's Prime Minister, Mr Anibal
Cavaco Silva. 'We did not need any devaluation,' he said yesterday. 'The
escudo survived without any problems the foreign exchange crisis on Friday.'
But the peseta did not. The Bank of Spain spent Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn)
supporting the currency last week after the Swedish government's attempt to
shadow the ERM failed - at a reported cost to the Swedish central bank of
around Dollars 25bn - last Thursday. Spain's finance minister, Mr Carlos
Solchaga, calculated that he had precious little time to act before
speculators turned again on the peseta.
The lessons of September still burn fiercely in Madrid. 'Solchaga didn't
want to be put in a situation where he was throwing foreign reserves away to
defend an overvalued currency,' said Mr Jaime de Pinies, head of research at
Banco Santander de Negocios yesterday. 'The Swedish failure must have scared
the daylights out of the Bank of Spain.'
Indeed, while Spain still has foreign reserves of around Dollars 53bn, Mr
Solchaga has contributed to further speculative pressure by suggesting for
two months that he would allow a further devaluation of the Spanish currency
as part of a wider realignment.
As it turned out, he could not wait. The government faces elections in the
next 11 months and a sharp fall in GDP growth (to under 1 per cent in the
third quarter), constant skirmishing with the unions and polls showing the
ruling Socialist party vote dropping sharply. A second peseta crisis could
have ruinously undermined domestic and foreign confidence.
Analysts in Madrid were at least applauding the government for agreeing to
follow the devaluation with an immediate withdrawal of a series of capital
controls imposed in September and designed to dissuade speculation. They
stopped the peseta falling through its ERM floor but also angered investors
attracted to Spain after it scrapped all exchange controls earlier this
year.
But with the artificial peseta floor provided by the controls removed,
Madrid is anxiously waiting to see what the markets do to the currency today
and tomorrow. Will a further 6 per cent prove to have been enough?
Government officials and Mr Solchaga said they believed it would.
The inflationary effects of the devaluation are hard to judge. Some analysts
yesterday predicted possible interest rate rises to dissuade employers from
using a cheaper peseta simply to boost exports while the domestic economy
cools and to stop concentrating on slowing wage growth.
The government has always said industry could no longer rely on competitive
devaluations to get it out of trouble at home, but the effect of the
devaluations in September and this weekend may be to do just that. Spain
stood firm for 10 years, following devaluations in 1959, 1967, 1976, 1977
and 1982. But including the two devaluations, the peseta has fallen about 15
per cent against the D-Mark since the summer.
Madrid's only guarantee of keeping inflation in check now - following a
welcome fall last month to 5.2 per cent - is to stick firmly to the tight
fiscal and deficit cutting targets in the 1993 budget, but many doubt it can
do so in an election year, when spending normally rises.
Portugal has been much more virtuous, fiscally, than Spain, which will only
add to irritation in the Lisbon government. Portugal has almost full
employment (Spain has 18 per cent unemployment) and the Portuguese finance
minister, Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, was only last week boasting that
devaluations were 'proof of the inability of governments to conceive of and
execute a credible policy programme'. Portuguese officials had even been
suggesting that by not following the peseta down, the country might be able
to diversify its trade and end dependence on Spain.
Lisbon will be particularly irritated by the message the escudo devaluation
will send to exporting employers, as the government is setting a tough
4.5-5.5 per cent target in public-sector wage talks, which act as a
guideline to the private industry.
But Portuguese exporters welcomed the escudo's fall, saying they still hoped
for more. And Mr Victor Constancio, a Socialist opposition economist, said:
'After failing to accompany the September devaluation of the peseta,
Portugal could no longer refuse to follow the depreciation of the weaker
southern currencies without losing credibility.'
Perhaps, but it hurts in Lisbon nevertheless.
The new peseta parity in the ERM is set at 72.79 to the D-Mark, against
68.42 before, as a result of the devaluation, the Economy Ministry said,
Reuter reports from Madrid.
It said the new upper limit within its 6 per cent fluctuation band is 68.55
pesetas, against 64.43 previously, and its lower limit 77.28 against 72.62.

FT  23 NOV 92 / The ERM Alignment: ERM move puts pressure on punt, and
Reynolds - Dublin pledges to defend the currency

THE IRISH government, which faces a general election in two days, will
continue to defend the punt even if it means putting up interest rates
again, the government said yesterday.
Ireland stood by the punt's value in the central band of the ERM as the
Spanish and Portuguese currencies were devalued at the weekend.
The government would defend its currency within the central band of the ERM
at the cost of higher interest rates in the short term, the Finance Ministry
said, but 'sustained high interest rates would be unbearable' in the longer
term. This would 'undermine the good fundamentals of the economy which have
sustained the punt until now'.
The government denied coming under pressure from German and French officials
to allow the punt to join the realignment. The ministry described the
reports as 'speculative loose talk' but added: 'It is anybody's guess
whether the (currency market) raiders will return. The continuing
instability within the system is a cause for worry.'
The government faces a renewed run on Ireland's reserves if the punt comes
under further pressure today.
Since sterling abandoned the ERM last September, there has been a question
mark over the punt. Around 30 per cent of Ireland's exports go to the UK,
and 40 per cent of its imports are sourced there. The government increased
interest rates by 3 percentage points in September and it has created a
IPounds 50m (Pounds 55m) fund to assist Irish companies adversely affected
by sterling's devaluation.
A number of Irish economists predict that interest rates could rise by a
further two points this week, bringing the Central Bank's short-term
facility rate to a record 15.75 per cent. Inflation is expected to be only 2
per cent this year.
Maintenance of a strong currency, linked to the D-Mark, has been the central
plank of the government's economic policy, which has until now enjoyed
cross-party support, over the past five years. It is a policy which has also
received the backing of the Confederation of Irish Industry and the trade
unions, although individual industrialists who have suffered most from
sterling's fall and the high interest rates have begun to raise their voices
in favour of a devaluation.
Should interest rates now be forced higher still, those voices will become a
clamour, and could cost Prime Minister Albert Reynolds' Fianna Fail party
votes in the election, especially from mortgage holders.
Nonetheless, abandonment of that policy on the eve of a general election
would be seen as politically damaging, particularly as opinion polls already
indicate that Fianna Fail will suffer a setback and that the Labour party is
likely to emerge greatly strengthened and hold the balance of power in the
new parliament.
Mr Ruari Quinn, the Labour party's economy spokesman, said yesterday: 'The
problem is being created by the high German interest rates, but the
Bundesbank is clearly not going to change its policy and bring them down.'
He was in favour of 'an orderly realignment' of ERM currencies involving the
French franc as well as the punt.
'It is not that we want to devalue. The problem is that the punt is being
revalued upwards with the D-Mark, which is now functioning as a European
reserve currency,' he said.
Last September, the Irish central bank borrowed over IPounds 1bn from other
EC central banks to defend the punt after sterling left the ERM, and is
estimated to have spent an additional IPounds 700m in reserves. In September
overseas investors also sold an estimated IPounds 500m in Irish gilts of a
IPounds 4bn total held by them, forcing the government to reverse its policy
of capping the foreign debt at IPounds 8.9bn.
A key factor which saved the punt though, was Ireland's remaining exchange
controls, which are due to be dismantled by the end of the year.

THE ROAD to European Monetary Union (Emu) is paved with good intentions. But
after the latest realignment inside the Exchange Rate Mechanism - the third
in just over two months - doubts about the feasibility of the Emu enterprise
seem certain to grow.
In Brussels yesterday, EC officials portrayed the weekend devaluations of
the Spanish and Portuguese currencies as a logical response to currency
market pressures aimed at enhancing stability within the European Monetary
System (EMS).
But stability has come at a price. Rather than signalling progress toward a
common European currency for the Twelve, the latest realignment underlines
the division of Europe into two tiers, with the prosperous upper half built
around a D-Mark zone to which France is clinging doggedly with its 'franc
fort' policy.
Germany's reluctance to lower interest rates during the 10-hour-long weekend
meeting of the European monetary committee not only suggests continuing
tensions within the ERM, it is also a statement about the balance of power
inside the EC.
This time, there was no repeat of the deal last September when Bonn traded a
0.25-point cut in the Lombard rate for a 7 per cent devaluation of the lira.
Having had its arm twisted by the politicians two months ago, Germany's
central bank was in no mood to undergo similar treatment again last weekend.
When bleary-eyed European monetary officials produced a communique early on
Sunday, they nevertheless chose to emphasise that progress toward the goal
of Emu set out in the Maastricht treaty remains on track.
Hence the reaffirmation of the need for ERM members to improve convergence
on price stability, and the commitment of the Spanish and Portuguese
governments to 'convergence programmes' aimed at matching the best
performers in the Community on inflation, deficits and government debt.
Yet at this moment, pressure is building in Brussels and other EC capitals
for a more flexible approach. Officials, including Mr Jacques Delors,
European Commission president, are worried that the convergence programmes'
built-in tendency toward deflation may have to be adjusted during the
current recession.
Without abandoning the long-term goal of convergence, or diluting the
criteria required for the final locking of exchange rates by the best EC
performers, Mr Delors is leaning toward policies which would stimulate
short-term growth - a significant shift in thinking from the more rigid
approach adopted in the late 1980s, when growth was strong and the fresh
push towards Emu began.
The two chief ideas circulating in Brussels are the creation of a European
Investment Fund to lend money for new infrastructure projects, particularly
road and communication links with eastern Europe, and a burst of Community
lending for public works programmes, financed through up to Ecu5bn (Pounds
4bn) borrowing on the international capital markets.
EC finance ministers will hear more about the planned growth initiative when
they gather in Brussels today. With Mr John Major, UK prime minister,
apparently offering guarded support, there is a reasonable chance of a
debate - but no decisions - on a growth package taking place at the EC
summit in Edinburgh.
Equally, ministers will hope to make progress on the Delors II package for
increasing the EC budget by almost one third over the next five or seven
years. The trick is to avoid the mistake of the late 1970s, when an EC-led
growth effort stoked inflation, says one EC official.

FT  23 NOV 92 / The ERM Realignment: Text of EC committee statement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The following is the text of a statement issued by the European Community's
monetary committee on the devaluation of the Spanish peseta and the
Portuguese escudo:
The ministers and central bank governors of the Member States of the
European Community have by mutual agreement following a common procedure
involving the Commission and after consultation with the Monetary Committee
decided to fix new central rates in the EMS.
The bilateral central rates of the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo
against the other currencies of the exchange rate mechanism have been
reduced by 6 per cent.
The new Ecu central rates are the following (in units of national currencies
per Ecu).
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Belgian franc       40.6304;
Danish crown        7.51410;
D-Mark              1.96992;
peseta              143.386;
French franc        6.60683;
Irish punt         0.735334;
Luxembourg franc    40.6304;
Dutch guilder       2.21958;
escudo              182.194;
*lira              1,690.76;
*sterling          0.805748;
*drachma            254.254.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
(* Notional central rates, based on market rates of 20 November).
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Spanish and Portuguese governments will implement strictly all the
measures necessary to ensure that the objectives of their convergence
programmes are achieved.
The Spanish government will immediately lift the special measures on some
foreign exchange transactions which it recently imposed. It will give the
highest priority to meeting the budgetary targets and implementing the
structural measures laid down in the convergence programme.
The ministers and governors draw the attention of the two governments to the
vital importance of restraint on the growth of labour costs.
Member states whose currencies are in the exchange rate mechanism will
implement economic and monetary policies in such a way as to improve their
convergence on price stability and ensure the stability of their currencies
within the parity grid.
The agrimonetary consequences of the present realignment will be examined by
the competent bodies.
The new bilateral central rates and the compulsory intervention points in
the exchange rate mechanism will be communicated by the central banks in
time for the opening of foreign exchange markets on 23 November 1992.

FT  23 NOV 92 / The ERM Realignment: New rates pressure on Bundesbank - Kohl
unlikely to be able to persuade central bank to abandon inflation fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bjorn Engholm, the German Social Democrat opposition leader, is expected
to press Chancellor Helmut Kohl at a meeting today to influence the
Bundesbank to ease its rigorous interest rates policy.
As trade union leaders argued at a similar session last week, he will say
the central bank's stance is killing jobs in western Germany and smothering
investment prospects in the east.
The talks, originally called to draft a 'solidarity pact' among all parties,
employers and unions to help recovery in the former GDR, are set to become
crucial to Bundesbank's deliberations.
Whatever the strength of the politicians' arguments - supported by a rising
wave of job cuts, forecasts of nil economic growth in the west and
downgraded expectations in the east next year - the Frankfurt policy-makers
are unlikely to back off just yet.
Unblinkingly dedicated to monetary stability, the bank has its eyes fixed on
two key indicators which dictate policy: inflation and money supply growth.
The depleted band of optimists still expecting German rate cuts before the
year's end may draw hope from inflation figures due later this week. Some
economists expect a shift down from October's 3.7 per cent annual rate in
the west to perhaps 3.5 per cent. But as others point out, any fall will be
a technical illusion, resulting from factors which pushed rates up 0.5 per
cent 12 months ago dropping out of the calculation.
Although producer price rises are now below 1 per cent year-on-year and
import prices in October were down 5 per cent on a year ago, there is still
considerable underlying inflationary pressure which the bank is determined
to squeeze out.
This stems mainly from increases in rents and services of around 6 per cent.
Housing shortages have been one influence, but the main source is the
undimmed pressure of high labour costs, which have increased the price of
some local authority services by as much as 20 per cent.
More trouble looms: a one-point increase in VAT to 15 per cent in January is
expected to push the overall rate of price increase firmly back above 4 per
cent.
Money supply growth, fuelled by demand for credit to ease personal and
corporate cash-flow problems, is currently running at 9.3 per cent, far
beyond the bank's upper 5.5 per cent target for annualised expansion in the
broad M3 measure.
Now that the economic squeeze has migrated into Germany, domestic political
pressure for rate cuts will grow. But the Bundesbank is determined that Mr
Kohl, Mr Engholm, unions and employers should come to accept its view of
what is 'right' for Germany.
The government has promised to cut public spending and attack its soaring
deficit, unions have hinted at restraining their pay demands, and employers
have again said they will stand firm in the coming wages round.
But the Bundesbank will need evidence more robust than tips and winks before
it is convinced that the enemy inflation is in full flight and feels able to
relax its grip on the interest rates leash.

DANISH Economy Minister Thor Pedersen welcomed the weekend's devaluation of
the Spanish and Portuguese currencies within the Exchange Rate Mechanism
(ERM) yesterday and said it would have little effect on Denmark, Reuter
reports from Copenhagen.
'The move will only have a marginal effect on the Danish economy, as only 3
per cent of our foreign trade involves these countries,' Mr Pedersen said.
'It is satisfactory that the devaluations were so small and that the
readjustments within ERM were so limited,' he said.
'This should prevent currency speculation. I welcome the ERM realignment as
it will bring calm to the EC currency situation.'
In Stockholm, Swedish central bank governor Bengt Dennis said the
devaluation of the two currencies would not have any great effect on Sweden.
'They are relatively small trading partners so it will not have any major
effects for Sweden,' Mr Dennis told the TT news agency.
Sweden said on Thursday it would float its crown against other currencies,
saying the fight against currency speculators had proved too hard.
'There is no doubt that our decision on a floating exchange rate contributed
to the devaluations. It released a very strong reaction in the European
currencies. Many currencies came under pressure then,' Mr Dennis said.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Market doubts remain over ERM: Spain and Portugal devalue by
6%; Major wants priority for capital spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Economics, Political and Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN and Portugal devalued their currencies in the European exchange rate
mechanism early yesterday but the agreement triggered concern in financial
markets over whether this third realignment in 10 weeks would prove durable.
After meeting for 10 hours in Brussels, the European Community's monetary
committee announced that the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo had been
devalued against the other six currencies in the ERM by 6 per cent.
The monetary committee statement also said Spain would lift the special
capital controls imposed during the currency turmoil of September to protect
the peseta after its 5 per cent devaluation that month.
But while officials leaving the meeting in the early hours yesterday
expressed confidence that the latest currency changes would put an end to
turmoil in the European Monetary System, foreign exchange market analysts
and economists in London were virtually unanimous in predicting further
troubles ahead.
The ERM changes spurred early buying interest in the dollar, which opened
sharply higher in the Far East. It was trading at DM1.6140 against DM1.6055
in New York on Friday.
The realignment came amid signs that the British presidency of the EC is
ready to reverse its previously-indicated opposition to efforts at next
month's summit to agree a concerted strategy to pull Europe from recession.
British officials said last night that Mr John Major would float with his
continental partners the idea of a Europe-wide agreement to give priority to
capital spending programmes - along the lines of the package announced by
the UK government in this month's Autumn Statement.
The British move, which the prime minister is expected to discuss with Mr
Jean-Luc Dehaene, his Belgian counterpart, at a meeting in Brussels today,
is designed to deflect calls from Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission
president, for a European 'growth strategy'.
Mr Leon Brittan, the British vice-president of the Commission, last week
held up the Autumn Statement as a possible model for other European
governments.
The weekend negotiations on ERM realignment - which came after Madrid
requested a peseta devaluation late on Friday - were marked by tension
between the Spanish and Portuguese officials in the committee because
Portugal was reluctant to devalue its currency.
The final agreement left the Irish punt and Danish krone unchanged against
the D-Mark, in spite of speculation against both currencies last week.
Neither Italy nor Britain, which left the ERM in September, applied to
rejoin the system. There was also no sign that the German Bundesbank would
be willing to lower its interest rates in support of the latest realignment.
On Friday, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, warned that
there was minimal room for a cut in German interest rates. Early yesterday,
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice-president, gave no indication that
the German central bank would change its policy. On leaving the meeting, he
said only that Germany would do what it felt was 'appropriate'. When asked
whether an interest rate cut would be appropriate, he answered 'no comment'.
Finance ministries throughout Europe joined in hailing the latest
realignment as a success. The French finance ministry said the move
suggested that the autumn currency crisis was over and that 'our
difficulties are behind us'.
Mr Thor Pedersen, Danish economy minister, said it 'should prevent currency
speculation' and 'bring calm'. Mr Bertie Ahern, Irish finance minister, said
he was 'well pleased' that the punt was unchanged and that the outcome was
'a recognition of the strength of the economic fundamentals in Ireland'.
But the limited nature of the weekend realignment fuelled expectations that
the Irish punt and Danish krone could again become the target of speculative
attack. Ireland's problem of a loss of competitiveness since the floating of
sterling in September has been compounded by political uncertainty ahead of
its general election on Wednesday.
There was some discomfort in Spain, the initiator of the changes. Mr Carlos
Solchaga, finance minister, said Spain would have preferred to wait for the
Italian lira to re-enter the system, but had acted to devalue the peseta
when there was no sign that this would happen.
From Madrid, it was reported last night that the Spanish government was
nervously awaiting market reaction, fearful that any further attacks on the
currency might force it out of the ERM.
It was also clear that Portugal had only agreed to a 6 per cent fall in the
value of the escudo in the ERM with the greatest reluctance.
'We did not need any devaluation,' said Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the
Portuguese prime minister.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Brussels confident on EC-US farm trade agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR European Commission officials were confident at the weekend that
there was enough political momentum behind last Friday's EC-US farm trade
deal to overcome French attempts to block it.
The agreement, which settled long-running disputes over subsidised food
exports and opens the way to concluding the six-year-old Uruguay Round
negotiations on liberalising world trade, has overwhelming support inside
the EC, officials said. This view was endorsed in London where the fierce
French opposition has done little to dent optimism that the way is now open
for a conclusion of the Uruguay Round.
Meanwhile, the French government this weekend came under intense political
pressure to reject the deal as angry French farmers threatened to step up
protests against the agreement. These will culminate in a nationwide day of
action on Wednesday and other strikes and stoppages planned by workers on
the Paris subway, French railways and Air France, the state-owned airline.
The beleaguered government is not expected to take a final decision on the
farm trade deal until a debate in the National Assembly on Wednesday. Mr
Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, has criticised the deal as
'unacceptable', and claims it contravenes last May's reform of the EC's
Common Agricultural Policy.
But Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, says 'we have no
difficulty whatsoever' in demonstrating that the EC-US accord is within the
price and production cuts agreed by the Community - including France - in
this year's radical reform of the CAP.
France's partners, one official argued, would not accept any new risk of a
transatlantic trade war. Nor would they support French opposition when they
feel the agreement is in key respects better than even France had expected.
'It's going to be difficult for France to oppose (the EC-US settlement) on
its previously stated grounds', he said.
The British judgment is that France would not veto the US-EC agreement. UK
ministers say that French anger has been entirely predictable, and expect
Paris to allow itself eventually to be 'outvoted' by its partners.
Mr MacSharry says the farm regime which EC states wish to preserve could not
survive in the absence of a Uruguay Round agreement guaranteed by the
108-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 'We are satisfied we have
a deal which will consolidate the benefits to EC agriculture agreed
unanimously by the member governments.'
Officials in Brussels believe the matter will be settled at the summit of EC
heads of government at Edinburgh on December 11-12. Some note that French
ministers are using the present furore to establish credentials as
intransigent defenders of French interests. France's staunchest ally,
Germany, has also failed to reinforce Paris on the Gatt front.
US officials were keeping a low profile over the weekend, making no public
statements about the disarray within the EC, conscious of the danger of
inflaming their own farmers, many of whom said on Friday they were deeply
disappointed with the deal.
The Bush administration, which leaves office on January 20, will not be able
to complete the passage of any Uruguay Round package through Congress. But
President Bush has vowed to negotiate until January 20, and president-elect
Bill Clinton has carefully avoided any words or actions that might undermine
this final burst of activity by his predecessor.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Irish punt, Danish krone seen as targets for selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE weekend realignment of currencies in the European exchange rate
mechanism met with a negative response from currency analysts and economists
who forecast increased tensions on the foreign exchange markets in the days
ahead.
The Irish punt and the Danish krone were singled out as candidates for
renewed attack after the 6 per cent devaluations of the Spanish peseta and
Portuguese escudo were criticised as 'too little, too late'.
Analysts said that outside the ERM, they expected speculative selling of the
Norwegian krone and last night Norway's central bank moved to bolster the
currency by raising its key overnight lending rate from 17 to 25 per cent
with effect from today. The krone has been under pressure since Sweden
floated its currency against the Ecu on Thursday.
Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at Union Bank of
Switzerland in London, said: 'What we have is a piecemeal realignment. It
spells the death knell of the ERM.'
'It isn't big enough and it doesn't involve enough currencies,' said Mr Jim
O'Neill, Swiss Bank Corporation's London-based head of research. 'The
markets will think: 'OK, those have gone, which will we go for now?''
'There is a week of turbulence ahead,' predicted Mr Gerry Holtham, chief
economist of Lehman Brothers International in London. 'The main problem
concerns the Irish punt, which is very vulnerable. But the markets could
also attack the Danish krone and if that goes, the French franc will come
under pressure,' he added.
The apparent reluctance of the Bundesbank to agree to any easing of its
monetary policy in connection with the peseta and escudo devaluations was
seen as an especially weak feature of the third ERM realignment in 10 weeks.
'The disappointment is likely to be all the greater this time around as
there is no promise of a cut in the Bundesbank's key lending rates in return
for the realignment,' said Mr Mike Gallagher, director of economic research
at IDEA, which forecasts market trends.
Indeed, for many analysts, a close reading of the communique issued by the
EC monetary committee yesterday appeared to confirm the Bundesbank's
determination not to adjust its monetary policy to save the ERM.
'Member states whose currencies are in the exchange rate mechanism will
implement their economic and monetary policies in such a way as to improve
their convergence on price stability and ensure the stability of their
currencies within the parity grid,' the statement said.
'That doesn't amount to a declaration of mutual support,' argued one
specialist in international monetary affairs. 'If the statement had referred
to ensuring the stability of the parity grid, it would have imposed
obligations on the Bundesbank. As it stands, it will be up to the weaker
currency countries to raise interest rates if necessary to keep their
currencies in line with the Deutsche-mark.'
According to Mr Chertkow of UBS, the markets were likely to question whether
Ireland, Denmark or France would have the stomach to raise rates.
Before September, Denmark and Ireland were counted among the low inflation
'core' countries of the ERM, and excluded as candidates for devaluation. But
currency changes have meant reduced competitiveness for Ireland in its
important UK market and for Denmark in Britain and Sweden. This would add to
pressure on the punt and krone, economists said.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of Eastern France (2): Rebirth of a region - Lorraine
shakes off its old blackspot image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE slow pre-programmed death of Lorraine's state-owned coal mines, the
largest and most efficient in France, is an object lesson to the British
government as it grapples erratically with its own coal industry closures,
writes William Dawkins.
Lorraine is today beginning to shake off its old image as France's
industrial blackspot, having lost 16,000 coal jobs over the past 25 years,
not to mention 75,000 in steel and iron ore mining and 26,000 in textiles.
Remarkably, the region has lived through this industrial cataclysm without
serious social unrest. There was violence in the early stages of the steel
closures and token strikes in some coal mines, but there has been nothing
approaching the scale of the British coal strike under the government of Mrs
Margaret Thatcher.
Today, Lorraine has an unemployment rate of 9.4 per cent, slightly below the
national average and one of the highest flows of foreign investment in
provincial France after its prosperous little neighbour, Alsace.
The rebirth is, however, far from perfect in that few of the new jobs have
been created in high technology industries - and businessmen complain of a
shortage of advanced services such as software consultancy in Lorraine.
According to Anvar, the state research agency, nearly three-quarters of
Lorraine's industrial workforce is employed by companies that devote less
than one per cent of their value-added to research and development.
Some job creation schemes have had a difficult ride. One of the oddest is
Parc des Schtroumpfs, a FFr1bn theme park near a former steel works in
Hagondange, based on the cartoon characters known as Smurfs in the UK.
Backed by Usinor Sacilor and the regional government, it went into
liquidation in 1990, only a year after opening, because the number of
visitors fell dramatically short of target, but was rescued by Walibi, the
Belgian theme park operator.
Others have been reassuring, like the growth of a community of plastics
companies around St Avold, on the northern Lorraine border with Germany, now
the second largest plastics centre after Oyonnax in Rhone-Alpes
The transformation of Lorraine has been successful enough to attract
international attention. The Polish and Czechoslovak governments, which have
asked Sofirem, the 25-year-old job creation arm of Charbonnages de France
(CdF) for advice on how to reduce the pain of coal mine closures in their
own countries.
Sofirem has helped more than 400 new and existing companies over the past
eight years and claims an 85 per cent success rate.
So what is the secret?
Out of Lorraine's three traditional industries, the Saar coal fields in the
north-east of the region stand out for having made planned closures more or
less evenly over a period of 25 years, so spreading the pain relatively
thinly. The iron and steel job reductions in around Longwy and Thionville in
the north and Pompey and Neuves-Maisons in the south, were less evenly
planned, because the outlook for the French steel industry was never as
bleak as for coal. Like CdF, the state-owned steelmaker Usinor Sacilor has
its own job-creation arm for the region, Sodiest, which has supported 1,000
new companies in its 10-year existence, a larger but less experienced body
than the coal board's Sofirem.
Achieving a smooth run-down for coal mining, due to close entirely in
Lorraine and nationwide by 2005, has not been easy. For the French
administration, like the UK government, has had changes of heart over the
future for coal.
Sofirem was established in 1967 when the government launched the first coal
output reductions on the realisation that French production costs could
never compete against cheap imported coal from Australia and south America.
It then eased off the reductions with the 1973 first oil price shock, only
to step them up again with France's subsequent decision to launch what
turned out to be the most ambitious nuclear energy programme in Europe.
The Socialist government bought another volte-face on coming to power in
1981, when it said coal output must rise by a third by the end of the
decade, only to change its mind in 1984 with the sober abandonment of its
go-it-alone economic expansionism.
Mr Richard Muller, head of the industrialisation department at Houilleres du
Bassin de Lorraine - CdF's local branch - does not expect any further
U-turns in government policy.
Accordingly, Lorraine, which now accounts for three quarters of French coal
output, is set to lose its remaining 14,000 mining jobs within the next
decade or so.
Massive state aid for retraining and economic development has been part of
the answer. Over the past five years, Lorraine alone has swallowed one fifth
of France's entire primes d'amenagement de territoire or regional economic
development budget, spent on business parks, roads and start-up premises.
Foreign investors can expect to find generous incentives, of between 10 per
cent and 30 per cent of project cost, depending on the location, says Mr
Michel Ferrand, a director of Adena, the Nancy development agency.
Richard Muller reckons that, all kinds of assistance included, each of the
13,565 jobs created or aided in Lorraine's former coal fields has cost the
public purse FFr100,000 - 'on an international comparison, we think that is
pretty reasonable,' he claims.
Another important element has been the advice and training organised by
Sofirem and the CdF itself, says Mr Jean-Jacques Fix, Sofirem's Lorraine
regional manager.
Sofirem offers start-up equity funding for former coal miners seeking to set
up their own businesses and helps them present their cases to bank lenders.
Most former miners, however, prefer the safer course of getting a new job
with another employer, often a foreign investor.
Here the CdF funds retraining, pays former employees' salaries for a trial
two months in a new company and runs a prospection service for employers and
employees.
'We can offer people of high quality and motivation,' says Mr Fix.
The British government is not the only one who might have an interest in
Lorraine's experience. Just a few miles away over the border, the German
coal industry is reducing production from its mines in the same Saar
deposits that stretch under Lorraine, but at a far more gentle pace,
reflecting the Bonn government's more coal-dependent energy policy. Yet
France decided long ago that coal mining in the area could never be
internationally competitive.

FT  23 NOV 92 / US keeps a low profile on Paris opposition
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US OFFICIALS are keeping a low profile and making no public statements about
the disarray within the European Community over last week's farm trade
reform deal.
Mr Carla Hills, the US trade representative, and Mr Ed Madigan, the US
agriculture secretary, were asked about French opposition on Friday when
they briefed the press.
The response was to point to the approval by the European Commission as if
the deal were now done. It has been their view that the Commission had
obstructed progress in the past on instructions from French president
Francois Mitterrand, passed through EC president Jacques Delors.
Privately, officials regard the French response as a manoeuvre to obtain a
better deal within the Community's reform of its Common Agriculture Policy
(CAP).
US officials are already looking forward to a return to the negotiating
table in Geneva and an early conclusion to the wider Uruguay Round talks
under the aegis of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
The hope is that major political decisions can be concluded by Christmas.
After that, the tremendous amount of detailed work to be done is expected to
take weeks if not months.
Inevitably, the Bush administration will run out of time. President Bush has
vowed to negotiate until January 20, the day governor Clinton is
inaugurated. The president-elect has said nothing to discourage this final
burst of activity by his predecessor.
A senior US official said Mr Clinton had 'pulled the rug out' from under
French efforts to delay agreement by saying after his election: 'There's
only one president at a time.'
Specifically he said he wanted a good Gatt agreement as soon as possible,
and that he said he would study the details of the farm trade pact reached
last week.
The Gatt talks, unlike the North American Free Trade Agreement linking the
US, Canada and Mexico, never became a campaign issue, and they have had the
support of leading Democrats in Congress.
Senator Lloyd Benson, the chairman of the Senate finance committee has been
mentioned as a possible member of the Clinton cabinet.
Last week he flew to Brussels to urge a speedy end to the farm trade dispute
and a return to the negotiating table.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (12): One-time jewel in
the crown shows up flaws - Profile of Navistar International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGENDARY financier JP Morgan would certainly blink if he saw the balance
sheet of Navistar International, a slimmed-down version of the former
International Harvester, once a jewel in Morgan's turn-of-the-century
corporate empire. The company, having eluded bankruptcy in the mid-1980s, is
once again on the financial brink.
Battling five-year cumulative losses, Navistar sold off the Harvester name
and its prestigious line of agricultural machinery in 1985. The ambitious
restructuring saved it from bankruptcy, and its surviving core businesses of
heavy- and medium-weight truck and engine manufacturing were projected to
carry it to solvency.
However, seven years after the overhaul, the company is still dogged by
losses and is locked in negotiations with the United Autoworkers' Union over
benefits for retired employees that it contends could push it into
bankruptcy. Chicago-based Navistar reported its eighth consecutive quarterly
loss last month, an outflow of Dollars 50m, or 13 cents per share, on sales
of Dollars 920m.
With a whopping 251m shares outstanding, those sales translate into little
more than Dollars 3 1/2 for each share. Navistar's stock has not traded over
Dollars 5 since 1989, and is now about Dollars 2 a share.
The core of Navistar's financial difficulties do not rest with its
day-to-day operations, which analysts agree are in fine shape. The class
eight heavy truck market, of which Navistar holds a 20 per pent market
share, is pulling out of recession with gusto, and is projected to grow by
about 20,000 units in 1993. Heavy truck assembly comprises about 40 per cent
of Navistar's business.
The medium-truck market is still flat, with 1993 industry sales projected at
about 95,000 units. Navistar commands about 30 per cent of that market,
which represents about 40 per cent of its business. Included in the medium
truck class is Navistar's school bus chassis business. Navistar produces two
thirds of all the school bus chassis manufactured in North America. However,
the sector has been dented by recalls and weakness in municipal budgets, and
is expected to recover more slowly from the recession than other truck
lines.
Sales of Navistar's truck engines have increased steadily, and have
benefited from a recent Mexican expansion, and a Dollars 100m a year
commitment to production research and development.
The development programme has kept Navistar's truck engines in the forefront
in terms of fuel consumption and emissions controls, as well as in
production efficiency. 'Navistar has good products, and their engine
technology is as good as anyone's,' says Robert McCarthy, a securities
analyst with Chicago-based Duff and Phelps. 'In terms of the products they
present to the marketplace, they are extremely competitive.'
However, decisions during the 1986 restructuring are bleeding red ink on to
Navistar's bottom line. To trade off its big International Harvester units,
executives agreed to have Navistar retain responsibility for all of
International's former workers' retirement and health benefits. As
health-care costs have escalated in the US, the company has been swamped
with pension bills and related costs. The pension burdens increase operating
costs by about Dollars 150m a year - costs not shared by its competitors.
Securities analysts say that sum, ploughed back into income, would equate to
50 cents a share each year.
In its pared-down condition, Navistar supports three retired workers for
each of its active workers. A decade of downscaling has reduced the
company's workforce to 13,000, from 100,000 in 1980.
The realities of that ratio have caused John Horne, Navistar's president,
and James Cotting, the firm's chief financial officer, to seek to reduce the
level of health care and other benefits it provides to former workers. By
asking employees and retired workers to contribute some of their healthcare
costs, they expect to achieve annual savings of about Dollars 90m.
The alternative, they have said in court filings, is bankruptcy, and the
loss of the company's remaining jobs as well as retired workers' pension
benefits.
While declining to comment directly on the case, Mr Cotting noted that to
remain competitive, a company must focus on productivity. 'If you're not
servicing your customers or supporting your people who do, you simply can't
afford to be in business any more,' he said.
When first proposed in July, the reduced benefits were strongly opposed by
unions representing Navistar's workforce. However, by October the powerful
United Auto Workers' Union had agreed to negotiate, with both sides aiming
for a resolution by early December. The union has also agreed to open the
terms of its master contract for existing employees.
Mr John McGinty, securities analyst for the investment firm First Boston,
sees the talks as a potential landmark. If Navistar is successful in
obtaining union concessions on healthcare and pension issues, the
repercussions would reach far beyond its own workforce, and deeply influence
contract negotiations for autoworkers in Detroit next year, he said.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (4): New plant opened in
France - Profile of Scania
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE MIDST of declining heavy truck markets across Europe, Scania, the
specialist Swedish heavy truck maker, has added to its capacity with the
opening of a new truck assembly plant at Angers in western France.
Scania has long enjoyed the leading position as the most profitable truck
maker in Europe, but its financial performance is coming under pressure as
it adds capacity at a time of shrinking demand.
The Swedish truck and bus maker is a subsidiary of Saab-Scania, the
automotive and aerospace group, which in turn forms the main wholly-owned
operating unit of Investor, the Swedish investment group controlled by the
Wallenberg family.
When European truck sales were booming in the late 1980s Scania was unable
to keep up with demand and was forced to sacrifice market share. It embarked
on the Angers project at the peak of the market, however, and it now faces
the burden of carrying the excess capacity through the duration of the
present recession.
Last year the group succeeded in compensating for the lower demand in
western Europe with increased sales in other markets, in particular in the
Middle East and in the Far East, but this has proved more difficult in 1992.
In the first half of this year sales of Scania trucks and buses fell by 10
per cent to 14,961 from 16,643 in the corresponding period a year earlier.
Turnover has declined by 7 per cent to SKr8.38bn. It captured a 10.4 per
cent share of the European heavy truck market (above 15 tonnes) last year, a
fall from 11.2 per cent a year earlier. Scania's truck production operations
are located in Europe - in Sweden, in the Netherlands and in France - and in
South America, where it began to build trucks, buses and engines in Brazil
in the mid-1950s and in Argentina in 1976.
It has a leading position among European truck makers in the Middle East and
Far East, where its trucks are assembled under licence in South Korea by
Asia Motors, a subsidiary of the Kia group.
The main blank on the Scania map is North America, where the Swedish truck
maker has failed to follow its European rivals Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and
Renault into the US industry. Unlike these three groups, which have all
taken over established US truck producers - and have all suffered heavy
losses - Scania tried to go it alone, but with little success.
Since 1985 Scania has exported to the US a limited volume of trucks for sale
in the north-eastern states of the US, but it was forced to announce in the
summer that it was discontinuing production for the US from the end of this
year. It blamed its withdrawal on the lack of profitability in the US heavy
truck market and 'the unlikelihood of a return to profitability in the
foreseeable future'.
Scania's well-established global presence in markets outside north America
has been an important source of strength in the face of the volatility of
demand in individual markets. In 1989 its five biggest truck markets were
Brazil with 4,099 vehicles sold, the UK, 3,507, France, 2,942, Sweden, 2,656
and Italy, 2,506.
In the space of two years the UK, Sweden and Italy had dropped out of the
top five to be replaced in 1991 by Germany - with 4,011 vehicles Scania's
biggest market - Iran and the Netherlands.
Iran, where Scania sold no trucks in 1990, emerged as its fourth largest
market worldwide last year with the sale of 2,300 vehicles. Scania's sales
in Germany, where it is the leading heavy truck importer, with a market
share of around 6 per cent, have more than doubled in three years from 1,813
in 1989 to 4,011 last year. In the same period its sales have more than
halved in the UK, however, falling to only 1,263 last year from 3,507 in
1989.
Helped by a surge in the construction sector in South Korea Scania sales
there more than trebled last year to 1,798 from 537 a year earlier.
This year the Iran and Korea markets have declined, and Scania truck sales
are also falling in line with the markets in Germany and in Brazil.
Scania has been unable to make up for these falls, although it has made
gains in Argentina, and in several smaller markets such as Morocco, Tunisia
and Syria. It has returned to Morocco this year after an absence of 30 years
with the assembly of trucks and buses by Soriac, a privately-owned, local
group. It is aiming at a sales volume in Morocco of around 250 vehicles a
year.
The access to overseas markets has not been sufficient during the recession
in Europe to maintain production levels at Scania's Swedish and Dutch
plants, and the group has announced measures to cut its workforce in the two
countries by 875 by early next year. It had a workforce of 22,000 at the
beginning of 1992 with 6,500 at its main Sodertalje plant in Sweden, and
9,000 outside Sweden.
To bring output into line with falling sales production is being stopped for
a total of 9 days from September to the end of the year at the Dutch plants,
while four production days will be lost at the Swedish plants around the end
of the year.
The decline in Europe means that production at the new Angers plant, where
Scania has initially invested close to FFr400m (Pounds 49m) will develop
much more slowly than originally planned. The workforce presently totals
around 200 including 120 hourly-paid workers. With output running at 5
trucks a day the Angers plant is scheduled to produce 600 trucks by the end
of this year. At full capacity of 30 trucks a day the workforce is expected
to rise to 400-500.
Scania has developed plans to establish an engine plant at Angers as well as
to further boost truck production capacity at the site, but investment in
further expansion will require first a significant recovery in the European
heavy truck market.
The group is aiming to have a production capacity for 50,000 vehicles a year
by the mid-1990s. Last year total deliveries of trucks and buses increased
by 5 per cent to 33,100, including 3,980 buses, the second best year in the
group's history.

FT  21 NOV 92 / Scots authority plan 'unwanted'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCOTTISH Office's plans to create a single-tier system of local
government in place of the present two-tier structure are 'unwanted and
unwelcome', Mr Charles Gray, president of the Convention of Scottish Local
Authorities, said yesterday.
The Scottish Office last month issued a consultation document proposing
various ways of redrawing the local council map of Scotland. Between 15 and
51 single-tier authorities would be set up instead of the nine regional and
51 district councils. Some functions straddling more than one authority
would be handled by joint boards.
Mr Gray argued that the question of local government ought to be examined by
an independent commission. The convention had hoped that single-tier
councils would follow the setting up of a Scottish parliament.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, told the same conference in Edinburgh, that
the consultation exercise was genuine. 'There is no map, already prepared,
sitting on a shelf, waiting to be dusted off.'
Savings were likely to arise from the proposed unitary structure, he said.
While Mr Gray, until recently convener of Strathclyde regional council,
which comprises nearly half Scotland's population, has long opposed the
abolition of regional councils, some representatives of district councils
also voiced reservations.
They believe the new unitary councils will not gain all the powers now in
the hands of regional councils and that there will be little democratic
control over functions handled by joint boards.

FT  21 NOV 92 / Castle embodies nation's heritage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WINDSOR CASTLE is the largest inhabited castle in the world and has been the
sovereign's official residence for more than 800 years.
The original castle at Windsor, a fortified earthwork surrounded by a dry
ditch, was built by William the Conqueror in about 1070 as one of a chain of
strongholds to control the area around London.
It was rebuilt and enlarged over the centuries, although the outline still
follows the shape of the original earthwork.
In 1215 King John rode reluctantly from the castle to nearby Runnymede to
set his seal on the Magna Carta.
Earlier, Henry I was the first monarch to make it a royal house when in 1121
he married his second wife Adelaide of Louvain in a chapel in the castle.
Their new home was little more than a cold and draughty timbered hall.
Each monarch in turn strengthened and added to the castle. The lower wall of
the dominant Round Tower dates back to Henry II, who reigned from 1154-89.
Two kings were born in the castle: Edward III (1327-77), and the gentle and
pious Henry Vl (1422-61), who founded Eton College. His body lies in the
castle's St George's Chapel.
Henry VIII (1509-47) made additions to St George's Chapel and his daughter,
Queen Elizabeth I (1558-1603), built a gallery which is now part of the
Royal Library.
Work on the inside of the castle was carried out by Sir Christopher Wren on
the command on Charles II (1660-85), although he was not often resident
there.
George III - 'Farmer George', who was king for 60 years from 1760 - loved
the whole of the Thames valley, and since then Windsor's popularity has
never wavered. Queen Victoria (1837-1901) loved the castle more and more as
she grew older.
The state apartments are open to the public when the Queen is not in
residence and visitors can view a collection of paintings by Holbein,
Rembrandt, Vermeer, Rubens, Van Dyck and Canaletto, as well as important
collections of furniture, porcelain and tapestries. Also on display are
drawings by old masters, including Leonardo da Vinci.

FT  21 NOV 92 / Hopes grow for cut-price fighter project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, insisted last night that the
planned European fighter aircraft (EFA) would not be built, but accepted
that a cheaper aircraft, with reduced military requirements, could still
emerge from negotiations.
In Rome, Spanish defence minister Julian Garcia Vargas said production of
the controversial fighter would be delayed by two years, but would be 30 per
cent cheaper.
Speaking after defence chiefs of Germany, Britain, Spain and Italy signed an
agreement listing the military requirements for the EFA, Mr Garcia said the
fighter would be cheaper and simpler and take longer to produce than
previously envisaged. He gave no details of the new specifications.
Mr Garcia hoped overall agreement on relaunching the EFA would be reached
soon.
British Aerospace, the UK partner in the programme, said it was encouraged
by Mr Garcia's statements, which suggested strongly that a compromise could
be reached.
Germany dismayed its partners in July when it dropped out of the
multi-billion-dollar EFA's production phase to pursue a cheaper alternative,
but has since indicated it was prepared to re-enter the project if costs
were scaled back.
In a television interview, Mr Ruhe accused colleagues of failing to back him
in his battle to scrap the original plans and build a cheaper version.
Mr Ruhe's bitterness suggests he has been forced to retreat and accept that
a new version of the old EFA will be built and not an entirely new aircraft.
He said the battle to reduce the price and military requirements of the EFA
was by no means over, in spite of reports that his ministry was ready to
accept what is in effect the same aircraft with less sophisticated
equipment.
The key now was to reduce the military requirements of the aircraft, and
Germany had drawn up a list of 10 elements where they could be significantly
reduced, he said.
He said a report by the 10 defence chiefs of the partner states should be
ready in December, and on that basis the negotiations could be finalised.
As far as Germany was concerned, no final decision on the production of a
new fighter was needed for at least three years, in order to have the
aircraft in service by 2002.

<TEXT>
MINIMAL room exists for manoeuvre on German interest rates, Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, warned yesterday, in remarks which will
dampen widespread hopes of a cut in German rates this year, David Waller
writes from Frankfurt.
Speaking at the European Banking Congress in Frankfurt he emphasised that
the Bundesbank's policy was aimed at medium-term price stability, cautioning
that this goal was being challenged by sharply growing money supply, strong
credit growth, considerable price rises and the weakening of the D-Mark
against the US dollar.
His speech also contained a highly sceptical assessment of the path to
monetary union as outlined in the Maastricht treaty. He said that monetary
union was desirable and realisable - but not necessarily within the
timetable laid down in the treaty.
The Bundesbank's policymaking Council meets only twice more this year, on
Thursday next week and again on December 10, when a money supply target will
be set for next year. Any decision on whether to cut the key Lombard or
discount rates will be influenced by provisional data for October money
supply growth and November inflation, to be published next week.
The Lombard rate is currently 9.5 per cent, cut from 9.75 per cent in
mid-September.

FT  21 NOV 92 / France wants Pounds and lira in ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE 'earnestly wishes' to see the pound and the lira return to the
European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) as quickly as possible, Mr Michel
Sapin, the French finance minister, said in London yesterday, writes Robert
Mauthner, Diplomatic Editor.
He told the Royal Institute of International Relations the fact that there
was now a de facto core of two stable currencies in western Europe, the
D-Mark and the French franc, should not act as a pretext for the exclusion
of other currencies from closer monetary integration.
He was fundamentally opposed to a 'two-speed Europe', which would relegate
such an important participant in the Community's development as Britain to
the sidelines.
However, Mr Sapin, who held up the stability of the franc in relation to the
D-Mark within the ERM as one of the main reasons for France's economic
success over the past six years, was implicitly critical of the British
government's decision in September to float the pound.
A strong currency resulted in less imported inflation as well as the
obligation to keep up and constantly improve the economy's competitive edge.
A reduction of cost and price inflation, as had been achieved by France, was
a prerequisite for growth.
'I am convinced that the policy of competitive devaluation does not allow
one to reach this goal,' the minister said.

with the significant exception of France - hailed yesterday's trade pact as
a triumph, but farmers condemned it as a sellout of their interests, Reuter
reports.
In Bonn, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government welcomed the farm deal.
Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said the agreement formed a good basis for
a Gatt agreement. 'The German government assumes that this agreement can be
implemented within the framework of the EC agriculture reform,' he said.
'The world economy and the German economy need a positive impulse in the
present critical phase. Prosperity in Germany and in the European Community
depend decisively on free world trade and open markets.'
But in Paris Agriculture Minister Jean-Pierre Soisson said France could not
accept the deal. But, although pressed repeatedly, he declined to say
definitely that the government would veto the accord.
The Spanish agriculture minister, Mr Pedro Solbes, said: 'This is good news,
and means sacrifices on both sides, but we are concerned over France's
dissatisfaction with the agreement.'
French farmers called for a popular revolt against the deal. Mr Luc Guyau,
president of the biggest farmers' union, FNSEA, described the accord reached
in Washington as 'a knife in the back' and called for immediate nationwide
protests by farmers.
France would not be alone in objecting, Mr Soisson said. 'When other
agriculture ministers discover (the details), they will have the similar
positions to mine.'
The German Farmers' Association (DBV) said the Community had caved in to
'massive pressure' from the US.
In the US, President-elect Bill Clinton, who would have to guide the package
through Congress, was guarded in his response yesterday.
'I'm hopeful but we've got to look at it,' he told reporters. 'I've been
fooling with farm issues for 20 years now. We've got to look at it, see the
details.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS has been European Drug Prevention Week, and naturally most attention to
it has been paid by the channels with most young listeners, Radio 1 and
Radio 5. Radio 1 has the sensible idea in its social programmes of taking
its listeners by surprise. Solvent-sniffers may find their programmes
unexpectedly interrupted by voices talking about their problem. What follows
is not instant advice but a helpline number. Calls are not only free, but
not shown in the telephone account.
Radio 5 took a different line, and offered on Thursday a continuous,
dramatic programme called Who Dares? Against a faint background of pop, came
a stream of admissions by young people of what they had done, how it made
them feel, where they did it. About one school child in 10 is reckoned to
try a sniff. Mums and dads spoke of their trouble in spotting anything,
experts told which solvents were used, where they were likely to be found,
and what they did to you. The same helpline number was given.
Marin Sorescu's Vlad the Impaler (Radio 3, Sunday) shows the author as a
sort of mini-Brecht. Impaling is already en vogue when the piece begins, and
the action is largely seen, or anyway discussed, by two of Prince Vlad's
victims, a Romanian and a Turk, on neighbouring stakes. Quasi-historic
events are a revolt by the pretender Dan, and the conquest of Romania by the
Turks, who sell Vlad to the Hungarians. He escapes and returns to Romania,
where the two impalees reckon from their stakes that everything is the same
only different.
Within this pattern, Vlad, sharply played by John Hurt, displays his
politics, clearly suggesting Ceausescu's. Impaling is for the people's
benefit. Tradesmen all want something for nothing, and the land is full of
beggars; what better than to lock them all in a church and burn them? In the
end, Vlad, back in charge, is thought to be 'the prince of darkness'; or
else as 'the light of Romania'. Perplexed by his inability to work things
out, he impales himself, significantly between the two thieves - but 'I'll
be back,' he says.
Richard Crane's translation includes some awful jokes, like confusing
'stakes' and 'steaks'. Sorescu's own jokes are fair - a portrait of Vlad
fades to nothing because the paints are made from Romanian soil. The date
runs from 1429 to 1476, but the language and behaviour are of today. The
impaled pair are done by Stephen McCann and Andrew Sachs, and Vlad's police
chief Papuc is Roy Hanlon. Faynia Williams is the director.
Better political satire in Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita, which on
Saturday played the second of the four parts of Brian Wright's Classic
Serial adaptation for Radio 4. The story is complex. The Devil has come to
earth in Moscow, with three assistants, one of them a giant cat, who call
him 'Messiah'. He poses as a professor of necromancy, and he is after 'the
Master', author of a book about the trial of Jesus, condemned by the
authorities. The Master is in a mental home, but his friend Margarita has a
copy of the book.
Some events seem less than relevant - the death under a tram of the
president of the Writers' Union, the proposed pantomime by some of Woland's
gang. It would make a marvellous comic strip, and I don't mean this
adversely. Daniel Massey is Woland, with no theatrical diablerie; the
Master, who has done little so far, is Michael Maloney; and Geraldine James
is a sturdy Margarita. David Hutchinson directs.

THE MEZZO Cynthia Clarey has been singing the role of Serena to much acclaim
in Covent Garden's staging of Porgy and Bess. But her appearance in the
Purcell Room on Wednesday in the South Bank's Song Series was not quite the
exhilarating experience one had hoped to hear - splendid in parts, yet
dutiful and prosaic in others.
The programming seemed miscalculated; it was designed obviously to
demonstrate Ms Clarey's versatility yet managed to submerge her engaging
personality in the process. The highlights were almost all confined to the
second, American half of the evening - a group of four spirituals, a
Sondheim encore and especially six of Copland's settings of Emily Dickinson.
Here she was able to relax a little, and allow her singing to blossom, her
tone to acquire many more interesting lights and tints, using a parlando
edge to some of her phrases with winning expressive effect. At the close she
was projecting herself with more directness than at any other time; more
Americana, perhaps the whole of the Copland set, should have been prescribed
beforehand. Instead Ms Clarey had laboured through heavyweight German song,
always cautious and only intermittently sparking into dramatic life. Haydn's
cantata Arianna a Naxos is always a dogged thing with which to begin an
evening, and even her accompanist, the usually creative Iain Burnside, made
heavy weather of his contribution. There was a hint of theatricality in the
final aria, and flair and dashing enjoyment in 'Hexenlied', the second of
two Mendelssohn songs. But in Schumann's Frauenliebe und Leben everything
was damped down again, safety was the watchword and one longed for her to
abandon caution and just to sing.

FT  21 NOV 92 / Arts: Venice celebrates Rossini / Review of 'Semiramide' at
the Fenice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Rossini arrived in Venice in December of 1822, the city's lovely opera
house, the Teatro La Fenice was 30 years old and so was Rossini. This year,
while theatres all over the world are celebrating the bicentenary of the
composer, Venice has been enjoying a double festivity, commemorating its own
200 years of musical life.
The Fenice has chosen to recall its illustrious past by presenting works
that were commissioned by the house or that had their world premieres there:
Rigoletto and The Turn of the Screw were heard earlier this year, La
traviata is coming in March. Now, as the two celebrations merge, Rossini's
Semiramide, completed in Venice and given at the Fenice on February 3, 1823,
is enjoying a successful run.
After that first Semiramide Rossini and his wife Isabella Colbran - who
created the title role - left for Paris, and the composer never wrote for an
Italian theatre again. The present revival was delayed by strikes, the
opera's production suffered some anticipatory attacks, and one of the
results of the discontent was the resignation of the artistic director John
Fisher. Finally, however, this Semiramide has opened, to a capacity house;
and the performance - four hours including one interval - was greeted by
enthusiastic applause.
As visitors to Pesaro last summer learned, an uncut performance of the opera
can be so gripping that the time passes unheeded. For his, surely
unconscious, farewell to Italian theatre, Rossini produced one of his
richest, most generous scores, an irresistible torrent of musical invention,
with golden opportunities for the singers and for the orchestra. Producer
and designer was Pier Luigi Pizzi; the production was not new, but about a
dozen years old. Pizzi, however, came to Venice to re-stage and revise it;
and, in the event, it did not seem worn or tired. It seemed, however,
perhaps dated. Its chilly, ice-cream white neo-classicism, in many respects
handsome and monumental (including a pyramid tomb echoing Canova), warred
with the empassioned intensity of the music. The kabuki-like anti-reality of
the staging - singers' faces chalky, arias aimed straight at the audience
from the purposely extended apron of the stage or even from two runways
bridging the orchestra pit. Some of the chorus, in 19th century dress, were
seated in armchairs at either side of the apron, others arrayed in stiff
costumes like chessmen.
It was a completely coherent view of the opera and, on its own terms,
successful; but the music kept contradicting it. Mariella Devia, who sang
the title role, has sometimes been criticised for being more of a singer
than an actress. Her Semiramide was a convincing contradiction of this
received opinion. Despite an unbecoming coiffure, she looked both regal and
human; the singing - even in the most complex coloratura - was never
uncharacterised. In the two grand scenes with Arsace she was, first, tender
and womanly and, finally, tragic. As would have been expected, she performed
the opera's most famous aria, 'Bel raggio', with impeccable technique and
appealing tone.
Her Arsace was to have been Marilyn Horne, whose indisposition led to her
being replaced, for the first two performances, by the Polish contralto Ewa
Podles (later the Irish mezzo Patricia Bardon will take over). Physically,
the veteran Podles suggests the late Ebe Stignani; but vocally she has very
much a personality of her own. The lower voice is big and resonant, and she
can move up to the head voice virtually seamlessly; and coloratura obviously
represents no problem for her. She was an excellent partner for Devia, and
also a strong interpreter on her own. Despite her matronly figure, she made
a convincing warrior, moving with ease and purpose, and acting - above all -
with her flexible, multicoloured voice.
The tenor Luca Canonici was miscast as Idreno; as Assur, the young bass
Carlo Colombara also had only a shaky grasp of Rossinian style, and in the
higher passages, the voice sounded strained. But it is an attractive voice,
and as the evening progressed, Colombara seemed to gain confidence. The
smaller parts were acceptably filled. Henry Lewis, the conductor, offered a
patchy reading of the overture. When it came to accompanying the singers, he
was more at home. The chorus and orchestra were not always perfectly
synchronised, but, all in all, the performance moved readily, comfortably,
never sagging.
The production could hardly have been more different from the Pesaro
Festival's, so dark and Eastern and spectacular, or from the traditional
Sequi staging for Joan Sutherland in the late 1960's, but it won the
audience and even for the hardened opera-goer, it provided not just
pleasure, but abundant food for thought.

FT  21 NOV 92 / Arts: Drama of silences and double-talk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN IT appeared last year that the New York Theatre Workshop's excellent
American premiere production of Caryl Churchill's Mad Forest, despite
excellent reviews, several Obie (Off-Broadway) Awards and a sold-out run at
the 99-seat Perry Street Theatre, was not going to find a future life in a
larger off-Broadway or Broadway theatre, many in New York's non-profit
theatre community were ready to throw in the towel. Particular
congratulations must be extended, then, to the Manhattan Theatre Club for
its last-minute rescue of Mad Forest, which is now playing at the 299-seat
City Center Theatre. Mark Wing-Davey's production has only improved in the
transfer.
Churchill developed the play, about the 1989 Romanian revolution and its
aftermath, through hands-on research in Romania with Wing-Davey and students
from London's Central School of Speech and Drama, of which Wing-Davey was
then Artistic Director. He directed the world premiere at the Central
School, which transferred to the Royal Court in 1990.
Mad Forest communicates the subtleties and complexities of a political
situation through theatrically innovative and exciting means. In the play's
silences, double-talk and misinformation, Churchill skillfully merges form
and content by making language as undependable and indeterminate to the
audience as it was to the Romanian people under Ceaucescu. The smashing of
an egg conveys all the anger and misunderstanding of a family torn apart by
political strife, and one oblique scene of blackmail belies a world of
suspiciousness and dishonesty. Wing-Davey's production is a masterwork of
understatement; Mary Mara, Mary Schultz, and Christopher McCann stand out
among the fine 11-player ensemble.
Wing-Davey, set and costume designer Marina Draghici and lighting designer
Christopher Akerlind have not only retained the claustrophobic intensity of
the Perry Street Theatre production but added new levels of meaning in their
use of the whole theatre as their playing area. Performers enter through the
theatre and deliver many of the Romanian/English phrasebook translations
which precede each scene from the aisles, lit by exposed bulbs over their
heads, drawing the audience into the play.
Akerlind uses the metaphoric potential of light and darkness to its fullest,
as when, in an otherwise dimly lit food line, the blond head of young
revolutionary Radu (Jake Weber) is caught in a shaft of light and glows
seraphically as he whispers 'Down with Ceausescu.' Draghici's set of dark,
nubbled walls which swing and slide unexpectedly to reveal gilt-laden
murals, furthers the play's themes of unreliable appearances and layered
truths.

FT  21 NOV 92 / Arts: Kings of the blues - Pop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IT IS an inspired idea
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
inspired as much by selective ticket buying among today's pop audience as
creative synergy - to present these two great Blues men on the same bill. If
BB is the acknowledged King of the Blues, Cray is everyone's choice as the
Crown Prince.
They also provide wonderfully easy critical contrasts. BB, a giant of a man,
comes on stage like a pink brocaded marquee, while Cray just rolls up his
shirt sleeves. His years on the cabaret circuit have given BB a glib, reach
out and touch, show biz act. He demands communal responses from the
audience; he has a straight man who hauls him back for manipulated encores;
at the final finale he distributes trinkets to the front row fans. Cray, in
contrast, has the personality of a Prime Minister.
And their approach to the blues also rings the changes. At 67 BB is not
playing for fame. He delicately, lazily, inter-weaves his guitar into the
noisy boisterous backing of his troupe of lively old stagers. It is unsubtle
stuff, harking back to the swing bands on the Chicago club circuit, forced
to play above raucous winers and diners. Cray in contrast, with a very
impressive band, does the business with conservatoire precision. His spare,
unadorned, discrete playing is a triumph for old fashioned musical virtues
as against the computer tech that is overwhelming pop.
Yet BB is somehow more enjoyable. He seems to visit the UK as frequently as
Atlantic depressions and sometimes gives short shrift. At Hammersmith he
took up Cray's challenge and devoted at least 15 minutes to a recreation of
the old Memphis days of the 1940s, sitting and crooning the blues, including
the classic 'The thrill is gone', as if they mattered.
Despite the black tie and tuxedo dressing it somehow got closer to the pain
of the blues than Cray's more soulful contemporary confessions of love and
betrayal in the adultery belt. Cray has rescued the blues from oblivion by
letting them sing the message of broken relationships among the socially
mobile but he misses out on the humour and earthy authenticity which BB
still recalls after almost half a century of chicken-in-the-basket dinners.

FT  21 NOV 92 / The FT Goes Shopping (10: The good times are back - Watch
snobbery is an art almost as exacting as that of watch-making
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF COURSE, if all you want to do is tell the time, then Pounds 10 should do
it nicely. You could pick up a perfectly accurate matt black little number
with a quartz movement and never have an excuse for being late again . . .
But once you pay more than that, you are buying more than a simple
time-telling device. You are buying a look, an image, an aura, an accessory,
a classic piece of craftsmanship, status, a virility symbol . . . take your
choice. Watch snobbery is as diverse, as subtle, as exclusive, as any other
sort.
In Italy, where watchology has almost become an art form, they say any
Italian waiter worth his pasta can read a bank balance from a wrist. But who
would have guessed that George Bush would wear a cheapo Timex on a fabric
strap, that John Major would sport a Pounds 700 Swiss Rado (and, if you have
not heard of Rado, you might like to know that more Swiss francs change
hands buying Rado than any other brand) or that Mr and Mrs Gorbachev and the
Pope all sport gold Day-Date Rolexes - at about Pounds 8,000 each?
If selling watches were simply about time-keeping then it would be a doddle
. . . and a lot duller. As it is, watches have joined that great band of
personal appurtenances that tell the world as much about you as you want it
to know.
Watch-buying has not come to a full stop even in this grim recession. Sales
of women's watches have fallen off - when a woman needs a pick-me-up, or
what a friend calls some 'retail therapy', she may buy a lipstick or a
designer jacket - but a chap is very likely to cheer himself up with a
watch.
Chaps have become very knowledgeable, too. At Watches of Switzerland, Tania
Foster-Brown says that they can almost spot the watch-buyer as he walks
through the door. He knows exactly what he wants and what he wants is a full
explanation of every knob, bezel, catch and fancy function the watch has to
offer. Men, it seems, do not buy on look alone - image and function count.
Today watch-buying falls into three categories. First, there is the
disposable watch, the sort you buy on impulse and wear on the beach, doing
the washing-up, looking after the children. Then there is the style-watch -
the watch that exists for what it conveys, the Tag-Heuer or Ebel for the
sportsman, the Omega or Longines for the classicist, the Dunhill or the
Gucci for the fashion-conscious. You choose your image and you take your
choice, and the price would range between Pounds 300 and Pounds 500.
Finally, there is the classic watch, the hand-crafted piece with a
mechanical movement made in Switzerland by a skilled watchmaker - Blancpain
(which survives nicely by just making a few hundred watches a year), Patek
Philippe, IWC, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Vacherin Constantin, Ulysse-Nardin. They
offer the wearer character, craftsmanship, tradition, exclusivity - and the
highest of prices.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, when Tokyo was ticking ahead producing
inexpensive, technically perfect watches, quartz models looked as if they
might largely replace mechanical movements. These days those fears have
gone, as more and more people seem to want real mechanisms. Given that even
the finest mechanical movement cannot compete with the precision of a quartz
crystal for accuracy - the best mechanical movement can be tuned to be no
more than three to four seconds out a day, whereas quartz is accurate to
within three to four seconds a month - it is yet more proof that technical
precision alone is not what watch-buying is about.
The man who rescued the Swiss watch industry and transformed the market is
Nicholas Hayek who, when he developed the low-cost, design-driven Swatch,
took on and beat the Japanese at their own game: the low-margin,
price-sensitive mass market. Until he came up with Swatch, exports of Swiss
watches and watch movements had crashed from 91m units in 1974 to just 43m
in 1983.
The supreme irony of the Swatch is that although it was meant to be cheap
and disposable, it has ended up a collectors' item, a cult product. Some of
the more esoteric designs now sell for many times their original face value
in the world's auction rooms.
More than that, Swatch changed the whole industry. It became a catalyst for
change. The first models were relatively sober and proficient, many with
plain matt black straps and classic faces, all selling at less than Pounds
20. However, SMH (producer of Swatch) quickly began to behave much more like
a fashion house and to produce two collections a year - the fact that once a
line was sold out and those models were no longer available only increased
their desirability.
Word began to get around and people rushed to buy the latest design.
Well-known artists were recruited to design them - some Swatches looked like
demented sea urchins, others sported flaky faeries, yet another was bedecked
with golden tulle, others swathed in net, embellished with crystal . . .
wild, witty and fun, they attracted attention everywhere. Today some of the
most sought-after models, such as Hocus-Pocus, the jelly-fish, and Alfred
Hofkunst's kitsch vegetables, have buyers queueing to pay huge sums for them
 -if only they can be found.
The innovation goes on. This year has seen lots of new designs, including
Vivienne Westwood's in romantic post-modernist mood (but naturally; Swatch
is never one to be left out of a trend) and - a real innovation - a fully
automatic watch for just Pounds 42.
But the remarkable thing is that the success of Swatch does not seem to have
been at the expense of the rest of the trade. Last year Swiss watch and
movement exports surpassed their 1974 peak level and the Swiss watch
industry seems back in confident form. Top-quality gold watches have ridden
out the recession more successfully than most and the fad for sports watches
has brought in lots of new customers. Today, there are watches that stand up
to all manner of macho tests - they can survive being submerged hundreds of
feet under water and come with such 'necessities' as luminous dials,
breathing-tank measuring attachments and pressure resistance to a depth of
thousands of feet. They will survive being hit on the face by a polo stick,
they have climbed Alps, crossed Tundras . . . but most are worn by those who
only battle with the office files.
Rado, too, homes in on a rugged, futuristic image - it makes much play of
the fact that its bracelets and cases are made from high-tech ceramic, said
to be rugged enough to survive a journey to the moon next time you buy a day
return.
Cults develop around certain watches which are not always easy to explain.
Anybody lucky enough, for instance, to lay their hands on a The Rolex
Daytona Chronograph (chronographs - models with built-in stop-watches - are
a current rage), would be able to sell it almost immediately for twice the
price. At Garrards they tell me some eight or ten people come in every day
asking for it, but the shop only gets one every six months.
Chronographs - awesomely chunky, aggressively functional - are one of the
huge successes of the watch market, in tune with our sports-obsessed times.
It has become the new executive toy. According to Count Franz La Rosee, the
director of The Watch Gallery: 'It is a way of saying, I'm young, fit and
healthy.'
At Tag-Heuer (formed in 1985 when Tag bought into Heuer), the only watch
company that specialises in professional sports watches, worldwide sales
increased nine times between 1985 and 1992.
Tania Foster Brown says Watches of Switzerland customers see a Tag-Heuer as
the ultimate sporting watch. 'Don't crack under pressure' is the company's
marketing line and the real skier, deep-sea diver or racing driver wants a
watch that performs.
Whereas Tag-Heuer may be the watch for the real action-man, Breitling has
captured a large slice of the lucrative market for those who merely want to
look like action-man - and woman. Many of the fashions in watches come from
Italy and a saunter down Milan's Monte Napoleone will quickly reveal that
Breitling is a sought-after name.
Alfred Dunhill, which was making pocket watches back in 1906 and by the mid
1920s was putting timepieces into lighters (the Unique), silver belt buckles
(the Reversible) and travelling cases (the Captive), seems to see two strong
trends in watches: nostalgia and sports. In time for Christmas Alfred
Dunhill will be selling a few carefully made small editions of some of these
old pieces.
Its Millennium Sports watch range is water-resistant to withstand depths of
up to 200 metres, has a strengthened case reinforced with screws on the case
back, a strong sapphire glass and luminous markings - vital, of course, to
survive the rigours of a chic metropolitan lunch.
A quieter cult watch is the Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso. Originally designed in
the 1930s for polo players whose watch-glasses kept being broken, it sports
an ingenious design with a hinge which allows the wearer to turn the watch
face over so it is protected. It is made to the same design today and, it
goes without saying, is worn by those who could not tell a polo stick from a
croquet mallet.
Finally, if you are interested in the nuances of which watches carry real
clout, you may be interested to know that when The Watch Gallery in Jermyn
Street was burgled recently only two makes were taken - Breguet and
Breitling. Patek Philippe, Jaeger-LeCoultre, IWC - all were left
ignominiously on the shelf.

FT  21 NOV 92 / The FT Goes Shopping (11): On the elusive scent of profit -
What makes a classic perfume? Lucia van der Post unbottles the secrets
behind a potent image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE PROUST and his madeleines, scent works at a powerful level in us all.
Smell is the most acute of our senses and the scent we dab on transmits as
potent an image as the clothes we wear and the make-up we apply. And for
that image women, it seems, will pay whatever it costs.
With a small bottle of fine perfume costing around Pounds 50 the price may
seem high for a bottled smell - but they are not too high if the customer
can be persuaded that she is buying a little magic.
With her head she knows that the contents of the bottle account for a small
fraction of the total cost, lost in the overall expenses of a top 'nose',
expensive packaging, glossy advertising, marketing, distribution and finally
the retail mark-up of some 45 per cent. But with her heart she is seduced.
She may not be able to afford one of Chanel's signature jackets but she can
dab herself with Chanel No. 5. Issey Miyake may be beyond her reach but
there, no further away than a crystal bottle, is a little of his genius. The
allure is compelling.
Though the market in the UK is huge and growing (worth some Pounds 330m at
wholesale) the fine fragrance people still wish that we would become more
'European' in our attitudes to scent. According to Peter Norman, managing
director of Parfums Givenchy UK, we use half as much fine fragrance as the
average French woman. Though there are some who would, perhaps unkindly,
attribute this to their apparent habit of bathing half as often, this cannot
be the whole story. Deep in our culture is the tendency still to regard
fragrance as a wanton indulgence. Our European cousins accord it a much
deeper respect, recognising its powerful psychology, seeing it as an
essential enhancer of day-to-day living, an expression of self, of style.
What everybody knows is how important perfume sales are to France's haute
couture fashion houses. Due to French accounting laws and to the fact that
some of the houses are still privately owned, just how important it is is a
not-so-well-guarded secret. All those delicious frocks float on oceans of
scent. When put together with cosmetics, they are estimated to account for
80 per cent of the revenue of most houses.
It was Coco Chanel who first explored the idea of attaching a perfume to a
designer name when she dreamed up Chanel. No. 5 back in 1925. Nobody has yet
thought of a better way of expanding the customer base, of retaining an air
of exclusivity whilst at the same time selling to thousands of women.
Today companies invest millions of dollars in the hope that they will find
the Chanel No. 5 of the day. The world's two longest lasting great classics
 -Chanel No. 5 and Guerlain's Shalimar - are each rumoured to do Pounds 50m
worth of business a year. At Chanel, where the fragrance business accounts
for 60 per cent of sales, Chanel No. 5 alone makes up for 40 per cent of
that.
Whereas 15 years ago there were about 100 fragrances to choose from, today
there are nearer 1,000. But the cost of launching them is vast and the
failure rate high. Each year sees somewhere between 50 and 100 new perfumes,
and well over half of them eventually disappear quietly from the shelves.
Only one in five has a chance of real success. But still the houses keep
trying.
Fashion in perfumes change as much as in anything else but it does not
change at whim. Like all the arts - and creating a great perfume IS an art -
it anticipates the ready unconscious. So fashions in scents change in mood
with the times.
The 1970s saw the heyday of the so-called Life-Style perfumes - remember
Charlie? Smitty? Stevie B? Jaunty, youthful, exuberant, they conjured up
visions of a newly fashionable modern woman. Today, it is hard even to
recall their names. They were seen off by the bold, racy, power perfumes of
the 1980s, the years when women wheeled and dealed with the best of them as
the consumer boom took off. Opium, Giorgio, Poison, Obsession, redolent with
imagery from the video/rock/Hollywood cultures, were the olfactory hallmarks
of the decade.
The 1990s has seen a real change. Subtlety and sophistication have taken
over from the boldly obvious. Calvin Klein, for instance, whose Obsession
claimed the provocative high ground in the 80s, launched Eternity at the
beginning of the '90s and the orgiastic writhings deemed appropriate to
convey Obsession were replaced with angelic visions of a mother and child.
Out, too, with the eighties have gone the celebrity perfumes. Cher and Omar
Sharif, Sophia Loren and Linda Evans, all tried to capitalise on their names
but most failed within a year. This week saw the announcement of the
withdrawal of the last of the survivors - Liz Taylor's Passion. But we
should not mourn their passing. It marks the end of the cynical marketing
ploy. Many were launched in tacky bottles and most smelt dreadful. It only
proved what most astute observers of the scene have always believed - that
somehow integrity, authenticity and heart do matter.
As Bernard Aloy, general manager of Nina Ricci, which in L'Air du Temps has
one of the great perfumes of all time, puts it: 'We are still family-owned
and so the house still has a family spirit. When we create a fragrance we
try to create something which we think is nice. It is still a creation, an
artistic venture. We do not believe in 'doing a marketing'.'
LVMH's launch of C'est la Vie is a vivid example of a house getting it
wrong. Christian Lacroix is a delightful man, but, as style guru Peter York
puts it: 'He was too new on the scene, too little known in the wider world,
he tried to invent his own history too fast.' It was, to be brutally
truthful, a not very attractive smell.
Louis Urvois, managing director of Loewe, which has just launched its new
fragrance, Gala, in the UK with great success (it has more than beaten its
first year budget),
believes that for a new perfume to succeed what is essential is great
coherence between the name, the packaging, the product, the advertising, and
the distribution. 'If, for instance, we had launched a perfume called Gala,
which we believe conveys evening, glamour, complexity, but which was made
with light, green notes, it would have been a great inconsistency. It could
not have succeeded.'
Coming back, and one can see why, are the great classic perfumes. Their
history is solid and intact. They offer the magic of nostalgia, visions of a
past rich with pleasures, secure in its luxuries. Lanvin's Arpege, in its
day a heady conveyor of sumptuous glamour, is being newly successful. Miss
Dior is being repackaged and relaunched. Meanwhile, Chanel No. 5., its
bottle subtly updated over the years, and Shalimar go on and on.
But also succeeding are the best of the new. The best truly capture the
spirit of the times and can do stunning business whilst their moment lasts.
In Harrods perfumery hall - a showcase for new exclusive launches - of the
ten best-sellers last year all except Chanel No. 5 were new or nearly-new.
In no particular order they were Safari by Ralph Lauren, Eternity by Calvin
Klein, Cabotine by Gres, L'Eau d'Issey from Issey Miyake, Volupte by Oscar
de la Renta, Gala by Loewe, Oleg Cassini, Escada by Margaretha Ley,
Beautiful by Estee Lauder, and, but of course, Chanel. No. 5.
But what has done most for the perfume giants is that whereas once a woman
remained faithful to her one true love, the perfume of her choice, today she
plays around, she flirts a little, trying one and then another.
Look on the fashionable woman's dressing-table today and you will find at
least three scents on top and three tucked away. She will go for light,
fresh green notes for a sporty summer week-end, a mix of tuberose and
bergamot, of musk and jasmine for her winter satins and velvets; a classic
to go with her twinset and pearls; and something crisp and not too heady for
the boardroom. And, not content with buying the perfume, today's woman
(alas, she still has to buy most of it herself) will go for the bath oils
and gels as well.
All of which explains why the cash tills are still ringing - not quite as
frenetically as they did in the consumer boom but, as Peter Norman puts it,
'holding their own in a pretty grotty retailing environment.' Certainly
enough, at any rate, to keep the big couture houses in frills and furbelows,
giving them time to reassess the future and plan their strategies for the
years ahead.
Finally, if what you are really bothered about is which is the one for you,
I leave you with the words of Karl Lagerfeld, the designer who revamped and
revitalised the Chanel label. 'There are no rules . . . it's not like a
bottle of medicine. It's all about fantasy and dreams and each woman has to
make her own.' In other words . . . choose your dream. Ultimately, Like all
the arts, it is still a mysterious business  - and one person's Poison is
another's life-long addiction.

FT  21 NOV 92 / The FT Goes Shopping (9): Conspicuous wealth is out, Grunge
(sleaze to you) is in - The fashion excesses of the 1980s must be atoned for

DURING THE 1980s, sales of luxury goods soared and the labels with
class-related cachet soared highest. Loewe's hunting collection in green
suede and brown leather, the aristocrat of huntin', shootin' and fishin'
gear, was snapped up by the upwardly mobile to be sported together with the
Barbour, the Hermes silk square with stirrup motif, the caramel and black
initialled Vuitton cases, the Gucci moccasins with horsebit trim, the
quilted Chanel handbag, the Cartier watch, the Dunhill document case and the
Porsche for town, the blond Labrador and the Range Rover for the country.
If we aspire to be what we buy, then, as Ralph Lauren and Roger Saul of
Mulberry so sharply intuited back in the 1970s, for several years many of us
wanted to be rich. We seemed to crave a lifestyle which divided its time
between the stress of the City boardroom and the tedium of competitive rural
pursuits. If we could not have what we craved, we dressed for it anyway.
But a profound change has occurred in the fashionable person's
consciousness. The psychological effects of the recession are, in the long
term, going to be more important than the simple belt-tightening dictated by
economic necessity. There is a sense, particularly among those aged between
20 and 30, of crime and punishment. The excesses of the 1980s must be atoned
for. A system which seemed to exalt greed, selfishness and the flaunting of
wealth must be rejected and replaced by something more spiritual.
Fashion is always an early indicator of shifts in cultural direction, so the
current revival of the styles of the late 1960s and early 1970s, the era of
love, peace and hippy idealism, indicates parallel preoccupations. It is,
put simply, a more outward-looking and generous mood. The squandering of
resources is over. We must save and conserve.
In the hands of Karl Lagerfeld or Ralph Lauren the look is romantically
nostalgic, but younger designers in Paris, London and New York handle it
more aggressively, applying overtones of late 1970s Punk. The most
apocalyptic version of the look, espoused last month by New York's hottest
young designers, Marc Jacobs and Christian Francis Roth, is called 'Grunge,'
after the sleaze-celebrating, anti-materialistic music movement which
started in Seattle.
'Grungy' clothes, as affected by young music fans, are ill-fitting, droopy,
decayed, inside-out, charity-shop, uncoordinated, scruffy and, ideally,
repulsively stained and malodorous. The designer version is, of course,
cleaner, co-ordinated - and pricy.
It is unlikely that 'grunge' will be embraced by the core consumers of
Vuitton, Gucci, Ferragamo, Hermes, Cartier et al, but the enormous growth in
sales which the status-defining brands enjoyed in the 1980s was fuelled by
fashion. It was fashionable to appear wealthy and an army of the
fashion-aware would break the bank to own the correct accessories, to signal
that they belonged to a club based on wealth and taste. Now, for these
people status-dressing is history. Arguably, boredom would eventually have
done for it anyway.
The traditional Vuitton travel goods, Gucci's shoes, belts and bags, Hermes
scarves and bags, Cartier watches and Chanel costume jewellery are the most
copied and counterfeited artefacts in the world. Valued initially for the
craftsmanship with which they were made, price made them exclusive and
exclusiveness made them covetable.
Such was the boom of the 1980s that, even without copies on the market, the
goods sold by Vuitton, Hermes etc themselves flooded it. 'There is a danger
of the product becoming too widely owned,' warned Jonathan Falkner, managing
director of Louis Vuitton UK, nearly two years ago. 'Then it becomes a
cliche and it loses its exclusiveness.'
The frantic expansion of the great accessory brands was triggered in 1986 by
the relaxation in France of regulations governing takeovers and mergers
which, in turn, attracted new investment. Bernard Arnault, owner of the
Christion Dior couture business, exploited the situation to acquire Celine
from its founders and owners, Richard and Celine Viplana, and then set his
sights first on Parfums Christian Dior, owned by the luxury goods
conglomerate, Moet-Hennessy, and eventually on dominating the expanded group
which, having acquired Louis Vuitton, became LVMH.
Even the public power struggle between Arnault and LVMH's Henry Racamier,
also an imaginative entrepreneur, did not appear to dissipate the products'
glamour for the consumer. Arnault's strategy was to strengthen his 'grandes
marques' by clawing back power and profits from licensees and
franchisees,strictly controlling products to which the great names were
applied. He was watched by rivals in France, Italy and Britain. All
recognised the need to protect their most important asset: their name.
Since quality, classicism and longevity were their stock in trade, they
could not, as the fashion designer does, bring out a startling new style to
supplant the old one every season. But they could expand their product
bases, spread the cachet a little wider without undermining the traditional
lines which sold so well in Japan and the rest of the Far East.
At Vuitton it is Francoise Jollant Kneebone, erstwhile director of the
Centre Pompidou and now design director at Louis Vuitton, who, in
commissioning some of the great names of design - Philippe Starck, Gae
Aulenti, Andree Putman - has created, among others, the dashing Epi range.
At Hermes, Claude Brouet fulfills the some function, as does Dawn Mello at
the dynastically strife-torn Gucci. These women are all design managers.
Jollant Kneebone was an academic, Brouet a journalist/stylist, Mello a
merchandiser, former president of Bergdorf Goodman. Their brief is to
restore to the great labels the quality which made them great: invention,
innovation and a style which expresses their present, not their past. It is
likely that surviving the recession will depend on new products rather than
on the currently discredited classic cliches.
In Britain the cash-rich Dunhill (lighters, watches, luggage, accessories,
fragrance) group has, in a shopping spree which started in the mid-1980s,
acquired Mont Blanc pens, the Hackett menswear chain and the French fashion
houses, Chloe and Karl Lagerfeld. Interim results announced this month show
a dip in profits from Pounds 80.8m to Pounds 30.1m. When the last
acquisition was made, in June this year, Lord Douro, the group's chairman,
made clear that he was putting his money on fashion rather than status - or,
at least, hedging his bets.
The more solid of the great accessory companies have always looked forward
and embraced change, maintaining their identity not in aggressive logos and
instantly recognisable forms but in reassuringly high standards of quality
and creativity. Loewe in Spain or Ferragamo in Italy are companies which
have expanded slowly, an eye always on the first principles of their
founders who were, above all, supremely innovative designers.
The late 1980s saw the creation of several pre-aged brands. Arnault himself
attempted, in Christian Lacroix, to create a couture house. Hackett, the
august-looking menswear chain now owned by Dunhill, is hardly a decade old.
In Italy, Giralmo Etro, the fabric manufacturer, turned his passion for
paisley and all things nostalgically British into a range of scarves,
shawls, ties, bags, cushions and those expensive little indispensibles known
as small leather goods which, when sold in an oak-panelled Victorian
ambiance, gave an illusion of antiquity.
As Francoise Jollant Kneebone of Vuitton says: 'A culture is its collective
memory and its artefacts are significant definers of its cultural identity.
What we made and used tells an archaeologist who we were. What we, today,
buy and use provides information about who we aspire to be and how we wish
to be perceived.'
While there are people with money to spend, they will buy and use beautiful
and clever things. What the accessory companies seen to be facing up to -
some faster than others - is that in the future different criteria are
likely to apply. Pickings will never be so rich again.

FT  21 NOV 92 / The FT Goes Shopping (8): Fountain pens make a big comeback
with the smart set - Stephen Bayley considers the merits of a small but
relatively affordable status symbol
</HEADLINE>

THE FOUNTAIN pen has never been so popular. For manufacturers, designers,
buyers, consumers and sociologists brought up with a belief in technical
progress, this is a daunting reversal.
There is no good reason why leaky, expensive, fragile and unreliable
fountain pens, temperamental ghosts from the past, should be in demand
today.
Except that people demand them. They are a sure and relatively affordable
status symbol. The choice and use of a fountain pen speaks volumes not only
for discretionary spending, but about your respect for writing.
While ten or 15 years ago you would have had to look hard in dusty
specialist stationers to satisfy a perverse whim to buy a fountain pen,
nowadays they are one of the fixed currencies in the language of luxury
goods.
In airport duty free shops, in full-page advertisements in glossy magazines
big names such as Parker, Sheaffer, Waterman and Montblanc take space and
demand attention.
Ever more expensive, ever more luxurious pens regularly appear.
Manufacturers in the US, Germany, France and Britain are trawling the
archives to find yet more obscure antique prototypes to revive. It is as if
a telecommunications expert was wanting to restore Marconi's telegraph.
History is in reverse, but why is it happening?
Memories of awful, scratchy things, delivering too much - or too little -
ink, haunt the imaginations of anyone born before 1960. For the fountain
pen, familiarity bred neglect. Those born later have never known the
miseries of a rapid disgorgement of permanent blue all the way across their
homework, and subsequently over the cuff and up the forearm.
Instead, the current generation has become flabby in its discriminations,
numbed to the niceties of handwriting and blotting paper by the mass
availability of cheap ballpoints and felt tip pens, often technically
excellent. We tend to believe that progress and technology lead to
perfection. Maybe, but the evidence is that technical perfection bores
consumers.
The technical problem with creating a pen is (a) storage of the ink and (b)
delivery of the ink and (c) the ink itself.
Broadly speaking this means: (a) external dip or internal reservoir; (b)
whether you get no ink at all, or all the ink at once and (c) does the ink
have density and dry immediately, but rot the nib, or is it thin stuff with
long-term wetness which rots the paper?
The answers to these questions involved rubber sacs, ancient valves, pistons
or levers and some of the patents which define the history of technology in
its most hucksterish phase.
Their appearance was not rapid: it was, for instance, quite a long time
after the discovery of rubber that someone developed the rubber sac.
Lewis E. Waterman's technical achievement was to develop a simple capillary
valve (comprising three extremely thin slits at the working end of the
barrel interior) which allowed air to enter the reservoir as the ink
escaped, obviating rushing blobs, scratches, and facilitating easy
handwriting.
Waterman, of New York, was followed as a pioneer of the popular fountain pen
by George S. Parker of Janesville, Wisconsin, whose Duofold of 1921 was a
breakthrough in product design.
In 1937 Parker introduced the '51' to celebrate the company's 51st birthday.
Technically, it evolved from the Parker Company's experiments with
fast-drying inks. Eventually, the '51', a masterpiece of streamlined
styling, became a totem of the industrial design movement. The popular
appeal of the '51' brought production into the millions every year but, just
as the fountain pen appeared to reach its apotheosis, it was sabotaged by
two fundamental developments in the proletarianisation of the pen - the
ball-point and the felt-tip.
In 1943 a Hungarian called Lasso Biro, working in Argentina, patented a
design for a ball-point pen with quick drying ink which did not blot. By
1945 it was being manufactured in Europe. Crucially, by 1953, a Frenchman
called Marcel Bich made it disposable.
When he dropped his 'h' Bic became synonymous with ball-point. In a similar
mood of post-War endeavour in 1946, a Japanese called Yokio Horie founded a
company called Pentel (a Japanese-English word combining the sense of pencil
and pastel). Pentel's innovation was to adapt traditional Japanese practice
to industrial production. Using the principles of bamboo-based techniques
(where the fibrous core soaked up and delivered the ink to a chiselled point
by osmotic pressure), Pentel Introduced the felt-tip marker in 1960. In 1963
came the sign pen and in, 1970 came the famous green-barrelled R50 roller
ball. And all the rest was graffiti.
Of all new technology, mass-produced, inexpensive pens, the R50 Ball Pentel,
has been outstanding. It replaced the Bic as the universal, global writing
instrument. It seemed another example of Japanese ingenuity taking advantage
of Western complacency.
At about the same time as the bright green Pentel (about 50p) was becoming
ubiquitous, the fat, shiny expensive Montblanc Meisterstuck (two to three
hundred times more expensive) was becoming familiar in well-heeled pockets.
The massive, reactionary, archaic, intensely desirable Montblanc is the
paradigm of the pen, not as a functional tool, but as luxury product.
Luxury is the opposite of function, which is not to say it lacks utility. It
is a marvellous testament to our civilisation that a functionally perfect
pen can be bought for a matter of pence. But that is the problem. The
consumer is capricious. As soon as his basic needs are satisfied, he seeks
more obscure appetites to grafify.
Bored with sterile perfection, he wants the unpredictable. An individual's
pen has always been an expression of self-esteem because the act of writing
is so intensely personal. Our own word 'style' derives from the Latin
stylus. Lewis E. Waterman recognised this: his great commercial innovation
was to sit in a New York shop window demonstrating his pens to a sceptical
public. Consumers are once again enjoying the same sense of showmanship.
The massive interest in fountain pens is not simply a taste for nostalgia,
although for the time being this may be the expression favoured by most
manufacturers with their evocative lacquers, finishes and names.
It is also an expression of a growing interest in the process of owning and
using everyday things, of taking serious pleasure in small details. People
who want to own a decent fountain pen want to do it right, whichever way you
spell it.
