FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: York Waterworks rises to Pounds 1.28m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
York Waterworks raised pre-tax profit from Pounds 1.17m to Pounds 1.28m in
the six months ended September 30 1992, and is lifting the interim dividend
from 2.8p to 3.05p.
Turnover rose from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 3.66m principally as a result of
the April tariff increase. Sales by meter had not been affected by the
depressed economy, but the growth in domestic sales slowed because of the
reduction in housebuilding.
Earnings per share came to 13.9p (12.3p).

FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Sheriff shares rise on doubled profits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Sheriff Holdings, the USM-quoted plant hire group, rose 10p to 68p
following the announcement of more than doubled pre-tax profits in the year
to September 30 and the raising of Pounds 2.85m net by subscription and open
offer.
Mr Richard Dunn, chairman, said that the result, up from a depressed Pounds
312,000 to Pounds 686,000, was achieved with strong contributions from the
core business and acquisitions made during the year.
Cash generation reduced gearing from 85 per cent following the acquisition
of Abelson in December last year to 48 per cent at the end of the year.
To assist further acquisitions, The Causeway Smaller Quoted Companies Fund
has subscribed for almost 4m shares at 75p. There is an open offer to
shareholders on a 8-for-13 basis.
Causeway could have a maximum holding of 38 per cent but the requirement to
make a full offer has been waived by the Takeover Panel.
Turnover improved 15 per cent to Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 9.15m). The pre-tax
figure was struck after interest charges of Pounds 312,000 (Pounds 212,000).
Earnings per share were 6.7p (3.4p) and a final dividend of 1p is
recommended for a total of 2p (1.5p).

FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Early Xmas orders lift Filofax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SIGNIFICANT increase in sales and improved gross margins lifted Filofax
Group in the six months to September 30 1992.
Turnover rose to Pounds 6.18m (Pounds 4.81m) and pre-tax profit to Pounds
950,000 (Pounds 274,000). Mindful of that success and confident of strong
trading through Christmas, directors declared an interim dividend of 0.5p.
Mr Robin Field, chief executive, said the sales growth was assisted by
retailers worldwide ordering for Christmas earlier than they did previously.
There had also been a significant contribution from mid-year products
launched specifically to counter the market seasonality of the business.
Growth in the US continued to be encouraging and, dependent on the level of
the dollar, 1992 might see sales there exceed those in the UK for the first
time.
Earnings per share were 4.3p (1.5p). For the previous 15 months to March 31
1992 there was a single dividend of 0.5p.

FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Hogg Robinson slips to Pounds 10m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOGG ROBINSON, the travel, transport and financial services group,
experienced a slight fall in interim profits reflecting weakness in the
business and leisure travel markets.
Pre-tax profits slipped from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 10.1m in the six months
to September 30. Turnover increased 10 per cent to Pounds 57.1m helped by
acquisitions.
'In the circumstances, this is a pretty good set of results,' said Mr Chris
Brown, finance director.
Operating profits from travel fell from Pounds 5.53m to Pounds 4.34m.
Business travel, which accounts for about 60 per cent of the division's
turnover, was affected by the recession and companies' tight control of
travel budgets.
The transport division, which covers commercial freight operations in Europe
and the Falklands, increased profits 50 per cent to Pounds 3.17m.
Net cash fell Pounds 1m to Pounds 28m and interest earnings were lower at
Pounds 1.16m (Pounds 1.81m).
Earnings fell to 9.35p (10.03p) but the interim dividend is increased to
2.6p (2.5p).
COMMENT
Times obviously remain tough in travel. While price cutting on the high
street grabs the headlines, the downturn in corporate travel budgets -
initiated ahead of the Gulf war - is more damaging. Business travel will
also be affected by sterling's fall in value. Companies will have another
reason to stop executives upgrading to business class. But Hogg's
performance elsewhere was encouraging, especially at Dens, giving grounds
for optimism in the longer term. Before then, Hogg is looking to spend some
of its cash pile on acquisitions, probably in the travel division. Full year
forecasts of Pounds 15m put the shares on just over 12 times, suggesting
there is room for growth once consumer and corporate confidence returns to
the travel market.

SHIRES Investment reported net asset value of 203p per share at the end of
the half year to September 30, against 225.8p at March 31.
The fully diluted figure was 201.6p (219.6p).
Earnings per share were 8.5p (9.59p) basic and 8.26p (9.04p) fully diluted.
A second interim dividend of 4.2p brings the total so far to 8.3p, the same
as at the comparable stage last year.
The company has paid Pounds 5.24m for a 41.83 per cent stake in Shirescot,
an investment trust launched in August. In turn Shirescot paid Shires Pounds
4.5m for a portfolio of listed smaller company investments.
The company's share of Shirescot's results has not been included in these
results as the contribution is for such a short period.

FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Barrett brothers lead Pounds 15m buy-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CORE businesses of Henry Barrett Group, the Bradford-based company which
went into receivership last week, have been sold in a management buy-out
worth Pounds 15m.
A new company, Barrett Steels, has acquired the group's steel stockholding
and steel buildings businesses, employing 450 people and still trading
profitably, with a combined annual turnover of Pounds 62m.
Mr James Barrett and his brother, Richard, members of the group's founding
family, will lead the buy-out, which has been backed by Granville
Development Capital and Apax Partners.
The team is paying the receivers, Grant Thornton, Pounds 12m. The new
company has been financed by Pounds 6m equity, Pounds 6m in term loans and a
Pounds 3m working capital facility.
Mr Allan Griffiths, one of the receivers, said that as well as paying the
purchase price, the new company would assume about Pounds 17m of the parent
group's total debts of Pounds 40m-Pounds 45m.
Mr Griffiths said it was an unusual situation, in that talks regarding sales
of the two businesses were well advanced when the receivers arrived, keeping
the companies out of receivership.
The two companies had been extensively marketed over the summer and received
several bids, of which the existing management's was the highest. The
receivers soon hope to sell Lindapter, the group's special fastenings
company, which was also kept out of receivership.
Touche Ross in Leeds acted as lead financial advisers to the management and
Simpson Curtis were legal advisers. KPMG Peat Marwick gave financial advice
to the investors and Evershed Hepworth and Chadwick were legal advisers.
Henry Barrett was floated in 1987 and undertook an aggressive
diversification policy to reduce its dependence on steel. The buy-out team
said the parent company's financial difficulties were due largely to the
underperformance of these acquisitions.

FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: ACT rise falls short of estimates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACT, the acquisitive computing services company, announced interim pre-tax
profits of Pounds 9.54m, up 25 per cent on last time but at the lower end of
City expectations.
The shares fell 9p to 146p.
Turnover rose 37 per cent to Pounds 72.1m (Pounds 52.6m) in the six months
to September 30. Earnings per share, however, were only 4 per cent ahead at
5.34p, reflecting the acquisition strategy. The interim dividend is raised
to 1.75p (1.5p). Cash balances stood at Pounds 21.3m.
The outstanding performer among the new acquisitions was Kindle, the Irish
financial software house, which turned in a profit contribution before tax
of Pounds 4.2m.
The figure ensures that Kindle's directors will be paid an earn-out fee of
Pounds 5.5m.
Mr Roger Foster, ACT chairman, said the earn-out payment meant the company
had been acquired on a p/e of about 6.2: 'It looks like the most outstanding
acquisition we have done'.
On the debit side, two of ACT's previously profitable divisions both lost
money in the first half.
Medisys, which provides financial systems, lost Pounds 150,000 chiefly
because of uncertainty among trust hospitals over the general election
result.
Logsys - whose customers are principally central government departments -
lost Pounds 800,000 during its transformation from computer hardware
supplier to systems integrator. Both divisions now operate profitably, Mr
Foster said.
The acquisition of NMW Computers, which would enhance ACT's strength in
stock processing and delivering and give cost savings in data processing,
has been delayed while the Office of Fair Trading considers ACT's market
share in stock processing. Mr Foster said he was confident the deal would go
through.

FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Cater Allen gets benefit from lower UK
rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CATER ALLEN yesterday became the latest discount house group to announce
strong profits on the back of falling UK interest rates, though it continued
to refuse to comment on whether it is discussing a takeover of rival Union
Discount.
Outlining the group's plans, Mr James Barclay, chairman, said: 'We're in the
business of building on what we've already got . . . We don't want to
over-diversify.'
Ill-judged diversification into leasing and property in the 1980s has
brought losses at Union Discount, culminating in news on Wednesday that it
is discussing a possible takeover.
Mr Barclay refused to be drawn on whether absorbing a rival discount house
would meet his objective of strengthening Cater's existing businesses. He
added: 'If Union Discount disappears, it would be a disappointment to me.'
Cater did not publish figures for the six months to the end of October, but
said that its discount house, stock lending and Jersey businesses had
'performed particularly well.' Also, futures broking is reported to have
improved and to have shown a profit. Losses on the group's business at
Lloyd's, where it operates both as a managing agent and a members' agent,
were larger than in the first half of last year.
Mr Barclay said the group had not made large profits when sterling sank out
of the ERM in September, but that discount houses always did well when
interest rates were falling - a factor which had made November a good month
so far, as UK base rates fell again last week.
Cater is raising the interim dividend by 1p to 7p, though Mr Barclay said
this did not indicate it was planning to lift its final dividend as well.

<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRITCHLEY, the maker of electrical cable accessories, will begin trading
next Thursday with a market capitalisation of Pounds 25.4m.
SG Warburg Securities, the company's adviser, said yesterday it had placed
6.7m shares at 220p with a number of institutions and with some brokers for
private clients.
The issue will raise Pounds 14.7m and leave Critchley with net cash of about
Pounds 3m.
The pricing puts the group on a substantial discount to Bowthorpe and Volex,
companies with which it is sometimes compared with.
Critchley will come to the market at 14.4 times historic earnings, while on
prospective earnings of 18p per share.
The shares will start with a multiple of 12.3.
This is based on forecasts of Pounds 2.8m pre-tax profits for the year.
The dividend yield, based on a notional net dividend, is 3.7 per cent.

FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Blue Circle cement cuts please City -
Capacity to be cut by a sixth in response to fall in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLUE CIRCLE Industries warned yesterday that the cost of closing down a
sixth of its UK cement capacity would reduce its operating profits this year
by Pounds 58m. More than 500 jobs are to be axed.
However, the company repeated its pledge to maintain total dividends at
11.25p for the year to December 31.
The move, in response to a big fall in demand for cement from the
construction industry, was welcomed by brokers and the shares rose 2p to
close at 177p.
The group said that the Pounds 58m closure provisions and a Pounds 20m UK
property loss this year would be offset at the operating profit level by net
sale proceeds of Pounds 44m, mostly from the disposal of the South African
building materials business.
Previously the sale proceeds would have been included below the line. Blue
Circle said that the changed treatment was required under the new FRS 3
accounting standard introduced by the Accounting Standards Board at end of
last month.
Brokers, following the announcement, reduced their forecasts for pre-tax
profits this year from between Pounds 100m and Pounds 115m to between Pounds
60m and Pounds 80m.
Mr Keith Orrell-Jones, managing director, said the company planned to reduce
its UK cement manufacturing capacity by 1.2m tonnes to 6.7m tonnes. It
intends to close one kiln and mothball another at its Northfleet Works in
Kent. This would leave just one kiln working at the plant compared with six
kilns 20 years ago.
The company is also closing 13 of its 23 UK cement distribution depots. It
said that a total of 550 jobs would be lost, representing about a fifth of
its current UK cement workforce.
Most of the jobs were expected to go through compulsory redundancy and would
affect management as well as blue collar staff. Approaching half of the
provision would be used to meet redundancy costs.
Blue Circle, which produces about half of all the cement sold in the UK,
blamed the recession in the construction industry for the cutbacks.
Mr Orrell-Jones said that construction output would not climb back to
previous levels even when the market recovered.
Annual sales by UK cement manufacturers since 1989 had fallen by a third
from 17.5m tonnes to a little less than 12m tonnes this year. This compared
with an industry capacity, before the latest reduction, of more than 14m
tonnes.
Mr Orrell-Jones said that the benefits of the rationalisation would start to
show through in improved profits within a year of it being implemented.

FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Pressure on British Gas pay-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, reiterated yesterday the
company's policy to increase the pay-out but warned it was under pressure.
'Clearly with the threat to the gas business and the more cyclical nature of
exploration and production earnings, we may have to assess it.'
Analysts believe, however, it may be forced to revise its policy of
increasing its dividend in line with inflation if it continues to confront
rising competition and lower prices for domestic gas sales.
They forecast that the dividend will remain flat for the next five years as
it the company witnesses the erosion of its UK gas business.
Mr Steve Turner, energy analyst at Smith New Court, believes dividend growth
will be below earnings in the medium term, which he expects to be
'pedestrian.'
Turnover improved to Pounds 1.41bn (Pounds 1.34bn) for the third quarter; UK
gas supply contributed Pounds 1.04bn (Pounds 966m) with a reduced operating
loss of Pounds 214m (Pounds 260m).
Exploration and production turnover fell slightly to Pounds 122m (Pounds
129m) with operating losses down from Pounds 29m to Pounds 18m.
Turnover for nine months amounted to Pounds 6.92bn (Pounds 7.22bn).
Losses for the third quarter worked through at 4.4p (4.9p) per share;
earnings per share for the nine months were 10.4p (16p).
COMMENT
British Gas is asking shareholders to be patient while the company undergoes
a wide-ranging review by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which is
unlikely to be completed before next summer. Until it knows the results of
the inquiry, the company says it is difficult to plan ahead or institute any
sizeable cost-cutting. The shares are offering a yield premium of about 40
per cent over the rest of the market and shareholders may expect to realise
value if the MMC forces the company to break itself up. But dividend growth
could be threatened by the continuing pressure on the company's UK business.
Although profit forecasts range widely, there is a common feeling among
analysts that British Gas will lag the market once the economy starts to
come out of recession.

FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Mirror shares continue climb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Mirror Group Newspapers continued its rise yesterday  -
up 5p on the day to 84p - amid growing City enthusiasm for the management
changes that ushered Mr David Montgomery in as chief executive.
It is believed that more than 4m shares changed hands. The main boost
appears to have come from hopes that a cheaper way can be found to modernise
printing operations at the Daily Record and Sunday Mail, MGN's Scottish
titles. Earlier this year the board agreed to a Pounds 70m investment to
install new colour printing presses, stored for some time in a disused bus
garage in Glasgow due to lack of funds.
Mr Montgomery said last night: 'Everything is being reviewed. We have got to
look at absolutely everything. Clearly there have been some hard decisions
about tidying up the business and people have never had to cope with that in
this company before. I sense that they are looking forward to it.'
Meanwhile, Mr John Talbot of Arthur Andersen, the administrator of Robert
Maxwell Holdings, which holds 54 per cent of shares in MGN, revealed that he
 -rather than the banks - was the prime mover behind the management changes.
Immediately following the death of Mr Maxwell, Mr Talbot decided to
strengthen management.
'I gradually formed that view and the chairman (Sir Robert Clark) also
formed that view,' said Mr Talbot, adding that it is his duty to maximise
the value of shares not just for the banks but for all creditors.
Mr Talbot and Sir Robert felt new management would more likely take radical
measures to cut costs and increase profitability than the existing team.
Talks have been held between Mr Montgomery and Lord Hollick, chief executive
of MAI, about the possibility of a takeover. They continued after the
administrator ruled out an early sale.

<TEXT>
WASSALL, the mini-conglomerate run by former Hanson executives, expects its
gearing to rise to above 50 per cent if it wins its Pounds 94.3m hostile bid
for Evode, the chemical and plastics group.
Although its intends to finance the offer through a rights issue, which will

(Pounds 28.4m) for Evode's unlisted redeemable preference shares.
Wassall has offered 80p in cash for every Evode ordinary share, valuing the
ordinary capital at Pounds 58.2m. There is a share alternative on the basis
of one Wassall ordinary for every 180p being paid to a maximum of 16.2m
shares.
The preference shares are held by US West, one of the US 'baby Bell'
telecommunication companies and GE Capital, an investment subsidiary of
General Electric, the diversified US holding company.
The two companies have the right to ask for immediate repayment on a change
of Evode's ownership.
Mr Christopher Miller, Wassall's chief executive, said that since the
unlisted preference shares have a high coupon of 13 per cent, US West and GE
Capital may not want to force repayment. The shares can be redeemed from
1996.
Nonetheless, Wassall has 'facilities in place' to repay the Dollars 43m if
it wins control of Evode. It also estimates that Evode has bank debt of
about Pounds 35m.
Mr Andrew Simon, Evode's chairman, would not disclose the company's debt,
but said it had substantial borrowing facilities which were more than enough
to fund its needs.
Mr Miller retorted: 'Is it prudent for Evode to be borrowing more. How will
they repay that debt?'
Mr Simon said: 'I take grave exception that Wassall made no effort to
contact me before the morning of the offer and then did not even ask for a
meeting.'

FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Rodime in profit with Dollars 1.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RODIME, the disk drive pioneer which now concentrates on licensing its
technology, has made its first pre-tax profit since its heyday in 1985.
It also said that on Wednesday it began litigation against Seagate
Technology of the US, one of the world's leading disk drive makers, for
'continuing wilful patent infringement' and unfair competition.
Rodime made a pre-tax profit of Dollars 1.69m (Pounds 1.11m) in the year to
September 30, against a restated pre-tax loss of Dollars 22.4m in 1991. Net
profit per share was 0.8 cents (16 cents loss).
Operating income fell from Dollars 12.4m to Dollars 8.68m. But provisions
for investments and liabilities of subsidiaries fell from Dollars 28.2m to
Dollars 0.66m. Interest took Dollars 1.7m (Dollars 2.8m).
Bank debt fell by Dollars 14.5m, but the balance sheet at September 30 still
showed net liabilities of Dollars 25.68m (Dollars 26.8m).
Shares in the Scotland-based company were relisted this August at 2 1/2 p
after a year-long suspension. In recent weeks they have climbed to 7 1/2 p
and yesterday closed unchanged at the same price.
Rodime said it was disappointed with progress in licensing talks with
'several large disk drive producers.'
It wanted negotiated agreements, but would initiate further patent
infringement actions if necessary.
Rodime has recovered Dollars 12.9m of the Dollars 16.9m it hoped to raise
from asset disposals.

FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: ICI may be forced to postpone Zeneca move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK's biggest manufacturing company, may be
forced to postpone the demerger of Zeneca, its bioscience business, broker
Smith New Court said yesterday.
It also warned that ICI might need to reappraise its dividend policy because
of poor trading conditions.
In the first detailed analysis of the proposed demerger of ICI's
pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and specialities businesses, Mr Charles
Lambert, chemicals analyst, valued the separate businesses at 950p per
share. On current conditions ICI was worth 350p and Zeneca 600p.
The group would have to put most of its debt into Zeneca so the new ICI
could generate sufficient cash flow to ensure its dividend.
A share issue by Zeneca to clear the debt was a pre-requisite for the
separation, Mr Lambert said. He thought this was most likely to be on a
1-for-4 basis, raising Pounds 1bn.
A demerged ICI had massive scope for recovery, said Mr Lambert. He reckoned
that the group would generate pre-tax profits of Pounds 643m in 1995,
against an estimated Pounds 147m this year.
However, he warned that market conditions suggested the new ICI's dividend
would be uncovered in 1993, posing a real problem for the demerger's timing.
The report predicts that Zeneca's pre-tax profits would increase from Pounds
428m this year to Pounds 712m in 1995. However, Zeneca's pharmaceuticals
business, which generates 75 per cent of its turnover, has a mature product
portfolio. Its pipeline of new products was described as 'somewhat
lacklustre' and weighted towards the second half of the decade.
The pharmaceuticals division's turnover could increase from Pounds 1.59bn
last year to Pounds 2.24bn by 1995 and trading profits from Pounds 538m to
Pounds 648m.
Sales of Tenormin, Zeneca's best-selling heart drug, are forecast to fall
from Pounds 652m last year to Pounds 411 by 1995. SmithKline Beecham, the
Anglo-American pharmaceuticals and consumer products group, yesterday
acquired ICI's world-wide Corsodyl business for an undisclosed sum.

FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Storehouse returns to black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG SALES growth and higher gross margins returned Storehouse to profit
in the 28 weeks to October 10.
The slimmed-down group, which includes the BhS and Mothercare chains, made a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.1m, a Pounds 17m turnround from the Pounds 13.9m
loss in the previous first half.
Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman, said: 'We remain confident that our underlying
trading performance will show a significant improvement for the year as a
whole'.
The profit news surprised the stock market, which had been expecting a
break-even position, and pushed the shares higher. They settled back to show
a 1p gain on the day at 186p. The share price has risen from a low of 85p
last December.
Mr David Dworkin, chief executive, said Storehouse had been transformed from
a financial holding company to a focused retailer. Trading conditions were
still tough, but Storehouse could now achieve 'real and consistent growth.'
Group sales rose from Pounds 573m to Pounds 617m. Sales in the two main
chains rose by 10 per cent on a comparable store basis, without any help
from price increases. BhS made an operating profit of Pounds 10.5m, against
a Pounds 7m loss previously, while Mothercare turned a Pounds 2.9m deficit
into Pounds 1.7m profit.
The results were held back by losses of Pounds 7.8m from Richards, Habitat
and Blazer. The first two chains have since been sold and the disposal of
Blazer is planned.
Associate income fell to Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 2.6m) due to the timing of
sales in the property joint venture. Mr Dworkin said the associate
contribution for the year should match last time's Pounds 4.9m.
Interest took Pounds 3.1m, against a Pounds 600,000 gain previously. But the
group is due to receive cash totalling Pounds 100m from the Richards and
Habitat disposals, which should give it net cash by the year end.
At the half-year stage net debt stood at Pounds 80.5m (Pounds 82m), although
this is a seasonal peak for borrowings in the run up to Christmas.
There was a net charge below the line of Pounds 20.4m relating to the
disposals, and after a maintained interim dividend of 2.5p, there was a net
loss of Pounds 27m. Earnings per share were 0.5p (2.3p deficit).
COMMENT
The Storehouse recovery is well and truly underway. There is now a momentum
to sales which should carry on even as BhS comes up against tougher
comparisons. Margin improvements may slow as the emphasis on value-for-money
increases, though the reduction in mark downs is encouraging. Much of the
immediate recovery is in the share price. With forecasts of Pounds 40m
pre-tax for the current year (against Pounds 15.8m) and perhaps Pounds 65m
next, the prospective p/e is up with events at about 28, falling to 17. But
the longer term potential is clear in the poor job BhS is still doing in
many departments, while Mothercare is two years behind BhS in its
revitalisation.

<TEXT>
TOUCHE ROSS, the account-ancy firm, yesterday launched a Pounds 6.5m offer
for Praxis, the software development company, and claimed irrevocable
undertakings from directors and some shareholders speaking for 74 per cent
of the equity, writes Andrew Jack.
The offer document sent to shareholders yesterday sets a price of Pounds
1.1255 per share and a related consideration for all options under the
company's share save scheme.
Mr John Connolly, Touche Ross London managing partner, said the acquisition
would boost the firm's aim of increasing consulting revenues from 16 per
cent to 20 per cent, and strengthen its ability to develop software for
clients.
He said Praxis would continue to work as a 'stand-alone division' and
continue to operate as a company. The acquisition was being funded using
'internal finance.'

FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: CE Heath cuts dividend after decline to
Pounds 8.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CE HEATH, the insurance broker, has cut its interim dividend after
announcing a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 8.9m for
the six months to September 30 1992.
The group was badly affected by the weakness of the dollar earlier this
year, low interest rates and recession in the UK, which depressed demand for
commercial insurance, explained Mr Michael Kier, chairman.
Earnings per share were 7.6p compared with 12.1p.
The interim dividend is reduced to 5p, compared with 7.5p last time.
Mr Kier said the 'prudence dictated that the group pays a dividend which it
can sustain from its operating cash flow.'
He said the final dividend will not be less than 11p, making a total of 16p.
Income from brokerage fees and commissions rose to Pounds 51.2m (Pounds
46.1m), an increase of 11 per cent.
Computer services generated income of Pounds 20.6m (Pounds 18.7m). But
expenses were also higher at Pounds 74.2m and investment and other income
fell to Pounds 7m (Pounds 7.7m).
Mr Kier said London market non-marine broking, as well as UK corporate risks
and wholesale operations had performed well, although lower business volumes
had held back growth of UK retail operations.
He attributed the higher expenses to the cost of starting new broking
operations, such as the group's US wholesale network, and the costs of new
head office accommodation at Houndsditch.
Currency movements cost the group Pounds 1.2m.
After adjusting for these factors brokerage increased by 14 per cent in
underlying terms.
Profit from underwriting amounted to Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 6.9m).
COMMENT
After briefly dipping in early trading, Heath's share price rose sharply
yesterday to close at 308p, a response indicating that investors had already
anticipated a cut in the dividend. The markets appear to be impressed by
management's determined focus on the core broking business, whose prospects
seem reasonably good, especially now that exchange rates are moving in the
group's favour. Nevertheless the UK recession, lower interest rates and the
tightness of international reinsurance markets could dampen brokerage
growth, while underlying continuing exposure to aviation liability claims
via its Australian underwriting subsidiary, is also perceived as risk. Even
so, the group is well on the way to recording full-year pre-tax profits of
at least Pounds 24m and earnings per share of about 22p. On yesterday's
closing price that gives a prospective p/e of 14.
Heath seems relatively good value, especially in comparison to its bigger
rivals, Willis and Sedgwick, both of which are on ratings of over 17.

FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Blagden shares fall 59p after warning on
core activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Blagden Industries, the packaging and chemicals group, plunged 59p
to 144p yesterday after the company warned that its core packaging division
would be hit in the second half.
Group pre-tax profit for the full year was 'now expected to be significantly
lower than the Pounds 11m achieved in 1991.'
The balance sheet remained strong and trading at the chemical and protective
equipment divisions had held up well. All product areas remained profitable,
Blagden said.
The warning comes only three months after profit increases across the board
were reported at the interim stage. Pre-tax profits for the six months to
June 28 rose 11 per cent to Pounds 6m.
Mr Lance Levine, finance director, said a very poor September and October
had followed a poor July and August, two months from which the company never
drew any conclusions.
'Trading profits in the group's packaging division, particularly in the UK
and Germany, have increasingly been severely affected by the deepening
recession.'
In the past, Blagden's high exposure to continental Europe had sheltered it
from the downturn in the UK. 'What is being seen is a deterioration in the
European markets in general,' Mr Levine said.
Because packaging was a business with high fixed costs, the 15 per cent drop
in volumes had a significant impact, Mr Levine said. Packaging accounts for
about 70 per cent of group sales and more of its profits.
The group had bucked the market trend in the first half and had been hit by
recession particularly late in the cycle.

FT  20 NOV 92 / British Gas hit by competition and prices cap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS showed yesterday how far it is coming under pressure from
increased competition and a cap on domestic gas prices when it reported a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 282m for the third quarter which was higher than many
in the City had expected.
Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive, said he was disappointed with
the results: 'What they demonstrate is the squeeze we're in is continuing.'
In the same period last year, warmer-than-normal weather had led to a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 318m on an historic cost basis. The effects of colder
weather this year have been more than offset by price controls and rising
competition in the industrial gas market.
The company said that 42 per cent of the firm contract market for gas -
about half of the entire industrial market - is now supplied by rivals.
British Gas has been forced to lower its prices to domestic gas consumers
twice by pressure from the regulator.
In the first nine months of the year, profits slipped to Pounds 633m from
Pounds 989m in the previous year. Analysts have cut forecasts for full-year
earnings to Pounds 850m-Pounds 950m, against Pounds 1.2bn last year.
Mr Brown said he recognised the need to reduce costs, in an attempt to
offset pressure from competition and lower prices, but was unable to make
sweeping cutbacks or initiate any big restructuring before hearing the
results of an inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission into British
Gas's business.
British Gas took the unprecedented step of submitting itself to an MMC
inquiry in July after it became frustrated with its regulator. The MMC
review has shrouded the company's entire UK business in uncertainty.
The company is looking to its exploration and production business for future
growth, although it has retreated from its goal of achieving 40 per cent of
its profits from this division by the end of the decade. 'We want to achieve
a better balance between the businesses', said Mr Brown, 'and our main drive
is to convert proven reserves into production which will start generating
earnings.'
Nevertheless, the company has cut capital expenditure from Pounds 2.8bn this
year to Pounds 2bn in an effort to control costs. Its shares were little
changed yesterday, edging up from 279p to 279.5p.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Growth of Mercury helps lift Cable and Wireless profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABLE and Wireless, the international telecommunications group, reported an
8 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of
September on the back of a strong performance by its UK subsidiary Mercury
Communications.
Group profits rose to Pounds 378m from Pounds 351m while turnover increased
to Pounds 1.74bn from Pounds 1.57bn.
Mercury's trading profit rose 36 per cent from Pounds 69m to Pounds 94m
while turnover grew 29 per cent from Pounds 439m to Pounds 567m. This was
largely because market share increased at the expense of its main rival
British Telecommunications.
Lord Young, C and W chairman, also revealed yesterday that the group would
be interested in establishing a 'trans-border Mercury' in mainland Europe if
the European Commission opens up the region's largely monopolistic
telecommunications market.
'Telephone prices in Europe are far higher than those in the UK, so you
instinctively know there is a (business) case', said Lord Young.
Mercury carried a daily average of 9.7m calls during the period, a 52 per
cent increase compared with the same period last year. At the end of
September Mercury had an order base of 897,000 lines, 39 per cent more than
last year.
Mr Mike Harris, Mercury's chief executive, was bullish about the future
following Mercury's alliance last week with BCE, the Canadian
telecommunications group.
He predicted that price competition would continue to be vigorous but not to
the same extent as last year when BT cut its international prices by 10 per
cent.
Mercury is also hoping to boost its share of the residential market with the
introduction of 'easy access', which will make it simpler for customers with
BT lines to use Mercury's long-distance service.
Other parts of C and W grew less strongly. Trading profits for the Asia and
Pacific region, made up largely of Hong Kong Telecom, grew 5 per cent to
Pounds 251m from Pounds 240m.
Earnings per share increased 4 per cent to 18p from 17.3p and the dividend
rose 12 per cent from 4.25p to 4.75p. C and W's shares closed up 10p at
652p.

WALT DISNEY yesterday posted a 29 per cent improvement in fourth-quarter net
income to Dollars 223.7m (Pounds 150m), on revenues which rose 21 per cent
to Dollars 2.08bn, writes Karen Zagor in New York. A year earlier, Disney
had net earnings of Dollars 174.1m. For the full year, Disney had net income
of Dollars 816.7m, up from Dollars 636.6m. In contrast to Euro Disney,
operating income from Disney's domestic theme parks and resorts soared 44
per cent in the quarter to Dollars 213.9m on revenues which rose 26 per cent
to Dollars 996.2m. For the year, operating income and revenues rose 18 per
cent, to Dollars 644m and Dollars 3.31bn respectively.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Euro Disney loses FFr188m but will pay a dividend: Alice
Rawsthorn analyses the first published annual figures since opening of
French theme park
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EURO DISNEY, which has been clouded by controversy ever since opening its
lavish Euro Disneyland theme park in April, yesterday confirmed analysts'
gloomy forecasts by reporting a loss for its last financial year.
The results, the first annual figures to be published since Euro
Disneyland's launch, reveal a loss of FFr188m (Pounds 23m) on overall
revenue of FFr8.46bn for the year ended September, which includes nearly six
months of the park's operation, against net profits of FFr248.7m in the
previous year.
The immediate outlook is little better. Euro Disney warned of further losses
for this year. Euro Disney has long since lost its star status on the stock
market and the investment community's expectations of it are at a low.
Its shares, which soared to a peak of FFr164 before the opening of the theme
park, yesterday fell FFr5 to FFr68.
Analysts had been bracing themselves for far heavier losses. The news that
Euro Disney plans to pay a dividend - albeit a token FFr1 - was
well-received, as was the announcement that it has reached agreement with
Disney, its US parent, to relax the terms of their financial arrangements.
Disney will waive its 'management fee' of 3 per cent of total revenues for
1992 and 1993 - thereby forfeiting FFr114.6m of the FFr3.82bn park and
hotels revenue in 1992 - and will postpone repayments until Euro Disney is
profitable.
The crux of Euro Disney's problems is that attendance at the park and hotels
has been lower than expected. Euro Disney, like its US parent, is
notoriously loath to disclose financial information.
However the park attracted 6.8m visitors between the opening and September
30. This suggests, as Mr John Forsgren, finance director, conceded, that it
is on course for a total of 10.5m visitors in its first year of operation,
rather than the initial target of 11m. The level of hotel occupancy at 73
per cent is also, according to Mr Forsgren, 'several points' below
expectations.
This shortfall is partly the product of the sluggish economic environment.
Euro Disney did, after all, finalise its financial plans before its 1989
flotation in more clement conditions.
The change in the economic climate has also added FFr200m to Euro Disney's
annualised interest bill, due to the rise in French real interest rates, and
temporarily scuppered its plans to develop the land around the park.
However, Euro Disney has also been affected by its failure to adapt the
formula of its US theme parks to meet the needs of the European market. Mr
Forsgren said it was attempting to address this issue. It has improved
facilities for coaches (more popular in Europe than the US) and made its
marketing more explicit to try to cut down on crowding.
Euro Disney is also changing its merchandise mix to include more classic
Disney character items and adding more points-of-sale. Similarly it is
trying to cut staff (the biggest area of variable costs), mainly by
retraining central employees to work in the park.
Meanwhile the economic climate has worsened. The currency crisis has
strengthened the franc, notably against the pound and the lire, making it
much more expensive for the British and Italians - respectively 20 per cent
and 10 per cent of the park's visitors - to go to Euro Disneyland.
'This will be a difficult year, although we do expect to see some
improvement in attendance' said Mr Forsgren. 'As for when we will move into
profit - I do not want to make any projections about that.'

FT  20 NOV 92 / Wassall rights issue to pay for Pounds 94.3m hostile bid for
Evode
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WASSALL, the mini-conglomerate run by former Hanson executives, yesterday
launched its biggest hostile bid to date with a Pounds 94.3m offer for
Evode, the chemicals and plastics group.
Mr Andrew Simon, Evode chairman, said he would fight the bid 'tooth and
nail' and urged his shareholders to reject the offer.
Wassall's cash offer of 80p per Evode share, compared with Wednesday's
closing price of 72p, values the ordinary shares at Pounds 58.2m. Evode's
shareholders have been offered share and cash and share alternatives.
The conglomerate is also offering 85 new convertible preference shares for
every 100 Evode convertible preference shares.
This values each Evode convertible preference share at 88.5p compared with
Wednesday's closing price of 75.5p, for a total of Pounds 36.1m.
Wassall's shares yesterday closed 15p down at 183p. Evode's shares rose 19p
to 91p.
The conglomerate bought 3.5 per cent of Evode from Scottish Amicable at 80p
a share.
Wassall is financing its deal with a 3-for-5 rights issue at 150p per share
to raise Pounds 103m, net of underwriting commissions. It will be payable in
two instalments, the second of which is conditional on the success of the
offer.
Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, which holds 8 per cent of Wassall, is to
take up its rights.
Wassall is forecasting an increase of more than 60 per cent in pre-tax
profits to at least Pounds 16.5m for the year ending December 31 and a final
dividend of 1.7p per share (up from 1.33p).
A strong performance from the North American plastics operations helped
Evode increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 3m to Pounds 3.8m for the half
year to March.
Mr Christopher Miller, Wassall's chief executive, said: 'There is
overwhelming evidence that Evode's disappointing performance is because of
low margins due to poor management.'

FT  20 NOV 92 / Group opposing Sugar's bid for Amstrad claims growing
support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 113m bid by Mr Alan Sugar for the 65 per cent of Amstrad he does
not already own faces growing opposition from small shareholders.
Mr Gideon Fiegel, founder of the Amstrad Shareholders Club - an informal
committee of disgruntled shareholders who believe the 30p a share offer
price for the UK electronics group is inadequate - claimed yesterday that
the club already speaks for 'more than 25m shares', or about 4.3 per cent of
Amstrad's outstanding equity.
Mr Fiegel said he is hopeful that the club will be able to muster the 93.9m
shares - a quarter of the shares Mr Sugar does not already own - required to
block the bid to take Amstrad private again.
On the basis of Amstrad's share register, he estimates that about 31,000
small shareholders control roughly 230m Amstrad shares. Institutional
investors, each with less than a 3 per cent stake, are thought to control
about 146m shares. The shareholders' committee, which met earlier this week,
has also appealed for institutional investors' support.
The Amstrad board and Kleinwort Benson, its financial advisers, are
preparing for what promises to be a stormy annual meeting in London on
Tuesday and an extraordinary general meeting called for December 10 to
discuss the bid.
The board, which is precluded by takeover rules from advising shareholders
on the bid because it has no non-executive directors, is expected to issue a
letter to shareholders after the AGM in an attempt to clarify what are seen
as 'certain misunderstandings'.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Management: Different routes through the minefield of change
 -Christopher Lorenz assesses new research aimed at helping companies to
revitalise themselves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unlike journalists, most academics are slow to commit their thoughts to
paper. Even business school professors can take six months to write a short
treatise.
So congratulations are due to two sprightly scholars for taking only four
weeks to come up with a very practical paper on one of the hottest issues of
the moment: how sclerotic companies (even ones still thriving on past
success) can set about transforming themselves into lean, agile and creative
predators capable of seizing on every future shift in their competitive
environment, and turning it to their advantage.
From General Motors to IBM, British Airways to thousands of small companies,
the tricky topic of how to handle this type of radical change preoccupies
almost every company these days.
As regular readers of this column may recall, the far from academic question
of how to vary one's leadership and management style between different types
of corporate 'change' and 'transformation' processes transfixed the many top
managers, academics and consultants who attended a large international
conference in London last month (this page, Oct 23).
They were particularly at odds over how to distinguish between the actions
needed to create the sort of change which alters a company's portfolio,
strategies, or operational effectiveness, and those needed completely to
'reinvent' corporate character and behaviour, as at IBM.
Two of the puzzled academics at the conference were Dr Barbara Blumenthal,
of Temple University, Pennsylvania (she also works for Gemini Consulting)
and Professor Philippe Haspeslagh of Insead, one of Europe's top business
schools. Their reaction to the post-conference confusion was to get together
and thrash out a working paper which knocks some welcome order into the
subject*. In many respects it contains more sense than some previous books
on it.
In essence, the duo's message is as follows. As distinct from the simple
word 'change', a corporate 'transformation' is very considerable in both
scope and depth. A litmus test is whether the behaviour of most people in
the organisation is affected significantly.
There are three basic types of transformation process, each of which may
include radical changes in culture. In other words, cultural change is not a
separate category, as most academics and consultants would maintain. Nor, as
companies are usually advised, must a transformation process necessarily
focus directly on issues of competitive strategy if it is to succeed.
The three most common types of transformation process, say Blumenthal and
Haspeslagh, are:
Radical operational improvement. Typically, this involves thorough redesign
of business processes, supported by changes to structure, skills and
behaviour.
Strategic transformation. Some strategic changes, such as mergers, do not
always imply transformation. Fundamental changes in strategy spark ones in
the components of the organisation: its structure, processes, people and
culture.
Such transformation can be attempted in several ways. One is the traditional
top-down approach, which can work in some cases. An increasingly popular
approach, dubbed 'strategic framing', involves top management defining the
company's strategic intent, as at Motorola, but then encouraging a great
deal of experimentation and championing of actual strategies by middle
managers.
Some experts advocate a more minimalist view of the top team's ability to
set even just strategic direction, and call for middle management to take
the lead in a 'middle-up-down' approach. They claim that the current chaos
at Digital Equipment is of this kind, and was stimulated deliberately.
Genetic re-engineering. This is out in a category of its own, compared with
the other two. It involves efforts by top executives to instil a management
approach which is able constantly to renew the organisation, by anticipating
and coping with change whenever big market changes occur. This involves
creating a host of new structures, processes and behaviours, including
culture change.
The term 'genetic re-engineering' is jargon and, as a metaphor drawn from
science, is not strictly accurate. But it certainly conveys the fundamental
nature of the type of transformation involved. It also helps separate
'genetic' changes, such as those at US General Electric since 1981, from
less broad and deep changes.
Again conflicting with much conventional wisdom, Blumenthal and Haspeslagh
say there is no one 'correct' combination of these three processes, nor
sequence in which they should be attempted.
The duo ends with two wise maxims. First, that transformations of any kind
are more easily started than completed - especially if middle management
cannot be converted solidly to the new approach.
And second, that the need to transform never ends. Even highly adaptive,
'self-renewing' companies, such as 3M and Hewlett-Packard, need periodic and
carefully-engineered transformation. So how about your organisation?

FT  20 NOV 92 / Management: Why pensions pay off - Perks / Norma Cohen
continues the series with a look at one of the most expensive benefits that
companies provide for their employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of all the benefits provided to employees, perhaps none is more costly than
a good pension scheme. Employers typically contribute anywhere from 10-12
per cent of payrolls to finance the classic 'final salary' scheme - no small
outlay.
Yet, as an increasing number of employers is discovering, the pension is
among the least understood and appreciated of all benefits on offer. Mark
Duke, benefits consultant at actuaries Towers Perrin, says that an
increasing number of corporate clients are conducting surveys of employees'
attitudes to various benefits. 'You often find that employees' appreciation
is in inverse proportion to the expenditure involved,' he said.
Towers Perrin's own employee studies have found, for instance, that the
company car and subsidised mortgage mean a lot more than the really
high-cost items such as pension.
Why, then, do employers bother? According to Charles Evans, partner at
actuaries Mercer Fraser: 'The traditional view is that it helps recruitment,
motivation and retention. It is also promotion for the company's image. It
says 'this is a company which cares about its employees'. And it really does
help retention.' More generally, pensions remain on offer because employers
feel they must offer them in order to be able to compete for the best staff,
adds Evans.
The need to offer the same benefits package as other employers in similar
industries has been one factor inhibiting large companies from curtailing
pension benefits and, indeed, has encouraged their enhancement over time.
But if employees, particularly younger ones, do not know or care about the
structure of pension benefits, why do employers continue to insist that they
must offer them? Significantly, figures from the National Association of
Pension Funds' latest survey show that in 1991 some 16 per cent of all new
employees rejected the opportunity to join their company scheme.
And since 1988, when membership in an employer's occupational scheme became
no longer mandatory, the number of scheme members in Britain has fallen.
While this may partly reflect demographic trends, it is clear that some
employees are electing either to join personal pension plans or none at all.
Some pensions experts argue that pension provision is not wholly a
charitable exercise. Employers earn benefits other than a happy workforce.
'The reasons are tax, tax, tax,' says John Cunliffe, partner at McKenna and
Co and a leading pensions lawyer. Employers' contributions to a scheme are
tax deductible and investment income rolls up tax-free. Those employers who
avail themselves of the surpluses through contributions holidays are, in
effect, able to make use of tax-free investment gains to offset expenditure.
Also, Evans points out, the availability of a fully-funded pension scheme
offers an employer a relatively painless way of funding redundancies.
Pension benefits can - and frequently are - enhanced to induce workers to
leave quietly, without threat of industrial strife and with no effect on
profits.
Kevin Spring, partner at international benefits consultants The Wyatt Co,
says that some impetus for corporate pension schemes has come from UK tax
legislation. Tax rebates were offered to those companies that agreed to pick
up the salary-related portion of state pension benefits through so-called
contracting-out arrangements. 'That tax rebate was used by many companies to
build up their pension funds,' Spring says.
Ron Amy, compensation and benefits director at Grand Metropolitan, argues
that some employers' reasons are shrouded in history. Since the 1920s, when
employers first began offering organised occupational pensions, they have
grown to the point where they now account for more than 70 per cent of
retirement income. The growth of occupational pensions has blunted political
demands for more generous state provision and Britain has one of the least
generous schemes in Europe.
Says Amy: 'We are now in a situation where there is no alternative state
provision.' He feels his company has no alternative but to provide a good
scheme. 'But we also have had the phenomenon in the 1980s of pension fund
surpluses which have sharply reduced the cost. Perhaps the real question is
what will happen when the contributions holidays are over and companies have
to begin making provision again.'
Already, there are rumblings that the classic final salary scheme, which
promises workers two-thirds of their last year's pay, is under threat.
Trevor Crowter, principal actuary at KPMG Peat Marwick Actuarial Services,
notes that among small companies, the trend is towards so-called money
purchase schemes. Instead of guaranteeing a worker a set pension for as long
as he or she lives after retirement, these offer a lump sum instead. The sum
should be sufficient to guarantee the purchase of an annuity, but they
rarely offer inflation indexing or other benefits attached to final salary
schemes.
However, from the employer's point of view, money purchase schemes cost less
and are thus more attractive. Meanwhile, the recent wave of pensions
legislation, and the promise of more to come, is driving up costs. Since
1985, for instance, employers have been required to increase the value of
deferred pensions by up to 5 per cent a year and, when the provisions of the
1990 Social Security Act come into effect, pensions being paid will have to
be increased by a similar amount.
Earlier this year, Standard Life, one of Britain's largest insurers,
announced that it would no longer offer final salary schemes - widely
interpreted as a sign of shrinking demand for a product of increasing
complexity and cost.
'There is an element of paternalism here on the part of British employers,'
says Brad Nelson, head of employee communication at Towers Perrin. 'And I
wonder how long they can reasonably be expected to keep that up.'

FT  20 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Backbenchers try to block last
Thatcherite reform - Ivo Dawnay on the fight by a Tory force against reforms
to leasehold law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST of the great Thatcherite reforms or a fiendishly interventionist
meddling? Take your pick.
But what is now abundantly clear, as the leasehold reform provisions in the
Housing and Urban Development Bill pass through the Commons committee stage,
is that they will be approved largely intact.
Having lost the war, the landlord champions of a 'third way' between
freehold and rental property are now fighting rearguard actions to ensure
they hang on to something of what they now hold.
For some Tory backbenchers, the concept of the right-to-buy for leaseholders
should be anathema to a party, in part, founded on its determination to
defend property ownership rights.
Yet they appear to be a minority. Others, such as Mr Dudley Fishburn,
Conservative MP for Kensington and himself a lessee of Grosvenor Estates,
say the issue is really about extending right-to-buy principles to the
private sector.
His view appears to be prevailing. In spite of lobbying by the landlords,
Sir George Young, the housing minister, looks set to favour a further tilt
towards the leaseholder.
Under the legislation as drafted, leaseholders with leases of more than 21
years will be entitled to buy the freehold of their properties from their
landlords so long as certain criteria are met. But even some of those are
now under concerted attack.
Among them are what is known as the 'low rent' requirement which insists
that, to qualify, ground rents are Pounds 1,000 or less - a figure that is
aimed at ensuring properties that are arguably part of the rental market are
not included.
Further, another let-out clause - exempting properties where more than 10
per cent of the building is used for commercial purposes - is also under
attack. Pointing out that many blocks of flats include ground-floor shops,
the leaseholders' lobby says thousands of properties could unjustifiably
slip through the net.
This week rebellions by Tory backbenchers backed by Labour have attempted to
ease the rules on both those points to ensure that the right to buy is
extended to the maximum number of people.
Sir George has appeared more than ready to adopt changes on both points,
promising to review the relevant clauses.
For the landlords, the fallback issues now increasingly centre on other
arrangements including the criteria by which 'principal primary residence'
qualifications are established.
They are determined that primary-residence qualifications, as written in the
bill, are not altered. That would mean that the right to buy would not apply
to many central London properties which are the second homes of UK citizens
or where lessees are companies or foreigners.
Instead, leaseholders who technically qualified would retain the right to
indefinite renenwal of their leases. That viewpoint, underwritten in the
bill, may well prevail.
Whatever the rights and wrongs of the case, the pure politics of the
leasehold reforms is that the landlords and their formidable lobbying power
are outgunned by a bi-partisan consensus.
With the government standing to the left of some backbenchers on the issues,
Labour can be counted on to ensure the measure is passed. Many more cynical
Tory MPs argue simply that there are more votes to be won by establishing
the right to buy across swathes of London and the south-east than by
maintaining a landlord's right to own.
When the Duke of Westminster, owner of the Grosvenor estate in central
London, took his case to the European Court of Human Rights, it ruled that
'compulsory transfer of property from one individual to another might
constitute a legitimate means for promoting the public interest'.
Mr John Major's Conservative government clearly believes that interest
dovetails neatly with its own.

MR JOHN MAJOR denied in the Commons yesterday that an inner-cities aid
programme had been cancelled. Challenged by Mr Peter Pike, Labour MP for
Burnley, about a letter from the Department of the Environment to local
councils warning them there would be no new projects under this programme,
the prime minister said Pounds 176m would be available for the urban
programme in 1993-94.
That money will be for projects already approved.
Mr Pike said cancellation of the programme, as a result of the
public-spending settlement, would cause 'despair and despondency'.

POWER stations should be allowed to keep secret some details of pollution
they emit on grounds of commercial confidentiality, according to the first
government decisions under new environmental legislation, Bronwen Maddox
writes.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, yesterday accepted an appeal by
National Power that details of future emissions at 18 of its power stations
should not be made public because they would reveal future needs for fuel
and choice of fuel to its commercial disadvantage.
However, at the same time he dismissed an appeal by PowerGen to keep
'different information' confidential because it was central to the process
of licensing power stations.
Mr Howard's decision on National Power applies only to projections of future
emissions.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory Euro-sceptics prepare for new
battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLASHES between Tory Euro-sceptics and the government will resume in the
next two weeks against the backdrop of a Commons' committee report yesterday
warning of difficulties ahead in ratifying the Maastricht treaty.
MPs will debate developments in the European Community and its financing on
Tuesday. The following week they will start the committee stage of the
Maastricht treaty bill.
About 300 amendments have already been proposed to the Maastricht bill.
Little headway is expected in the two or three days to be set aside before
Christmas.
Mr John Major begins a tour of European capitals on Monday, starting in
Brussels. He hopes to make progress towards agreement at next month's
Edinburgh EC summit on how Danish objections to Maastricht can be overcome
and on defining subsidiarity - making decisions at the lowest possible
level.
Downing Street indicated yesterday that the prime minister may concede a
discussion at Edinburgh on joint action to end recession - possibly
including European Commission proposals based on monetary co-operation and
public works.
Officials said the summit would 'certainly' discuss economic growth. Any
fresh proposals, however, would have to take into account the EC's past
commitment to 'sound public finance' and reduction of government deficits.
Downing Street continues to emphasise the importance of a deal on the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
In its report, the cross-party Commons foreign affairs select committee says
that EC leaders' hope of agreeing at Edinburgh on how subsidiarity can be
applied in principle 'will be difficult to achieve'.
It argues that challenges in the European Court of Justice against community
action under the subsidiarity articles in the Maastricht treaty are unlikely
to succeed and that without a new institutional mechanism for enforcing
subsidiarity, they will not be effective. 'Subsidiarity is best understood
as a political or constitutional convention, rather than a legal mechanism,'
the report says.
The MPs also say it is 'unclear' how the changes to Maastricht needed before
a second Danish referendum can be made legally binding, while upholding the
agreement of other EC countries not to renegotiate the treaty. The MPs say
it is 'not known' how changes for Denmark will affect ratification in the
UK. The British government, in its capacity as president of the European
Community, bore a special responsibility in the failure to find a solution
to the Yugoslav crisis, Dr John Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary
said yesterday.
Dr Cunningham was particularly critical of the Community's and Britain's
'failure of will' in enforcing sanctions against Serbia and other former
Yugoslav regions.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs' pay freeze under attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A GOVERNMENT proposal to freeze MPs' pay at its present level
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pounds 30,854 - should be opposed, Ms Harriet Harman, Labour's shadow chief
secretary, told the Commons last night.
She called for the agreement linking rises in MPs' pay to that of
middle-ranking civil servants to continue. Under that agreement, MPs would
receive an increase of 3.9 per cent from January. The allowance MPs receive
for their office costs was increased by more than Pounds 10,000 last July.
Conservative MPs will be subject to a two-line whip on the proposal, due to
be debated on Wednesday, while Labour backbenchers will be allowed a free
vote.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy leader, said yesterday that the party
leadership's intention was to abstain, but that might be reviewed in the
light of the terms of the government motion.
Ms Harman's move came during the resumed debate on the chancellor's Autumn
Statement in response to Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the
Treasury.
Ms Harman recalled that the link with civil servants' pay was made to stop
the remuneration of MPs being a 'political football'. She challenged Tory
MPs 'baying for a pay freeze' to observe the 1.5 per cent ceiling set by the
government for public-sector workers and to refuse increases in the fees
they received from directorships.
She was joined by other Labour MPs in arguing that the growing number of
redundancies underlined the failure of the Autumn Statement to provide the
stimulus needed for for recovery.
Mr Portillo maintained that the Autumn Statement would create the conditions
for a return of confidence and would remove the barrier to growth.
Mr John Townend, MP for Bridlington and chairman of the Conservative
backbench finance committee, warned that unless there was another 'assault'
on public spending next year, the alternative of an increase in taxation
would have to be faced.
He urged ministers to remember what had happened to departing US President
George Bush after his pledge not to raise taxes, and warned them that the
Conservatives had won the election because voters believed they would not
put up taxes.
Mr Nick Brown, in the final speech from the Labour front bench, emphasised
that the increase in unemployment was the largest single factor affecting
consumer confidence.
An attempt by Labour to condemn the Autumn Statement was defeated by 55
votes (322-267). A second attempt by Labour to attack the government's
policy came to a premature end when the party's whips failed to appoint
tellers for the vote. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, ruled that the
division could not take place, which resulted in a motion approving the
Autumn Statement being carried without challenge.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Pensions group calls for curbs on employers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PENSIONS industry's trade association urged new restrictions yesterday
on employers' operation of pension schemes and renewed its call for a
compensation fund for pensioners.
The National Association of Pension Funds set out at its autumn conference a
detailed response to the independent inquiry set up by the government.
The association proposed that court permission be required for a number of
actions, including amending trust deeds, winding up pension schemes and
making bulk transfers of members into and out of pension schemes. All those
actions were taken by trustees of pension schemes controlled by the late
Robert Maxwell, which have collapsed after the theft of more than Pounds
400m.
In response to the most contentious issue under review, the association said
there should be no restrictions on employers' ability to use surpluses for
their sole benefit, provided the scheme had more than enough to provide
members with all promised benefits.
The association's submission said: 'The NAPF working party believes that if
surpluses had always to be used in whole or in part for the benefit of
scheme members, some employers might insist on a funding policy which aimed
to avoid surpluses arising, or they would cease to operate final salary
schemes. Neither of these outcomes would be in the interests of scheme
members.'
The association has proposed several conditions that employers would have to
meet to preserve members' reasonable expectations. Employers would have to
tell employees what increases they could expect to pensions in payment and
whether employers were providing enough money to the scheme to fund those
increases.
It should be expected that employers would always leave some surplus in the
scheme to cover a reasonable margin in the event of poor investment returns.
With that information available, and measures to protect members' rights on
wind-up, employees should be able to view their contributions as the
purchase of an entitlement to a known set of benefits.
The association urged that the composition of a board of trustees should
strike a balance between the different interests, and members should have
the right to appoint at least one trustee to each scheme.
In a show of hands, the conference overwhelmingly signalled opposition to
the associations's wide-ranging proposal for an industry-funded compensation
scheme. The majority of those present favoured a more limited scheme
offering compensation to pensioners only in cases of outright fraud.
Mr Tom Ross, the NAPF vice-chairman elect and a partner at actuaries Clay
and Partners, said the delegates were not necessarily representative of the
membership.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Safety rules for VDU use attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEALTH and safety regulations for visual display unit workers will cover
self-employed as well as directly employed workers from next January, the
government said yesterday, Catherine Milton writes.
But the regulations, implemented to comply with one of several EC health and
safety directives, mean employers face fewer obligations if they contract
work out to self-employed 'operators'. The Health and Safety Commission said
it had gone beyond the requirements of the directive in including the
self-employed.
In addition, the NCU communications union accused the government of
introducing dual safety standards.
It said: 'The regulations encourage two different standards of workstation
within one workplace - one for workers who use display screen equipment for
'a significant part of their normal work' and the other for the rest of us.
With no clear definition of who is or who is not a user in the eyes of the
law, there is every incentive for unscrupulous employers to operate to the
lowest standards they can get away with.'
The new regulations apply only to workers recognised in law as display
screen workers. The Health and Safety Commission said the new regulations
would improve rights for about 7m people.
The regulations are designed to combat the growing issue of injuries such as
repetitive strain injury.
The commission also produced guidance for regulations to introduce an EC
directive on manual handling that comes into force in January.
The regulations apply to all industries and services. The main new duties
placed on employers will be to avoid the need for manual handling operations
involving a risk of injury 'so far as is reasonably practicable'; to make an
assessment of the risk of injury in those operations that cannot be avoided;
and reduce the risk of injury to the 'lowest level reasonably practicable,
using the assessment as a basis for action'.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Official is thrust into limelight: David Owen and Richard
Donkin on a key Matrix Churchill trial witness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR two days during the Matrix Churchill trial, a slight figure occupied the
witness box facing questions about his role in the approval of export
licences for Iraq. Mr Tony Steadman, the former director of export licensing
at the Department of Trade and Industry, was confronting every civil
servant's nightmare.
Normally shielded by the anonymity of Whitehall, he now found his every word
exposed to public scrutiny. He now works as a grade seven official at the
DTI's Enterprise Initiative division and declines requests for interviews.
Government documents released during the trial show that Mr Steadman, more
than any other Whitehall official, was involved in the initial
interpretation of the 1984 guidelines for exports to Iran and Iraq,
especially where they covered the critical 'grey' area of dual-use equipment
such as machine tools.
The arguments between ministers were often framed by officials, whose
stock-in-trade was to construct lines of argument to suit any occasion.
In the Matrix Churchill case, Mr Steadman features on scores of documents
covering 2 1/2 years. It is even possible to pinpoint the date on which he
moved offices. His name also crops up in other Iraq-related episodes such as
the supergun affair and the Ordnance Technology trial.
Mr Steadman appears to have made several crucial interventions in the
unfolding Iraqi arms drama.
November 1987
The DTI received intelligence that two Iraqi industrial complexes to which
British machine tools were being sent were 'heavily engaged in a munitions
production programme'. Mr Steadman told the Matrix Churchill trial the
information was received before the first of the export licences for the
company had been approved but that he did not see it until December when the
licence had been passed.
In January, that presented the DTI with a dilemma: should it revoke the
licences with 'catastrophic consequences' for the three companies concerned
or should it compound the subterfuge by permitting the exports to go ahead?
Mr Steadman's advice in a letter to a Ministry of Defence official was
important in moulding policy for the next three years.
It said: 'There is scope for the balanced approach of allowing existing
commitments but refusing for the present future licence applications for
munitions or other military programmes from the consignees.'
A subsequent Foreign Office memo the same month notes that in agreeing early
licences, the Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) - a body comprising
officials from the DTI, MoD and the Foreign Office set up to review British
exports to Iran and Iraq - 'satisfied itself that the lathes and tools were,
as the companies had claimed, civilian items for general industrial
purposes'.
The retrospective pressure to make the policy fit the existing arrangements
is recognised in the memo: 'It is likely that had we known from the outset
that the machine tools would be used to manufacture munitions we would have
recommended that the licences be refused'.
One FO official who saw the memo wrote on it that 'the companies should be
urged to ship as fast as they can'.
With the knowledge that the real use for the machines was now known in the
DTI, the exporters wanted guidance about future business they knew was
available in Iraq. In January a meeting was arranged between the Machine
Tools Trades Association and Mr Alan Clark, then minister for trade.
Mr Clark advised potential exporters to Iraq to emphasise the civilian use
of dual-use equipment that they were thinking of supplying - as he later
acknowledged to the fury of Customs, whose case against three ex-Matrix
Churchill directors collapsed.
The outcome might have been different if the minister had followed the
advice of Mr Steadman in a short briefing before the meeting. The advice was
to 'assure' those present that no decisions would be taken under a
government review of machine-tool licensing until their views had been
considered and ministerial colleagues consulted. Meanwhile, the trades
association and machine-tool companies 'should maintain a low profile'.
On the whole, ministers stuck to the line provided by their civil servants.
June 1988
Potential defence implications were foremost when Mr Steadman liaised with
the MoD over a proposed contract involving the supply of massive steel pipes
manufactured by Walter Somers to Space Research Corporation of Belgium.
In April 1990, Customs impounded tubes made by Somers and Sheffield
Forgemasters and the supergun affair hit newspaper front pages.
October 1989
Lord Trefgarne, now trade minister, received a briefing prepared by Mr
Steadman ahead of a critical meeting with Mr Alan Clark, who was now
minister for defence procurement, and Mr William Waldegrave, foreign office
minister. By this time an inter-departmental tussle had developed between
the cautious Mr Waldegrave and his two colleagues after the earlier decision
to press ahead with exports of machine tools to known armaments plants.
Countering the anticipated Foreign Office line that a new batch of licence
applications should be refused because of 'strategic concerns', he argues:
'The fact that Matrix Churchill is virtually Iraqi-owned or an organisation
known to be procuring nuclear technology is not sufficient to refuse these
applications.'
He also suggests that Lord Trefgarne make common cause with Mr Clark by
supporting a 'possible proposal' for 'the review of the IDC guidelines with
a view to their removal or relaxation'. In the wake of the meeting, Mr
Waldegrave withdrew his objections to allowing the licences to proceed in
return for certain concessions.
February 1992
Mr Steadman was conspicuous by his absence. Defence lawyers wanted him to
give evidence at the trial of four businessmen at Reading Crown Court facing
charges of conspiring to supply detonation fuses for heavy artillery shells
to Iraq.
The charges arose out of a contract for Ordnance Technology, a Reading
company that exported the goods under an end-user certificate giving Jordan,
Iraq's neighbour to the north, as the customer.
Judge Stanley Spence set aside a witness summons from the defence for Mr
Steadman to give evidence at the trial. He did agree, however, to the
appearance of a DTI official.
Mr Stuart Blackledge, one of the defendants, said this week: 'With the
rapidly diminishing chances of a fair trial, the offer of a deal, and the
threat of costs, I changed my plea to guilty. The other defendants did the
same.'

FT  20 NOV 92 / Delay for Iranian lathes venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UK-IRANIAN joint venture potentially worth Pounds 150m in business to BSA
Tools, the Birmingham-based machine tool company, is being held up by delays
over export licences, it was claimed yesterday.
Mr Keith Bailey, the company chairman and a central figure in the Matrix
Churchill affair, is pushing the Department of Trade and Industry to approve
a licensing deal under which standard lathes would be produced in Iran.
Kits worth Pounds 150m could be supplied over the next five years for
assembly in Iran.
Mr Bailey said the BSA licence application has been with the DTI for months,
but the Iran project has been 'on the back burner' because of the Matrix
Churchill case, his own trial over alleged illegal exports to Iraq, and the
receivership this summer of Matrix Churchill.
Now, with charges against the three Matrix Churchill executives and Mr
Bailey's own case dropped, the BSA chief is keen to go ahead with the
project.
The DTI said yesterday that it could not comment on individual cases.
Last month, however, it introduced special licensing procedures for a list
of countries including Iran, to ensure that equipment such as machine tools
could not be used in the manufacture of weapons.
That meant that export licence applications for Iran were now taking longer,
the department said.
Mr Bailey's company Automation Investments bought Matrix Churchill from
Iraqi ownership two years ago, but the Coventry-based lathe and grinding
machine producer went into receivership after bank funding was withdrawn.
Last month, AI, which also owns BSA Tools, bought Matrix Churchill back from
the receivers, Price Waterhouse. The grinding business has been sold,
leaving Mr Bailey with the Churchill lathe range.
Customs and Excise commissioners agreed earlier this year to stay a
prosecution against Contractors 600 relating to the export of lathes to Iraq
on payment of Pounds 75,000, the government said yesterday.
The lathes were supplied by the Colchester Lathe Company. The proceedings
were in respect of the export of castings without the requisite licence, Sir
John Cope, paymaster-general, said in answer to a written question from Mr
George Foulkes, Labour defence spokesman.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Schools point out exam-list mistakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPLAINTS about the accuracy of the government's exam results league tables
came from individual schools and local authorities yesterday.
The first and loudest cry came from the independent sector. Manchester High
School for Girls' had its 100 per cent record for top GCSE grades tabulated
as 16 per cent.
Headteacher Miss Mary Moon 'repeatedly' made the error clear to the
Education Department. She said: 'It was quite clear in the information that
they sent to us to check in October that they had omitted all our entries in
the Northern Examining Board.'
Miss Moon, who as head of an independent school entered the league table
scheme voluntarily, said she was anxious that the bungle might put parents
off sending their children to the school, and was considering taking legal
action.
Another independent school, Rugby, in Warwickshire, also suffered, with all
eight statistics incorrect. The tables gave only 71 per cent of pupils
scoring five or more GCSEs at top grades. The true figure was 96 per cent,
putting Rugby near the top of the league.
Somerset headteacher Mr Roland Chant condemned the 'grossly distorted'
figures published for GCSE exam passes at Holyrood School at Chard. The
tables gave only 6 per cent of pupils achieving five or more A-C passes
instead of the true figure of 46.9 per cent.
Parliament Hill School, a comprehensive girls' school in Camden, north
London, had no A-level passes recorded, instead of an average points score
of 11.3 per pupil.
Ms Judy Box, its headmistress, said: 'I'm totally fed up. I don't know how
much damage this will do us. I'm very concerned for staff, parents and
pupils. I think the department has just mucked this up.'
Local education authorities also produced lists of errors. How many are
valid, and how many the result of inadequate checking by schools and
councils, will be a rich source of dispute.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
                        ERRORS AND COMPLAINTS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cambridgeshire claims the tables contain more than 53 errors. At least
30 schools in the area are affected by inaccurate Department of
Education data and five village colleges are listed without name, said
Bill Goodwin, assistant director of education.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Manchester High School for Girls achieved a 100% record for pupils
scoring five or more top GCSE grades. But the league tables give the
figure as just 16 percent
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rugby School, Warwickshire, claims all eight statistics given for it
are incorrect, significantly underplaying its exam success. The tables
say only 71 percent of pupils scored five or more GCSEs at top grades
when the true figure was 94 percent.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Parliament Hill School, a comprehensive girls' school in Camden, north
London, is shown as recording no A-level passes. In fact it achieved an
average points score of 11.3 percent per pupil - the equivalent of two
C grades.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Holyrood School in Chard, Somerset, was listed as having only 6 percent
of pupils with five or more A-C passes at GCSE instead of the true
figure of 46.9 percent.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Results of tertiary and further-education colleges are excluded,
distorting the A-level results for some local education authorities.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Schools which pool their sixth forms are in some cases given no credit
at all for their A-level results.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The tables exclude all pupils achieving GCSE grades who fell outside
the traditional age group for taking GCSEs and A-levels. Independent
schools, in particular, say this discriminates against them.

Earlier this month Lloyd's said that more than 3,000 Names, facing heavy

Action groups of Names, the individuals whose assets back underwriting, have

FT  20 NOV 92 / Universities' fears grow about cut in income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIVERSITY CHIEFS are increasingly concerned that the government's
determination to slow the rise in the numbers of higher-education students
will lead to cuts in fee income, causing severe financial difficulties for
some institutions.
Until last week's Autumn Statement, universities expected tuition fees for
next year to be increased by at least the rate of inflation, in accordance
with the government's policy of encouraging institutions to raise intake to
match demand.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, announced last week that government
funding projections would allow for only a 13 per cent increase in student
numbers over the next three years - which is far below most recent estimates
of growth and is equivalent to the increase in polytechnic student numbers
for last year alone.
Mr Patten has also asked the Higher Education Funding Council to use its
funding leverage to give greater incentives for recruitment to engineering
and science courses.
The council is considering 'adjustments' to the fee structure for next year
and is having intensive discussions with Department of Education officials.
At present, the government pays universities Pounds 1,855 for each
undergraduate on a classroom-based course, Pounds 2,770 for those on
laboratory-based courses, and Pounds 4,985 for clinical courses. In 1987
universities received only Pounds 556 per student for all types of courses.
The partial shift from block grants to fees was a deliberate attempt to
boost numbers and make higher education more responsive to demand. It has
been so successful, particularly among the former polytechnics, that in some
institutions a third or more of students are already funded by fees alone
and are beyond the numbers covered by the block grant.
Mr John Stoddart, principal of Sheffield Hallam university, said he was
'worried' about reform of the fee structure.
He said: 'If they are aiming to choke off supply, fairly drastic changes
will be needed. It will be difficult for the funding council to dampen down
expectations which the government has built up over several years.'
Dr David Harrison, chairman of the committee of vice-chancellors, said he
was 'concerned at a sudden and possibly ill-thought-out change which will
cause considerable planning difficulties all round, and very serious
problems for institutions relying on expansion to fund capital projects'.
The Higher Education Funding Council's most likely course of action is to
allow a nil or tiny increase in overall fee levels, with a larger
differential between classroom and laboratory courses. One vice-chancellor
speculated that if that failed to stifle growth, the council might be forced
back to slashing fee levels and fining institutions taking 'too many'
students.

FT  20 NOV 92 / London chefs put expansion on menu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of large, high-quality restaurants opening in London this year
has been greater than at any time since 1986, according to a report
published yesterday.
The editors of the Harden's London Restaurants guide say the fall in the
capital's property prices has resulted in restaurateurs being able to afford
larger premises.
There is also now a larger group of English chefs able to compete with their
counterparts in large cities abroad.
The report says 10 London restaurants with more than 75 seats and catering
to the middle and upper markets have opened this year, compared with three
last year and one each in 1989 and 1990. The new openings included the
Criterion, Christopher's and 5th Floor at Harvey Nichols.
The report says that of the 692 restaurants mentioned in its guide at the
beginning of the year, 17 have closed and 23 have new names or owners. The
editors say restaurants that closed were offering poor value for money,
suffering from a poor location or were in Soho or outer Chelsea and Fulham -
areas affected by the end of the 1980s boom.
Mr Peter Harden, co-editor of the report, said: 'There isn't a single
example of a large, prominent mid-to-high-quality restaurant closing over
the past year. London hasn't had in the past these big, metropolitan
eateries you find in New York. It now has.'
Average cost at the restaurants named was Pounds 24.71, down from Pounds
24.77 a year ago.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Warning on future of Post Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S current review of the Post Office and its future structure
should take full account of users' fears that a change of ownership might
imperil service and prices, the postal watchdog warns today.
In two reports sent to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
the Post Office Users National Council acknowledged that privatisation, with
appropriate regulatory safeguards, could provide greater freedom and
flexibility to manage, expand and finance the business.
But it argues that the government could provide the greater commercial
freedom that the business needed by keeping it under state ownership. The
option of privatisation was not essential.
Mr Tom Corrigan, council chairman, said it was important that big structural
changes, particularly disposals of any parts of the business, should proceed
only if it could be demonstrated that the present universal service would
not be prejudiced.
'This applies equally to Parcelforce, where the government has announced a
clear intention to privatise the business,' he said.
Mr Corrigan argued against 'ill-considered' change and said that the full
impli-cations, benefits and consequences of proposals for change must be
properly analysed, reviewed and presented objectively rather than
ideologically.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Action urged over timeshare group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR Party has urged the government to protect customers from the
activities of Club Riviera, a timeshare company that had its credit licences
revoked by the Office of Fair Trading last July.
In an early day motion Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs
spokesman, and Mr Peter Hain, MP for Neath, allege that - like Land Travel,
the coach company which collapsed last July - Club Riviera has failed to
file accounts within the legal timescale.
The motion adds that Club Riviera's records at Companies House 'do not
reveal the principals' of its various companies. They include Club Tenerife,
Canary Islands Holiday Club, Regency Palms, Marbella Beach Club, Vacation
Management Services, Olympus Resources and Mackintosh Associates.
The motion says that in spite the OFT's revocation of Club Riviera's credit
licences for seriously misleading and deceptive conduct, 'the Department of
Trade and Industry has permitted those responsible for such conduct,
Laurence Werner, Simon Clarke and others, to continue to run the company'.
It adds that Club Riviera and its associated companies 'intimidate consumers
they have cheated, repossess thousands of properties resulting from high
maintenance charge disputes (and) tricked consumers by offering a buy-back
guarantee which was not honoured'.
The motion says the company is being investigated 'by the Fraud Office' and
calls on Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to investigate
those who control the companies. It also calls on Mr Heseltine 'to protect
existing customers and the public from malpractices'.
Club Riviera declined to comment on the motion.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Anger at axe for research on fast reactor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK nuclear industry reacted angrily yesterday to the government's
decision to cease funding for research and development of the European fast
reactor, the joint programme by the UK, France and Germany. Others welcomed
the decision, given the uncertain outlook for nuclear power.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, told MPs that the government had concluded
that it could not justify continuing the research because design validation
had been completed and there was 'general agreement that the commercial
deployment of the fast reactor will not be justified until well into the
next century'.
He said that about 270 jobs would be lost, about 40 of them at Dounreay,
Caithness, and about 160 of them at Risley, Cheshire. About 40 people were
likely to be made redundant at Winfrith, Dorset.
In a joint statement, Nuclear Electric, Scottish Nuclear, British Nuclear
Fuels and AEA Technology - all government-owned - said they 'greatly'
regretted the move. Mr John Collier, chairman of Nuclear Electric, said
there were signs of growing interest in fast reactors in Japan, the US,
Russia and Spain.
In spite of Mr Eggar's insistence that the government was following a
recommendation by the cross-party Commons energy committee in 1990 that it
should review the position after the design validation process, he came
under attack from across the Commons.
Tory and opposition MPs warned with dismay of the consequences of the UK's
giving up its lead in this field, because it was impossible 'to mothball
nuclear physics'.
Rejecting the charge that the government was not committed to the research,
Mr Eggar said that during the past 40 years more than Pounds 4bn (at 1992
prices) had been spent on the project.
Dr Brian Eyre, chief executive of AEA Technology, said he was deeply
disappointed by the decision because the EFR project 'was within reach of
building a commercial demonstration plant'.
Mr John Chesshire, of the Science Policy Research Unit at Sussex University,
said the government was correct because of what he described as 'the major
reassessment' being made about the economics of nuclear power.
A seepage of plutonium nitrate from an evaporator which halted reprocessing
at British Nuclear Fuels' Sellafield plant in West Cumbria for six weeks has
been reclassified from Level 1 to Level 3 on the International Nuclear Event
scale, the company has confirmed.
The new rating, the highest non-accident classification on the scale,
follows the discovery that monitoring equipment did not flash warnings of
the spillage, which happened in early September.
The duopoly of National Power and PowerGen must be destroyed if there is to
be a future for independent generators, Dr James Smith, chairman of Eastern
Electricity, the biggest of the regional distribution companies, said
yesterday. He called for more renewable-energy projects.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Project Columbus sets about trimming the crew: John Gapper
reports on moves at Royal Bank of Scotland to reshape its branch network by
investing in technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROJECT Columbus is the name given by Royal Bank of Scotland to its
five-year plan to reshape its branch network by investing in technology and
cutting 3,500 jobs. 'It seems to symbolise a move forward to a brave new
world,' Mr Tony Schofield, the man in charge of the project, said yesterday.
The metaphor of a voyage is appropriate to Royal Bank's approach, which is
more gradual than that of other banks. But it also symbolises the risk of
encountering similar problems to the Italian explorer, who limped back from
his last trip 'with the ships rotten, worm-eaten, all in holes'.
Such pitfalls have become common for banks that have tried to cut costs and
boost income by automating mundane tasks and training staff to sell more
products. Spending on technology has often not been accompanied by cuts in
staff numbers, so that cost-income ratios have continued to climb.
One reason is the traditional culture of banks, which have given staff
greater employment security than other sectors of private industry. Many now
believe that deteriorating profits have left them with little choice but to
press forward with aggressive cutting costs in branch networks.
Barclays plans to cut at least 8,000 from its present 77,000 branch staff by
1995, and has closed 120 branches this year. National Westminster is
reviewing networks in each of its 21 regions after the first review in the
London West End region led to plans to cut 35 of the 90 branches.
Royal Bank comes late to this process, compared with a bank such as Midland,
which centralised all its branch back office processing in eight centres and
closed 250 branches between 1988 and 1991. Yet Midland still has a
cost-income ratio of 70.1 per cent, higher that the RBS figure.
Mr Schofield, managing director of branch banking at RBS, estimates that if
Project Columbus were implemented in full today, the network's cost-income
ratio would fall from the present 68 per cent to 53 per cent. That would
bring it respectably into line with many building societies.
Project Columbus is less ambitious in terms of technology than the efforts
of other banks but firmer in cutting staff. The 3,500 cut represents 27 per
cent of the 13,000 people working in branches.
Mr Schofield says: 'We are trying to match technology to business need, not
have the best technology around, which some have tried at enormous cost.'
He cites the decision to move back-office work to one branch in a small
group rather than adopt Midland's more centralised approach.
The reform will be carried out in three stages. The first - between now and
the start of 1994 - will include two changes. One is the consolidation of
back-office work, the second the introduction of an credit-scoring system
like that already used in the bank's Direct Line insurance subsidiary.
In the second overlapping stage, between 1993 and the end of 1995, the bank
will try to reform the structure of its 780 branches to respond to what it
calls retail 'micromarkets'. That will mean having more specialist branches
giving specialist advice on products such as mortgages.
Mr Schofield cites the example of an experimental RBS outlet in the
Meadowhall shopping centre on the outskirts of Sheffield, South Yorkshire.
That has no traditional counter service, but opens in the same hours as the
centre and has a range of advisers selling financial products.
The bank also wants to develop a telephone banking service similar to
National Westminster's Actionline service.
The third wave will - like Columbus's third voyage to the West Indies -
depend on the outcome of the first two. Mr Schofield says the rapid
development of technology means it makes more sense to have 'a gestation
period' to see what is the best way forward after it has gained experience.
There are many uncertainties over Project Columbus, but probably the most
pressing is whether the bank will win the necessary co-operation from staff.
Mr Sandy Boyle, the Bifu financial services union's deputy general secretary
in Scotland, says that is already in jeopardy.
Mr Schofield says the use of technology will enrich the average job by
reducing paper-shuffling. He says there has been considerable enthusiasm
among younger staff for the change. A larger question is whether the
longer-serving staff will respond well to the new service culture.
'I can't see how you produce a highly motivated sales team by making every
employee look over their shoulder for the next five years,' says Mr Boyle.
Like Columbus, the bank's reform may be remembered as much for its
destruction of a traditional culture as for its discovery of a new world.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Fears on council contracts calmed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday moved to reassure companies which contract to
provide local council services that they are not affected by new regulations
protecting workers' pay and conditions when they transfer to the private
sector.
The regulations, which stem from a European Community directive, mean that
the pay and conditions of staff cannot be cut when there is a transfer of
undertakings.
Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, said yesterday the new
regulations did not alter the legal position of people working in the
private sector whose work was contracted out. In a reply to a parliamentary
question, he said that the regulations applied only where there was a
transfer of an undertaking or part of an undertaking.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Public pay rises may be under 1.5%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE GROUPS of public-sector workers will have to accept pay rises of less
than the government limit of 1.5 per cent if the automatic 'incremental' pay
rises that some groups are entitled to eat into pay bills.
The issue of increments has been raised with the chancellor by Mr Andrew
Smith, a shadow Treasury minister.
Treasury officials have confirmed that the 1.5 per cent increase assumes no
overall increase in the incremental payments - usually related to seniority
 -enjoyed by nurses, most teachers and some local government workers.
In normal years there is virtually no overall increase in increments as
higher-grade workers move out to other jobs. Public-sector pay experts such
as Mr Chris Trinder, of the Public Finance Foundation, say, though, that
during recessions there is less movement out of the public sector and
'incremental drift'.
Mr Trinder calculates that such incremental drift usually consumes about 0.5
per cent of the pay bill.
Cohse, the health union, decided yesterday to take a sounding of membership
reaction to the 1.5 per cent limit with a view to calling for industrial
action.

Mr Harry Dunlevy, personnel operations director at Rover, said yesterday:
'The seminar is a very positive way forward and it is a milestone along the
way in what has already been a success story.'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT by manufacturing industry in capital goods fell by 2 per cent in
the third quarter compared with a year ago, but was virtually unchanged on
the previous quarter, Emma Tucker writes.
The third-quarter seasonally adjusted figure at 1985 prices was Pounds
2.57bn, compared with Pounds 2.576bn in the second quarter, according to the
Central Statistical Office.
Spending by mineral extraction and chemicals industries dropped from Pounds
642m to Pounds 634m between the two quarters and spending by the engineering
and car industries fell to Pounds 908m from Pounds 935m.
Capital spending by the 'other manufacturing' sector, which includes
printing and publishing, rose from Pounds 999m to Pounds 1.028bn in the
third quarter. That was the highest level of spending in the category since
the second quarter of 1990.
Manufacturing industry spent less on new building in the third quarter but
more on vehicles and plant and machinery.

FT  20 NOV 92 / October lending sharply up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BIG rise in lending by banks and building societies last month encouraged
hopes that the economy may be on the mend.
The increase was partly a rebound from a large repayment of loans in
September, while demand by consumers for bank credit remains weak.
Lending by banks and building societies in sterling increased in October by
a seasonally adjusted Pounds 5.1bn, the biggest monthly figure for nearly
two years, the Bank of England said yesterday.
The rise followed a repayment of loans of Pounds 1.1bn in September. Mr
Simon Briscoe, an economist at brokers Greenwell Montagu, said that the
figures for the two months showed the economy was 'still weak'.
The British Bankers' Association said the nine biggest UK commercial banks
increased lending by a seasonally adjusted Pounds 3.2bn last month, the
biggest rise since February 1990. It followed a repayment of loans to those
banks of Pounds 1.3bn in September.
The rise in bank lending partly reflected large borrowing by manufacturers
to pay corporation tax. Manufacturers increased lending by Pounds 728m, on a
non-seasonally-adjusted basis, the biggest rise since June 1988.
Against that, demand from consumers remains weak. Although lending for house
purchases continued to rise the increase of Pounds 335m lent for mortgages
from the nine banks was the smallest since January.
Excluding mortgages, consumers repaid credit to the nine banks of Pounds
542m, the largest repayment since the BBA started monthly records in 1986.
Other Bank of England figures showed the amount of money in the economy
expanding modestly in October. M0, the narrow measure of the money supply,
mainly comprising notes and coins in circulation, rose a seasonally adjusted
0.6 per cent in October to show a year-on-year rise of 2.4 per cent. In the
year to September, the figure was 2.3 per cent.
M4, a broader measure, which takes in bank and building society deposits as
well as notes and coins, increased by 1.0 per cent in October. The
year-on-year rise was 5.4 per cent, as against 5.1 per cent in the 12 months
to September.
Britain's public-sector borrowing requirement was overfunded by Pounds 9.1bn
in the first six months of the 1992-93 financial year, the Bank of England
reported yesterday.
The overfund reflected drawings on the UK foreign currency reserves to
defend sterling in September; foreign borrowing by the government; and
official sales of government gilt-edged stock.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Building society savings rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING societies managed to reverse the outflow of funds from the industry
last month, reflecting a national rise in savings.
The Building Societies Association said yesterday that the net inflow of
retail funds in October was Pounds 281m, compared with an outflow of Pounds
264m the previous month.
Figures published by the association showed a slight rise in new commitments
to mortgages and in actual mortgage lending. However, both figures remain at
low levels compared with the first half of the year.
Gross mortgage lending expanded to Pounds 1.9bn for the month, up from
Pounds 1.8bn in September. Net mortgage advances rose slightly to Pounds
683m, while net new commitments increased to Pounds 2.2bncompared with
Pounds 1.8bn in September.
Although the flow of funds into societies was aided by the lowering of rates
on National Savings products in the summer, National Savings products also
enjoyed a good month in October, achieving gross sales of Pounds 867m.
Building societies may benefit further this month from the withdrawal of two
National Savings products after the Autumn Statement. They were the
fixed-interest First Option Bond, and the fifth issue of index-linked
certificates.
Mr Mark Boleat, the association's director-general, said the savings inflow
'marked a welcome turnround from the September position but was still barely
half the level of a year earlier'. There was a net outflow of Pounds 262m
from societies in the third quarter of this year.
The attempt by societies to rebuild capital to offset growing provisions for
bad loans on mortgages has led to the raising of margins between mortgage
rates and the base rate over the past two months as base rates have fallen.
Mr Boleat said the 3-percentage-point reduction in base rates since late
September would help improve underlying sentiment towards the housing
market, and lending volumes would be likely to rise from next spring.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Disinflation 'too quick': Bank of England seeks gradual
transition to price stability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORTLY after sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism on Black
Wednesday, it was reported that a collective sigh of relief could be heard
in the Bank of England.
The Bank's latest quarterly bulletin explains why. Policy had become far too
tight this year and disinflation was proceeding so quickly that price
stability - defined as an underlying inflation rate of 2 per cent or less -
might have been achieved next year.
The Bank has not turned away from seeking stable prices. Indeed, it says:
'It is vital that a steady and sustainable transition to price stability be
maintained. In the long run, economic growth is not promoted by tolerating
higher rates of inflation.'
Its bulletin, though, marks a new awareness of the damage caused by debt
deflation and the way falling house prices have damped consumer confidence
and UK economic growth. A too rapid move towards price stability might have
intensified that. Once sterling was forced out of the ERM and the UK freed
from having to maintain a monetary policy geared to German domestic
conditions, 'some easing of policy was desirable', the Bank says.
In spite of the fall in bank base rates to 7 per cent, the bulletin does
nothing to encourage hope of a strong economic recovery in Britain. 'Recent
economic data and surveys have suggested a subdued picture for activity in
the second half of this year,' it says.
The international outlook is also bleak. The prospects for world trade have
worsened since the Bank's last bulletin in August. The volume of world trade
in 1993 is expected to be only 12 per cent higher than in 1990, whereas 12
months ago it was expected to rise by 18 per cent between 1990 and 1993.
According to the Bank, economic activity in the UK's six Group of Seven
partner countries is now forecast to rise by 1.6 per cent this year - half a
percentage point less than forecast six months ago. It expects output among
the six to grow next year at a still sluggish 2.2 per cent, with the
European Community growing by only 1 per cent, reflecting an anticipated
slowdown in Germany and Italy.
The EC's expected 1 per cent rate of growth in 1993 would be unchanged from
this year and in 1991, and would compare with growth of between 2.5 per cent
and 3 per cent expected for Japan and the US next year. Subdued global
growth is one reason the Bank does not fear a swift revival of inflationary
pressures in Britain after sterling's large devaluation since September 16.
It also believes under-utilisation of capacity and the depressed state of
the labour market will delay, and may reduce, the pass-through of the
depreciation into prices.
UK inflation (when measured by the seasonally adjusted change in the index
in the latest three months over the preceding three months at an annualised
rate) has been lower than suggested by official figures in recent months.
Goods prices, which a year ago were rising at an annualised rate of about 6
per cent, have been growing at annualised rates close to 1 per cent. Average
prices reported by retailers have shown little underlying growth through the
summer.
The bulletin suggests reasons why low inflation has failed to stop sharp
falls in business and consumer confidence.
Companies have started to shed labour at an accelerating rate while those
affected by job losses differ from the 1980s. The proportion of women losing
their jobs has declined, as has the percentage of people aged 18 to 24. By
contrast, the proportion of unemployed aged between 25 and 49 has increased,
as has the percentage of jobless in the south-east.
A 'striking' change has been the sharp increase of short-term male
unemployment benefit claimants in mortgaged households from 34 per cent in
1986 to 41 per cent last year. Claimants are also more educated than in the
mid 1980s, with 41 per cent holding A-levels or higher qualifications
against 34 per cent previously.
The spread of unemployment to such groups has affected people with higher
expectations and greater financial commitments than in earlier recessions.
The Bank suggests that that has encouraged greater financial caution among
individuals than indicated by overall data on the economy. The sight of well
educated homeowners losing their jobs may have made skilled workers and
potential home buyers especially concerned about their own security and so
unwilling to borrow or spend more.

The bishop, third most senior in the Anglican hierarchy until he retired

The archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, yesterday called for

   RIO DE JANEIRO, BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL's new President Itamar Franco has defended himself against mounting
criticism he is spending his time on trivia rather than the economic
problems confronting the country.
In his first lengthy press conference since taking office two months ago, Mr
Franco said: 'Society wants the president sometimes to put aside
macrothinking and descend to the microlevel of rents, medicines, schools and
trying to improve everyday life.'
His focus on such issues has led his administration to be labelled 'the
Cheese Muffin Republic', a reference to the muffin staple diet of Brazil's
poor.
The president was to outline his plans for government in his first national
address on Wednesday but cancelled it to visit his sick mother. Later he
made clear some of his views, declaring war on financial speculators who
have been leaving the stockmarket and buying gold and dollars. 'As long as
I'm President there will be this war without mercy.'
Referring to Mr Collor's recent comments that he was dragging Brazil into
the fifth world, Mr Franco said 'the misery we have today puts us far below
the fifth world. Two and a half years of Collor's high interest rates and
violent monetary policy have left us with deep recession and millions of
Brazilians living in absolute poverty.'
For the first time in living memory, a senior public figure has been found
guilty of corruption in Argentina. The Senate yesterday impeached Mr Alberto
Nicosia, a federal judge accused of multi-million-dollar fraud against state
companies, John Barham reports from Buenos Aires. The senators found the
judge guilty of misconduct and failing to carry out the duties of a public
official. They removed him from the bench and banned him from holding public
office.

GOVERNOR Bill Clinton yesterday set out to 'establish a good working
relationship' with Congress in a series of meetings on Capitol Hill with
leaders from both parties, focusing on health care and the best way of
combining an economic stimulus with a reduction of the budget deficit.
The US president-elect began with his own Democratic party leaders, in his
second meeting with the majority leaders since the election.
He then saw Sen Robert Dole, Republican leader in the Senate, and meetings
were also scheduled with powerful individual congressmen such as Mr Dan
Rostenkowski, who has dominated US tax policy for the past 12 years as
chairman of the ways and means committee.
Congress has in recent years developed a reputation as an institution
hamstrung by autocratic committee chairmen, incapable of passing needed
legislation, and prone to the perquisites of power.
Mr Clinton's election may open the way to more effective action, but a new
study published yesterday by two of Washington's most influential think
tanks, the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institution,
suggests more reforms are needed to the way Congress does business. 'We
think effective policy-making requires a strong president and a strong
Congress,' said Mr Thomas Mann of Brookings.
The problems of Congress reflected the weakness of party leaderships and
their lack of control over the setting of a policy agenda as well as
debating structures that 'put a premium on cheap shots,' he said.
Mr Mann and Mr Norman Ornstein of AEI urged the party caucus meetings of the
House of Representatives in December to give a mandate to each party's
leaders, and especially to the Speaker, to set a policy agenda.
Policy making in the early months of the administration will be crucial. Mr
Lawrence Summers, chief economist at the World Bank, has taken a four week
leave of absence to join Mr Bill Clinton's economic transition team.
The team, directed by Mr Robert Reich, a Harvard professor, plans to prepare
a series of detailed economic position papers to give Mr Clinton the
information he needs to make swift decisions when he assumes the presidency
in January.
Mr Summers, a leading candidate for chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers, will work on macroeconomic and fiscal policy options. Others in
this field include Mr Robert Shapiro of the Progressive Policy Institute, Mr
Robert Rubin of Goldman Sachs and Mr Roger Altman of the Blackstone
investment bank.
Other economists and associates have been assigned specific tasks during the
transition. Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a professor at the University of
California, is overseeing technology policy and manufacturing industry.
Most of Mr Clinton's economic appointments seem likely to be drawn from the
team working on policy options. He may cast the net wider for top posts such
as Treasury Secretary, for which Mr Paul Volcker, former Federal Reserve
chairman, may still be in the running.

<TEXT>
BRAZIL's new President Itamar Franco has strongly defended himself against
mounting criticism he is spending his time on trivia rather than the central
economic problems confronting the country.
In his first lengthy press conference since taking office two months ago, Mr
Franco said: 'Society wants the president sometimes to put aside
macrothinking and descend to the microlevel of rents, medicines, schools and
trying to improve everyday life.'
His focus on such issues has led his administration to be labelled 'the
Cheese Muffin Republic', a reference to the muffins that are a staple diet
of many of Brazil's poor.
The president was to outline his plans for government in his first national
address on Wednesday but cancelled it to visit his sick mother.
Instead he made clear some of his views, declaring war on financial
speculators who have been leaving the stockmarket and buying gold and
dollars. 'As long as I'm President there will be war without mercy until
they learn the productive system is more important for the country than
speculation.'
Referring to Mr Collor's recent comments that he was dragging Brazil into
the fifth world, Mr Franco said 'the misery we have today puts us far below
the fifth world. Two and a half years of Collor's high interest rates and
violent monetary policy have left us with deep recession and millions and
millions of unemployed Brazilians living in absolute poverty.'

<TEXT>
FOR the first time in living memory, a senior public figure has been found
guilty of corruption in Argentina, after the Senate yesterday impeached Mr
Alberto Nicosia, a federal judge accused of multi-million dollar fraud
against state-owned companies.
The senators found the judge guilty of misconduct and failing to carry out
the duties of a public official.
They removed him from the bench and banned him from holding public office.
Mr Nicosia was a key figure in an organisation involving other judges,
expert witnesses and defence and prosecution lawyers, who colluded with
plaintiffs suing state companies for personal loss in accidents. The judges
invariably found against the defendants and inflated their damages, which
they then shared out amongst themselves.
Ferrocarriles Argentinos, the state-owned railway company, was their
favoured target. In December 1990, a government watchdog agency reported
that the company owed legal costs and damages of about Dollars 80m. The
government has also initiated further, as yet unknown, charges against Mr
Nicosia.
Corruption is one of the principal complaints of ordinary Argentines against
the government of President Carlos Menem. The government claims it is
rooting out corruption by deregulating and privatising the economy.
Furthermore, about 20 senior government officials, including five cabinet
ministers, have been sacked in corruption-related scandals.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Stars and Stripes for Puerto Rico?: Islanders will vote on
whether to join the union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL decades of debates about Puerto Rico's political status will end
within 12 months when the 3m people of the US possession in the Caribbean
will vote on whether they want to retain their current 'commonwealth'
relationship with Washington, become a state of the union, or be politically
independent.
Dr Pedro Rossello, the governor-elect of Puerto Rico who will take office in
January, has promised that a long-awaited plebiscite on the issue will be
held next year. The result, he says, will be taken to the US Congress for
approval.
In December 1991, Puerto Ricans rejected a referendum seeking to maintain
the island's autonomy. The issue of what status they do support has since
been left open.
Puerto Rico is officially described as having a 'freely associated'
relationship with the US. Puerto Ricans are US citizens, but cannot vote for
a president. The island's representation in Washington is limited to a
commissioner who has no vote to influence legislation.
Dr Rossello, the candidate of the New Progressive Party, won the island's
gubernatorial election earlier this month with 50 per cent of the votes
cast. His main rival, Mrs Victoria Munoz Mendoza of the Popular Democratic
Party, received 46 per cent, with Mr Fernando Martin of the Puerto Rican
Independence Party being supported by just 4 per cent.
There is little support for political independence, as indicated by the
Independence Party's showing, and the impending plebiscite is expected to
determine whether Puerto Ricans want to continue and enhance their current
status, or become a state of the union.
Dr Rossello's NPP has consistently advocated statehood, but Puerto Rican
analysts have cautioned that votes cast in the referendum will cut across
party political lines.
Dr Rossello's decision that the issue of the island's status must be decided
soon is an apparent attempt to determine definitively a matter which has
been the object of sometimes trenchant debate.
Although the governor-elect will present the result of the referendum to
Washington as a fait accompli, any decision by the US Congress will be
affected by considerations such as Puerto Rico's geopolitical and strategic
value to Washington. The island, at the north-eastern end of the Caribbean
archipelago, is host to a large US naval base.
Puerto Ricans' decision about their political future will turn on economics.
The current 'commonwealth' status has allowed the island's economy an
advantage under Section 936 of the US revenue code which encourages mainland
companies with subsidiaries in Puerto Rico to deposit their profits in local
banks. Totalling about Dollars 15bn (Pounds 9.9bn), these have assisted
economic growth and stability.
The economy also benefits from federal welfare funds of about Dollars 4bn a
year and receives hundreds of millions of dollars from rebates of federal
excise taxes and duties collected on exports such as rum.
Support for the political options for the island will be determined largely
by whether Puerto Ricans feel that this level of financial support will be
available to them if they vote for statehood, and whether the economy can do
without it.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RUN OF encouraging US economic news was broken yesterday by reports of an
unexpected decline in housing starts in October and a sharp rise in weekly
claims for unemployment insurance early this month, writes Michael Prowse
from Washington.
The Commerce Department said housing starts fell 1.1 per cent between
September and October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.23m units.
The decline was broadly based with fewer starts in all regions except the
Midwest. The figures, however, tend to be volatile on a monthly basis.
The number of people making new claims for state unemployment insurance rose
31,000 to 386,000 in the week ending November 7, the largest increase in
three months. The jump came as a surprise after weeks of steady declines.

FT  20 NOV 92 / World Trade News: US, EC claim 'progress' on oilseeds deal
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE NEGOTIATORS from the US and European Community ended crucial talks in
Washington last night, with both sides claiming to have made 'very good
progress'.
The discussions were aimed at averting a transatlantic trade war over
European oilseed subsidies and at reviving stalled Uruguay Round talks on
world trade liberalisation.
Officials said that the US-EC talks would continue at a later date, though
it was not disclosed when.
The two sides are negotiating under a deadline, as US punitive sanctions
against some European goods are due to come into force on December 5 in
retaliation for European subsidies to oilseeds farmers.
In a brief but upbeat statement both sides insisted that 'very good
progress' had been made in the talks, which began on Wednesday night.
Mrs Carla Hills, the US Trade Representative, said: 'We are very close
together and we are going to continue to work. We will meet again as soon as
possible. We have to gather some other data.'
Mr Frans Andriessen, the EC external affairs commissioner, said: 'We have
had a good consultation which contributed to finding solutions to points we
still have to settle between us.'
Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC's agriculture commissioner, said: 'We are almost at
an agreement.'
Earlier, after Wednesday night's session, the sides said they had been far
apart on critical issues. Differences included:
A significant gap between proposed US and EC ceilings on oilseeds
production;
Whether or not oilseeds grown for industrial use on set-aside land should be
included in the deal;
EC refusal to accept a formal or binding enforcement mechanism to ensure
corrective action and compensation if EC farmers overshoot output ceilings.
As the two sides resumed talks yesterday, Mrs Hills said she wanted above
all to be able to announce agreement by the time talks ended last night.
Meanwhile, tempers flared elsewhere. Some 300 French farmers burned the US
flag and hurled fireworks over police lines barring them from the US embassy
in Paris.
Twenty police were injured in the clash, intended to put pressure on the EC
'not to allow the US to step on our feet and sacrifice European and French
agriculture'. In Washington, Mr Steve Yoder, American Soyabean Association
president, and a leading lobbyist against the EC oilseeds regime, said he
was 'disgusted' by the French farmers.
France would not be mollified by any US concessions in the non-farm aspects
of the Gatt talks into accepting what it saw as a bad farm trade deal, Mr
Jean-Pierre Soisson, French agriculture minister, said.
Despite the demonstrations in Paris, President Francois Mitterrand is
keeping his counsel on whether to invoke a last-resort veto of an agreement
in Washington.
'This (the Gatt) is one of the hardest dossiers I have had to deal with
since 1951,' he was quoted as telling his cabinet. Mr Mitterrand clearly
fears an EC crisis if he vetoes a Gatt deal, and a domestic crisis if he
does not. Mr Soisson said yesterday an eventual French veto in the EC
Council of Ministers was for the president to decide.
Mr Soisson said that while France wanted progress in the Gatt areas of
services, market access and copyright protection, it would not be bought off
by concessions here. 'The agricultural chapter must be improved, and the
whole book be made readable,' he added. France would not agree to a rushed
Gatt agreement, he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANXIOUSLY awaiting the outcome of yesterday's US-EC farm trade talks in
Washington was Mr Clayton Yeutter, former US trade representative, and one
of the midwives at the birth of the trade talks in Uruguay in 1986.
Mr Yeutter brought the case against EC oilseeds subsidies to Geneva in 1987,
against the urging of Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, who
told him the EC would soon alter its subsidy programme. 'I told MacSharry
that with the size of the subsidies offered, I'd grow oilseeds on the top of
the Alps,' Mr Yeutter says.
'At leisure' since President Bush lost the presidential election on November
3, Mr Yeutter went on to become agriculture secretary, Republican party
chairman, and a White House adviser. 'MacSharry wanted to change the
programme. He just didn't get it done,' he says.' This is no minor dispute
that can be held on the backburner for years.'
With no breakthrough soon, time will run out on the Uruguay Round. The US
president loses his 'fast-track' authority to negotiate after March 1. Mr
Yeutter believes the Democratic Congress could well extend President
Clinton's negotiating authority, but waiting entails risks. Congress is
likely to attach protectionist constraints to the legislation.
In his first appearance on the international trade stage, President Clinton
would be under pressure, Mr Yeutter said, not to 'give away the store'.
Because he is likely to 'take on' his labour supporters to get approval of
the North American Free Trade Agreement, 'he will have to give them
something in the Uruguay Round context'. That is likely to be labour rights.
There would be months of delays while a new US negotiating team is prepared
to continue Uruguay Round negotiations.

FT  20 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Steel dumping duties upset E Europe -
Critics say the EC is using outdated criteria to hobble the most promising
industries

<TEXT>
THE European Commission's decision to impose anti-dumping duties on seamless
steel tube imports from Croatia and the three central European countries
with which it has signed association agreements has aroused predictable
anger in the affected countries.
By imposing the highest duty, 30.4 per cent, on Czechoslovakia the
commission clearly identified what it perceives as the main offender. But Mr
Vladimir Petr, director of the metallurgical department of the Czech
Ministry of Industry, questioned the Commission's figures and said the case
for dumping was 'not proven'.
The point was made more forcibly by Mr Philip Toor, managing director of
Future Steel trading, a principal UK importer of Czechoslovak steel. 'Prices
on west European markets are determined by EC producers undercutting each
other against the backdrop of a 19m-26m ton surplus steel capacity among EC
producers. East European exporters are still far too small to be market
makers. They are just a soft target for EC producers anxious to cut down the
competition.'
Producers and traders are not alone, however, in criticising the latest
protectionist move against steel products, one of the most sensitive of the
trilogy of east European products, with textiles and foodstuffs, subject to
special treatment in deference to EC sensibilities.
'The latest dumping duties appear to have been imposed using the old
criteria, applied when all prices in the former centrally planned economies
were artificial and judgments about the degree of dumping were formed by
comparison with prices from third countries. Eight months after the the EC
signed association agreements with Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland which
apparently liberalised the steel trade we see the Community being
bloody-minded at the first hurdle,' says Mr Jim Rollo, an east-west trade
specialist at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London. 'If
they do this for steel now what will they do for electronics imports in
future?'
According to the Commission, east European pipe exports have risen from 7.8
per cent of the market in 1988 to 18 per cent this year, contributing to the
closure of 11 EC tube mills over the last two years.
Czechoslovakia has three steel plants with tube-making capacity at
Vitkovice, Ostrava and Chomutov. The value of its tube exports to EC markets
rose from Dollars 26m (Pounds 17.2m) in 1989 to Dollars 45m last year and
Dollars 59m over the first nine months of this year.
While most exports have come from Czechoslovakia and Poland, Hungary, a
relatively small producer, incurred the second highest duty, at 21.7 per
cent. The Hungarians are particularly incensed at this latest example of
what is widely seen as the EC's tendency to talk grandly about helping
central Europe while hobbling those industries with the greatest trade
potential.
Hungarian officials say the local industry enforced a self-imposed reduction
in pipe exports to around 22,000 tons this year compared with 40,000 tons in
1991, precisely in order to ward off damaging EC protectionist measures.
Hungary has only one seamless tube producer, the Csepel Steel Mill, which
traditionally exported 90 per cent of its products to the former Soviet
Union. According to Mr Bela Simon, the managing director, Csepel has managed
to regain much of that market in recent months, ironically, against
competition from cheap Czechoslovak products both at home and abroad.
The penetration of western markets by private traders has been assisted by
under-valued currencies. Czechoslovakia in particular argues its
competitiveness in western markets is not a function of dumping but of a
currency whose value is depressed in part because of uncertainty ahead of
January's expected separation of Czech and Slovak republics.
Currency factors are less important in the Polish and Hungarian cases, while
Poland, like Czechoslovakia, still provides an element of subsidy to the
steel industry through low energy prices. Such subsidies are being rapidly
phased out.
At the root of east European competitiveness is a cocktail of factors -
cheap labour at wage rates around 10 per cent of western levels, undervalued
currencies, cheap energy and raw materials from the former Soviet Union, and
the collapse of domestic demand and inter-Comecon trade.
But circumstances are changing fast. Ukraine is one of the main sources of
iron ore for steel mills in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. It
also produced 7m of the 22m tons of steel tubes made before the former
Soviet Union collapsed.
Since Ukraine decided this month to withdraw from the rouble zone, however,
Russia has indicated that future oil and other energy deliveries to the
Ukraine will be at world market prices. This will force Kiev to raise the
price of iron pellets to central European plants whose own energy cost
advantages are also fast disappearing.
This leaves cheap labour and a desperate need for higher exports as the main
driving force behind higher sales to a European Community whose own future
exports to the region depend on an export-led recovery in east and central
Europe - which the latest anti-dumping measures contradict.

PLANS to set up Poland's first industrial enterprise zone at Mielec, site of

officials to granting the necessary financial incentives.
Samuel Montagu Financial Services say the initial cost of allowing tax
concessions and paying unemployment benefit will reach Zloty 135bn (Pounds

The plan has been authorised by the industry ministry whose head, Mr Waclaw
Niewiarowski, is to meet striking workers today. The aircraft works, which
once employed 22,000 people, now has 9,850 on its payroll. A further 4,500
are to be dismissed within months.
Workers are demanding restructuring proposals for the plant, suffering from
collapse of the Soviet market.

<TEXT>
THE South African government yesterday rejected evidence from a judicial
commission suggesting that the army plotted to undermine the African
National Congress (ANC), and criticised the respected judge who heads the
commission for making 'wild statements', writes Patti Waldmeir in
Johannesburg.
A government spokesman said Pretoria did not believe any abuse had taken
place, but promised punishment if any security force members were found to
have acted against the political opposition.
The government's hardline response to Judge Richard Goldstone's finding  -
including harsh criticism of the judge himself - will not enhance Pretoria's
reputation for probity in the matter of alleged security force involvement
in violence.
Signs of intransigence from Pretoria contrasted with the conciliatory tone
yesterday adopted by the ANC, which announced that its policy-making
National Working Committee had adopted a controversial plan for
power-sharing in a post-apartheid government. The decision was a major
success for ANC moderates, and came only after fierce debate.
The ANC condemned the decision of Mr F W de Klerk, the president, to launch
an internal inquiry into intelligence operations, to be headed by the second
in command of the South African Defence Force, Lt-Gen Pierre Steyn. Gen
Steyn is to conduct his investigation in parallel with Judge Goldstone,
whose commission of enquiry into violence announced on Monday that it had
found evidence of a military intelligence plot to discredit the ANC.
The ANC said: 'Once more, secrecy is the order of the day ..the public will
only be told what it is thought they ought to know.'

THAI investors staged noisy protests outside the Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) for the second day running yesterday as share prices continued to
plunge in response to government moves to control speculators.
The SET index fell 3.9 per cent, or 33.87 points, to close at 834.17
yesterday, making a cumulative decline of more than 13 per cent since it
peaked two weeks ago.
Foreign stockbrokers believe rising corporate profits and an economy growing
at about 8 per cent a year will soon push share prices up again, but many
Thai investors fear the once lively market has been weakened by official
moves to curb speculation.
On Wednesday, the six-month-old Securities and Exchange Commission filed
charges against Mr Song Watcharasriroj, a 35-year-old speculator known as
Sia Song, for allegedly manipulating the price of shares in Bangkok Bank of
Commerce in collaboration with a group of associates.
Mr Song, who could face a fine or imprisonment for up to two years, denied
the charges. He also said that before being arrested and released on bail he
had agreed to a request by Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, the finance minister,
to stop trading for a week.
'It's unfair to arrest me after I've already agreed to stop,' he said.
Investors were apparently unimpressed by official announcements that the
government-controlled Krung Thai Bank and a group of stockbrokers had been
directed to inject a total of Bt15bn (Pounds 39m) into a fund to buy shares
and stabilise the market.
'I think it will take a few days before they can mobilise such a large
amount of money,' said one stockbroker yesterday.
Angry speculators and investors exchanged facsimile messages attacking the
finance ministry and the managements of the SEC and the SET.
Demonstrators outside the SET in central Bangkok called for the resignation
of Mr Seri Chintanaseri, SET president.
On a busy day Bangkok brokerage houses resemble British bookmakers on the
day of the Grand National, with everyone from housewives to executives
crowding round the screens to watch their favourites and place their bets.
In an attempt to stop the market overheating, the central bank and the
finance ministry have forced brokers to restrict the credit they extend to
their clients to buy shares.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Insecurities come to haunt Singapore's top men: Kieran Cooke
looks at the fears within the ruling People's Action Party that protest may
grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been an eventful and somewhat macabre week in the normally placid
world of Singapore politics.
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong made an urgent appeal last Sunday for new
political talent to step forward. His cabinet, he said, was ageing and had
to be revitalised.
The next day, it was announced that two of the island republic's most senior
political figures, Mr Ong Teng Cheong, first deputy prime minister, and Mr
Lee Hsien Loong, second deputy prime minister and minister for trade and
industry, were suffering from cancer. The statement said that the disease
had been detected early and that chances for successful treatment were
excellent.
There has been obvious compassion for the men, mixed with surprise at the
way in which the illnesses were announced simultaneously, but, above all,
the statement led to renewed speculation about the future direction of
Singapore's politics.
Mr Lee, 40, is the son of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the man who dominated almost
every aspect of Singapore life for much of the last 40 years and who, in
1990 stepped down as prime minister to be succeeded by his deputy, Mr Goh
Chok Tong.
The received wisdom was that Mr Goh would merely serve time before a
resumption of the Lee dynasty, that the younger Lee would at some
unspecified date take the helm.
Though officials say the younger Lee, now undergoing chemotherapy treatment,
is likely to resume his ministerial duties shortly, uncertainty about his
future has caused political nervousness.
Since independence from British colonial rule, Singapore's politics has been
remarkably stable, with the People's Action Party (PAP), formed in the early
1950s as an anti-colonial party, exercising almost complete dominance and
for many years controlling every seat in parliament. Under the party's
guidance, Singapore has been transformed into a well-developed country with
one of the highest standards of living in Asia.
Yet, despite its achievements, the party has noticeable insecurities. It was
fashioned in Mr Lee Kuan Yew's image, and, as Mr Raj Vasil, a writer on
Singapore politics, says, the elder Lee is the party in the eyes of
Singaporeans: 'The PAP does not have much of an identity independent of the
(then) prime minister and the government headed by him. Its image, identity
and appeal are almost entirely derived from the personality of the prime
minister ..' His departure was traumatic.
Mr Goh has tried to bring in a more open style of government, introducing a
limited degree of glasnost, allowing Singapore's carefully controlled
citizens to view slightly risque films and permitting a small measure of
dissent. But he has found it exceptionally difficult to fill Mr Lee's shoes.
Mr Lee, now entitled senior minister, still exercises a great deal of
influence, retaining his post as PAP secretary general.
Mr Goh, seeking a popular mandate, called a surprise election last year. The
PAP was returned to power, winning 77 of the 81 parliamentary seats, but the
fact that some form of opposition, however small and disunited, was emerging
was seen as a near disaster for Mr Goh and his party.
A popular interpretation of the election was that Singaporeans felt nervous
under the more relaxed regime of Mr Goh: only when the younger Lee - stamped
in the same no-nonsense, authoritarian style as his father - put a firm hand
on the helm would the party's complete dominance be re-established.
But a degree of popular unhappiness with the party had set in well before Mr
Goh's ascendancy. While many able technocrats were recruited to PAP ranks,
few figures with any noticeable political talent emerged. 'A lot of yes-men
and sycophants were nurtured under Lee,' says one political analyst. 'He
only has himself to blame if there are no real personalities to succeed
him.'
The party tended to concentrate too much on the mainly English-educated,
increasingly affluent middle class. The views of the people on the housing
estates - mainly the Chinese-educated who were finding life increasingly
expensive and hard - were being largely ignored.
Both the younger Lee and Mr Ong are key figures in regaining support among
this group. They are among the few government ministers who speak Mandarin
fluently and read the Chinese-language newspapers. While Mr Lee is seen as
arrogant and is not a particularly popular figure, he is respected as a
gifted and able minister. Mr Ong, as head of the Singapore Trades Union
Congress, provides important contact with working-class voters.
Mr Goh has promised a number of by-elections in the near future, and the
small, fragmented opposition is unlikely to pose any serious challenge. Yet
the PAP is deeply concerned about a rising protest vote.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Patten's proposals face testing time: Alexander Nicoll and
Simon Holberton look at HK's democratic aspirations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX weeks after Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, unveiled his plans
for broader democracy, the gulf between London and Beijing which they have
opened shows little sign of being narrowed.
A round of diplomatic activity in London this week saw Britain, China and Mr
Patten himself spelling out their positions - and the governor winning
strong backing from Mr John Major, the prime minister. But no further
discussions with the Chinese are planned beyond regularly scheduled contacts
between London, Beijing and Hong Kong.
Though Mr Patten has called repeatedly for discussions and invited Beijing
to produce alternative proposals, there appears to be a growing prospect
that there will be little or no dialogue. That would leave Hong Kong to make
arrangements for the 1995 Legislative Council (Legco) elections without
knowing whether Beijing will, as it has threatened, reverse them when it
assumes sovereignty over the territory in 1997.
China's frustration at what it sees as Britain's duplicity, evident from
vitriolic attacks on Mr Patten and snubs when he visited Beijing, was made
even plainer during a visit to Britain by Zhu Rongji, a vice premier and
Politburo member.
Though he has no direct responsibility for Hong Kong, Zhu went out of his
way to express the depth of Beijing's disgust and its belief that London has
gone back on agreements.
He indicated that China could allow the dispute to spread into other
bilateral links, and caused alarm in Hong Kong when he said: 'People cannot
help asking the question whether we still have to stick to the Sino-British
Joint Declaration and whether the understanding reached between the Chinese
and British sides is to be allowed to be scattered to the winds.'
China is not alone in being rattled by Mr Patten's decision - backed by his
former cabinet colleagues in London - to stop treating Beijing with kid
gloves and attempt to deal with it in much the same way as with any other
country.
Some British officials who were involved in previous negotiations with
Beijing are quietly shaking their heads at the abandonment of a
non-confrontational approach. They fear that Mr Patten has precipitated a
serious crisis.
His supporters dismiss such worries as springing from what they see as the
former tendency of the British government, under the influence of Sinologist
academics, to view Hong Kong as a relatively small factor in an overall
UK/China relationship. This was thought to have led London to give too much
away to Beijing on Hong Kong.
Instead, the governor's backers point to the importance of Hong Kong to
China - it would represent 18 per cent of China's economy and economic ties
with the mainland are constantly growing. Though there can be no certainty
that Beijing would subordinate its political worries to its economic
interests, they at least believe Hong Kong is dealing from a position of
greater strength than was previously assumed.
Mr Patten has repeatedly argued that he is seeking to implement the 1984
Joint Declaration on Hong Kong's future; that he had to produce proposals
because the Basic Law, Hong Kong's Beijing-drafted post-1997 constitution,
was silent on the 1995 elections; that they are modest and do not contravene
the Basic Law or Joint Declaration; that a smooth transition to Chinese rule
is the aim.
However, though Britain insists that there has been no policy change on Hong
Kong, Mr Patten clearly wants to meet popular aspirations to greater
democracy as much as he can, and to a degree previously not thought possible
in London.
China's concern is to keep the development of democracy, and particularly
the involvement of vocal liberals, to a minimum. Mr Patten has succeeded in
bringing the democracy campaigners behind his plans, even though proposed
arrangements fall well short both of what they wanted and of full democracy.
The danger, however, is that support within Hong Kong - Mr Patten's trump
card and the basis for his policy - will ebb as fears grow about the dangers
of confrontation with Beijing. Some businessmen are already showing their
concern.
Opinion polls show the electorate supporting his plans, and LegCo last week
broadly endorsed them. However, there will not be a final LegCo vote on them
until the late spring of 1993. In the meantime, China can be expected to
exert pressure on opinion makers.
The stock market jitters resulting from Zhu's remarks strengthened the
worries of Mr Patten's opponents in business and political circles about the
effect of a stalemate in Sino-British relations on investment in Hong Kong.
Yesterday's decision to push ahead with the platform contract for the
colony's new airport may bolster confidence. Proceeding with the contract
means the project remains on schedule for opening in 1997 even though China
has yet to agree to financing plans. The government says it will prevent
cost overruns.
British officials told the Chinese that Hong Kong had no intention of
pursuing a 'go it alone' policy on the airport and that it still seeks a
comprehensive settlement to the financing of the HKDollars 175bn project.
Yesterday, Hong Kong officials said there was no question of the government
awarding contracts which require China's consent without Beijing's approval.
However, some influential businessmen in Hong Kong doubt the wisdom of
moving ahead with the airport platform contract at such a sensitive time.
They feel it will only invite negative Chinese reaction - which has been
promised - at a time when all efforts should be directed to mending fences
with Beijing.
The airport talks could be the main channel for negotiations with Beijing in
the coming months. But there is a growing feeling in Hong Kong that Beijing
will not produce counter-proposals on the electoral arrangements.
Mr Patten has staked his governorship on his constitutional plans and has
won the support of Australia, Canada and the US for them. But he may find
that the wisdom of his 'have-a-go' approach will increasingly be questioned
in Hong Kong if there is no sign of rapprochement with Beijing.
The way remains open for an increasingly mature political community in Hong
Kong to produce alternative suggestions if their concerns about Mr Patten's
proposals mount. If he were to be forced to compromise, it could be with
them - and this would eventually allow him an honourable way to give ground.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Japanese guru starts pressure group

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kenichi Ohmae, Japan's most famous management guru, plans an attempt to
break the mould of Japanese politics by launching a pressure group to
champion the cause of radical political reform.
Mr Ohmae, chairman of the Japanese operations of McKinsey and Co, management
consultants, is a household name in Japanese business after publishing more
than 30 books on management.
He describes his group, dubbed The Reform of Heisei, as a grass-roots
organisation which will offer a third choice between the ruling Liberal
Democratic party and the Socialist parties.
The grouping will promote the reform of Japan's political institutions by
offering to support politicians who endorse its goals. A reform of the
electoral system widely blamed for encouraging politicians to seek illegal
corporate donations is likely to be a central issue for the group.
Mr Ohmae was named the nation's most influential leader of public opinion by
a recent survey of more than 700 prominent Japanese.
Mr Ohmae's group is unlikely to stage a significant challenge but it could
provide a focal point for the public outcry of the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin
scandal which has exposed links between LDP leaders, allegedly corrupt
businessmen and organised crime syndicates. The initiative is likely to put
pressure on the LDP to offer more far-reaching proposals for political
reform.
The scandal has led to a vicious power struggle within the LDP. A two-week
stalemate between the LDP and the opposition parties over which LDP leaders
should testify to the parliament over their involvement in the affair has
delayed passage of the supplementary budget needed to implement the
Y10,700bn (Pounds 57bn) emergency spending package announced in August.
There were signs last night that the parties were edging towards a
compromise on the testimony issue to allow debate on the budget to proceed.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Decline in land prices accelerates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAND prices in Japan's largest cities have fallen by about a fifth in the
last six months, threatening to exacerbate the Japanese banks' mounting
problems with non-performing loans to real estate developers, according to a
report published yesterday.
The report by the Japan Real Estate Institute said that commercial land
prices fell at an annual rate of 22.5 per cent in the six largest cities,
Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka and Kobe in the six months to the end
of September. Residential land prices in these cities fell by about 20.5 per
cent.
The institute said the falls were the worst results since it started the
survey in 1936.
The continued fall in land prices will eat into more of the collateral used
for many of the real estate loans which the banks made during the boom in
land speculation in the late 1980s. The collapse in real estate prices is
the main reason for the sharp rise in the bank's non-performing loans over
the past year.
In the six months to September non-performing loans held by the top 21
Japanese banks rose by more than 50 per cent to Y12,000bn (Pounds 63bn).
This increase largely reflects last year's fall in the property market, when
average residential land prices for the six largest cities fell by 9.7 per
cent. The acceleration in the rate of decline in land prices means the banks
bad debts will continue to rise for the foreseeable future.
Senior bankers admit the amount of non-performing loans is still rising
rapidly.
The findings of the report, based on a survey of 22,000 sites in 223 cities,
suggests the government's public works programme, which includes measures to
bring forward purchases of land for public infrastructure schemes, has had
little impact on prices.
Average land prices throughout Japan fell by 2.6 per cent in the six months
to the end of September, with residential prices down 2.5 per cent and
commercial prices down 3.3 per cent.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Yeltsin halts North Korean military aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, seeking to cement ties with South
Korea, said yesterday his country was suspending military aid to North
Korea.
In a speech to the South Korean parliament, he also said that Russia could
stop building submarines, a key component of its naval arsenal, within the
next three years.
He said Moscow would sharply cut its armed forces in the Far East to help
contribute to better relations. 'I think that in two or three years' time we
will stop making submarines for military purposes,' he said, departing from
the text of his prepared speech to parliament. He also hinted broadly Russia
would consider selling weapons to South Korea.
Mr Yeltsin, on his first official trip to an Asian country, is pressing hard
to transform ties with a strategically vital region and potential source of
hard currency.
He tried to bury the contentious past, returning to Seoul the flight
recorders from a South Korean airliner shot down by a Soviet warplane in
1983 with the loss of 269 lives.
Seoul is seeking Russian help in persuading North Korea to accept nuclear
inspections and renew progress toward unification. But Russia's reduced
military ties and falling trade with North Korea are likely to weaken its
leverage with Pyongyang. Russia has already ended the supply of nuclear
materials and technology to North Korea, Mr Yeltsin told Mr Roh Tae-woo, the
South Korean president.
Moscow is now curtailing arms shipments to Pyongyang, including the supply
of MiG-29 combat aircraft being assembled in the North.
Mr Roh asked Mr Yeltsin, who will visit Beijing next month, to urge China to
take a more active role in resolving the Korean question. North Korea's
trade patterns last year were governed by a search for new oil supplies to
compensate for falling petroleum shipments from the former Soviet Union,
Kotra, the Seoul-based Korea trade promotion agency, said yesterday.
Soviet oil supplies and its shipment of machinery and industrial facilities
to North Korea fell last year after Moscow demanded cash payments for these
goods, which were formerly settled through open account arrangements.

The murder removed probably the most skilled military organiser for the

The murder occurred as Tajikistan, the former Soviet Union's most unstable

controlled by the anti-Communist coalition.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Germany slows fall in Europe's new car sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW car sales in west Europe were boosted last month by an increase of
around 5 per cent in registrations in Germany, the biggest single market in
Europe.
The rise in Germany helped to compensate for falls in many of the small and
medium-sized European markets and left sales in October virtually unchanged
from the same month a year ago at 1.068m, an increase of 0.1 per cent.
According to industry estimates new car sales in west Europe in the first 10
months of the year totalled 11.56m, a decline of 1.4 per cent from the
corresponding period a year ago.
New car registrations in Germany in the last couple of months have not yet
begun to reflect the steep decline in new orders experienced by car makers
since the summer.
The most recent industry forecasts suggest that new car sales in Germany
could fall by around 11 per cent in 1993.
In the first 10 months of this year German new car sales are estimated to
have fallen by 8 per cent to 3.36m from the record level reached in 1991 in
the wake of reunification.
Current forecasts suggest that west European new car sales could fall by
around 3.5 per cent next year, chiefly under the impact of falling demand in
Germany and in Italy. The weakening trend is already clear in Italy where
sales in October fell by 2.9 per cent year-on-year, the third consecutive
monthly fall. In the first 10 months of the year new car sales in Italy were
still 3.3 per cent higher than a year ago.
Sales have also been weakening in Spain, where new car demand in October
fell by 9.1 per cent.
In the first 10 months new car sales in Spain were still 10.9 per cent
higher than a year ago. Sales in France in October were unchanged.
In the UK, new car sales rose year-on-year by 8.2 per cent last month, but
almost all of the boost came from the fleet sector. In the first 10 months
sales were still 1.9 per cent below last year's already very depressed
level.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Ireland turns to thoughts of Spring: Tim Coone reports on
why the Labour party leader is riding high in the opinion polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LANKY, bespectacled figure, with a neatly clipped moustache, a firm
handshake, and an air of gravitas, swept through north Dublin's street
markets and shopping malls this week . . . with a promise of change.
Mr Dick Spring, the leader of the Irish Labour party, has serious ambitions
of becoming the country's next prime minister. Riding high in the opinion
polls, he has signalled to other party leaders that any discussions on
coalition government after next week's general election will have to include
the possibility of shared leadership if Labour is to join in.
On current poll projections, it is likely that neither Prime Minister Albert
Reynolds' Fianna Fail nor Fine Gael, the two main parties, will win enough
seats to form a government in the 166-seat Dail (parliament) on its own, nor
with any of the smaller parties that have indicated a willingness to join a
coalition.
Barring a last-minute blunder, it is probable that Labour will hold the
balance of power with 20-25 seats, against 70-75 for Fianna Fail and maybe
50-55 for Fine Gael.
Polling only 6.4 per cent and 9.5 per cent in the 1987 and 1989
parliamentary elections respectively, Labour had its big breakthrough in the
1990 presidential election, when Mrs Mary Robinson, the Labour-backed
candidate, won with 53 per cent of the vote.
Although her victory is accepted as a one-off result, the positive image she
has projected as president and her well-known liberal stance on women's and
civil rights are generally acknowledged as factors behind Labour's current
good standing at 19 per cent in the polls.
Mr Spring's own high parliamentary profile, as a latter-day Don Quixote
tilting at the windmills of corruption in high places, and the champion of
the unemployed, has given him a personal popularity rating of almost 70 per
cent, more than 30 points ahead any other party leader, and at least 42
points ahead of Mr Reynolds.
Mr Spring says: 'I now have the confidence to say that Labour will make the
most important breakthrough it has ever made, which will break the mould of
traditional concepts of Irish politics which are still rooted in the civil
war (of the 1920s).'
One of the key battlegrounds will be Dublin, where Labour has almost caught
up with Fianna Fail in the opinion polls, and where it hopes to pick up
seven new seats.
The Dublin Central constituency, a poor working-class district, is a key
marginal where Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, is defending his Dail
seat. It is a Fianna Fail heartland, but boundary changes since the last
election have given Labour a strong chance of winning one of two seats held
by Fianna Fail.
Mr Spring's name is not exactly a household one. 'Who's that?' asked a group
of grimy-faced children who beg for money from the photographers who swarm
around Mr Spring. He is also less than universally popular. 'He only comes
down here when he wants our votes]' a man shouts out. However, his reception
is usually overwhelmingly welcoming. People approach him to wish him well.
'I'll take two-to-one-on for 30 seats,' grins an elderly man coming out of a
betting shop. Another elderly man who complains of the health service says:
'I usually vote Fine Gael but I think I'll give yer man a try this time.'
A pensioner and life-long Fianna Fail supporter says she will be voting
Labour: 'It's the unemployment, the jobs. This lot haven't done anything, so
it's time to give the others a chance. They can't do any worse.'
Mr Spring presses on with his message that his party will bring probity to
government, tackle unemployment and improve housing, health and the schools.
At a primary school housed in 20-year-old prefabricated buildings on the
grounds of the Education Ministry, he surveys the peeling paintwork, missing
gutterwork and rotting windowframes.
He promises the teachers and parents who have gathered to meet him that a
government in which he participated would rebuild the school. Presenting him
proudly to her class, a teacher asks: 'Does anyone know who this man is?'
After a moment's silence, one small child ventures 'John Major?'

<TEXT>
THE Romanian parliament yesterday accepted a new cabinet led by Prime
Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu and committed to gentler reforms.
The cabinet is dominated by the Democratic National Salvation Front (DNSF)
which won 28 per cent of the vote in September's elections. It includes
several junior ministers who served in the communist era and favours a
slower reform.
However, the cabinet is weighted towards the party's younger wing and brings
many newcomers to the government. It also includes some reform-minded
independents, such as Mr Misu Negritoiu, who will be deputy prime minister
in charge of economic reforms.
Romanian nationalist parties which captured 12 per cent of the vote did not,
as feared by many, win cabinet posts.
The democratic convention, a coalition of anti-communist parties which came
second in the polls, voted against the government because it said it failed
to present concrete economic policies.
Mr Vacaroiu said he would not present a long-term strategy for four months.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Doubts over EC steel aid proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN steelmakers yesterday gave a cautious welcome to Commission plans
to support restructuring of the industry.
However, Commission and national officials voiced doubts about the sums of
EC money available to help steel producers, which are suffering from the
economic downturn, competition from cheap non-EC imports and over-capacity.
Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, said on Wednesday that up to
Ecu900m (Pounds 731m) could be available to the industry over three years,
half from Community funds and half from member states.
But Commission officials pointed out yesterday that only Ecu240m of the
Brussels plan was new money, and it was unclear whether EC members would
agree to match that funding.
'If the finance ministers are not ready to do anything our contribution will
obviously go down too,' said one Commission official.
Eurofer, the European steel industry federation, called on the governments
of member states 'to respect their responsibilities ..by making available at
least the same amount' as the Commission. Under coal and steel treaty rules,
funding by the Commission for national industries depends on equal or
greater funding from the member state concerned.
EC industry ministers will discuss the plan on Tuesday, but they will not be
required to take a formal decision.
Other elements of the plan include strengthening protection against cheap
non-EC imports and examining where capacity cuts have to be made.
British Steel said the Brussels plan was a step in the right direction.
It would be discussing with the UK government and the Commission how to
ensure that the plan achieved the necessary restructuring and was adequate
to deal with East European imports.
A major continental steel company said it was clear that the Commission was
now 'more conscious' of the steel industry's problems, and recognised that
the influence of eastern European imports could damage the market.
But steel producers are still anxiously awaiting the result of Tuesday's EC
industry ministers meeting, which will discuss a controversial plan by
Spain's state steel industry to rebuild a steel mill at Sestoa in northern
Spain.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Unions offer Kohl a deal on reviving east Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S leading trade unions have presented the government with a list of
measures to preserve and revive the east German economy, in exchange for a
'solidarity pact' to restrain their wage demands.
At a private meeting on Monday, the union leaders warned Chancellor Helmut
Kohl that he must introduce a comprehensive industrial policy to preserve
key enterprises in east Germany's manufacturing base, even if they cannot be
privatised.
The German government must also extend its current costly labour market
measures - such as job-creation schemes, and huge retraining programmes -
and embark on new programmes to promote east German products in the west and
in eastern Europe.
They also called for concerted action from the German government, and other
western industrialised states, to revive international economic activity,
and for clear relaxation of monetary policy by the German Bundesbank, to
stimulate economic growth and curb rising unemployment.
The trade union position was spelt out at a meeting in the chancellor's
office on Monday night, which involved Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of IG
Metall, the giant engineering workers' union, Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies of the
oTV public sector union, Mr Hermann Rappe of IG Chemie, the chemical workers
union, and Mr Heinz-Werner Meyer, chairman of the DGB union federation.
News of the meeting, the first top-level talks to negotiate Mr Kohl's
planned solidarity pact, leaked out yesterday, prompting bitter
recriminations within the government. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister
who attended, accused his colleague Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics
minister, of 'wild garrulousness', for allegedly letting out the secret.
From the union side, Mr Steinkuhler refused to give away any details, but
expressed disappointment that the government had failed to present any clear
ideas of its own on the content of the planned pact.
The union leaders are under some pressure for participating at all, with a
sharp attack yesterday from Mr Detlef Hensche, leader of the hard-left union
IG Medien, representing printing workers, for taking part in 'secret
diplomacy.'
The trade union platform goes far beyond what the German government has been
ready to do so far to support lame-duck industries in the east, and would
require the maintenance of at least the present massive subsidies, running
at a net flow of some DM150bn (Pounds 62bn) a year from west to east.
The question now is how far Mr Kohl is prepared to compromise his
market-oriented approach in order to win trade union support for the
solidarity pact.
But the very fact that the talks have begun, and that both sides apparently
agreed to keep them secret, suggests both are interested in a deal.
Mr Kohl will meet Mr Bjorn Engholm, leader of the opposition Social
Democrats, on Monday to discuss the state of the German economy and the
basis of the planned solidarity pact. Mr Engholm can be expected to back the
trade union position.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, yesterday backed calls
for a Community-led growth package, warning that unemployment next year was
likely to rise to 11 per cent amid sluggish growth of between 1 per cent and
1.5 per cent.
Mr Christophersen said he hoped the EC summit in Edinburgh next month would
send a strong signal of support for co-ordinated action based on a
multi-billion dollar public works programme and joint efforts with Japan and
the US to put 'more steam' into the world economy. In a speech in Brussels,
Mr Christophersen implied that the package could entail dilution of the
conditions for the EC's planned shift to a common currency, particularly
over budget deficits.
The Danish commissioner said: 'What we are seeing is more a lack of revenue
(rather) than expenditures getting out of control. Under these
circumstances, it would be understandable if some member states do not
compensate fully on the revenue side.'
Any suggestion of backsliding on the 'convergence criteria' set out in the
Maastricht treaty will alarm Germany. The Bonn government and the Bundesbank
agreed to sacrifice the D-Mark for a common European currency only on
condition that member states met strict criteria on inflation and budget
discipline.
This week, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, criticised the
convergence criteria as inadequate and warned against 'lazy compromises' in
selecting countries for monetary union. Mr Christophersen's view that budget
deficit criteria may have to be eased in the short-term is shared by Mr
Jacques Delors, European president.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Sweden admits defeat in battle for krona: Sudden central
bank move takes premier by surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE sudden decision to float the Swedish krona yesterday afternoon by the
central bank took even the government by surprise. Mr Carl Bildt, prime
minister, was given just 10 minutes' notice by central bank governor Mr
Bengt Dennis of what had to be done to stem the huge outflow of capital from
the country.
A shaken and bewildered Mr Bildt said the krona would have to float 'for
some time' but he asserted: 'You cannot run an economic policy with a
floating exchange rate. European countries cannot be floating against each
other. It won't work. I don't believe in this policy.'
Ever the good European who still wants to see Sweden as an obedient member
of a future economic and monetary union, Mr Bildt insisted that his medium-
and longer-term strategy had not been blown off course to take his country
into an economically integrated EC. The prime minister said it was too early
to discuss what his coalition government would do in the short run. This
would have to wait for January's budget for 1993-1994.
More problematically, the previous bipartisan support for tough measures was
missing yesterday. In September the main opposition joined forces with the
government in hammering out two crisis packages to eliminate the burgeoning
budget deficit and improve internal cost competitiveness. There was an
impressive display of national unity and not a serious voice raised in
support of devaluation.
'Against all the odds we succeeded,' said Mr Bildt. 'But we (Sweden) were
always alone in our defence of the fixed exchange rate policy.' It meant
draconian interest rates, with a symbolic 500 per cent for a few days
imposed by the central bank on its overnight lending to the banks.
Since Tuesday Mr Bildt and others have tried to win over the Social
Democrats for a further crisis package to impress the markets. Only early
yesterday afternoon came the answer. The Social Democratic leadership said
it no longer 'believed in the policy' that the government was proposing.
'They threw in the towel,' complained one government adviser. 'When it came
to the crunch they could accept no more cuts in public spending.'
There is no immediate threat to the four-party coalition. But without Social
Democratic support, Mr Bildt's latest SKr30bn (Pounds 3.3bn) package
announced yesterday morning to try to avert the crisis already lacked
political credibility, especially as the other main opposition party,the
right-wing New Democracy came out for floating the krona.
But it is hard to believe this would have been enough to calm the markets.
The central bank admitted Sweden's financial position was far graver than in
September.
Since last Thursday SKr158bn had flowed out of the country, compared with
SKr80bn over the three weeks of the earlier crisis.
The trouble started on November 12, when market interest rates began to rise
sharply on hearing of the poor results of the Swedish National Debt Office's
issue of Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) bonds as part of its emergency borrowing
programme to replenish the country's reserves and help fund the budget
deficit.
As the central bank admitted yesterday this pointed to 'rising difficulties'
in financing the budget deficit of Skr160bn for the current financial year.
For the first time since September capital began to flow out of the country.
The central bank acted last Friday to dampen interest rates by buying
SKr45bn of Treasury bills, but this made little difference.
At the start of this week foreign as well as domestic players began to sell
Swedish krona in increasing volume. The arrival of large US banks on the
scene on Tuesday escalated the crisis.
Unlike Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, Mr Bildt sees no advantages for
his country in a floating currency. He does not believe in a 'national'
solution to Sweden's economic troubles.
He also insists the longer-term structural reforms designed to make Sweden
more competitive and prosperous are in place and more will come next year.

THE decision to let the krona float was received with surprising caution by
hard-pressed corporate Sweden, with many executives worried about its
long-term impact on inflation.
However, industry leaders acknowledged the move would have a positive
short-term effect on their exports and help them regain lost business in key
markets.
The fear is that Sweden will repeat the mistakes of previous devaluations
and gain no long-term economic benefit.
'We must avoid the disastrous mistakes of the 1980s,' said Mr Magnus Lemmel,
managing director of the Federation of Swedish Industries. He called on the
government to keep in place measures to strengthen industry's
competitiveness.
Other industry leaders echoed his views, and suggested the high price of
defending the krona might prove worthwhile if the measures adopted in
Sweden's recent crisis packages wrought permanent change away from the old
bias towards social welfare expenditure.
Sweden's forest industry groups, badly affected by the flotation of the
Finnish markka in September, will be among the main beneficiaries of
yesterday's move.
But Mr Jan Remrod, director general of the Swedish paper and pulp
association, said: 'The important thing is that this does not lead to
inflation or wage increases, and that it does not undo what we have already
achieved in the way of improved efficiency.'
Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo chief executive, said floating the krona would benefit
the group, as 90 per cent of its sales were outside Sweden. He estimated
that the move would result in an effective devaluation of 10 per cent.
Norway's Finance Ministry and central bank responded to the Swedish crisis
by standing firm on maintaining the exchange rate policy, adopted in October
1990, which pegs the Norwegian krone to the Ecu, Karen Fossli writes from
Oslo.
The domestic one-month money-market rate shot up to 45 per cent after
Sweden's decision to float the krona, from 13.80 per cent earlier in the
day.
The Bank of Norway announced it was limiting overnight lending to banks from
today. It said it would introduce a system under which individual banks'
daily withdrawals would be limited to 50 per cent of the amount available
for overnight lending.
For withdrawals exceeding this amount, an extra interest rate of 40 per cent
will be imposed.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Brussels renewscall for EC-led growth package
</HEADLINE>

MR Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, yesterday threw his
weight behind calls for a Community-led growth package, warning that
unemployment next year was likely to rise to 11 per cent amid sluggish
growth of between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent.
Mr Christophersen said he hoped that the EC summit in Edinburgh next month
would send a 'strong signal' of support for co-ordinated action based on a
multi-billion dollar public works programme and joint efforts with Japan and
the US to put 'more steam' into the world economy. In a speech in Brussels,
Mr Christophersen also implied that such a package could entail dilution of
the conditions for the EC's planned shift to a common currency, particularly
in regard to budget deficits.
The Danish Commissioner said: 'What we are seeing is more a lack of revenue
(rather) than expenditures getting out of control. Under these
circumstances, it would be understandable if some member states do not
compensate fully on the revenue side.' Any suggestion of backsliding on the
'convergence criteria' set out in the Maastricht treaty is bound to raise
alarm in Germany. The Bonn government and the Bundesbank agreed to sacrifice
the D-Mark for a common European currency only on the condition that member
states met strict criteria on inflation and budget discipline.
This week, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, criticised the
convergence criteria as inadequate and warned against 'lazy compromises' in
the selection of countries for monetary union.
Mr Christophersen's view that the criteria on budget deficits may have to be
relaxed in the short-term is shared by Mr Jacques Delors, European
Commission President.
Officials close to Mr Delors said yesterday that a growth package involving
at least Ecu5bn (Pounds 4.bn) of new loans from a European Investment Fund
or the European Investment Bank would be combined with planned increases to
the EC budget under the so-called Delors II package.
A primary target is infrastructure investment in eastern Europe, viewed as a
powerful sales-pitch to Germany.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Greece welcomed into revived WEU
</HEADLINE>

THE Western European Union will today expand its role as the fledgling
defence arm of the European Community by welcoming Greece as a full member.
At a meeting in Rome, the WEU's foreign affairs and defence ministers will
also sign agreements offering associate membership to Turkey, Norway and
Iceland. But in a setback to the WEU's ambitions, Denmark and Ireland, both
EC members, have agreed to observer status only.
Mr Wim van Eekelen, WEU secretary general, said yesterday he hoped Denmark,
a member of Nato, and Ireland, traditionally neutral, would become full
members after a period of transition.
France, Germany and some other members see the WEU as leading gradually to a
common European defence policy under the political direction of EC
governments as sketched out in the Maastricht treaty. Britain, however, has
stressed the WEU's continuing close relationship with the Nato alliance.
Mr van Eekelen said the WEU was fast becoming the European 'pillar' of the
Nato alliance. A new planning cell will focus on peace-keeping, humanitarian
aid, and crisis management and the WEU will move from London to new
headquarters in Brussels.
The Greek government sees WEU membership both as an extra security guarantee
at a time of regional upheaval, and as confirmation that Greece will not be
excluded from helping to shape future EC policy on security and defence.
However, Greece had to make concessions during almost a year of
negotiations, to ensure it would not exploit WEU membership as a guarantee
against a perceived threat to its security from Turkey, a Nato ally.
Under Article 5 of the pact, WEU members must assist each other if attacked.
Greece has accepted, as a condition of joining, that the assistance clause
cannot be invoked in a dispute between Nato members.
Greece has also accepted Turkey's admission to the WEU as an associate
member, with the right to participate in its activities.
Turning to Yugoslavia, Mr van Eekelen said the WEU would strengthen the
naval blockade in the Adriatic through stop-and-search operations on vessels
suspected of carrying banned cargo to Serbia and Montenegro, in accordance
with a UN security council resolution adopted this week.
If a blockade had been enforced earlier, the Serbian bombardment of the
historic town of Dubrovnik might have been prevented, he said.
The WEU secretary general conceded that the Europeans had a 'credibility'
problem in Yugoslavia, particularly in the light of recent failures to
ensure food convoys reached their destinations in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Although he raised the possibility of dispatching troops under the WEU
banner, he said this could not be done without a clear mission. 'No one
wants to intervene massively in Yugoslavia.'
A Turkish proposal to convene a meeting of Balkan countries to discuss the
Yugoslav crisis was immediately rejected yesterday by Greece, writes John
Murray Brown in Ankara.
The Turkish move came in response to fears that recent violence in Macedonia
and the Serb province of Kosovo could draw regional powers into the war.
It was also aimed at countering criticism at home of the government's
inaction in the face of Serb attacks on Moslems in Bosnia.
At Geneva peace talks yesterday, Bosnia's rebel Serbs told international
mediators that Croats, Moslems and Serbs could never again live together.
In a draft constitution, the Serbs, who control 70 per cent of war-torn
Bosnia, insisted the country must be split into three ethnic mini-states.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Industry sheds 10,000 jobs: Blow to ministers' recovery
hopes Rate of cuts growing says Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANNOUNCEMENTS of almost 10,000 job cuts across British industry yesterday
set back government hopes of an upturn in economic confidence. The cuts
included 3,500 jobs at the Royal Bank of Scotland over the next five years
and 5,000 at British Rail.
The announcements were a disappointment for ministers who hoped the Autumn
Statement last week would be a turning point in economic optimism and
restore the government's standing.
They coincided with the publication of the Bank of England's quarterly
bulletin, which said companies have been shedding labour at an accelerating
rate as productivity in manufacturing and services has risen.
In spite of the news, Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury,
told the Commons the Treasury's achievement had been 'to create the
conditions for a return of confidence and so remove a barrier to growth'.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the job cuts showed the economy was
'not only still stuck in recession, but that decline is sharpening'. He said
the government should introduce an emergency employment programme.
Unemployment has reached its highest level for 5 1/2 years, according to
figures released last week. The seasonally adjusted rise in unemployment in
October was 24,200, taking the total to 2.87m.
Yesterday's job loss announcements included:
3,500 jobs over five years at the Royal Bank of Scotland out of a total of
13,000 in branch banking as it reforms branch services and automates some
routine processing jobs. The bank believed that staff turnover would enable
it to restrict redundancies to fewer than 300 per year. 550 jobs at Blue
Circle Industries which said it was closing a sixth of its UK cement-making
capacity and eliminating a fifth of its workforce because of the severe and
continuing recession afflicting the industry.
200 redundancies at Eagle Star Life among clerical staff.
390 job losses at National Westminster Bank and its subsidiary Lombard North
Central be-cause of 'continuing recession'.
5,000 jobs from British Rail's workforce of 138,000 over the next four
months in an attempt to bring costs into line with what it called a
'massive' drop in revenues.
The job losses, most of which BR hopes will be voluntary, will fall upon
management and administrative staff as well as blue collar workers. BR
blamed the cuts on recession, saying latest forecasts for the year to next
March pointed to a Pounds 400m loss of revenues from its passenger and
freight businesses. Turnover in the previous year was Pounds 3.2bn.
BR also warned of further cuts, putting part of the blame on the 'tight'
financial settlement imposed on the railway in the Autumn Statement. The
Department of Transport said the statement had left BR Pounds 230m better
off in cash terms over the next two years.
BR said income from its InterCity and Network SouthEast operations were
expected to be at least Pounds 100m lower than forecast this year, and its
profitable Trainload Freight business had lost income because of the effect
of recession on its biggest customers. On current forecasts, customer
receipts in the year to next March would be 14 per cent down on the 1988
level.
In the past two years, BR has added almost 4,000 to staff numbers, partly in
response to increased safety spending.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Sweden floats krona after outflow threatens reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN abandoned efforts to peg the krona to the European currency unit
yesterday, floating its battered currency after a speculative outflow of
capital threatened to wipe out reserves.
The decision by the Riksbank, the central bank, followed the failure of
attempts during the morning to prop up the currency by raising interest
rates. The events - strongly reminiscent of Black Wednesday on September 16
in which Britain pulled sterling out of the European exchange rate mechanism
 -heightened tensions last night within the ERM.
Sweden, although not a member of the ERM, has pegged the krona to the Ecu
for 18 months.
European finance ministers faced pressure to consider another realignment of
the system, as the floating of the krona led to intense buying of the D-Mark
which was pushed higher against the dollar and European currencies. There
has been growing speculation in recent weeks that several ERM currencies,
including the peseta, escudo and punt, might need to be realigned against
the D-Mark.
The dollar closed nearly 2 pfennigs down in London at DM1.5790 after rising
over several weeks. In New York it closed at DM1.5715. The lira, which had
appreciated sharply as investors grew more confident about the Italian
government's emergency package, fell in London to L859.1 against the D-Mark
from a previous L855.1. Later, in US trading, it slid further to L863.
The French franc, now regarded as one of the strongest currencies in the
ERM, lost 0.7 centimes against the D-Mark in London to FFr3.38. In New York
it closed at FFr3.3875.
Yesterday the krona fell by some 7.3 per cent against the dollar to
SKr6.5325.
Mr Carl Bildt, Sweden's prime minister, said the Riksbank's decision
represented 'a failure for the national effort which had been made to
protect the value of the krona', adding: 'We have done all we could to hold
the fixed exchange rate.'
The central bank, having weathered the earlier ERM crisis by pushing
marginal interbank rates as high as 500 per cent, said similar tactics
yesterday were not working. After lifting the marginal rate to 20 per cent
from 11.5 per cent, the rate ended the day back at 12.5 per cent.
Yesterday's traumas developed as Mr Bildt and Mrs Anne Wibble, his finance
minister, rushed out a SKr30bn (Pounds 3bn) crisis package to improve
internal competitiveness and calm the markets. But the opposition Social
Democrats refused to support it, saying it lacked credibility. This was in
contrast to September when all the main political parties agreed on measures
to save the krona.
The central bank said there had been 'massive speculation against the krona'
with an estimated SKr158bn flowing out of Sweden since last Thursday,
compared with a SKr80bn outflow in September's currency crisis.
Mr Bengt Dennis, the Riksbank governor, said the decision to raise the
marginal rate to 20 per cent 'proved insufficient' to stabilise the currency
and he concluded: 'In the current circumstances additional increases in
interest rates would not create market stability.' He added: 'We could not
see the possibility of stopping the outward flow'.
The government announced the abolition of 10-year-old restrictions
preventing the state borrowing in foreign currency to finance debts. Mr
Bildt and Mrs Wibble said there would be some changes in the latest crisis
package, likely to come in the budget statement in January. Before then the
government will publish a new assessment of prospects.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Row grows over exam results league table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS, BETHAN HUTTON and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROVERSY over the government's exam results league table intensified
yesterday, with a catalogue of complaints and errors, and the revelation
that the government employed two private contractors to compile its
statistics.
The use of small private contractors to gather and process the examination
statistics led last night to allegations that the government had failed to
supervise its own operation and ensure that its statistics were accurate.
Manchester High School for Girls is considering legal action after its
league table entry stated that only 16 per cent of pupils gained five or
more GCSEs at grades A to C. The correct figure was 100 per cent, and the
head mistress said she 'repeatedly' told the Department of Education of the
error before publication.
The department said it was 'seriously investigating' all the complaints. Mr
John Patten, education secretary, has not apologised publicly for errors in
the league tables. He will, however, appear before the Commons education
select committee next Wednesday to be cross-examined.
The main contractor, PMS Communications, a Birmingham-based company
employing 30 people, specialises in computer systems for the education
sector. Last night it said the allegations of mass inaccuracies were mainly
the result of rules laid down by the department.
PMS, a niche company not well known in the data processing industry, has in
the past held contracts with examinations boards, but it has no experience
of conducting operations on this scale.
Mr Craig Peppiatt, a director of PMS Communications, admitted there were
some errors, but said: 'That is the sort of thing which is bound to happen
in the first year.'
He added that most of the problems arose because of misunderstandings about
the basis upon which tables were compiled and lack of time for schools to
check their results. The role of the second contractor, Bath university, was
itself a source of controversy last night, with PMS citing it as a separate
contractor and the Education Department denying any knowledge of it.
Computer analysts said in PMS's defence that the principle of 'gigo' -
garbage in, garbage out - seems to have applied. Specialists in data
analysis emphasised the care which has to be taken in designing surveys if
the right data are to be collected.
The survey design appears to have been flawed by rules such as not allowing
for schools which share or group their A-level classes. As a result, some
schools with thriving sixth forms were shown as achieving no A-level passes.
The row dominated prime minister's questions in the Commons, with Mr John
Smith, the Labour leader, accusing the government of having 'botched' the
results and being 'so incompetent it cannot produce an accurate record of
exam results'.
Mr John Major said it was 'hardly surprising' there were some errors since
it was 'the biggest exercise of its kind undertaken by the government', and
accused Mr Smith of 'hiding the fact that you want to cover up these
statistics.'
Mr Stephen Byers, a backbench Labour MP, tabled parliamentary questions last
night asking why private contractors had been engaged for the project.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Recession maintains its grip for ninth quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION maintained its grip on the UK in the three months to
September, making it the ninth quarter of flat or falling output.
But while the latest official figures showed no sign of recovery, they are
unlikely to trigger any further easing of policy in the near future.
Gross domestic product, excluding oil and gas production, dropped by 0.3 per
cent compared with the previous quarter, and was 0.8 per cent lower than the
same quarter year on year, according to provisional seasonally adjusted
figures from the Central Statistical Office.
The CSO reported yesterday that overall third-quarter GDP was unchanged
compared with the three months to June, re-flecting a sharp 6.7 per cent
rise in oil and gas extraction. Compared with the same period a year ago,
GDP fell by 0.7 per cent.
The Treasury said the figures were in line with their Autumn Statement
forecasts of a 1 per cent drop in economic output for 1992 as a whole. The
forecast, published last week, implies another big fall in GDP in the fourth
quarter.
Treasury officials said the latest figures were of limited value in
assessing present economic conditions, because they mainly reflected
conditions before the big relaxation in government monetary policy after
Black Wednesday (September 16), which has included three base rate cuts and
a large sterling devaluation.
The Bank of England, which highlighted the problem of debt deflation in its
latest quarterly bulletin yesterday, is understood to have advised the
government to wait and see how the lower interest rates and last week's
fiscal measures affect inflation and activity before considering whether to
cut base rates further from seven per cent.
The third-quarter fall in non-oil GDP reflected a drop in manufacturing
output, after two consecutive quarters of growth, and poor performance by
the service industries.
Total GDP has fallen by 4 per cent since the recession began more than two
years ago. Excluding oil and gas extraction, the fall has been 4.1 per cent.
Neither fall is as steep as those in output during the recession in the
early 1980s when GDP fell by 5.5 per cent overall and by 6.2 per cent,
excluding oil and gas extraction. However, then the economy recovered after
only seven quarters.
Service industry output, which accounts for over half of total GDP, fell by
0.3 per cent in the third quarter compared with the second quarter and was
0.5 per cent lower year on year.

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROTHSCHILD Bank, the troubled Zurich affiliate of N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons,
has sacked its auditors, KPMG, Fides Peat.
The move follows a series of misadventures at the bank in the past decade,
culminating last summer in the arrest of its credit manager for fraud and a
SFr250m (Dollars 178.5m) capital restructuring backed by the Rothschild
family.
Mr Adolf Lustenberger, the KPMG partner responsible for the Rothschild Bank
account, confirmed that the firm was 'in the process of being replaced'.
Rothschild Bank decided at its last board meeting that it would replace KPMG
with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the firm which is carrying out an investigation into
the bank's problems.
Under Swiss banking law, a bank must apply to the Swiss Federal Banking
Commission for permission to change auditors, and the Commission will hear
evidence from both the auditor and the bank before deciding.
In this case, the commission is likely to ask KPMG how it could have failed
to notice and draw attention to some of the problems at the bank.
Mr Lustenberger would not comment on the role of the firm.
A spokesman for the bank said last week that losses on loans made improperly
over a period of several years to companies associated with the
German-Canadian property financiers, Mr Karsten von Wersebe and Mr Wolfgang
Stolzenberg, would reach around SFr220m.

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
METALLGESELLSCHAFT, the German mining and industrial group, yesterday
reported 1991-1992 pre-tax profits down by nearly a quarter and signalled
its gloom about the future by saying that it is proposing a dividend cut
from DM10 to DM8 per share.
Group profits for the year ended September sank by 23 per cent to DM245m
(Dollars 163.3m), the second consecutive year that the profits have fallen
sharply against a background of falling metals prices. Last year profits
sunk 35 per cent from DM483m in 1990, but the dividend was maintained.
Turnover rose by 20 per cent to more than DM20bn, the increase reflecting
the company's purchase late last year of businesses from Stora of Sweden,
mainly Buderus and Dynamit Nobel.
Excluding these acquisitions, turnover rose by three per cent.
Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive, blamed the downturn on a
combination of factors which hit the metals businesses especially hard.
These included falling prices, the adverse effect of currency movements and
the costs of upgrading facilities to make them more friendly to the
environment, he said.
The figures imply a sharp downturn in the second half of the year, since at
the six month stage profits were flat at DM162m with the company expecting
satisfactory figures for the full year despite difficult conditions.
Yesterday Mr Schimmelbusch said that profits for the current year were
likely to remain at around the same level as in 1991-92.
He defended last year's acquisition from Stora, which cost DM1.45bn.
The businesses were performing extremely well and there was no way that this
had put Metallgesellschaft under financial strain: net indebtedness was nil,
he said.

THAILAND yesterday urged members of the United Nations Security Council,
which is considering sanctions against the Khmer Rouge for violating the
Cambodian peace accord, not to come to 'hasty conclusions' or issue a
resolution that might be impossible to enforce.
'I hope that such a resolution will be implementable, not one which is aimed
only at threatening without being practical,' Mr Prasong Soonsiri, the Thai
foreign minister, told the Financial Times. 'Thailand shares the
international community's disappointment at the Khmer Rouge's intransigence
on co-operating in the peace process,' he said. But he added: 'Every effort
should be made and all the remaining time should be spent in finding a way
to bring the Khmer Rouge back into the peace process . . . If the Khmer
Rouge is allowed to remain outside the process then the conflicts and
disputes remain and may even intensify.'
Thailand, whose businessmen buy gems and timber from Khmer Rouge strongholds
across the border, has repeatedly emphasised that it will abide by United
Nations resolutions on Cambodia.
However, the Thai government has also made clear that it is reluctant to
impose economic sanctions and has said that any UN resolution should be
compatible with Thai law.
'If the resolutions require the seizure of assets of the Khmer Rouge outside
Cambodia this will affect our own domestic banking laws,' Mr Prasong said.
'Our domestic laws prohibit the seizure of assets even of Thai nationals in
matters where the government only has suspicions that irregularities might
have been committed.'
Mr Prasong also suggested that other governments were over-emphasising the
importance of the Cambodian elections scheduled for May next year as a
solution to the civil war.
'We do not wish to see elections held and then all the parties concerned
pack their bags and go home thinking that peace has been achieved in
Cambodia, leaving the residual problems for our country to contend with,' he
said.
'This would only lead to a return to square one.'
The head of the UN peacekeeping operation in Cambodia yesterday promised new
measures to stem growing political violence in the lead up to next May's
elections, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh. Several people have been killed
and at least 11 injured in a recent spate of shootings and grenade attacks
against opposition party offices and officials.
'Free and fair elections cannot be held in circumstances where people face
threats to their lives, liberty and security for attempting to exercise
their political rights,' said Mr Yasushi Akashi, the Japanese head of the UN
transitional authority.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Putting tourists back on road to Mandalay: Nice sights,
shame about the infrastructure - Victor Mallet on Burma's drive to attract
more visitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOBODY minds the sparrows building their nests in the restaurant at Rangoon
airport, but the plump rats which scuttle around the reception desk at the
Strand Hotel are living testimony to the sorry state of the Burmese tourism
industry.
To make matters worse the country's military rulers have restricted most
tourists to frantic, seven-day visits for the past 30 years, and to
seven-day group tours since the army crushed a pro-democracy uprising in
1988.
All that is changing. In the past few weeks the State Law and Order
Restoration Council (Slorc), the ruling junta, has welcomed individual
travellers, announced that visas will be issued in 48 hours or granted on
arrival, opened the Thai border to day trippers, and disclosed plans to
start international flights to Mandalay.
For the first time in years, a cruise ship has called at Rangoon, disgorging
more than 400 tourists into the dilapidated capital.
The government is courting foreign investors interested in refurbishing
hotels in Rangoon and Mandalay, and the romantic but vermin-infested Strand
is already being converted into a luxury Dollars 250-a-night hotel by a
company from Hong Kong.
Ambitious but unworldly, the Slorc generals initially said they were aiming
to lure 500,000 tourists to Burma annually, compared with about 8,000 last
year and a similar number in 1992. Now they admit that the shortage of hotel
rooms and flights will make it hard to attract even 50,000.
'It is politically quite stable, so now we allow these tourists back here,'
Mr Myo Lwin of the new Ministry of Tourism said recently. 'It's very
difficult to make a target at the moment because the change has been so
sudden. After more than 30 years, the government has relaxed the rules.'
Officials admit they have no idea how many hotel rooms Burma will have in
three years.
Burma's attractions, from the pagodas of Pagan to the southern beaches, are
more than a match for the better-known sights of neighbouring Thailand, but
decades of civil war and economic mismanagement have left much of the
country inaccessible.
'It could be a major earner for us,' says Mr Myo Lwin. 'If it can be for
Thailand, it can be for us. But we need infrastructure.'
For tourism as for other sectors of the economy over the past four years,
the Slorc has abandoned the state's monopoly and encouraged entrepreneurs
from Burma and abroad. The foreign investors have started redeveloping
hotels, and licences have been granted to 30 travel agents in Burma.
Progress, however, has been painfully slow. The transformation of Rangoon's
Inya Lake Hotel, a grim edifice originally constructed with Soviet aid, is a
case in point. Along with the Strand and the Thamada, the Inya Lake is being
refurbished and the staff retrained under a joint venture agreement between
Strand Hotels International of Hong Kong and the state-owned Myanmar Hotels
and Tourism Services.
It took eight months just to create and decorate the small room containing
the new bar.
The efforts of foreign investors to turn the hotels into profitable concerns
are further undermined by official bureaucracy and the Slorc's reluctance to
spend what little money it has on long-term investments.
'Clearing things from the customs can take up to a month,' says one
frustrated foreign contractor. 'Everything takes so long. The (refurbished)
Strand was supposed to be open by now.'
Potential tourists would hardly have been encouraged by the sight of Gen
Kyaw Ba, the new tourism minister, visiting the Strand's building site in
October protected by a truckload of soldiers.
Another obstacle is the government's refusal to devalue the kyat, the local
currency.
This means that a very ordinary Chinese meal for two with a few beers can
theoretically cost about Dollars 350; travellers accustomed to the ways of
the third world are happy to change their dollars on the black market (and
get the same meal for Dollars 15) but the respectable tourists the Slorc
wants are unlikely to be happy dealing on the black market.

FT  20 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Brazilian state adapts to centre stage -
Christina Lamb looks at Rio Grande do Sul's hopes and fears from Mercosur
pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the first callers to the Dial Mercosur service set up last year by
the state government of Rio Grande do Sul was a lady asking where she could
find her local Mercosul, mistakenly believing it to be a new chain of
supermarkets.
Today most of the state's 9.2m inhabitants are better informed, but hold
mixed opinions about the nascent free trade arrangement between Brazil,
Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay which will affect them more than any other
community in the southern cone.
Not only is Brazil's southernmost state right in the centre of Mercosur, but
its largely agricultural production comprises the same crops as neighbouring
Uruguay and Argentina and is less competitive due to poorer soil conditions
and heavier local taxes.
Agriculture makes up 53 per cent of the state's Dollars 35.7bn GDP and much
of the 15m tonnes of foodstuff produced yearly sells within Brazil.
Although currently benefiting from Argentina's overvalued currency which
make Brazilian products cheap in comparison, Rio Grande's wheat, rice,
poultry, dairy, beef and wine producers all expect to suffer once Mercosur
comes fully into operation in 1995 with zero tariffs between the four
neighbours.
Mr Hugo Paz, the president of the state's Farmers Association, complains:
'Mercosur is moving so fast that it's heading for self-destruction. It is
destroying Brazil's agroeconomy, particularly that of Rio Grande.'
He describes Brazil's integration with its neighbours formalised by the
Treaty of Asuncion of March 1991, as 'like marrying a girl you have just met
in the street.'
He says: 'No compensating mechanisms have been created for the dead and
injured and the lack of macroeconomic stability or policy coordination means
it's impossible to decide whether to abandon products. Unless something
drastic is done what we'll have is not integration but wars over food
mountains.'
Yet in many ways for Rio Grande, Mercosur makes far more sense than for
Brazil's north-eastern states. It shares a 1,000km border with Uruguay and a
700km border with Argentina and its culture is closer to these southern
neighbours than to that of Brazil.
Trade with Mercosur partners, though still relatively unimportant for the
state, is rising. Last year its exports to Mercosur increased to Dollars
221.9m from Dollars 137.6m in 1990, though still less than 7 per cent of the
total Dollars 3.5bn. This year it should top Dollars 300m. Another benefit
is an increased tourism. A record 500,000 tourists visited the state last
year, mostly from Mercosur countries.
In the last two decades, rapid industrialisation has transformed Rio Grande
which now has a gross domestic product greater than that of Hungary, and
Mercosur should benefit sectors such as car parts, bus manufacturers and
petrochemicals. Some local companies are already taking advantage. Brahma,
Brazil's leading beer company, recently invested Dollars 40m in joint
ventures in Argentina and Uruguay.
Fonte Ijui is selling mineral water to Argentina, Agrale is exporting trucks
across the border, and Balancas Uranos is selling electronic scales to
Paraguay.
The state authorities hope to use its strategic position, cheap power,
deepwater port, and high quality of life to attract in foreign companies
aiming at the 200m strong Mercosur. A department for international affairs
has been created with an impressive datasystem listing companies seeking
partners. State missions have visited the US, Hong Kong and Japan and Europe
is next on the list.
The Federation of Industries of Rio Grande has set up a Mercosur division
and in a specially commissioned study on 20 sectors found 16 saw it as an
opportunity and only four as a threat - wheat, wine, dairy products and
canned fruits.
Mr Luiz Mandelli, president of the federation, says 'we're entirely in
favour of Mercosur. For decades we've complained that we're in bad
competitive shape because we were so far from the main consumer markets of
Sao Paulo and Rio. Now we're right in the middle. If you draw a 600 mile
circle round Porto Alegre you have two thirds of the GDP of South America.'
But Mr Alceu Collares, the state Governor, warns against complacency: 'Our
proximity to all four Mercosul countries means we could be the biggest
beneficiary. However, we could just become a corridor between the big
producers of Buenos Aires and Sao Paulo unless we are competitive in price
and quality.'
The government has set up a Dollars 390m industrial development programme
and recruited Japanese and German advisers. Recently for example, Aurora,
Brazil's largest wine co-operative, invested Dollars 16m in reconversion to
produce fruit juice and jams to protect itself against a possible influx of
Argentine wine. 'It's adapt or die,' says Mr Adao Eliseu de Carvalho,
secretary for international affairs.

TIGHTER environmental standards offer business 'huge opportunities' in the
fast growing market for 'green' goods and services, a conference on European
business and the environment heard yesterday.
Mr Michael Howard, UK environment secretary, said the market for
environmental goods was already worth more than the global aerospace
industry, at some Dollars 200bn a year. Over the next eight years, he said,
the total market would be worth Pounds 850bn in the EC and Pounds 1,000bn in
the US.
The conference coincided with the publication of a survey for the European
Commission, showing that 86 per cent of EC citizens are concerned about the
effect of industry on the environment.
Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC environment commissioner, underlined that it was
'in the interests of industry to pursue a policy which fully integrates
environmental considerations.'
Mr Van Miert, later reiterated that the Commission remained 'fully
committed' to its proposal for an energy tax, equivalent to up to Dollars 10
on a barrel of oil by the year 2000.

FT  20 NOV 92 / International Company News: Shimuzu expects Y20bn costs for
rationalisation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SHIMUZU, the leading Japanese construction group yesterday disclosed its
withdrawal from Australian and European markets this year would cost it more
than Y20bn (Dollars 160.8m).
Earlier this autumn Shimuzu announced it was rationalising its overseas
operations which it invested in during the late 1980s, including closing its
UK operations.
Shimuzu's sudden withdrawal, a rare retreat from overseas markets for a
Japanese company, shocked many other Japanese construction companies which
are seeking to cut costs in the face of a sustained downturn in the
country's economy.
Shimuzu said its after-tax profits would for the year to next March would be
cut by 55 per cent to Y20bn to cover the costs of liquidating subsidiaries
in Europe and Australia.
The company reported a 10 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y50bn for the
first half to September, on a 1.7 per cent increase in sales to Y921bn.
The company blamed a large share of the profits fall on lower interest rates
reducing its return on investments. It also recorded a substantial appraisal
loss on its securities holdings.
Shimuzu's order intake fell by 19 per cent to Y1,115bn. It investment
programme will be cut by over 20 per cent from its original plans to about
Y20bn.
Executives said the government's public works programme, expanded to
stimulate the flagging economy, was creating strong demand for civil
engineering projects. However, this was more than offset by a sharp fall in
orders from the private sector.
Kajima, the construction group, reported a sharp increase in bad debts and a
cut in interest income was the main reason for a 9.8 per cent cut in
first-half pre-tax profits to Y38bn. The company recorded a Y2.3bn deficit
on its balance of financial items, after recording a Y5.1bn surplus in
financial income in the same period last year.
Kajima's sales in the six months to end-September rose by 25 per cent to
Y907bn. But its new order intake dropped by 21 per cent to Y1,006bn.
The company warned that in the second half profits would be pulled down by a
swelling deficit on financial items and low profit margins on large
projects.
Taisei, the Tokyo-based general contractor, reported an 18.4 per cent rise
in first-half pre-tax profits to Y46bn, on a 21 per cent increase in sales
to Y886bn. However, new order intake fell by 21 per cent to Y903bn.
Obayashi, reported a 26 per cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits to
Y16bn, mainly a reflection of its relatively low profits during the same
period the year before.
Public sector demand was the main reason for a 4.5 per cent increase in
sales to Y662bn.

TORAY Industries, the Japanese synthetic fibres group, yesterday announced a
12.2 per cent fall in unconsolidated pre-tax profits to Y25.03bn (Dollars
201.2m) in the six months to September 30.
Sales slipped 1.9 per cent to Y296.7bn, while net income fell 15.2 per cent
to Y12.8bn, compared with Y15.03bn in the previous corresponding half year.
Sales of fibres and textiles fell 1.6 per cent to Y166.1bn, despite higher
sales for products used in clothing such as polyester filament and nylon.
However, nylon sales to the tyre and carpet industries fell, reflecting the
difficult trading conditions in the automotive and construction sectors.
Plastics and chemicals sales were 7.9 per cent lower at Y90.8bn. The
automotive industry's troubles also hit this division, while the slowdown in
sales of electrical appliances and magnetic tapes also had an adverse
impact. Chemicals sales moved higher led by caprolactam which is employed in
synthetic fibre production.
In the group's new products and other businesses area, sales advanced 13.5
per cent to Y39.9bn. Foreign sales of advanced composite materials which are
used in the aircraft industry moved against the trend in the division
although sales to the sporting goods business strengthened.
Toray is forecasting a fall in net income for the 12 months to March 31 next
year to Y25bn from Y27.2bn in 1992 and a slight rise in sales to Y600bn for
the same term.
Taisho Pharmaceutical posted a 1.7 per cent rise in non-consolidated pre-tax
profits to Y28.8bn for the six months to September, writes Emiko Terazono.
Sales rose 6.3 per cent to Y104.9bn. After-tax profits grew 7.1 per cent to
Y14.5bn.

<TEXT>
ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications group, made a pre-tax profit of
SKr63m (Dollars 10m) for the third quarter of the year. This contrasts with
a SKr268m loss for the same period of 1991 and a SKr442m pre-tax profit for
the second quarter.
Sales rose slightly in the third quarter to SKr9.71bn from SKr9.57bn. For
the nine months ended September, net sales dropped by 6 per cent to
SKr30.02bn. Ericsson blamed this on continuing low investment volumes in
important markets like Spain and the divestment of its cable and telephone
operations in Latin America.
The company reported 22 per cent growth in order bookings for the nine
months to SKr37.72bn. This was due mainly to a strong increase in public
telecommunications and radio communication orders.
Mr Lars Ramqvist, chief executive, said the higher orders would make a full
impact on net sales next year and he added that the forecast for the whole
of 1992 of a low profit remained unchanged.
Mr Ramqvist claimed that Ericsson was strengthening its position as 'a
world-leading, independent supplier of telecommunications systems'.
Yesterday, the company announced it was extending its partnership with Texas
Instruments, the Dallas-based high technology company.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York, once the world's biggest real estate developer, is likely to
shrink to a modest-sized property manager during the next few months under
an agreement hammered out with its creditors.
In return for an eight-week postponement of votes on a contentious
debt-restructuring plan, the Reichmann family, O&amp;Y's owners, have agreed to
allow creditors to seize collateral after January 15 and not to obstruct
their efforts in the US courts.
Among the assets which are almost certain to be seized are First Canadian
Place, O&amp;Y's 72-storey flagship in the heart of Toronto's financial
district, and Scotia Plaza, a modern 68-storey building nearby.
A spokesman for one group of creditors said yesterday that 'by the middle of
January, we should have our building unless someone wants to buy our debt.'
O&amp;Y has already lost control of Canary Wharf in London's Docklands and some
of its properties in New York, including 55 Water Street, which is the
world's biggest office building.
The Reichmanns' latest humiliation came in the wake of fierce opposition to
a debt-restructuring proposal presented by O&amp;Y last month.
The opposition was led by Canadian banks and bondholders with claims secured
by specific buildings, who were confident they would be better off seizing
their collateral than agreeing to the concessions proposed by O&amp;Y.
Under this week's agreement, expected to be approved by an Ontario court on
Monday, O&amp;Y must file a new restructuring plan for its 34 creditor groups by
December 15, with votes to be held no later than January 15. Under the old
plan, the votes were to be held between November 25 and 30. A lawyer for one
group of creditors said yesterday 'the revised plan will in effect be a
liquidation.'

FT  20 NOV 92 / Port of Tyne wins Nissan exports deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, the Japanese car manufacturer, is to move its export and import
operations from Teesport to a new terminal on the Tyne near Jarrow.
The arrangements include the export of Sunderland-made Nissan cars to 30
countries, including Japan, a traffic contributing about Pounds 900m this
year in export earnings to the UK.
Winning the Nissan contract, initially a five-year deal from January 1994,
is a coup for the Port of Tyne, which depends for nearly half its annual
cargo tonnage on highly vulnerable coal shipments.
Teesport is part of the port of Tees and Hartlepool, Britain's
second-biggest port. Nissan's decision is a blow for Teesside Holdings, the
consortium that bought the port for Pounds 180m early this year.
Since 1988, Nissan has exported 357,000 Sunderland-made cars, nearly all
through Teesport, which this year is also handling 40,000 imported Nissans
built in Spain and Japan. Under the new deal, a few Sunderland-made cars
will still be exported through Southampton.
Output of Primeras and Micras at Sunderland - 175,000 this year - will rise
in 1993 to 270,000. At least 70 per cent will be exported. In 1994, Nissan
plans to export more than 200,000 Sunderland-made cars from the Tyne.
Mr Terry Hogg, director of production control at Sunderland, said the
working relationship with Teesport had been excellent but that Nissan's
operating conditions had changed dramatically, largely because of export
business growth.
'The Port of Tyne offered the most commercially viable alternative; that
included a purpose-built berthing facility dedicated to Nissan,' he said.
Because the Tyne is much nearer Nissan's Sunderland plant and an adjacent
national distribution compound, car transporter movements will be reduced by
900,000 miles a year. Nissan's 37 Teesport employees will be offered
transfers to the Tyne terminal.
Neither party would disclose the deal's financial terms. Work will start
immediately on constructing three roll-on roll-berths for Nissan on 27 acres
of an 87-acre site. Mr Alan Fairley, the port's managing director, said he
was delighted.
In a terse statement yesterday, Mr John Holloway, chief executive of the
Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority, said the authority was 'obviously very
disappointed'.

FT  20 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Unctad to boost aid for debt managing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) is to boost its
programme for helping developing countries manage their debt, with potential
foreign exchange savings running to millions of dollars.
Unctad's computerised debt information system, used by about 20 countries,
enables governments to monitor their obligations (which many countries
cannot easily do) and use the information in economic decision-making. It is
a way to avoid unnecessary costs such as overpayments to creditors or
penalty interest rates due to poor book-keeping.
Unctad officials say developing countries must process huge amounts of
information on debt, a task only handled effectively by computer. Many
debtor countries carry 1,000 loans on their books.
Lack of information has meant many countries must rely on data provided by
their creditors, with no independent means of checking accuracy. Use of
Unctad's debt management system enabled one central American country to
reclaim Dollars 1.2m in overpayments. An Asian debtor recouped Dollars
800,000 paid in excess interest.
Expansion of the programme, in collaboration with the World Bank, is being
financed by a Dollars 5.3m grant from the UN Development Programme (UNDP)
over the next four years. Unctad will be carrying out debt audits for
individual countries, advising them on data collection and analysis,
providing debt management software packages and training local officials.
Unctad hopes donor countries will come up with funds to let it meet the
growing requests for debt management help. Computerising the debts of a
middle-sized developing country can cost up to Dollars 500,000. Thus, it
would cost Dollars 200m-300m to bring external debt management in all
developing nations up to an acceptable standard in five years.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Big names fail to find buyers: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GREAT names of British art are having a difficult time in the auction
rooms this week. On Wednesday Constable's 'Harnham Bridge', estimated at
Pounds 1m plus, failed to sell at Sotheby's. Yesterday an important Turner
watercolour of Venice was unsold in the same saleroom when the bidding
stopped at Pounds 400,000.
It set a record in 1988 for an English watercolour of Pounds 440,000. Its
European owner wanted Pounds 500,000 this time. The sale of British drawings
and water colours totalled Pounds 706,596 and was 55.2 per cent unsold.
Another important Turner, 'The Wreck', was a casualty, but Agnews paid
Pounds 187,000 for a view of Lichfield Cathedral that Turner executed about
1835. A wooded landscape by Gainsborough sold, below estimate, at Pounds
88,000.
Christie's sale of contemporary art in New York on Wednesday was dented by
the failure of two top lots, paintings by de Kooning and Rauschenberg, to
find buyers. That accounted for much of the 30 per cent unsold out of a
total of Dollars 17.76m (Pounds 11.6m).
Other important pictures sold below estimate, in particular '0 Through 9' by
Jasper Johns, which made Dollars 2.3m as against its Dollars 2.8m-Dollars
3.5m estimate, and 'No 6: 1948' by Jackson Pollock, which went for Dollars
1.98m (estimate Dollars 2.5m-Dollars 3.5m). There was one artist record, for
Joseph Beuys: Dollars 385,000 was paid for a cello which he had covered with
grey felt and decorated with a red cross.
There were also setbacks at Christie's English furniture auction in London
yesterday. The two star items, a commode and a pair of secretaire bookcases,
all decoratively painted and attributed to George Brookshaw, failed to sell,
in spite of Pounds 200,000 bid for the bookcases. A George IV ormolu mounted
centrepiece, depicting the king as a Roman emperor, more than doubled its
estimate at Pounds 121,000.
In Geneva Sotheby's sold for Pounds 2.05m the fourth-largest emerald cut
diamond to appear at auction, weighing 50.83 carats. It was bought by a
Saudi sheikh, Ahmed Fitaihi. In London a nine-volume set of Blaeu's 'Atlas
major', in Dutch, and in a contemporary 17th-century cabinet, beat its
estimate at Pounds 187,000.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Major faces new attack over arms to Iraq affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPPOSITION leaders last night joined forces to accuse Mr John Major of
misleading parliament in his statements about government guidelines covering
the sale of arms-related equipment to Iraq. The move came as Labour called
for a Commons debate on the subject on Monday.
In separate open letters, Mr John Smith and Mr Paddy Ashdown highlighted
repeated government pledges that the 1985 guidelines had been consistently
applied. These assurances were contrasted with Downing Street admissions to
journalists that changes had secretly taken place.
'Any objective analysis of the statements made by John Major and other
ministers must reach the conclusion that parliament and members of
parliament have been consistently misled on this issue,' Mr Smith wrote in
what was much the more aggressive of the two letters.
The Labour leader called on the prime minister to 'now apologise' to
parliament. It was 'extraordinary' that Mr Major had 'so categorically
denied' that ministers had misled MPs in prime minister's questions on
Tuesday, when Downing Street was 'telling journalists that the 1985
guidelines were changed in December 1988.'
Mr Ashdown asked Mr Major to explain 'this discrepancy': 'Were you badly
briefed by your officials - did you mistakenly inform me and the House in
your previous statements and letters - or is this all part of what many are
now increasingly regarding as a high-level and systematic action which has
had the effect of misleading parliament?'.
In a strongly worded motion for next week's debate, Labour charged that, as
a result of the 'private change of policy', British 'servicemen may have
been exposed to fire from shells and rockets made in munitions factories
equipped by Britain.'
'The conduct of ministers in this matter has been inconsistent with the
security of British troops, with open government, and with the just
administration of legal process,' it continued.
Mr Major is expected to be absent for the debate which will be opened by Mr
Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary. Labour said last night it
would use the debate to set out the case against the government and the
questions that it hoped Lord Justice Scott's inquiry would be able to
answer.
The 1988 change was first publicly alluded to in the all-party trade and
industry select committee's report into the Iraqi supergun affair, published
in March. But it first attracted widespread attention following the release
of previously restricted Whitehall documents during the Matrix Churchill
court case last week.
This brought to light an April 1989 letter signed by the private secretary
of Mr William Waldegrave, then a Foreign Office minister, which stated: 'We
agreed that we should continue to interpret the guidelines more flexibly in
respect of Iraq, as we have done in practice since the end of last year.'
The letter was addressed to Mr Alan Clark, then trade minister.
Downing Street, which had no immediate response to yesterday's
correspondence, has argued that the 1988 changes were not 'significant.'
Labour also published yesterday a list of UK companies - including
Rolls-Royce, ICL and British Aerospace - which it said had been 'implicated'
in the supply of defence-related equipment to Iraq. Most of the companies
named denied that the list contained anything new.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Public 'believes profits are used to increase dividends'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST PEOPLE think a big British company would be most likely to use a large
profit to increase dividends and managers' bonuses, according to the latest
British Social Attitudes survey.
The survey, conducted by Social and Community Planning Research, found 54
per cent believed this would happen, while only 3 per cent thought it should
be the company's first priority.
A total of 42 per cent favoured investing in machinery, technology, training
and research, but only 28 per cent believed it was what the company would
do.
A more striking variation between beliefs and expectations arose over
sharing profits with employees. Only 8 per cent thought a company would
improve pay and working conditions as its first priority, while 39 per cent
said it should. In the view of 90 per cent of respondents, owners,
shareholders, directors and managers benefit most from the profits of
British companies - although only 21 per cent think this should be so.
Using profits to pay bonuses to top managers - seen by 20 per cent as the
most likely course of action - was, says the report, favoured by virtually
no one. 'This must cast some doubt on any arguments that Britain has become
an opportunity society,' it adds.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Arts: Stages - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The old firm of David Storey the writer, Alan Bates the actor and Lindsay
Anderson the director is back with Storey's new play, Stages at the
Cottesloe in the National Theatre. The firm has not matured with age. Indeed
if you want a throwback to the 1960s, here it is. Outside of parody, it is
hard to imagine such a mixture of the worst of Harold Pinter, more than a
touch of John Osborne, a nod to John Braine's Room at the Top and an
acknowledgement of Philip Larkin for writing verse about the north of
England. The victim is Bates, who remains a powerful actor but has to speak
most of the lines and can hardly be expected to carry a text like this.
The point about Storey - it is always said, not least by himself - is that
he was born north-country poor, preferred art and literature to a more
humdrum life, and played professional rugby league in order to support his
studies. Thus the hearties regarded him as an aesthete, and the aesthetes
regarded him as a hearty: not, one may add, an entirely uncommon phenomenon.
Stages is the story retold, plus women. There are a lot of them about.
Fenchurch, the central character, has a daughter called Karen, an ex-wife
called Bea, a psychiatric adviser called Marion, and a glamorous-looking
woman called Rebecca who appears to be his neighbour but is treated as a
surrogate for all his longings. The main woman in the Fenchurch saga,
however, does not appear. She is Bea's mother, for whom he fell before he
married the daughter and with whom he continued an affair long after. I hope
that's clear.
The play contains one interesting line about why it is that some of us go
mad and others don't. No answer is given; nor is there much of an attempt to
find one. Fenchurch's dilemma seems to be whether he should go back to the
north, from which he and much of the 1960s drama came, or stay in the south
which he first welcomed for its anonymity. It is pointed out in passing that
the north has changed over the years; ie, has become more like the south.
Fenchurch stays put.
Bates copes manfully, looking as ever the blend of ex-rugby forward and
sensitive soul. The part is in many ways reminiscent of the middle-aged
Jimmy Porter in Osborne's Deja Vu, though without the drink and without the
foil of Osborne's Cliff. It is also without the jokes.
Pinterish pauses abound, never more so than in the first scene with the
daughter who reminds Fenchurch that nowadays the north is only a few hours
away from King's Cross. None of the women's parts add up to much. They
scarcely ever answer back, which is strange when, with the possible
exception of the neighbour, all are supposed to be well-educated
intellectuals. Joanna David's Marion must be the most inarticulate professor
of psychiatry one has ever come across. Rosemary Martin as the neighbour is
more a figment of the imagination than a character.
The set, designed by Jocelyn Herbert, looks as if it has been taken from
recent productions of Pinter: pretty well bare, but with the occasional use
of see-through gauze doors. It is Pinter without the menace.

The report says that 79 per cent of the 455 identified bathing places met EC
coliform - or bacteria - standards. This compares with 76 per cent in 1991

<TEXT>
THE PAKISTAN government yesterday despatched opposition leader Ms Benazir
Bhutto to the southern city of Karachi and placed her under house arrest
after she tried to lead a huge protest march on the capital Islamabad in an
attempt to bring down the government.
In a show of force Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif flooded the capital and
approach roads with troops who fired on protesters and beat them with
sticks. Hundreds were arrested including Ms Bhutto and the main leaders of
her opposition Pakistan People's party.
Ms Bhutto contends that the conservative Islamic government of Mr Sharif is
corrupt, repressive and came to power through rigging elections in 1990. She
led the 18km long march from Rawalpindi to parliament in Islamabad to demand
the government's dismissal and another election.
Although he commands a majority in parliament, Mr Sharif was unnerved by Ms
Bhutto's promise to storm the capital and may have over-reacted.
Police attacked Ms Bhutto and her supporters with batons after they broke
through barbed-wire barricades erected around her house in Islamabad.
Ms Bhutto, who wore a bullet-proof vest, was hit several times.
Later on the way to nearby Rawalpindi to begin the march police fired dozens
of tear-gas shells at her vehicle. He subsequent arrest only helped to fan
the anger of the crowds. In Rawalpindi protestersfought thousands of riot
police
and security forces battled to restore order in Islamabad and elsewhere in
the country.
'My arrest won't make any difference. The struggle will continue,' Ms Bhutto
told the main opposition crowd - estimated in some reports at 30,000 to
40,000 - in a brief address before being driven away.
She was then flown to Karachi where she was placed under house arrest. She
was also banned from the capital, Islamabad, for 30 days.
In Karachi, police said Ms Bhutto and her mother, Nusrat Bhutto, would be
confined to their homes in the city which have been designated as sub-jails
by Sind province's Home Affairs department. Prison regulations will apply to
the house. Government officials said she had been taken into protective
custody and no charges had been brought.
Yesterday's march represented the biggest challenge yet to the government of
Mr Sharif, who was elected after Ms Bhutto was sacked for alleged corruption
by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan in 1990.

FT  19 NOV 92 / De Klerk moves to defuse row over army scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT FW de Klerk last night moved to repair damage caused by
accusations of an army dirty tricks campaign against the African National
Congress by replacing the command of South African military intelligence.
In a statement after a 10-hour cabinet meeting, Mr De Klerk said that
General Pierre Steyn, the chief of the Defence Force Staff, had been placed
in immediate command of all intelligence organisations of the armed forces.
The president also ordered some military intelligence files to be seized.
Mr De Klerk by said he had ordered Gen Steyn and Police General Alwyn
Conradie to 'secure immediate control over all the documentation of the
Directorate of Covert Collection (of military intelligence).
The measures came in response to a statement by a judicial inquiry on Monday
that said military intelligence had sought to involve the armed wing of the
ANC, led by Mr Nelson Mandela, in common crime.
Mr De Klerk said he was seeking an urgent meeting with the inquiry's leader,
Judge Richard Goldstone, who has been appointed by the government to probe
the causes of the political violence which is racking the country. The two
will discuss the judge's request that he be given more resources to
investigate wrongdoing by all armed groups in the country.
Earlier further pressure on the government came from Mr Harry Schwartz, the
South African ambassador to the US, who said he was 'furious and outraged'
at the Goldstone Commission disclosures.
'It has undermined all our effort here, all the hard work that so many
people have put into changing our situation here. There can be no room for
this sort of thing in South Africa,' said Mr Schwartz.
The revelations have been a considerable embarrassment to the government as
they cast doubt on the veracity of previous pledges to stop covert campaigns
against political opponents. They have also impeded efforts to revive the
constitutional negotiation process, stalled since May.
The ANC has called for an expanded judicial inquiry into the military,
echoing Judge Goldstone's request for wider powers, more resources and
greater co-operation in carrying out his investigations.
Meanwhile, Mr Gene Louw, minister of defence, said he 'seriously disputed'
several of Judge Goldstone's statements about the affair.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Exports make small dent in US trade deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A REBOUND in exports led to a US trade deficit of Dollars 8.3bn (Pounds
5.5bn) in September, Dollars 300m lower than in August but still one of the
biggest deficits in two years, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
The slight narrowing in the deficit reflected unexpected strength in
exports, which rose 6.8 per cent from August to Dollars 38.2bn, a record in
cash terms. The improvement was broadly based, with sectors such as
computers, semiconductors and civilian aircraft rebounding after declines in
August.
Imports rose 4 per cent to Dollars 46.5bn, also a cash record. The increase
was concentrated in consumer goods, reflecting a recovery of personal
spending.
The longer-term trends, however, point to a deterioration of the trade
deficit in coming months.
Adjusting for the volatility of monthly figures, exports have barely risen
since the spring, while imports have increased sharply.
The discrepancy mainly reflects stronger growth in demand in the US than in
other big markets, such as Japan and Europe.
The deficit for the first nine months of the year was Dollars 60.1bn,
compared with Dollars 49.2bn in the same period last year.
The geographical spread of the deficit indicated possible trade tensions
next year with Japan and other Asian countries should the US recovery, and
hence import demand, gather momentum.
Last month, the US ran deficits of Dollars 4.4bn with Japan, Dollars 2.3bn
with China and Dollars 1.7bn with Asia's newly-industrialised countries.
By contrast it ran a surplus with most other regions, including western
Europe and Mexico.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOP semiconductor technologists from industry, academia and US government
laboratories are meeting in Dallas this week to develop a strategy for
semiconductor research and development that can be used to direct future US
industry and government spending.
The group will prepare a report to be presented to President-elect Bill
Clinton shortly before his inauguration. The meeting has been planned for
over a year, but has taken on a new significance in light of Mr Clinton's
plans to boost government spending on non-military research and development.
'The report is not expected to call for new money' or government-supported
programmes for semiconductor research and development, said Mr Gordon Moore,
chairman of Intel, who is chairing the meeting, 'but it should serve as a
useful guide to ensure that both public and private funds are spent
efficiently'.
The technologists will identify critical areas of research that need to be
addressed and determine where this work can best be done - whether at
Sematech, the government-backed semiconductor industry research consortium,
in national laboratories, university research departments or by individual
companies or groups of companies.
Elements of the strategy are expected to be drawn from the work of other
industry-led groups including the Semiconductor Research Council, the
National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors and Sematech.
Rather than compiling a 'wish list' for semiconductor research, however, the
technologists will attempt to formulate a plan for the industry to maintain
its competitive posture without the influx of new funds, Mr Moore explained.
The group hopes to guide the efforts of university and government
researchers, Mr Moore said, preventing the possibility of research being
diverted into 'weird materials and weird effects,' with little commercial
potential.
'I don't know of any other industry in which the chief technologies from
government laboratories, universities, consortia and private industries have
come together to work out a technology direction. This could serve as a
useful model for other industries,' Mr Moore said.
The plan to present the industry-led report to Mr Clinton signals what is
expected to be a much closer relationship between industry and the White
House under the new administration.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Clinton meets Bush in White House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT-ELECT Bill Clinton yesterday arrived in Washington for a private
White House meeting with President George Bush and what Mr Clinton described
as 'a candid assessment of world affairs'.
Particularly at issue is the degree of co-operation that Mr Clinton can
expect from President Bush in the run-up to the presidential inauguration in
January.
In fact, Bush has promised the full cooperation of his administration, and
Clinton has praised the president's helpfulness. Nonetheless, Mr Clinton
planned to spend just 55 minutes with the president.
Republican congressional leaders have served notice on Governor Bill Clinton
that they intend to act as his chaperons on his presidential honeymoon.
But although Mr Clinton says he prefers to 'dance with the one that brung
you', he may be tempted from time to time to flirt with his escorts.
Party divisions are rarely clear in the US, and many presidents have
governed with shifting congressional coalitions.
Many Republicans are now hinting that they could be receptive to
President-elect Clinton on some issues, especially if he sticks to the
centrist views that he has espoused as governor, rather than the more
liberal doctrines of his presidential campaign.
That is particularly so of some of his fellow-governors, many of whom have
worked with him during his years running Arkansas.
'We will be as supportive as we can with the new president. He can be
assured that this group will not take any cheap shots,' said Governor George
Voinovich, president of the Republican Governors' Association.
Mr Voinovich says the number one problem most governors face is the federal
government's habit of issuing new mandates to the states without giving them
any additional money.
'We take consolation from the fact that he is a governor. He certainly
understands our concern about mandates without money.'
Governor Carroll Campbell of South Carolina, who co-chaired a governors'
taskforce on education with Mr Clinton but who has fought him tooth and nail
over the last six months as head of Mr Bush's re-election campaign in the
South, also takes a conciliatory line.
'Everybody likes Bill. . . There are areas where we can get out there and
support him, and we should,' Mr Campbell said.
But Senator Robert Dole, Republican leader in the US Senate, warns that he
has no plans to give Mr Clinton an easy ride. 'The American people want him
to succeed, but I have never thought as a Republican that it was our
obligation just to give up. Don't expect Bob Dole to hand over the keys of
the place without a fight,' he said this week.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Solchaga blames Germans''perverse' policy mix
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, yesterday criticised Germany
for exacerbating difficulties in the European monetary system (EMS).
Mr Solchaga said German interest rates, having suffered the consequences of
German unification, currently reflected 'a policy mix that has traditionally
been considered perverse'. He compared German spending to that by the US in
the 1960s 'which led to the irreversible collapse of the Bretton Woods
agreements'.
At a Financial Times conference on Spain and Europe, Mr Solchaga said a
redirection of the German policy mix was a 'herculean task' that the German
monetary authorities were addressing and which all parties concerned
realised would take time.
He argued however that 'the maintenance of a strong D-Mark and a
co-ordinated, and possibly not homogenous, reduction of European interest
rates' should not be mutually exclusive.
Mr Solchaga said Spain was 'willing to back any Community agreement aimed at
solving the EMS crisis that began in September'. The UK and Italy withdrew
from the system in the midst of the currency turmoil two months ago, and
Spain, together with other Community partners, introduced currency exchange
restrictions in order to maintain their currencies within the EMS.
Mr Solchaga said that even if a realignment were politically possible,
little would be gained unless all the EC members were 'simultaneously able
to end the current anomalous situation of the EMS'.
Mr Solchaga said that Spain was determined to meet the criteria for economic
and monetary union and would pursue convergence policies.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Motorists to pay as they go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTORISTS COULD be paying to use roads in London and other cities by the
late 1990s, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, signalled yesterday.
Tolls would be collected electronically, with meters in cars activated by
roadside transmitters clocking up charges according to distance travelled,
vehicle type and time of day.
Mr MacGregor appears to have accepted that charging motorists on a
pay-as-you-go basis is likely to provide the only feasible long-term
solution to worsening urban traffic congestion. He has the support of
environment ministers who favour such charges as a way to curb the rise in
carbon dioxide emissions that accompanies rapid traffic growth.
Speaking at a London traffic conference yesterday, Mr MacGregor in effect
launched a campaign to soften up public opinion in readiness for the likely
introduction of road pricing in the late 1990s.
He said no firm decisions would be taken before the completion of a
three-year feasibility study at the end of 1994, but his intention was to
get a debate going.
Mr MacGregor acknowledged that road pricing was likely to prove unpopular,
but said that the alternative could be even worse. 'Is increasing
congestion, and ultimately gridlock, a more attractive option?' he asked.
Road pricing would shorten journey times, improve bus services and cut
transport costs, he said. It would also help trade and commerce by making
cities more attractive places in which to live, shop and work.
The initiative may yet face opposition from Mr MacGregor's cabinet
colleagues, some of whom will argue that road pricing could become a
transport version of the poll tax.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Labour acts on union votes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour party has moved closer to radically reducing union influence in
policy making with plans to give votes at its annual conference to MPs, MEPs
and possibly local councillors.
However the Labour/Trade Union Review Group, which met yesterday, decided
not to end union influence from the selection of local candidates and the
election of the party leader and deputy leader.
Instead of the idea of 'one member, one vote' in such elections, the review
group has backed the creation of a new category of 'registered supporters'
for union members paying a political levy who are not members of the party.
Registered supporters would have to be consulted in elections for the party
leaders and in local selection elections.
The paper presented to yesterday's meeting was not formally approved but is
expected to go virtually unchanged to a meeting of the party's National
Executive early next year. ever'.
The paper recommends cutting the unions' block vote from 70 per cent to 50
per cent and ensuring that votes are cast by actual delegates rather than
through card votes wielded by union leaders.
On the role of MPs and MEPs the paper says: 'In virtually all sister
socialist parites elected representatives have a direct, individual, vote at
conference'. MPs have no vote at the Labour conference and many say they
would prefer not to have one so as to avoid potential conflict with their
constituency parties.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Guidelines may be set up for human genetics research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is considering establishing a national policy on human
genetics - an area in which research is moving very quickly and raising
important social, regulatory and industrial issues.
The policy could include guidelines to cover controversial areas such as
patenting human genes and preventing discrimination against potential
carriers of genetic diseases. It could also lay down a strategy to enable
industry, particularly drug companies, to benefit as much as possible from
genetic research.
Professor Bill Stewart, the government chief scientist, has held a
preliminary meeting with the research directors of leading drug companies,
medical charities and the government's Medical Research Council to exchange
ideas on what might be done.
The Office of Science and Technology has decided that genetics is an
important area of science which could benefit from such a co-ordinated
approach. The office was set up after the election with Mr William
Waldegrave as minister in charge.
If the move is successful, it could be a blueprint for similar action by the
office in other fields.
Researchers are discovering thousands of new human genes every year. Within
15 years they expect to have decoded all of the 100,000 genes which provide
the blueprint for human development from the foetus to old age.
They are developing tests to diagnose genetic defects that predispose people
to illness - and are beginning to find ways to correct defects through 'gene
therapy'.
The issues covered by the Office of Science and Technology review are likely
to include:
Ethics: how to protect the rights of individuals and families who are
carrying genes that predispose them to serious diseases such as cancer.
Legislation may be needed to outlaw 'genetic discrimination' by employers
and insurers.
Ownership: the terms under which researchers can patent human genes and
exploit them commercially. The Medical Research Council has followed the
controversial lead of the US National Institutes of Health in applying for
pre-emptive patents on thousands of genes whose function is not yet known.
Research: how to co-ordinate programmes in the UK with similar efforts
elsewhere. The country's leading genetic research centre is likely to be the
Pounds 50m Sanger Centre, which the research council and Wellcome Trust are
setting up near Cambridge.
Dr Richard Sykes, research director of Glaxo, said that from the
pharmaceutical industry's point of view, 'a key issue is how we can access
and manipulate the tremendous amounts of information generated about human
genes to fight disease'.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Heseltine heartens machine toolmakers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Heseltine brought some cheer to the hard-pressed machine tool
industry last night with a rousing speech in support of government
intervention to help manufacturing industry succeed.
The trade and industry secretary told the Machine Tool Technologies
Association dinner: 'I have no doubt about the determination of the
government to create the climate in which the manufacturing sector can
flourish.'
He made only an oblique reference to the Matrix Churchill and exports to
Iraq affair - he admitted he had attended the dinner with some trepidation.
Mr Ron Bull, association president, received the biggest cheer of the night
when he said: 'I welcome the fact that cases against our colleagues with
regard to Iraq have been withdrawn.'
Mr Keith Bailey, the head of BSA Tools and against whom charges were dropped
last week, was sitting only three places away from Mr Heseltine on the top
table. Mr Paul Henderson, former Matrix Churchill managing director and one
of three men cleared when the Matrix Churchill trial collapsed, was also at
the dinner.
Mr Heseltine said the Autumn Statement had clearly indicated that the
government had listened to industry. Mr Norman Lamont had set 'an agenda
that was necessary for the depth of the recession'.
His speech was broadly welcomed but he made few specific references to the
industry's problems. The head of a leading machine tool manufacturer said:
'He must be living on a different planet to me.'

FT  19 NOV 92 / Warning over rail-track costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWERGEN and National Power, the privatised electricity generators,
yesterday called for British Rail's freight transport arm to be exposed to a
free market. But they warned that the allocation of rail-track costs would
be crucial to their future use of the rail network.
Their warning came as Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, fiercely rejected
accusations that BR was blocking the plans of private-sector train operators
by overcharging for the use of its tracks.
The generators complained that they were being charged more than other
freight users, and were being denied information on how costs were
calculated.
Mr Alf Roberts, an executive director of PowerGen, said in evidence to the
Commons transport committee: 'We believe the charges we experience are
significantly higher than those for other users for an equivalent service.'
He added that there was a 'significant connection between the issue of
British Coal and the issue of British Rail and freight transport costs.'
Mr Keith McNair, National Power's director of fuel management, warned that
increased rail transport costs could prompt a move away from coal to other
fuels as transport costs formed 10 per cent of the final cost of coal.
Mr McNair said that National Power's offers to buy and operate its own
locomotives and trucks had also been rejected. If no other operator could
offer competitive transport after privatisation, National Power would
consider operating the service itself.
Sir Bob denied in a lecture at London University that BR was overcharging
private operators. He said track infrastructure represented nearly 50 per
cent of BR's costs and private-sector train operators wanting access to the
tracks must expect to share the burden.
In the last few weeks several companies have accused BR of undermining their
plans to introduce new rail services. BAA, the airports group, has been
particularly outspoken in accusing BR of blocking the launch of the Heathrow
Express by asking too much for the use of its tracks out of London
Paddington station.
Sir Bob said the track was not only very expensive to put in place, but also
required extremely costly maintenance.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Exams league table fiercely attacked: A north-south divide
appears in rankings which have been published for the first time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLICATION by the gov-ernment of this year's GCSE and A-level examination
results for schools in England caused fierce controversy yesterday.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, hailed the exercise - involving the
issue of 3m booklets - as central to the Citizen's Charter, enabling parents
to make informed choices about schools for their children.
Opposition parties, teachers' unions and an array of educationalists
denounced the results tables as seriously misleading because they presented
'raw' results, making no allowance for socio-economic factors.
The booklets detailing results achieved by all state schools and about a
quarter of private schools will be distributed under the Parent's Charter,
at a cost of Pounds 1.4m. Separate booklets for each of England's 108 local
authority areas will be available through schools, libraries and from
telephone request lines.
Ranked by GCSE performance, London boroughs come top and bottom. After the
Scilly Isles, with its one secondary school, are the London boroughs of
Harrow and Kingston. Tower Hamlets, Barking and Southwark, all of which have
large areas of deprivation, come bottom.
Mr Philip Hygate, chief executive of Isles of Scilly council, said the isles
position at the top of the table was not an aberration. 'It demonstrates the
importance that education has on the Isles of Scilly. It is a historical and
cultural issue.' The Isles of Scilly had compulsory education 30 years
before the rest of the country. 'Almost 100 per cent of our pupils go on to
A-levels or further education,' said Mr Hygate.
Mr Patten said the tables 'mark the start of an information revolution,
bringing an end to a system which has too often denied parents the right to
know how schools are performing'.
The National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations condemned the
tables as 'lies, damned lies and school exam statistics'.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said: 'No parents should set too
much store by raw results which cannot reflect the real achievements of
schools - unless viewed with caution tables could unfairly damage the
reputation of a school.'
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the 179,000-strong National
Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers, said the tables
'do nothing more than confirm the obvious'. He said: 'Children in the
gin-and-tonic belt of the south-east do better than those from the poorer
areas of the country.'
The tables are only the first instalment. Next year all primary schools and
their results in the national tests for seven-year-olds will be included.
Results from all independent schools will also be included, as will
information on national curriculum test results for 14-year-olds, truancy
rates and school-leaver destinations.
LEAs and the independent sector complained yesterday at the way the tables
were compiled.

UNION negotiators yesterday claimed victory when GEC Avery, the
Birmingham-based weighing equipment subsidiary of the UK electronics and
electrical engineering group, agreed to restore an enhanced redundancy pay
agreement for more than 2,000 workers.
The agreement, due to be signed today, wins back the right to redundancy pay
for workers employed before April 6. It had been cut about two years ago as
part of an economy drive. The move follows a damages award by the High Court
to a former employee made redundant on inferior terms.
The company has agreed to pay unions' court costs of Pounds 130,000.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Blue Circle to cut jobs and capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLUE CIRCLE, Britain's biggest cement manufacturer, is expected to announce
plans today to cut its workforce by a fifth in response to the recession.
The company is expected to announce that more than 500 jobs will go as a
result of a series of kiln closures at its 10 UK plants.
The move is expected to reduce Blue Circle's annual capacity by about 1m
tonnes to 7m tonnes. This compares with sales of just under 6m tonnes
forecast for this year - accounting for just under half of the UK cement
market. The cuts will be a further blow to the UK construction industry,
which has lost more than 400,000 jobs since 1989.
Annual sales by UK cement manufacturers have fallen by a third since 1989,
from 17.5m tonnes to just under 12m tonnes. The industry has warned that
sales could slide further in 1993 when UK construction output is forecast to
fall by up to another 2 per cent.
Blue Circle has been operating its plants at under 75 per cent of capacity.
It is understood to have decided that it can no longer postpone kiln
closures given the delay in recovery. In September Blue Circle reported a
fall in pre-tax profits for the first half of the year from Pounds 57.5m to
Pounds 42.7m.
After the latest cuts, the UK's three largest cement manufacturers - Blue
Circle, Castle and Rugby, which produce more than 95 per cent of cement sold
in Britain - will have annual capacity of 13m tonnes, about 1m tonnes more
than current sales.

LAURENTIAN Group, a Montreal-based financial services conglomerate, had
third quarter profits of CDollars 9.5m (USDollars 7.4m), or 16 cents a
share, up 13 per cent from CDollars 8.4m, or 14 cents, a year earlier.
Results from the general insurance subsidiary improved.
Nine months' profit was CDollars 23.8m, or 39 cents a share, down nearly 9
per cent from CDollars 26.1m, or 45 cents, a year earlier. The 1991 period
included a special gain of CDollars 2.5m from the sale of a British
affiliate. Nine months' revenues were CDollars 2.1bn, up 7 per cent.
Corporate assets at September 30 were CDollars 14.4bn, up 5 per cent from
December 31 1991. Including assets under administration, the total was
CDollars 20.9bn, up 6 per cent. The gain in corporate assets was due mainly
to expansion by Laurentian Bank.
Teck, an internationally-owned diversified mining group, is expected to take
over the Baler and Greenhills coal mines in southern British Columbia from
the bankrupt Westar Mining. Teck bid CDollars 85m, with the backing of the
Bank of Montreal, Westar's largest secured creditor.

FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: TWA wrangle takes fresh twist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-running wrangle between interested parties at Trans World Airlines,
the bankrupt US carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn, took a new twist yesterday,
as the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal agency which
underpins pension benefits in the US, rejected a proposal from the airline's
creditors.
Part of the proposal would have involved Mr Icahn providing a Dollars 200m
short-term loan to TWA. This would have helped tide the carrier through the
difficult winter period, until it emerged from bankruptcy. But the PBGC said
the proposal would not have given adequate protection to pension plans at
the airline, which it claims are underfunded by Dollars 1.2bn, and would
have allowed Mr Icahn to escape the complex pension situation 'at a small
fraction of his obligations'.
The PBGC struck a deal with the airline, its unsecured creditors and unions
last month. Under this deal, TWA would issue 15-year notes, totalling
Dollars 300m, to cover a portion of the underfunding. The two pension plans
would be closed off shortly before the airline emerged from Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection, so that the agency could then pursue its claims
against Mr Icahn and his other business interests.
The PBGC said yesterday that it was prepared to accept amendments to that
agreement, but that the latest creditors' proposal failed 'to meet the
test', when it came to protection of pension interests.
Sir Colin Marshall, British Airways' chief executive, yesterday reiterated
his unwillingness to go ahead with a Dollars 750m investment in USAir, the
US carrier, if the US aviation authorities insist that the opening-up of
Heathrow Airport is a condition for approving the deal. However, he
suggested there could be 'in-between positions, and certainly there is no
reason why our respective governments cannot agree on the achievement of
those objectives'.
This brought a retort from United Airlines, one of the big three US carriers
opposing the BA/USAir deal in the absence of a aviation pact between the UK
and the US. Mr Stephen Wolf, United's chairman, described BA's
'protectionist posture' as 'not in the interests of consumer, US flag
carrier, their employees and the communities they serve'.

FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Costain seeks dismissals in Australian case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COSTAIN, the UK construction group, has asked the US Federal Court and the
High Court in the UK to dismiss proceedings designed to prevent it from
selling its Australian coal mining business to a higher bidder.
This follows legal moves to prevent Costain from selling the business to
Altus Finance, a subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank.
Peabody Holding, the US-based coal-mining subsidiary of Hanson, the UK
conglomerate, has asked the US courts to enforce an earlier agreement which
would have allowed it to buy the New South Wales coal mines.
Altus earlier this month agreed to pay Dollars 245m (Pounds 162m) for the
mining operations and Costain's remaining Australian commercial property
interests.
This compares with an offer of Dollars 200m from Peabody for just the coal
mining business.
Peabody alleges that Costain in accepting the Altus bid has acted in 'bad
faith and breach of written obligations'.
Costain said yesterday that it had asked the US Federal court to dismiss the
Peabody action. It has also started proceedings against Peabody and Hanson
Holdings in the UK High Court seeking a declaration that the deal with Altus
be permitted to proceed.
The UK construction group said that the original agreement was with a UK
subsidiary of Hanson and that 'this was recognised by the specific and
voluntary agreement by the parties to accept English law and jurisdiction.
Peabody has demonstrated its bad faith by choosing to ignore this.
'We have therefore taken appropriate steps to seek dismissal of the action
in the US and have moved in the UK to establish our right to proceed with
and complete our agreement with Altus.'

<TEXT>
GOOD MORNING Television, the new commercial breakfast station, will not
break even at the pre-tax level until 1996 according to James Capel, the
stockbroker.
In a generally gloomy assessment of ITV's financial prospects, the report
says the deteriorating television advertising environment will be offset by
GMTV, which succeeds TV-am, cutting its cost base.
Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at Capel, has however increased his forecast
loss for GMTV in its first year from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 3.5m and suggests
that operating break-even will not come until 1995, and the first pre-tax
profit of Pounds 1.5m not until 1997.
GMTV is owned by Carlton Communications, LWT (Holdings), Scottish TV, Walt
Disney and the Guardian and Manchester Evening News.
Capel believes the outlook for UK television advertising has worsened since
September.

FT  19 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A day of contrasts, the futures market powered to a large premium in busy
afternoon trading after a dull and largely negative start, writes
Christopher Price.
The December FT-SE contract opened lethargically at 2,684 in quiet business.
It traded at a discount to the cash market and drifted down amid concerns
over Gatt and the upcoming retail sales figures.
When they arrived the figures were a pleasant surprise but they only stirred
activity slightly and December traded around the 2,690-2,700 range until
around 2pm.
A strong rumour then appeared in the futures market suggesting that the Gatt
world trade talks had actually been settled and December was then moved
smartly forward.
There was some resistance at the 2,709 level, but after this was breached,
dealers reported heavy buying, which included a large programme trade.
December closed at 2,730, up 46 on the previous close and at a healthy
15-point premium to its fair value of around nine. Volume was 7,334
contracts compared with 6,165 lots previously.
In traded options, only 19,990 contracts were traded, over 8,000 of which
were in the FT-SE 100. Asda topped the stock options at 1,204, followed by
Rolls-Royce on 1,089, HSBC on 1,064 and British Gas with 599.

FT  19 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index regains the 2,700 mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CALM session in UK equities suddenly sprang to life yesterday afternoon
when the FT-SE Index jumped 24.8 points to regain the 2,700 mark again in
response to better news on domestic retail sales, interest rate cuts in
Belgium and Holland and hints that the resumed GATT talks would reach a
satisfactory outcome. The upturn, which favoured consumer and retail
industry stocks, was led by demand for stock index futures and by
speculative excitement prompted by disclosure of a potential bid for Union
Discount, once one of the monarchs of London's discount house network.
Having shown only a very modest improvement until early in the afternoon,
the stock market rose sharply when the December future contract on the
Footsie threw off the lethargy of the past two sessions and moved back into
a substantial premium against the underlying index.
The FT-SE Index closed at 2,704, just below the day's best levels, with the
December contract still showing a good premium. Trading volume increased as
the market advanced to record a Seaq-reported total for the day of 551m
shares against 480.4m on Tuesday.
Dealers said that turnover remained below the peak levels of recent weeks,
noting that shortage of stock had been a significant factor yesterday's
price gains. Retail value on Tuesday was relatively low at Pounds 816.7m.
Market strategists expressed confidence in the market's rebound which
underlined London's success in resisting weakness in other global stock
markets earlier this week and was unperturbed by yesterday's news that the
UK government plans another sale of shares in BT, the national
telecommunications network. They hope to see the Footsie challenge its
all-time trading highs of around 2,744 reached in May this year.
The rise of 0.1 per cent in October domestic retail sales, showing a year on
year rise of 1.8 per cent, surprised a market discouraged on Tuesday by a
somewhat bearish report on the distributive trades from the Confederation of
British Industry.
News of interest rate cuts in Belgium and Holland, together with suggestions
that bank analysts in Germany were predicting sharp falls in Bundesbank
rates as early as January, restored some of London's hopes that the next cut
in UK base rates will not be long postponed. Nervousness lest the cut in
base rates announced in the Autumn economic statement might prove the last
for some months had unsettled the market at the beginning of the week.
Gradually, sentiment in the market turned higher after a dull start which
had seen shares held back by another fall in Hong Kong equities. A lengthy
list of corporate trading statements helped buttress confidence. Good
results from the sector helped breweries follow the retail store groups and
the banks to higher ground.
The international blue chips, restrained by an easier trend in the US
dollar, and by an uncertain start to the new session in New York, achieved
only relatively modest gains. However, these leading stocks later began to
respond to the strength of the stock index future and also to renewed
interest in prospects for ICI's plans to demerge its bio-scientific
interests.

FT  19 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Demerger appraisal curbs ICI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEMICALS group ICI underperformed the market ahead of publication of a
weighty piece of research from Smith New Court which is expected to hit
clients' desks this morning. The 90-page document assesses the value of the
group in detail and concludes that the planned demerger will leave the
constituent parts with a joint value of 950p a share. That estimate is
significantly lower than initial forecasts when the demerger was first
announced in July.
The research document values the chemicals side of the group at 350p a share
and the pharmaceuticals side at 600p, giving a total capitalisation of
Pounds 6.8bn. Smiths' chemicals team also believes that the demerger will
have to be deferred for a year and the company will have to review its
dividend policy.
Analyst Mr Charles Lambert said; 'On the present evidence the demerger does
not appear to offer any initial upside for shareholders.' The team argues
that if the demerger does go ahead the chemicals arm will offer better value
than the bio-science side which will trade under the new name of Zeneca from
January. The stock closed 5 higher at 1037p yesterday.
Drama in BT
BT shares were enjoying another strong session and trading at 403p, their
highest level this year, before the chancellor of the exchequer's statement
in the House of Commons that the treasury intended another sale of BT shares
next year.
BT shares quickly turned down when the news filtered into the market just
before the close. As the session ended the stock price settled only a
half-pence higher at 396p with turnover accelerating sharply to end at 8m
shares.
The partly-paid shares were similarly boosted early on, touching 298p but
came off equally rapidly to close the day only a penny harder at 292 1/2 p;
turnover in the partly-paid was a lowly 3.6m.
The goverment's holding in BT amounts to 1.352bn shares, or 21.9 per cent of
the equity. When it decided to sell the second tranche of BT shares in 1991
the government said it would not sell more stock until the third and final
payment on the second tranche had been paid. This payment falls due on March
3 next year.
Although acknowledging that BT shares may fall in the short-term on the
prospect of a flood of new shares into the market next year, specialists
said there were three good reasons why BT III should go better than BT II.
Firstly; after BT III there would be no overhang of government-held stock;
secondly BT II was carried out under the threat of a change in government
from Conservative to Labour; thirdly much of the regulatory risk is already
thought to be in the price.
One caveat, however, would be the worry that overseas investors would be
more wary of moving heavily into the new shares because of the currency risk
inherent in investments in the UK since sterling withdrew from the Exchange
Rate Mechanism.
Thorn upset
Shares in both Thorn EMI and W H Smith were hit on recurring worries over
the state of trading in the world's music business. Thorn suffered the
worst, the shares off 17 at 775p, as a number of brokers took a bearish
stance reflecting on new industry figures which suggested that the growth in
music sales was faltering in the first three quarters of the year. Mr Jason
Crisp at Strauss Turnbull said: 'Thorn bought Virgin at the height of the
market and paid too much for it, in what is obviously a declining market.'
He reinforced his sell stance and said that the shares would have to fall a
further 15 per cent before being attractive.
Sentiment was little improved by speculation that sales at Our Price, the WH
Smith music and video subsidiary, were weak and current trading sluggish.
County NatWest cut its current year profit forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds
105m after visiting the group and suggested that the interims in January
would show a profits downturn. Smith shares retreated 5 to 453p.
Positive comments on current trading from Ladbroke to selected brokers this
week sent the shares forward for a second day. They rose 8 to 183p as UBS
Phillips and Drew was said to have upgraded the group and County NatWest
reinforced its buy recommendation on yield and rating considerations.
Union Discount busy
Shares in Union Discount, the discount house whose interests include
Winterflood Securities, the specialist marketmaking firm, raced up 10 to 71p
and prompted the group to disclose that it was involved in 'very preliminary
stages' of talks that could lead to a bid for the group.
The market immediately focused on Cater Allen, the second-largest of the
quoted discount houses and known to have a near-three per cent holding in
Union, as a potential bidder for the group. There were also suggestions that
a European financial group could be interested in acquiring Union.
Cater Allen, whose shares were marginally higher at 381p, is scheduled to
reveal interim figures this morning.
The BT III flotation news gave a strong push to SG Warburg, which was global
co-ordinator to BT II in 1991 and is seen a strong favourite to do thesame
job for the third tranche of BT.
The life issues surged ahead after strong support from one of the leading UK
integrated houses, with Legal &amp; General up 15 at 402p and Prudential 7
higher at 375p. Commercial Union's third quarter figures were well-received
and saw the shares add 9 to 573p.
Willis Corroon proved a major disappointment to the market with the 32 per
cent fall in nine-months profits and a very disappointing post-results
meeting triggering a steep slide in the shares which eventually closed 14
off at 174p, the worst individual performance of any Footsie stock.
Tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries lifted 24 to 952p following
meeetings between the company and investors this week. It was also suggested
that negative reaction this week to a US supreme court decision involving
BAT's Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp case might been overdone. The
insurance side of BAT was further helping shares as the outlook for some
insurers lightened slightly.
The world's biggest mining group RTZ Corp fell 14 to 604p on talk that a US
broker had a line of stock on offer.
Wellcome was squeezed 16 higher to 998p on minimal turnover.
British Airways rebounded 13 to 261p on continuing heavy turnover of 18m
shares.
The drinks sector was buoyed by a number of factors, not least of which was
a relief factor from Whitbread, whose figures contained none of the feared
black holes. Yesterday, they put on 11 to 432p. The sector, and the latter
stock in particular, was further strengthened by news that the gaming board
had increased the payout from fruit machines. Finally, the afternoon rumour
that the Gatt talks had been settled gave a push to Allied Lyons, up 5 at
634p.
The retail sales figures gave a shine to selected stores and food stocks.
Sainsbury gained 9 1/2 to 487p and Tesco 8 1/2 to 236p in continued busy
turnover of 9.4m.
Publisher Reed International slipped 7 to 597p in response to a sharp fall
in Elsevier on the Amsterdam stock exchange.
Ink manufacturer Usher-Walker saw its shares jump 80 to 161p after an
announcement of an agreed bid by Sun Chemical Corporation.
Thames Television lifted 7 to 186p on strong rumours that an announcement
about the financing for the new Channel Five would be made this week.
Scottish Television fell 9 to 378p with Smith New Court said to have been
sellers. Smiths' media team was up in Scotland talking to institutions.
Chemicals company Courtaulds performed well after reporting half-year
profits. Analysts were reasssured by the cautiously optimistic statement
from the company. The shares ended 19 up at 489p.

FT  19 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow bounces back on improved
trade data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER two days of losses, US stock markets bounced back into positive
territory yesterday on the heels of a big rally in Tokyo and improved trade
figures, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 14.05 at 3,207.37,
slightly below its highs for the session. The more broadly based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 finished up 3.59 at 422.86, while the Amex composite edged 2.20
to 386.49. The Nasdaq composite, which had been hit by heavy profit-taking
earlier in the week, recovered strongly, adding 7.80 at 634.87. NYSE
turnover was heavy at 219m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1171 to
625.
Analysts were not surprised when the market opened firmer. The selling of
Monday and Tuesday had lacked real conviction, prices were due for a modest
upward correction and sentiment was buoyed by a strong overnight performance
from Japanese equities.
Investors were also cheered by the news that the trade deficit in September
had narrowed to Dollars 8.3bn from Dollars 9bn in August.
The market had been expecting a larger trade gap, but economists warned that
the record level of merchandise exports in September - which was behind the
drop in the deficit - was not sustainable because of weakening overseas
economies.
Among individual stocks, Hewlett-Packard rose Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 58
3/4 in turnover of 4.4m shares in spite of news that the computer group
earned 28 cents a share in its fiscal fourth quarter in the wake of a 36
cents a share restructuring charge.
The earnings were below forecasts and analysts were at a loss to explain the
stock's rise, although the heavy selling of the shares earlier in the week
may have persuaded some investors they had become a bargain buy.
Ford eased Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 38 7/8 in turnover of almost 1m shares
after the securities house, Warburg, widened its fourth-quarter loss
estimate from 20 cents a share to 50 cents a share, primarily because of
problems with European markets.
On the Nasdaq market, Price Co jumped Dollars 2 at Dollars 42 1/2 in
turnover of 2m shares on uncomfirmed speculation that giant retailer Kmart
is in talks to acquire the warehouse club group. Kmart eased Dollars  1/8 to
Dollars 26 1/2 .
Elsewhere on the Nasdaq, leading technology stocks began to recoup some of
the losses incurred in recent days. Apple, which announced buy back another
10m of its own shares, put on Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 57 3/4 , Microsoft
firmed Dollars 2 to Dollars 92, Borland International clawed back Dollars
1/4 at Dollars 25 and Sun Microsystems rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 31 7/8 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended a four-session losing streak to end moderately higher.
Based on preliminary data, the TSE 300-stock composite index climbed 13.16
points, or 0.41 per cent, to 3231.68, with declines leading advances 286 to
254. Volume fell to 32,748,000 shares worth C325.1m, compared with
39,117,000 shares worth C378.9m on Tuesday.
The media sector and banks were tops among the sub-groups, each adding 1.4
per cent on index.

FT  19 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Bangkok falls as deflation takes effect
 -Thai equities have responded to a move against a market player
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bangkok's SET index fell 6.4 per cent to an intraday low of 834.35 yesterday
after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it had
filed a case with the police against Mr Song Watcharasriroj, a well-known
market player better known as Sia Song, and his associates for manipulating
stock prices.
The index recovered in the closing minutes to end down 23.45 at 868.04 after
the finance ministry said it had set up a Bt5bn fund to shore up the market.
But the move against Mr Song was the culmination of a process over the past
two weeks in which Thailand's financial authorities have been deflating,
qently, what they feared was an emerging and potentially dangerous stock
market bubble.
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index and market turnover had soared
since a new coalition government was formed in September.
Not all the activity, however, has been attributed to the return of
political stability and the renewed confidence of investors. The authorities
have been alarmed by what they see as wildly speculative buying of certain
stocks and a sharp increase in loans extended by stockbrokers to their
clients.
Last week, amid mounting criticism of the apparently feeble attempts of the
SET and the six-month-old SEC to regulate the market, the Bank of Thailand
and the finance ministry stepped in. The Bank named 22 brokers with
outstanding loans to clients of more than Bt1bn (Dollars 39.4m) and urged
them to restrict credit.
The brokers had little choice but to comply, and the market responded
quickly to the new austerity. Trading volume - at times second only to Tokyo
among Asian bourses - has fallen back, and the SET index has dropped from
its November 5 peak of 963.03.
SET officials say there was no hard evidence that stockbrokers had violated
overall guidelines on credit extension, but they were concerned about very
high activity in particular stocks. By September, brokers had outstanding
loans of Bt62.66bn to their clients - three times as much as a year earlier
 -with CMIC alone accounting for around Bt10bn. Speculators also have access
to money from banks in the form of personal loans.
'There is excessive speculation in the market,' says Mr Seri Chintanaseri,
SET president. 'This speculation would never have occurred if there was no
expansion of credit.'
Mr Asavin Chintakananda, Mr Seri's deputy, says: 'We are trying to allow
some steam out of the bubble before it becomes a bubble. I think we have the
matter well in hand.'
The twin issues of market regulation and credit extension to speculators
became particularly controversial when Mr Song took large stakes in Bangkok
Bank of Commerce (BBC) and in Mutual Fund Co. The SEC ordered the suspension
of BBC shares yesterday.
Mr Song, who takes his business to several brokerages, including CMIC, was
reported to have bought up to 30 per cent of BBC in collaboration with
several associates. He made no offer for the rest of the company, although
he ought to have done so if he did indeed control more than 25 per cent.
The SET says that it has passed 11 cases of possible stock manipulation to
the SEC for investigation since the Commission was established in May, but
so far none has come to court and it is not clear which companies other than
BBC are being investigated.
The SEC, under fire because some of its members have potential conflicts of
interest (one has been advising the chairman of BBC and another is head of a
brokerage firm), has pleaded for more time.
'It's not that simple,' says Mr Ekamol Kiriwat, SEC secretary-general. 'How
long did it take for (Michael) Milken to be in trouble?'
The confusion at the SET and the SEC seems to have prompted the central bank
and the finance ministry to adopt a two-track policy to steady the market.
On the one hand they are seeking to curb the speculators, and on the other
they are announcing as loudly as possible that the market is fundamentally
strong and accurately reflects the dynamism of an economy growing at 7 or 8
per cent a year. So far, the tactic seems to be working.

FT  19 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recovery flawed
by lack of investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Nikkei average climbed 4.9 per cent in active trading on rumours that
financial authorities were putting pressure on public fund managers to
inject funds into the stock market, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed 785.36 higher at 16,778.84, after a high of 16,851.45 in
the last minutes of trading. Having opened at the day's low of 16,011.33, it
was led higher by banking shares in the morning.
Volume rose to 350m shares from 194m. A total of 240m shares changed hands
in the afternoon, bolstered by buying by public funds, arbitrageurs and
investment trusts. Advances overwhelmed declines by 948 to 79 with 67
unchanged. All sectors gained ground and the Topix index of all first
section stocks rose 49.88 to 1,271.21. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
eased 0.44 to 1,023.70.
The early buying fanned rumours that the ministry of finance had asked
postal savings and public pension funds to commit funds to the stock market.
While many market participants remained on the sidelines, investors who had
sold short rushed to buy to cover their positions.
Speculation that an agreement between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
and opposition parties would be struck also helped sentiment to improve.
But traders noted that the underlying economic factors had not changed and
said there was little genuine buying by investors. Mr Chris Newton at James
Capel said: 'The rally was technical, mainly driven by heavy
short-covering.'
Public funds bought the electronics sector, which had been falling on
earnings concerns. NEC rose Y32 to Y640, while Fujitsu gained Y24 to Y526.
Bank shares, which had fallen on rumours of short-selling, also advanced.
Industrial Bank of Japan added Y150 to Y2,380 and Mitsubishi Bank gained
Y160 to Y2,190. Nippon Housing Loan, the troubled non-bank financial
institution, rose Y47 to Y250.
Dealers came back to trade speculative theme stocks. Green Cross, the most
active issue of the day, rose Y40 to Y1,410, while SS Pharmaceutical gained
Y100 to Y1,090.
In Osaka, the OSE average put on 614.35 to 18,082.07 in volume of 28.8m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, gained Y340 to Y10,100. The company
is likely to become the third largest earner among listed Japanese
manufacturing companies this fiscal year, as its parent pre-tax profit is
expected to surpass that of Matsushita Electronic Industrial.
Roundup
THE REGION was active and volatile in several markets, mainly on political
rumours and concerns.
HONG KONG nosedived 3.9 per cent on worries over Chinese criticism of
governor Chris Patten's proposed democratic reforms. The Hang Seng index
closed 240.19 lower at the day's low of 5,848.33 in turnover up from
HKDollars 3.76bn to a busy HKDollars 4.14bn.
There was a burst of selling by overseas institutions in late trading.
Leading blue chips saw profit-taking, with HSBC Holdings tumbling HKDollars
2.50 to HKDollars 60 and Cheung Kong HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 20.90.
BOMBAY fell to a low for the 1992/93 financial year (April/March) as trading
resumed after a four-day gap. The market was closed on Monday for
settlement, and on Tuesday brokers boycotted trading in protest against
registration fees imposed by Sebi, the new regulatory agency.
The BSE index fell to 2,501.77 before recovering some ground to finish at
2,524.71, still down 61.97 from last Friday's close. Brokers blamed poor
first-half company results, and the availability of several new equity and
debenture issues on attractive terms.
AUSTRALIA rose for the second consecutive day in its bounce from a 21-month
low, the All Ordinaries index closing 10.1 higher at 1,375.1 in light
turnover of ADollars 166.3m.
ANZ rose 10 cents to ADollars 2.63 after reporting a ADollars 579m loss on
Tuesday when it closed unchanged. Brokers said that today will be dominated
by Westpac and National Australia results. Both gained 2 cents with Westpac
closing at ADollars 2.62 and NAB at ADollars 6.90.
NEW ZEALAND registered its highest close for seven weeks as strength in
market leaders, particularly in Telecom and Carter Holt Harvey, took the
NZSE-40 index up 15.94 to 1,434.91 in healthy turnover of NZDollars 25m.
Telecom and CHH each rose 6 cents to Dollars 2.42 and Dollars 2.69
respectively.
TAIWAN rose 2.1 per cent and saw its most active trading this month on
rumours of overt government support for the market. Turnover more than
doubled from TDollars 5.4bn to TDollars 11.5bn as the weighted index closed
76.39 higher at 3,660.10. The financial sector led with a gain of 3.6 per
cent.
SEOUL dropped on a government move to force Daewoo to merge two of its
subsidiaries, and following the suicide last Sunday of a branch manager at a
major bank. The composite index fell 10.17 to 621.25.
MANILA slipped as electric power outages lasting seven hours hit local
industries and spread gloom in the market. The composite index closed 9.07
lower at 1,315.16.
SINGAPORE was led lower by key blue chips as investors continued to
consolidate their positions after the recent gains. The Straits Times
Industrial index fell 10.72 to 1,422.93 in volume of 87.05m shares against
111.18m.

FT  19 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent eases in spite of
cuts in interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE trend on the Continent was weak yesterday in spite of interest rate cuts
in the Netherlands and Belgium, writes Our Markets Staff. Frankfurt was on
holiday.
PARIS fell on renewed worries about a trade war between Europe and the US.
Sentiment was also harmed by the latest survey of business leaders by the
Bank of France which showed that industrial output and consumer demand
continued to weaken in October and that the investment outlook remained
sluggish. The CAC 40 index ended 5.27 lower at 1,759.17 as turnover remained
steady at FFr1.76bn.
Some stocks bucked the weaker trend. Lyonnaise-Dumez went as high as FFr506
before closing FFr13 better at FFr506 in heavy trading of 129,325 shares
after news that a consortium it leads had won a 25-year license to supply
Sydney, Australia with drinking water. Peugeot jumped FFr9 to FFr523 after a
leading domestic broker recommended buying the stock.
MILAN started to consolidate its recent gains, but some stocks were still
bought for speculative reasons. The Comit index fell 4.91 to 476.39 as
turnover eased to an estimated L300bn from Tuesday's L389bn.
Rinascente, part of the Fiat group, rose as high as L9,000 before closing
down L70 on reports that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the owner of the Standa
retail chain, was considering making an offer for Rinascente.
Privatisation hopes lifted Italy's national carrier Alitalia by L263 or 35.2
per cent to L1,010 from Friday. Shares in Buton, a brandy and spirits
producer, added L420 or 12.7 per cent to L3,720 on Tuesday's news that Grand
Metropolitan of the UK had bought a 34 per cent stake in it.
ZURICH saw an early drop of 20 points in the SMI index, still unhappy after
the poll suggesting that the December 6 referendum would vote against
membership of the European Economic Area. However, it then staged a
technical rebound and the SMI closed 6.7 lower at 1,882.8.
Banks stayed under pressure with UBS bearers, SFr5 lower at SFr794, topping
the active list and CS Holding shedding another SFr30 to SFr1,885. But
chemicals staged a strong recovery to close almost at yesterday's level,
Roche certificates ending steady at SFr3,800.
MADRID extended its rally on an influx of foreign buying, the general index
rising 5.27, or 2.5 per cent to 212.04 in heavy turnover of Pta31.2bn, up
from Pta23.2bn on Tuesday.
Five or six blue chips accounted for as much as 40 to 50 per cent of total
trade according to one domestic broker. The Ibex-35, an index of the 35
largest stocks, closed 74.41, or 3.3 per cent higher at 2,306.98.
Telefonica moved around 6m shares as it rose Pta70 to Pta1,125 and Repsol
put on Pta75 to Pta2,740, both after results this week. Endesa rose Pta85 to
Pta3,555.
STOCKHOLM advanced in heavy trading as strong demand for Astra made up for
dull trading in other issues. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 1.3 to
724.9 in turnover of SKr686m after SKr708m.
Astra rose SKr14 to SKr616 on persistent rumours that the investment group,
Investor, intended to sell its holdings in the pharmaceutical company.
The tool maker, Sandvik, dropped SKr16 or 5 per cent to SKr325 after its
nine-month results disappointed the market. The company's gloomy trading
forecast prompted James Capel to lower its 1992 and 1993 EPS forecasts to
SKr20 and SKr15 respectively from SKr24 and SKr17 previously.
COPENHAGEN subsided as a political storm over budget irregularities
threatened to unseat the economy and tax minister and possibly spark
premature elections. The KFX index fell 1.06 to 78.41.
AMSTERDAM ignored the upward trend in London and a cut in the central bank's
special advances money market rate. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.5 to
104.0. Elsevier fell Fl 2.10 to Fl 112.90 after comments by the chairman
that that 15 per cent annual profit growth could not be relied upon in

FT  19 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark weaker on rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR recovered from an early fall against the D-Mark yesterday after
the Dutch and Belgian central banks cut their money market dealing rates,
heightening speculation that the Bundesbank will ease monetary policy in the
short term, writes James Blitz.
However, the D-Mark's weakness yesterday was more a matter of tone than
substance. Dealers remain uncertain when the next easing in German official
and rates will come, while a slightly narrower US trade deficit in September
left the market no better informed yesterday about the scope for an economic
upturn.
The central banks of Belgium and the Netherlands reduced their rates
following a period in which their currencies have risen strongly against the
D-Mark. Both central banks are committed to keeping their currencies within
tight ranges against the German one.
The Dutch said yesterday that they had eased their special advances rate to
8.70 per cent from 8.80 per cent in response to the strong guilder.
The moves had only a minor impact on their currencies against the D-Mark.
The Belgian franc closed at BFr20.53 to the D-Mark from a previous close of
BFr20.58, and the guilder was unchanged at NFl 1.124 to the D-Mark.
However, the easing of policy had an impact on the dollar/D-Mark rate, on
speculation that it might now be easier for the Bundesbank to ease policy
too.
The US currency had weakened against the D-Mark at the start of European
trading, dropping to DM1.5815. But dealers tried to push the dollar through
the DM1.60 barrier at the end of the European day, and the currency closed
more-or-less unchanged at DM1.5975.
Sterling failed to benefit much from the continental moves, although UK
equity dealers said that the rate cuts had helped to underpin sterling after
the recent easing in UK base rates. Some dealers even suggested that a cut
in UK base rate to 6 per cent would be more likely before the end of the
year.
The pound closed unchanged at DM2.4300. Against the dollar it closed
slightly firmer at Dollars 1.5210.
Another factor affecting European trading yesterday was the decision of the
Swiss authorities to add liquidity to the Swiss franc money market, in order
to ease what they described as 'tension' in market interest rates.
The Swiss National Bank has repeatedly said that it would act to prevent a
sharp fall in the Swiss franc against the D-Mark as this would risk
importing inflation from Germany, the country's largest trading partner.
However, the Bank yesterday acted to halt the recent rise in money market
rates, and 3-month money closed unchanged at 6 per cent on the bid side. The
Swiss franc closed weaker at SFr0.912 to the D-Mark from SFr0.908.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Money Markets: European rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH the Belgian and Dutch central banks pushed money market dealing rates
below those of Germany yesterday because of the D-Mark's weaker position in
the European Monetary System grid, writes James Blitz.
The move led to a rise in short-dated Euromark futures, as dealers expected
that the move might make bring forward the time when German official rates
could be eased again.
Otherwise, money markets in both Germany and the UK were extremely calm. The
German cash market was closed for the one day prayer and repentance holiday.
Sterling dealers appeared to be taking a breather in the wake of the third
successive base rate cut in two months. Their attention was focused on the
Bank of England's decision to roll over the special funding facilities that
it is offering banks following the massive intervention to support sterling
on Black Wednesday.
The easing of official dealing rates in Holland and Belgium was caused by
the very strong position of both the Belgian franc and the Dutch guilder in
the ERM in recent weeks.
Both countries' central banks are committed to keeping their currencies
within tight ranges against the D-Mark.
To redress the balance, Belgium cut its overnight rate to 9.20 per cent from
9.25 per cent, while the special rate for primary dealers was cut to 8.70
per cent from 8.75 per cent.
The Dutch central bank cut its special advances rate to 8.70 per cent from
8.80 per cent in response to the strong guilder. However, the cuts had only
a marginal effect on these currencies exchange rates against the D-Mark.
The moves forced up Euromark futures, because of increased expectation that
Germany would ease rates. The March contract rose 16 basis points to a close
of 92.33 on heavy volume.
In the sterling cash market, 3-month money eased to 7 1/4 per cent on the
offered side from a previous close of 7 3/8 per cent. The fall reflected the
easier tone to the Bank of England's operations. A shortage of Pounds 950m
was forecast and Pounds 475m was removed in the early round.
The Bank of England announced that it would continue to provide special
facilities to the banking system to take effect on November 30 and mature on
February 1. The new facilities will replace the ones currently in operation.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Freeport plans Spanish copper
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FREEPORT-MCMORAN, the US natural resources group, plans to expand capacity
at the Huelva copper smelter in Spain by nearly half if its negotiations to
buy the plant succeed.
Huelva's capacity would be boosted from about 90,000 tonnes to 130,000
tonnes a year, says Mr James Moffett, Freeport's chairman. This would enable
the Spanish smelter to treat more copper concentrate (an intermediate
product) from Freeport's rapidly-growing copper-gold mine in Indonesia.
Freeport is also involved in a project to build a 150,000-tonne copper
smelter in Indonesia, of which Metallgesellschaft of Germany would be the
majority shareholder and operator.
However, Freeport would supply only half the Indonesian smelter's
concentrate and would welcome some more 'captive' smelting capacity.
The Huelva smelter is owned by Rio Tinto Minera, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Ercros, the troubled industrial group 39-per-cent owned by the Kuwait
Investment Office's Spanish holding company.
Freeport has been negotiating since April to buy RTM and Ercros's
loss-making fertiliser operation, Fesa-Enfersa. Management changes at Ercros
and the KIO have delayed negotiations but Mr Moffett says Freeport is still
very interested and still talking to Ercros. He insists, however: 'We won't
buy the assets unless the old losses are dealt with by the people in charge
when those losses were made'.
Some analysts suggest Mr Moffett is unlikely to be able to work out a deal
because Ercros's banks would have to forgive most of its debts and there are
great difficulties over Ercros's under-funded pension scheme. Meanwhile, the
KIO has left Ercros to sink or swim on its own and is unlikely to offer
Freeport any guarantees on behalf of its associate.
Freeport's 74-per-cent-owned subsidiary, Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold,
is continuing to explore in Indonesia in an area where it already has, in
the Grasberg mine, the western world's fifth-largest open pit copper reserve
and the biggest single gold mine reserve. The company expects to sell 650m
lb of copper and 620,000 troy ounces of gold this year.
Expansion of mining and milling facilities in Indonesia to 57,000 tonnes a
day has only recently been completed but Freeport is spending USDollars 90m
to boost output to 66,000 tonnes a day by the middle of next year. A further
expansion to 90,000 tonnes a day, costing Dollars 545m, is expected to be
completed by mid-1996, enabling Freeport to produce about 1bn lb of copper a
year plus 1.2m to 1.5m ounces of gold.
Mr Moffett says the Dollars 450m finance for the Indonesian smelter, in
which Metallgesellschaft is expected to take 55 per cent, and Freeport and
Nippon Mining about 20 per cent each, is virtually completed.
The smelter will be located at Gresik, near the port of Surabaya, where the
Indonesian government has a large fertiliser production complex. Mr Moffett
says that Dollars 50m was lopped off the smelter's cost by the choice of
site and sulphuric acid generated by the smelter will replace 150,000 tonnes
of sulphur at present imported for fertiliser production.

<TEXT>
AGRICULTURAL REFORMS are faltering in Russia and elsewhere in the
Commonwealth of Independent States as higher prices and mounting shortages
put the new private farming sector under pressure, reports Reuter from
Moscow.
Russian officials at a Moscow grains conference said farmers breaking away
from the state sector faced daunting problems.
'Many farms cannot compete in the current economic situation, with mounting
inflation and many barriers to development,' said Mr Leonid Vashukov, head
of the food and agriculture section of the CIS Statistics Committee. He
reported that more than 3,000 new private farms had folded.
Russia announced plans last year to dismantle unprofitable collective farms
and give farmers rights to buy and sell land. Other former Soviet republics
launched similar programmes, aiming to curb the role of big state
agrobusinesses blamed for decades of food shortages and crippling import
bills.
Mr Vashukov said sharply higher prices for equipment and fertilisers had
made life tough for the new private sector. Prices for some equipment were
currently 20 times higher than at the start of the year.
Delegates from other republics attending the grains conference, organised by
US grain exporters and Russia's Exportkhleb, stressed the need to become
self-sufficient in grain production.
But for the moment many countries would need to import grain, either on
world markets, or from Kazakhstan, which this year reported a record harvest
of 32m tonnes, Exportkhleb official Ms Svetlana Melshina told the
conference.
She put the 1992-93 CIS harvest at 182.4m tonnes, up 20 per cent from last
year but a little below the 185m tonnes estimated by Mr Vashukov.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: CAP reform 'shock to corporate
farming'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REFORM of the European Community's common agricultural policy had
'induced a shock to the corporate farming system,' the fifth annual
conference of Food from Britain, the government-backed promotional body, was
told in London yesterday.
But the many inconsistencies and escalating costs of the CAP could be
expected to lead to further, probably more radical, reforms later in the
decade, Mr Edward Robinson, a director of the Booker food and farming group,
predicted. The squeeze on farm incomes would continue 'with increased
severity', farm employment would continue to decline, and competitive
pressures would continue unabated.
'This prospect will in itself foster a climate of continuing uncertainty
with which agriculture, and by implication, other parts of the food chain
will have to live for some years to come.'
Mr Robinson was particularly critical of EC's plan to set aside 15 per cent
of cereal growing land next year. This would cut profits at Booker Farming -
which manages 27,000 acres of mainly arable crops - by up to Pounds 400,000
a year.
Cereal production could be expected to continue rising, he said. Set-aside
applies only to farmers with a production potential of more than 92 tonnes.
In the UK this would affect 54 per cent of farms. But in Greece, Italy,
Spain and Portugal 95 per cent or more of cereal farmers would be exempt,
while 80 per cent would be exempt in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and
Holland, and 70 per cent in France.
'Clearly there is no incentive for the community's predominantly small
farmers to reduce output,' Mr Robinson said. Last year EC output rose by 6
per cent to 167.5m tonnes, with Greece accounting for 35 per cent of the
rise, Portugal 26 per cent, Italy and Ireland 10 per cent, and France 8 per
cent.
The UK was responsible for just 0.5 per cent.
'The reality is, of course, that important elements of agricultural reform
are being driven by social policy rather than by economic consideration,'
said Mr Robinson.
Mr John Gummer, Agriculture Minister, yesterday announced a scheme
implementing EC regulations to register traditional, regional and speciality
foods from the UK.

London's robusta COFFEE market came under further pressure from hedge
selling and profit taking after the recent climb to nine-month highs. There
are signs of light origin sales beginning to emerge, with Uganda and
Indonesia seen as possibly taking advantage of the recent rise in prices.
New York arabicas were also lower at midday. Analysts said trade talk in
Colombia that Marxist guerrillas had shot dead a partner in a leading coffee
transportation firm had little impact on dealings. One trader said that
rebel actions would have to be prolonged for exports to be strongly
affected. BASE METAL prices continued to move higher on the LME, with
ALUMINIUM particularly firm. Dealers said the overall trend reflected
another technical reaction, with prices largely holding above downside
support levels last week. Aluminium was again underpinned by nervousness
over the possibility of stoppages at Pechiney and production cuts of around
100,000 tonnes.

This week at last brought a definite firming in Australian wool values. The
AWC market indicator rose 12 cents to 514c/kg on November 17, and a further
6 cents on November 18. Clearances were very good, around 95pc of the
offering. Buying interest is led by Japan and China, and although the rise
only covers part of the ground lost this season, it does represent a clearer
upturn than anything experienced for many weeks. At this stage of the season
some recovery is not unprecedented. This raises cautious hopes that the
decline may have been halted.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metal price slump cuts
exploration budgets by Dollars 96m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINING COMPANIES are making severe cuts in their exploration budgets to save
cash at a time of low metal prices and gold exploration is suffering most of
all.
The western world's big mining groups will spend about Dollars 96.4m less on
exploration this year than they did in 1991 - which itself showed a Dollars
122.8m decrease on the previous year - according to Metal Economics Group, a
Canadian research organisation.
It says in a new report that gold this year is attracting Dollars 839m or 52
per cent of total spending by the 158 companies that provided this
information. This is down from more than Dollars 1bn or 56 per cent of the
total in 1991. In 1989, when the gold price was much higher than at present,
gold exploration spending at Dollars 1.2bn reached 68 per cent of the total.
On the other hand, says MEG, budget shares devoted to base metals
exploration have increased steadily during the past few years. Base metals
and/or polymetallics programmes are attracting Dollars 525m this year, or
32.6 per cent of the surveyed total, compared with Dollars 576m in 1991, or
31 per cent, and only Dollars 305m or 18 per cent in 1989.
Expenditures for other metals and minerals - primarily diamonds,
titanium-bearing and other industrial minerals and platinum - are also
rising, with Dollars 248m being spent this year (15.4 per cent of the
surveyed total) compared with Dollars 242m or 13 per cent last year.
The exploration budgets of the 161 companies world-wide that were surveyed
total Dollars 1.7bn. The US still attracts most of the spending, taking 21.4
per cent, followed by Australia (19.1 per cent), Canada (17.8 per cent) and
Latin America (15.1 per cent).
Mining companies' growing interest in Latin America is reflected in the fact
that exploration expenditure there is scheduled to rise by 28 per cent this
year. Spending in the US is up by 6.5 per cent but it is down in Canada and
in Australia by 30 per cent and 8 per cent respectively.
Eleven companies in the RTZ Group, the world's biggest mining company, are
spending about Dollars 209m, according to MEG's calculations. The seven
companies in the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa group, RTZ's
biggest rival, are spending a combined Dollars 208.4m.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bulgarian farming's
post-communist crisis - Production has plummeted after the break-up of
co-operatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR EUROPEAN Community officials flew into Sofia last weekend in an
effort to keep talks on Bulgaria's EC association agreement afloat after
negotiations last week foundered once again, chiefly over access for
Bulgarian agricultural products to community markets.
Bulgaria is determined to receive the same treatment as Czechoslovakia,
Hungary and Poland, which concluded association agreements last year, and is
also asking that wine, its number one agricultural export, be included in
the terms.
The urgent need for new markets is a prime reason for Bulgaria's strong
stand in the EC talks. The country was heavily dependent on the now
collapsed Soviet market, which accounted for about 65 per cent of its
agricultural exports in the 1980s.
Mr Rangel Trendafilov, an agro-economist who advises the Bulgarian
government, believes the search for alternative markets is the sector's
greatest long-term challenge.
'We need hard currency earnings but must also export because of our small
domestic market, around 9m. There is little incentive to increase
productivity if there is nowhere to send our goods.'
However, in the short term, the sector faces more pressing problems while
farmers struggle to set up on their own now that most state co-operatives,
which controlled agriculture in the communist period, have been dismantled.
Production has plummeted since 1989 with grain, maize, tobacco and sugar
beet particularly hard hit, according to Ministry of Agriculture figures.
The grain harvest has fallen from 10.2m tonnes in 1980 to an estimated 7.1m
tonnes this year, while the sugar beet crop has dropped from 1.6m tonnes,
sufficient to meet only 10 per cent of domestic demand.
Nor are prospects for 1993 much better with autumn plantings well down on
last year and continuing shortages of seed and fertilisers.
Land reform, which has become a sensitive political issue, is a central
problem. The socialists, the main opposition party, charge that the
government, an anti-communist alliance, has put property restitution above
all else.
They believe the government, acting through so-called 'liquidation
committees', broke up the co-operatives far too quickly because to its
desire to return land to private ownership. Worse still, they say, the
government had no new strategy to replace the old system, often with serious
consequences.
'In my constituency, which had a stock-breeding industry, the liquidation of
the co-operatives has led to the slaughter of thousands of animals,' says Ms
Elena Poptodorova, a socialists MP. 'Those which survived were given to
private households where there is no possibility for
scientifically-controlled breeding. This policy has destroyed the genetic
stocks which our scientists have been building up for years.'
Moreover, while co-operatives have been disbanded, by the end of October
only about 24 per cent of land had been redistributed, leaving much farm
land unworked.
Agriculture has also been set back by the division of land into small units.
The land law allows for restitution up to 30 hectares (74 acres) per person
but, according to Mr Trendafilov, there are relatively few claims of this
size. Apart from in Dobrudga, a wheat region next to the Danube, small
holdings, rarely more than five hectares, predominated in pre-communist
Bulgaria.
In addition, where there was previously one owner, there might now be
several descendants, all with claims, leading to even smaller parcels of
land.
New landowners also face difficulties in raising capital to buy machinery,
seed or fertiliser, previously provided by the co-operative. Houses can be
used as collateral but with the base rate at 41 per cent, few can afford
loans.
The situation worries agro-economists and scientists, who fear much of the
progress of the past two decades is under threat. 'Our intellectual and
cultural attitude to agriculture is going backwards - it has become less
scientific,' says Ms Slavka Bahchevanova, director of a small research
institute in Sandanski, a tobacco and wine producing region in south west
Bulgaria, close to the Greek border.
With unemployment rising, especially in industry, many new landowners have
moved back to the countryside. Most are unskilled workers with little
practical experience of farming, she says. 'People aim to survive by living
off the land and perhaps have a little left over to sell in local markets.'
With such a system, Bulgaria is likely to have difficulty in reviving
exports or sustaining profitable related industries such as wine and
cigarette manufacturing.
Vinprom, Sandanski's local state-owned wine company, could only find 5,000
tonnes of grapes to purchase this year, compared to 25,000 tonnes two years
ago, and had to resort to selling stocks to meet demand.
Agricultural workers in Sandanski, disappointed by the parliamentary groups,
are putting their support behind a recently formed union of agrarian
parties.
'We are looking for new markets,' a manager at Vinprom says,'but first, we
need clearer government policies so that we can maintain output and preserve
the quality of our products.'

FT  19 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Hungary moves to broaden debt
market

<TEXT>
HUNGARY is poised to broaden significantly its government debt market by
issuing the country's first state bonds to have a maturity of five years and
be accessible to foreign investors.
Finance ministry officials and underwriters were still finalising terms
yesterday evening, but participants said they expected the issue to be of
the order of Ft7bn (Dollars 84m), to bear a coupon of 16 per cent and to be
priced at or just below par.
The issue, if the two sides reach agreement, will be only the second
fixed-rate government bond issue. The authorities launched the market in
October with a three-year bond with a step-down coupon of 21, 17 and 14 per
cent.
The government also placed 10-year paper with AB-Aegon, Hungary's largest
insurer, but this issue is not traded. Treasury bills are issued regularly
for maturities of one to 12 months.
Brokers had hoped that the forthcoming five-year bond would flesh out the
debt market and allow the construction of a genuine yield curve. But some
said that the government's aggressive pricing is likely to distort and
depress the yield, to leave it lower than that for both shorter-term and
longer-term debt.
The prospective government debt instrument is also the first which foreign
investors can buy directly, and so participate in Hungary's most active and
liquid securities market. Banque Indosuez Hungary, the local subsidiary of
France's Banque Indosuez, is part of the underwriting consortium handling
the international tranche.
International institutions were previously restricted to indirect investment

FT  19 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Traders' costs fall as volume
soars on futures exchanges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUTURES brokers in Europe have had a banner year, with commission income
leaping above last year's levels in the wake of soaring trading volume on
most European exchanges.
One result has been lower costs for the most active traders, as higher
volume has translated into lower commissions. Turnover rose sharply on the
main European futures markets in the first 10 months. In London, the number
of contracts traded leapt by 78 per cent over last year, to 48m. In Paris,
volume was up 56 per cent to 47m.
Futures exchanges have been among the biggest beneficiaries. Liffe reckons
its income this year will reach Pounds 60m (Dollars 90.6m), compared with
Pounds 33m in 1991. A year ago, it was considering borrowing to help finance
a move into new premises. Thanks to the jump in trading volume, it has been
able to pay for the move out of current income, rebuild its reserves and
still plan to hand money back to its members.
Brokers have seen a similar rise in income. With fixed costs accounting for
a high proportion of total outlays, much of the extra revenue has flowed
straight through into profit. In some cases, the benefits are being passed
on to customers.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd says its typical commission (excluding clearing
costs) for its most active customers has fallen from Pounds 1.50 per
contract a year ago to around Pounds 1. Clearing costs, though, have
remained static at up to Pounds 2 a bargain, with a further 45p fee payable
to Liffe.
Paris trading costs have followed a similar pattern. From FFr15 a year ago,
Matif commissions are now nearer FFr10 for active customers.
However, these reductions have not come across the board. Another London
broker says that its all-in charges - which range from around Pounds
5-Pounds 8, depending on the customer - for a 'round-trip' (a purchase and a
sale), had not changed over the year.
Part of the reason why commissions have not fallen further, says brokers, is
that rates have historically been too low to make futures broking a
profitable business in its own right. Many banks act as brokers, mainly to
transact in-house orders from other parts of their group, and as a result
offer broking services to clients at a marginal cost.
Also, brokers fear the consequences if this year's volatile market
conditions are not repeated.
The head of one futures trading operation in London said: 'If we cut
commission rates now to reflect good volumes, how do you get them up again
next year? Commissions are a one-way street.'
Investors generally seem to accept the rates they are asked to pay.
'It works both ways,' says one of the UK's biggest insurance companies,
which adds it is still paying much the same commissions as a year ago. 'If I
want first call from a broker, I have to pay the market rate for the
service.'
Estimating how much commission brokers have earned in total is not easy.
Charging methods differ, with some firms applying an all-in rate and others
charging separately for brokerage and clearing.
Also, much of the business conducted on exchanges is either commission-free
or at low rates. Two out of every five trades on Liffe are prompted by
member firms trading for their own account or by orders from the members'
associates.
If the other 60 per cent of trades had earned an average commission of just
Pounds 3 each (including clearing, but not the exchange charge), Liffe
brokers would have earned around Pounds 170m so far this year (since two
commissions - a purchase and sale - are paid on each bargain).
Brokers also earn interest on clients' margin payments. According to one
estimate, this accounted for as much as a quarter of some brokers' total
income a year ago, but is now down to below a fifth due to falling interest
rates.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Dutch, Belgian rate cuts dominate trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL interest rate cuts in the Netherlands and Belgium dominated trading in
European government bonds yesterday, leading to a late rally in most
European markets yesterday.
ALTHOUGH Germany was closed for a holiday, the impact fed through into the
German bond market, as speculation mounted that a German interest rate cut
may follow shortly. The German bund future on the London International
Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange rose  1/4 point to close at 91.26.
Dealers said the reaction was exaggerated because of thin volume due to the
holiday.
THE 10 basis-point cut in the Dutch special advances rate to 8.70 per cent
yesterday pushed Dutch rates below German rates once again. The special
advances rate is comparable to the German repo rate, currently 8.75 per
cent, which added to expectations that the repo rate is set to fall.
The Belgian central bank again moved in tandem with the Dutch, cutting its
overnight rate by five basis points.
'Although German interest rates are on the way down, (yesterday's rate cuts
are) a flimsy reason to conclude that there will be a imminent German rate
cut,' said Mr Klaus Baader, an economist at UBS Phillips and Drew. 'The two
currencies (guilder and Belgian franc) move in tandem, and (the central
banks) have clearly reacted to the strength of the currencies.'
NEWS of the Dutch and Belgian rate cuts prompted renewed buying interest in
the gilts market, even from some foreign accounts which had disappeared
following sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism in
September. A 0.1 per cent increase in retail sales for October helped
improve the tone in the gilts market.
After a quiet day's trading, the market suddenly put on a spurt at the end
of the day, bouncing a full point.
US Treasury prices firmed across the maturity range yesterday after the
Federal Reserve chose to add permanently to reserves.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/32 at 101
13/32 , yielding 7.501 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was up  5/32 , at 99 15/32 , for a yield of 4.520 per cent.
Trading was subdued throughout the morning. News that the US trade gap
narrowed in September, from Dollars 9bn in the previous month to Dollars
8.3bn was in line with market expectations.
Prices gained ground in the afternoon after the Fed bought coupons outright,
pushing prices higher as dealers covered short positions and retail
investors upped their demand. The market was also helped by the announcement
that the Treasury would sell Dollars 15bn in two-year notes and Dollars
10.75bn in five-year notes next week, in line with market expectations.

FT  19 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Focus shifts to pricing in subdued
conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICING and structuring provided the main talking points in the
international bond markets yesterday, in a relatively subdued atmosphere for
new issues.
The Dollars 250m five-year issue from LKB Baden-Wurttemberg Finance was
widely described as aggressively priced at 24 basis points over comparable
US Treasuries, despite the acknowledged quality of the name, the triple-A
rating and the explicit state guarantee. Traders felt the spread should have
been in the low 30s, particularly in the light of this week's heavy supply
of dollars at the short end of the market. LKB is understood to have swapped
the proceeds into sub-Libor US dollars.
The Dollars 150m five-year issue for Isveimer via Kredietbank in Luxembourg
is being seen as an example of the kind of structure and pricing that
Italian would-be borrowers will have to resort to in order to overcome
investor fears about term investment in Italy.
The structure offers investors a put option every six months, designed to
give the borrower effectively medium-term funding and the investor a
six-month deposit at a higher yield. The spread was described as generous
and the fees as 'enormous' for what could be six-month paper if investors
were to exercise their first option to exit.
The collared floating rate note is bearing up surprisingly well in view of
rising short-term dollar interest rates, say traders. But Lehman Brothers,
which led a further Dollars 50m 10-year issue for the World Bank, fungible
with a Dollars 100m issue led by Kidder Peabody in late October, says
issuers need to remain prudent and tap this niche of the market only for
small amounts.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development also reopened an issue,
offering a further ADollars 50m of bonds fungible with ADollars 300m-worth
led by SBC Dominguez Barry in June.
Traders described this as an opportunity for European investors to buy
exposure to Australian dollars at a lower level.
Expectations are mounting that Belgium will launch a Euroyen bond offering
for up to Y75bn over seven years through Nomura International.
The deadline for bids in the UK government's auction of privatised
companies' debt is the close of play today.
Baring Brothers, which is organising the auction, says it expects high
bidding interest from the issuers (British Telecom and the electricity
generators and distributors) and from third parties in the UK and overseas.
A decision on whether to grant Australian Consolidated Investments (ACIL)
leave to pursue an appeal in the House of Lords is expected in the next few
days, according to sources close to the case.

<TEXT>
ASTRA International, Indonesia's dominant automotive company, yesterday
announced the identity of the two buyers of 40m shares sold last Friday for
Rp400bn (Dollars 191m) by the Soeryadjaya family, its majority shareholder.
The shares, 16.5 per cent of issued shares, were sold in two 20m blocks to
the pension fund of state-owned Bank Dagang Negara (BDN) and to Newark of
Hong Kong.
Astra officials said Newark, the ownership of which was not disclosed, is
acting as a nominee for its shares, which are being held in an escrow
account while negotiations with a foreign purchaser are finalised.
Toyota of Japan, whose vehicles Astra assembles and distributes in
Indonesia, is the preferred buyer and has agreed in principle to take 20m
shares, Astra said.
Mr Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, Astra chairman, said the Soeryadjaya family
still held a 54 per cent stake in the company but 'they'll probably lose the
majority control'.
The Soeryadjayas have been compelled to raise finance for their
privately-owned Bank Summa, which was suspended from clearing operations by
Bank Indonesia, the Indonesian central bank, last week with bad debts of
over Rp1,000bn.
Bankers say the Soeryadjaya family may have pledged much of their remaining
Astra stake against loans.
The announcement that BDN Group pension fund has taken 20m Astra shares
could cause a rift within the Indonesian government over the use of state
funds and institutions in aiding Bank Summa.
One senior government official has privately argued against any
state-related pension fund buying shares from the Soeryadjayas. This would
'indirectly (be) bailing out Bank Summa. We don't want to create a precedent
here,' he explained.
Executives of 17 private banks, which are forming a consortium to take over
Bank Summa's small-scale depositors, also privately protest they are doing
so only under pressure from Bank Indo-nesia.
Most members of the consortium, which is raising over Rp150bn, have yet to
see Bank Summa's books.
As one broker explained: 'The banks are blindly signing cheques, and they
don't like it.'

<TEXT>
SOUTHERN Life, South Africa's second largest listed insurance company,
increased attributable profits by 18.5 per cent to R81m (Dollars 27m) in the
six months to September.
Net premium income rose to R1.15bn from R953.2m during the same period in
1991. Net investment income, however, fell to R530.8m from R542.6m. Mr Jan
Calitz, managing director, attributed this to lower interest rates and
minimal growth in dividends from share investments. The rise in total income
was limited to a 12 per cent increase, to R1.68bn from R1.49bn. Attributable
profits rose to R81m from R68.3m, equivalent to 48 cents a share against
40.5 cents. The interim dividend was lifted to 32 cents per share from 27
cents.
Mr Calitz said the company had continued its practice of setting interim
earnings and dividend figures at 50 per cent of the previous year's total.
Full actuarial valuations were undertaken at the end of each year.
Total assets rose 6.3 per cent to R17.5bn from R16.4bn. The figures reflect
the recent weak performance of the South African stock market. New business
totalled R511m, a 39 per cent rise over the 1991 first half. Single premium
business accounted for R299m and new recurring business for R212m.

LAND and House, the Thai property developer, yesterday announced plans to

a Bt2bn (Dollars 78.7m) bond for the Thai market.
The company said it was seeking shareholders' approval for the issues and

bonds, 175m will be set aside for buyers who wish to exercise their rights.
Land and House will use Bt3bn of the money raised to reduce debt and the
rest to buy land and property.
Unconsolidated third quarter net profits rose 68 per cent to Bt314m over the
same period last year, prompting a string of buy recommendations from
brokers. Bangkok Land, Thailand's biggest property company, last month
announced plans to borrow money abroad to finance expansion. The company
said it intended to issue SFr50m (Dollars 35.7m) of notes for Swiss
investors through a Cayman Islands subsidiary.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE South Korean government said yesterday that Daewoo, the nation's fourth
biggest conglomerate, must merge its shipbuilding and machinery subsidiaries
by the end of the year.
The government agreed in 1989 to provide rescue loans to debt-ridden Daewoo
Shipbuilding, an unlisted subsidiary, on condition it would later merge with
its listed Daewoo Heavy Industries to improve the group's financial
stability and rationalise operations.
The rescue package included loans and loan extensions totalling Won400bn
(Dollars 502.8m) from the state-owned Korea Development Bank.
Daewoo also agreed to dispose of other assets, including four subsidiaries,
property and stock, to keep the shipyard afloat.
It has invested Won500bn in Daewoo Shipbuilding as a result of the asset
sales.
Daewoo's shipbuilding unit suffered losses in the late 1980s, caused by
labour problems. Losses amounted to Won69.4bn in 1987, but narrowed to
Won39.7bn by 1990.
Daewoo has asked the government several times to drop the merger condition
since Daewoo Shipbuilding has returned to profitability, with earnings
reaching Won79bn on sales of Won1,066bn in 1991.
It estimates that profits will reach Won150bn this year on sales of
Won1,690bn, as the company diversifies into other business sectors,
including vehicle manufacturing.
Nonetheless, Daewoo is concerned about adverse stock market reaction to a
merger.
Shareholders in Daewoo Heavy Industries fear that a merger could cause
management problems and weaken the company's financial position as its debt
burden increases with the addition of the bigger shipbuilding unit.
Daewoo Heavy Industries had net earnings of Won18.9bn on sales of Won1,004bn
in 1991.
Analysts said yesterday that Daewoo may try to delay the merger until next
year in the hope that the new administration, which will take office in
February, may overturn the decision.
The government did not reveal what penalties it might impose against Daewoo
if the company refused to obey the order.
Daewoo said yesterday it would begin developing a coal mine in China's
Shandong province this year.
The mine venture will be a joint project with the Shandong government, each
investing Dollars 150m.
Daewoo will also study the feasibility of manufacturing petrochemicals and
rail carriages and building a hotel in the region.

PROTON, the Malaysian car-maker, has won approval from the Malaysian
government for foreigners to own more than 30 per cent of its shares.
Until now Malaysia has imposed a 30 per cent foreign shareholding limit on
local companies involved in important areas of the economy.
Proton has a Malaysian government shareholding of just under 50 per cent.
Mitsubishi, the Japanese carmaker, which has been central in developing the
Proton car, holds about 20 per cent of its equity.
Foreign share buyers have shown strong interest in Proton recently and the
30 per cent shareholding ceiling was reached this month. The local market
had expected Proton to apply for a separate foreign listing, but the
government decided to waive the 30 per cent ruling.
Analysts doubt the government will lift the 30 per cent foreign shareholding
limit across the board. They say such moves will be made only when there is
sustained foreign interest in a stock.
There have been rumours that Hicom, the Malaysian government controlled
industrial holding company with a 29 per cent Proton stake, might sell its
shares in the car maker to raise cash for acquisitions.

FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Maple Leaf in third-term advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAPLE Leaf Foods, the Canadian food processor 56 per cent owned by Hillsdown
Holdings of the UK, has overcome fiercely competitive markets to report a
small increase in third quarter earnings from continuing operations.
The steady performance was in spite of a 6 per cent drop in sales, and was
ascribed mainly to improved margins as a result of the restructuring and
belt-tightening measures which Hillsdown has put in place since it took over
the company in mid-1990.
Earnings from continuing operations climbed to CDollars 19.4m (USDollars
15.3m), or 24 cents a share, from CDollars 15.2m, or 23 cents, a year
earlier. Sales fell to CDollars 695m from CDollars 741.7m.
The company also reported interest income of CDollars 1.7m, compared with
financing charges of CDollars 3.3m a year earlier.
Mr Charles Bowen, chief executive, said the drop in sales resulted from
falling consumption and an unusually wet summer.
Economies of scale helped margins in several areas of Maple Leaf's business.
For example, a joint flour milling venture with ConAgra, the US food
processing giant, has enabled the Canadian company to benefit from ConAgra's
payroll and purchasing facilities.
Pork earnings rose as a result of combining production into a single plant.
On the other hand, poultry continues to suffer from over-capacity, while the
bakery business was hurt by intensifying competition and down-trading to
lower-priced products.
Maple Leaf is seeking an acquisition in the US food industry. It has the
advantage of virtually no long-term debt and cash reserves of over CDollars
160m.

Allied said net proceeds from the secondary offering were Dollars 585m. This
was in addition to the Dollars 355m the company received in September from

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY'S privatisation agency has embarked on its fourth attempt to sell
Gima, the country's second largest supermarket chain.
The PPFA, the government agency entrusted with selling state assets to the
public, announced that 94 per cent of Gima would be offered by block sale.
Bids have to be submitted by January 18.
The agency has set a minimum price of TL88.7bn (around Dollars 10m) above
which negotiations can begin.
It is to sell both its own shares and those of the co-operatives, an issue
which was the main stumbling block on three previous attempts to sell the
company.
Food and beverages is seen as one of the most attractive sectors. Carrefour,
the French foods group, is already in negotiations to set up a local
operation.
Koc, Turkey's largest industrial group, has a joint venture between its
Migros subsidiary, Turkey's biggest supermarket chain, and another French
concern, Prisunic, with two shops in Istanbul.
Gima owns 58 stores in Turkey, selling food and beverages. The company
reported net sales of TL580bn in 1991, although high operating expenses

The PPFA owns 50.5 per cent of Gima. Some 10 agricultural co-operatives own
43.6 per cent. The PPFA sold 4.3 per cent by public offering in 1991.

with bank

<TEXT>
CHRYSLER, the US vehicle manufacturer, is to sell nearly all the consumer
and inventory financing businesses and assets of its Chrysler First
subsidiary to Nationsbank, the fourth largest banking company in the US.
Chrysler said the net proceeds from the sale were expected to be more than
Dollars 2bn and would approximate to carrying value. Nationsbank said the
purchase price represented a premium of about Dollars 100m.
Chrysler indicated some time ago it wanted to sell these businesses as part
of a plan to reduce the indebtedness of its financial services business and
to ensure that this had enough funds to support its core operation -
financing the sale of vehicles.
Nationsbank said the proposed deal would increase its consumer finance
business eight-fold and make it the second largest US consumer finance
company owned by a bank holding company.
It will form a new consumer finance business as a result of the deal, to be
called Nationscredit.
Chrysler First, based in Allentown, Pennsylvania, services receivables of
about Dollars 4bn and operates in 175 locations in 32 states. Nationsbank's
financial services unit has some Dollars 500m in consumer finance
receivables and 105 offices in 10 states.
Chrysler First's consumer finance operations range from home mortgages to
private label credit cards, while the inventory finance division provides
financial services for private label manufacturers and distributors and high
technology equipment dealers.
The deal does not include Chrysler First's business credit operation, which
deals in commercial property loans.
Nationsbank, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, is one of the most
aggressively acquisitive super-regional banks in the US.

FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Pensions group offers guidance
on derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pensions Research Accountants Group (Prag), an association of 200 UK
pension fund practitioners, has published a document on the use of futures
and options by pension funds which provides guidance for trustees,
investment and pension fund managers on how best to meet reporting, control
and performance measurement demands.
Prag has built on work by the London International Financial Futures &amp;
Options Exchange (Liffe) and Mercer Fraser, the actuarial firm, which
published a similar report in January.
But the Prag report is broader, suggesting how trustees should approach
derivative products and an approach to reporting and accounting.
Since the 1990 Finance Act removed uncertainty over the tax position by
exempting approved pension schemes from tax on income and gains, distrust of
derivatives among trustees has been perhaps the main barrier to growth in
their use of them.
The report focuses on strategies and risks to be considered by trustees and
ways of constraining investment managers. Prag supports Liffe's view on
reporting futures on an 'associated economic exposure' basis - looking at
the total exposure of a particular position, rather than just taking account
of the initial margin payment. But the valuation of options is more
complicated, since accurate reporting requires technical calculations of the
relationship between cash prices and option prices.
The report suggests funds should account for premiums paid and received, and
should mark option prices to market, even though this does not reflect real
exposure. 'In an ideal world, we would go further,' said Mr Glyn Peat,
chairman of the futures and options working party.

orders remain healthy
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAAB-SCANIA, the Swedish vehicle and aerospace group, increased profit after
financial items to SKr1.66bn (Dollars 275m) in the first nine months, a
substantial improvement on the SKr947m recorded in the same period of 1991.
Orders grew to SKr27.4bn from SKr18.6bn, mainly due to the development of
the JAS39 Gripen fighter aircraft project.
Consolidated net income advanced to SKr1.65bn from SKr1.02bn last time,
while return on capital employed grew to 12 per cent from 9.6 per cent.
However, Mr Lars Kylberg, group president, warned that his previous profits
forecast for the year stood firm at around the SKr1.70bn achieved last year.
This suggests that the reduced demand for trucks and commercial aircraft, as
well as the growing losses at Saab Automobile, jointly owned with General
Motors of America, will lower the group's profits in the fourth quarter.
Mr Kylberg added that Saab-Scania was prepared for 'a difficult 1993 and for
an upturn further ahead,' mainly thanks to extensive capital spending on new
product programmes and rationalisation measures.
The group suffered a 5 per cent cut in consolidated sales in trucks and
buses to SKr15.89bn from SKr16.68bn in the first nine months. It reported a
weak market for both products across Europe with 21,900 trucks and buses
sold, compared with 24,200 for the same period of 1991.
Income raised from the sale of aircraft fell to SKr2.84bn from SKr3.07bn.
The order backlog for aircraft rose to SKr21.6bn from SKr11.1bn, of which
the commercial operation fell to SKr6.1bn from SKr6.8bn.
Investor, the Wallenberg family dominated investment and industrial company
that fully owns Saab-Scania, announced a profit after financial items for
the first nine months of SKr1.63bn, a drop from the SKr2.19bn for the same
period of last year.
The total value of Investor's share portfolio fell by 2 per cent to
SKr17.84bn when the general Stockholm bourse index dropped by 24 per cent.

CASCADES, a Canadian-based paper and packaging group with plants in Europe,
earned CDollars 13.6m (USDollars 10.6m), or 25 cents a share, in the first
nine months, against a loss of CDollars 4.9m, or 9 cents a share, a year
earlier. Sales were CDollars 643m, up 4 per cent.
Third quarter profit was CDollars 1.3m, or 2 cents a share, against a loss
of CDollars 8.3m, or 16 cents, a share a year earlier on sales of CDollars
217m, compared with Dollars 195m. Both 1991 periods included write-downs for
a pulp mill closure.
Cascades expects to make an initial public offering of Cascades Paperboard
International this year. This new subsidiary includes nearly all its

<TEXT>
ASARCO, one of the world's largest non-ferrous metals producers, is
reorganising its business divisions to reflect its new thrust as an
integrated mining company.
The company, now organised around mining, smelting and refining operations,
is restructuring into two new divisions, one comprising all its copper
mining and processing businesses, and a second covering its lead/zinc and
aggregates businesses. Asarco's specialty chemicals business will not be
affected by the change.
'The focus of Asarco's business strategy since 1985 has been on acquiring
ore reserves and expanding our mining capabilities,' said Mr Richard Osborne
Asarco, chairman.
With expansion projects at Mission and Ray copper mines in Arizona completed
this year, and modernisation work on its El Paso, Texas, smelter scheduled
to be finished in early 1993, Mr Osborne said the company had met its goal
of becoming a fully integrated producer of copper, and of lead in Missouri.
The expansions and improvements were made over a five-year period at a cost
of about Dollars 1.1bn.
Capacity of its Mission copper mine was expanded by 42 per cent, and
operations at the Ray mine, also in Arizona, expanded by about 58 per cent.
Asarco mined 78,900 tons of copper in the third quarter, and 31,400 tons of
lead. In 1991, Asarco had copper sales of Dollars 1.03bn.

RELATIONS between Canada's two big airlines, Air Canada and Canadian
Airlines International, have sunk to a new low.
PWA, parent of Canadian, has filed a law suit in Calgary alleging that Air
Canada is trying to drive it out of business by discounting domestic fares
60 per cent to 75 per cent, or well below the cost of service.
'This is predatory pricing and illegal under the Federal Competition Act,'
said Mr Rhys Eyton, PWA chairman. PWA is claiming CDollars 1bn (USDollars
788m) in damages.
It has also alleged that Air Canada increased capacity by more than 10 per
cent last spring with the intention of driving prices lower.
In Montreal, Air Canada retorted that the PWA suit was unfounded and the
capacity increase was designed only to maintain its 57 per cent domestic
market share.
Mr Eyton denied the suit was retaliation for last week's CDollars 1.5bn
action by Gemini Corp, the computerised reservations system jointly owned by
Air Canada and PWA.
Air Canada has claimed the CDollars 1.5bn damages from PWA and other
airlines, alleging that PWA had initiated legal moves to get out of the
Gemini joint venture.
In another move, American Airlines has offered to buy 25 per cent of PWA for
CDollars 250m, if Canadian switches from Gemini to American's Sabre
reservations system.
Air Canada, incensed that the federal government may bale out PWA, has made
two new proposals to Ottawa, including a fresh offer to merge with PWA -
which would require PWA creditors to make concessions of up to CDollars
500m. Under the second, Air Canada would buy Canadian's overseas routes,
including the coveted Asian service.
Transport minister Mr Jean Corbeil said in Montreal the government would
intervene 'only to ensure an equitable long-term solution' to both airlines'
problems.
Air Canada and a Texas group will assume control of Continental Airlines
early next year, after Continental's unsecured creditors approved a
financial reorganisation plan. Continental hopes to be out of US Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection early next year.

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RINASCENTE, Italy's largest retailing group, has seen its shares jump more
than 120 per cent since the beginning of October as a result of persistent
rumours of an imminent sale of Fiat's controlling stake in the company.
Milan bourse operators are convinced that Fiat is preparing to sell either
to Metro, the big German retailer, or to Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest
which controls Standa, the rival Italian chain.
The latter has denied the existence of a deal but this has not prevented
Rinascente shares rising from L3,600 to as high as L8,450 in under six
weeks. Yesterday they quoted at L8,380.
Fiat has made no secret it is looking at ways of raising cash and reducing
non-core businesses to fund heavy capital spending over the next decade in
the automotive sector. Rinascente was founded in 1917. Control was sold by
Fiat to the Cabassi group in the 1960s. Fiat reacquired 51 per cent in 1984.
With half-year turnover of L2,235bn (Dollars 1.6bn), Rinascente is a useful
source of cash flow to Fiat.
However, Rinascente requires at least L1,170bn to be invested by 1996 in new
malls and hypermarkets to bring Italy closer to the European norm in modern
retailing. Only 35 per cent of Italian food sales are through
super/hypermarkets, less than half the level of France.
Expansion has been largely financed by the sale of older properties but with
property prices slipping and the market depressed, it is increasingly
difficult to fund investment from such a source.
Prior to speculation about a disposal by Fiat, Rinascente's ordinary shares
were capitalised at L587bn, while the savings and privileged shares had a
combined capitalisation of L189bn.

SANDVIK, the Swedish speciality steel and carbide group, yesterday reported
a 21 per cent decline in nine months profits (after financial items) to
SKr1.17bn (Dollars 195.5m) from SKr1.48bn for the first nine months of 1991.
Turnover fell by 5 per cent to SKr12.47bn, with part of the decline due to
the strength of the krona. Group order intake totalled SKr12.67bn for the
January-September period, down from SKr13.28bn for the same months of 1991.
Sandvik warned that net profit for this year would fall short of SKr1.5bn.
Last year the group made SKr1.9bn after tax.
It said there was a decline in sales in most product areas with the biggest
drop in value coming in the steel division where sales tumbled to SKr3.78bn
from SKr4.2bn. By contrast sales in saws and tools rose by 42 per cent to
SKr1.52bn.
Sandvik recorded a 13 per cent improvement in invoiced sales in Sweden to
SKr981m from SKr865m but its most successful expansion took place in Latin
America with 27 per cent growth to SKr697m.
There was a 13 per cent drop in the demand for its goods in North America to
SKr2.04bn and a more modest 3 per cent setback in the EC to SKr5.57bn.
The group recorded a SKr1.0bn rise in liquid assets in the nine months to
SKr5.8bn. Return on investment was 10.4 per cent compared with 13.1 per cent
for the whole of last year. Earnings per share calculated after full tax
totalled SKr22.6 over the past twelve months.
Sandvik also announced yesterday it had reached agreement with SKF, the
Swedish rolling bearing company, for the sale of SKF's 80 per cent interest
in CTT Tools to Sandvik at the end of this year. CTT Tools reported sales
last year of SKr1.9bn and employs 3,900 people.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RARE shareholder battle broke out in the French building industry
yesterday when Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the water distribution to civil
engineering group, blocked a merger between two of the country's leading
construction companies.
Generale des Eaux, owner of a 34 per cent blocking minority in the
construction group Fougerolle, refused to vote in favour of Fougerolle
completing an agreed Dollars 830m takeover of one of its main competitors,
Societe Auxiliare d'Entreprises (SAE).
If the bid had succeeded, it would have resulted in a company with an annual
turnover of FFr40bn (Dollars 7.42bn).
This is of the same order as Generale des Eaux's main construction
subsidiary, SGE.
The sector leader, Bouygues, had sales of FFr64.3bn last year.
Generale des Eaux said the merger would make it harder for shareholders to
track the two groups' development and their separate profits records and
that it saw no advantages from the merger to compensate for this problem.
Fougerolle said that the merger could not now go ahead and that it was
regrettable that the industrial advantages of the scheme were so
misunderstood.
This shareholder battle is the latest episode in a power struggle between Mr
Guy Dejouany, chairman of Generale des Eaux, who is one of the most
influential operators in the Paris business establishment, and Mr
Jean-Francois Roverato, the self-made son of an Italian cabinet maker who
has worked his way up through the ranks in Fougerolle and became chairman in
1987.
Mr Dejouany wanted to take over Fougerolle three years ago and merge it with
SGE.
However, Mr Roverato refused and instead staged a management buy-out.
This left Generale des Eaux as the second largest minority shareholder after
Paribas, the financial and industrial holding group which owns 47 per cent
of Fougerolle.
The blocking move is also a setback for Paribas, which had strongly
supported the Fougerolle-SAE merger plan.
It represents another misadventure for Paribas's industrial portfolio
following the recent discovery of a FFr600m loss due to off-balance sheet
financial dealings in its Ciments Francais subsid-iary.

HEWLETT-PACKARD disapp-ointed Wall Street with a 46 per cent drop in
fourth-quarter earnings, after restructuring charges.
The US computer and electronics manufacturer said that it had been hit in
the quarter by pricing pressures, among other factors.
Fourth-quarter net earnings were Dollars 68m, or 28 cents a share, after
special charges of 36 cents.
For the same period last year H-P reported net earnings of Dollars 125m, or
50 cents after charges of about 40 cents a share.
The charges in both periods cover voluntary employee severance programmes,
relocations and consolidation of facilities.
Net revenue for the quarter rose 13 per cent to Dollars 4.3bn from Dollars
3.8bn. Net revenue in the US rose 9 per cent to Dollars 1.9bn, while
international sales were up 16 per cent at Dollars 2.4bn.
Mr Lewis Platt, who became H-P president and chief executive at the
beginning of the month, said: 'Our cost of sales grew more than revenue, and
we were unable to offset that increase by comparable reductions in our
operating-expense ratios'.
H-P said that its cost of sales rose by 1 per cent to 58.1 per cent of net
revenue, compared with the previous quarter.
The company listed pricing pressures, the cost of product transitions, an
increased proportion of sales through distributors, a continuing shift to
products with lower gross margins and costs of expanding its peripherals
operations as contributing factors.
Operating expenses rose 11 per cent, excluding special charges, over the
corresponding period of 1991.
Four percentage points of this increase were due to the impact of currency
fluctuations, H-P said.
For fiscal 1992, H-P's net revenue rose 13 per cent to Dollars 16.4bn from
Dollars 14.5bn in 1991. Net earnings for the year were Dollars 549m, down 27
per cent from Dollars 755m last year.

VON ROLL, the Swiss steel and engineering group in which Proventus of Sweden
bought a 19.7 per cent voting stake last December, said it expected its 1992
losses to be significantly higher than last year's SFr30m (Dollars 20.8m).
A recovery was not expected until the second half of 1993 at the earliest,
so that a loss was anticipated next year as well, the company said.
This contrasts with a statement in August when the directors said they
looked for an improvement in the second half of this year.
They said sales rose 6 per cent in the first half to SFr1.1bn but margins
were unsatisfactory and orders fell 13 per cent to SFr1bn.
Proventus said when revealing its stake that the investment would be of
long-term advantage, because of Von Roll's interests in waste management
systems and other environmental technologies.
Von Roll management did not welcome the investment and made clear that
Proventus would be held to the bylaw forbidding any shareholder from
exercising more than 6 per cent of the total voting capital.

<TEXT>
TAP-Air Portugal, the state-owned airline, could reduce its workforce by 12
per cent by the end of 1993 to cut heavy financial losses, company officials
said yesterday.
The officials said 1,500 of TAP's 10,500 workers were expected to leave as a
result of voluntary redundancy schemes, early retirement and the
cancellation of fixed-term contracts. They stressed there would be no forced
dismissals.
TAP, which has not been profitable since 1973, earlier forecast 1992 would
be a break-even year. But officials now admit losses will soar above Es8bn
(Dollars 56.4m) compared with a loss of Es2.1bn in 1992.
Officials said the higher than expected losses were caused by currency
factors which had affected all sources of income from ticketing to
maintenance and to a fierce price war that had slashed tariffs. TAP's
forecast loss is in spite of a 13 per cent increase in traffic and a rise in
seat-occupancy rates.
As part of its retrenchment plans, TAP did not renew the contracts of 600
temporary staff which expired in October. It will also offer early
retirement deals to 835 workers who will reach the age of 55 before the end
of this year.
The government is preparing to privatise 49 per cent of TAP's capital in the
second half of next year. Iberia, Spain's national carrier, has said it is a
leading contender to purchase a large stake in TAP.

FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Balterley false accounts prompt fears - A
crop of questions being levelled at Spring Ram
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN THE most bullish of analysts following Spring Ram Corporation, the
recession-defying kitchens and bathrooms group, admits that the recent
episode of false accounting at its Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary raises a
number of urgent questions.
The questions are being asked of a group that has been one of the
outstanding success stories of the past decade, including defying the
recession with pre-tax profit growth of 25 per cent last year.
From its foundation in 1979, Spring Ram built annual sales to Pounds 194.2m
in 1991 and pre-tax profit to Pounds 37.6m. After flotation in 1983, its
market value grew from Pounds 11m to Pounds 651m in May this year.
Even after the punishment delivered to the share price by the Balterley
revelation, the market value is about Pounds 390m and it remains well within
the top 350 on the stock exchange.
The group has grown organically by building state-of-the art factories on
its greenfield sites - all financed from its own resources. Last December it
had about Pounds 45m cash, part of which is going towards the latest wave of
capital spending.
It is still headed by one of the co-founders, Mr Bill Rooney. The other, Mr
Bob Murray, resigned in 1990.
Strong on marketing, Spring Ram has been much less outgoing when it comes to
breaking down its figures. Some analysts have questioned its accounting for
such items as stock, depreciation and government grants.
Likewise its success in motivating the entrepreneurs who run its mushrooming
subsidiaries has a questionable side: the pressure on them to meet ambitious
targets is intense.
The disclosure of financial irregularities at Balterley Bathrooms - tucked
away in a press announcement about an acquisition - wiped nearly Pounds 160m
off Spring Ram's market value on November 6.
Balterley, acquired in late 1986, lies in Stoke-on-Trent and is
comparatively remote from the Leeds-based group's other operations. Although
its annual sales amounted to only Pounds 10m, profits have been overstated
by up to Pounds 5.6m. Mr Stuart Greenwood, Spring Ram's finance director,
says the problem dates back three years, but mostly relates to last year.
Balterley appeared to be making 'gross margins of more than 50 per cent and
pre-tax margins of more than 30 per cent'. In fact, it fell into losses last
year as 'the pricing policy was wrong'. Mr Greenwood describes three areas
of false accounting: the value of closing stock was inflated to increase the
gross profit; the number of items in stock was overstated; and sales were
pushed up by ignoring returns from distributors.
Mr Terry Henshall, Balterley's finance director, has been dismissed. Spring
Ram stressed there was no element of personal gain. He was acting on an
order from the board to build up actual stocks substantially - 'the guy's
inflation satisfied a pre-determined requirement,' Mr Greenwood says.
The problem came to light during the audit of the 1991 figures by Arthur
Andersen. About Pounds 2.1m was deducted from Balterley's contribution to
group profits. Up to Pounds 3.5m more will be taken as an exceptional charge
in this year's accounts.
Against this background, Balterley raises the following questions:
Why was the problem not disclosed sooner?
It was discovered before the full-year results were announced on March 23,
but not mentioned either with these figures or with the 1992 interims
released on September 24. It was thought that the correct numbers had been
published in the 1991 accounts. Mr Greenwood likens the adjustment between
the internal and the published accounts to a typist accidently adding an
extra zero to a figure, which was then corrected.
When it was realised in May that the correction had been inadequate, the
issue of disclosure was mentioned at a meeting with the group's solicitors,
Simpson Curtis of Leeds. At that stage it was decided it was too early to
announce because the extent of the problem was not known.
Arthur Andersen, the auditors, were sent back to investigate. The final
report is awaited.
During the summer, a variety of bearish rumours circulated and the share
price fell from 181p to 104p. The rumours included that the auditors were
investigating.
Mr Angus Phaure, building materials analyst at County NatWest, says he and a
colleague rang on five occasions and were told it was not true.
Mr Greenwood says no one asked a specific question 'that hit the target'. He
adds that it would not have been right to tell people selectively, rather
than making a formal announcement.
Should the falsification of the figures have been discovered sooner?
Mr Greenwood started with Spring Ram early last year as its first ever group
finance director. By May he felt uncomfortable with the book-keeping at
Balterley. Later in the year Mr Henshall was asked to leave - but not until
he had seen through the year-end management accounts.
Mr Greenwood points out that 'to some extent you have to rely on the
integrity of the people and the system'. While Balterley's margins were
high, it was explained in terms of the substantial premiums commanded by its
decorative suites. Production capacity had been expanded substantially
between 1988 and 1990, and it was meeting aggressively set targets.
Spring Ram's gross profit margin last year was 24 per cent and its operating
margin 18 per cent. To achieve these averages the more mature subsidiaries,
such as Balterley, must do substantially better to offset the small
contributions, or even losses, from start-ups.
Has financial control been adequate?
Spring Ram makes a virtue of the way it motivates the entrepreneurs running
its subsidiaries. They are expected to behave as if they owned them, meaning
considerable autonomy.
The divisional structure is light and the board lean. It has five directors,
but no non-executives.
Mr Greenwood says financial controls have been tightened up over the past 18
months: 'We have checkers checking the checkers. I don't think we would be
conned for long now.'
As for the pressure to meet targets: 'We don't shoot the messenger. The
bathroom market is relatively weak and some of the numbers are below what we
expected.'
Is there any cause for concern in the way the group accounts for stock?
Take the three things that went wrong at Balterley: first sales were
inflated by a failure to register returns from distributors.
Mr Greenwood says sales are counted when a customer orders and accepts the
invoice: 'We sometimes hold stuff for a customer, for example during a
promotional period. We pre-load it, but they accept that it is their goods.'
Provisions are made, and regularly updated, for items sent back or other
adjustments made by distributors.
In relation to the second problem - the inflated closing stock value - Mr
Greenwood says: 'There is a degree of judgment as to stock value.' When
looking at cost - materials, labour and attributable overheads - the last is
a 'grey area'. Assumptions about overheads and the number of items that will
be made give a figure for the overhead per unit.
'If you make more than you thought you would, it reduces the element of
overhead in each unit,' he says. But you only realise the benefit when you
sell it.
Mr Greenwood says the calculations are reworked every month. This is the
area the auditors 'crawl over' because 'if you get the stock value wrong,
you screw the numbers up'.
Third, inflation of the number of items in stock. Mr Greenwood says most
subsidiaries now have stock on computer, which runs a more accurate
'perpetual inventory' system, rather than leaving the count to the period
end.
As Mr Greenwood attempts to be as frank as possible in answering the
post-Balterley questions, the share price appears to have stabilised just
above this summer's low point. At 106p last night, the group (which pays a
tiny dividend) was still on a historic p/e of nearly 15, a small discount to
the FT-A industrial group.
It can only rebuild its premium rating once everyone is satisfied on these
questions.

FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Sidlaw rises 27% on back of increased North
Sea market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG GROWTH in services to North Sea operators helped Sidlaw, the oil
services, packaging and textiles group, report a 27 per cent advance in
pre-tax profits, from Pounds 8.27m to Pounds 10.5m, for the year ended
September 30.
Sales improved 9 per cent to Pounds 95.5m (Pounds 84.6m).
Mr Digby Morrow, chief executive, said he was 'very happy with the profits .
. . We are achieving what we set out to achieve'.
The group had increased its share of the North Sea oil services market from
33 to 42 per cent since introducing a system called contract logistical
services. This entails taking over the management of the supply chain to
North Sea operators.
Stronger market share and a contract with BP were the main reasons for an
increase in oil services operating profits from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 6.7m.
The joint venture announced in the spring with Smit, the Dutch support
vessel operator, had already acquired two companies. However, Mr Morrow said
the venture - designed to sell CLS in the international arena - was expected
to cost money in the current year. It was not likely to make 'serious'
profits until 1995, he said.
Sidlaw experienced a good return from packaging, which saw trading profits
advance by 24 per cent to Pounds 4.2m. Margins benefited from lower polymer
prices and a Pounds 250,000 gain on the sale of a printing machine.
Mr Ian Bodie, finance director, said without those two factors margins had
actually declined slightly during the year. However, the division was
expected to benefit from record levels of capital expenditure. During the
year, Sidlaw spent about Pounds 3m on packaging plant and a further Pounds
5.25m to acquire Falcon Packaging.
Capital expenditure for the group as a whole came to Pounds 5.4m against
Pounds 3.2m last time.
Textiles continued to face difficulties, especially in the sale of jute
yarn. However, an increase in synthetic yarns largely offset the decline.
Redundancy costs of Pounds 300,000 helped to depress the operating return to
Pounds 800,000.
Mr Morrow was optimistic about current trading, especially for the oil
services division. However, he added the caveat that packaging and textiles
were less predictable because of their greater dependence on the UK economy.
The final dividend is increased to 6.25p for a total of 10p (9p). Earnings
per share, based on a higher tax charge, advanced to 22p (18.1p).

FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Usher-Walker agrees Pounds 15m Sun Chemical
bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
USHER-WALKER, the manufacturer and distributor of printing inks, yesterday
announced agreement on terms of a Pounds 14.8m takeover by Sun Chemical, the
UK subsidiary of Sun Chemical Corporation, a US manufacturer of graphic arts
products.
Usher-Walker's board has recommended that shareholders accept Sun's 167 1/2
p per share cash offer, which carries a loan note alternative.
The offer is more than double the share price of 81p on Tuesday when the
company's market value stood at Pounds 7.1m.
Upon the offer becoming unconditional, holders of preference shares would be
offered 80p cash for each 3.5 per cent cumulative preference share, valuing
the preference share capital at Pounds 80,000.
Usher-Walker shares jumped to 165p yesterday, before falling to 161p at the
close.
Mr Edward Barr, group president and chief executive officer, said both
parties, which had enjoyed a good relationship for some time, believed the
market had been 'sending the wrong signals' about the fundamental strength
of Usher-Walker's business.
'Usher-Walker is a fine well-respected, well-managed business . . . By
working together Sun believes it can win a good return on its investment.'
New Jersey-based Sun has operations in North and South America as well as in
Europe, and is affiliated to Dainippon Ink &amp; Chemicals, the Japanese
diversified chemicals group.
Usher-Walker's profit faded from Pounds 217,000 to Pounds 9,000 before tax
in the half-year to June 30 under pressure from restructuring and redundancy
costs, which amounted to Pounds 143,000, as well as tightening margins.
Falling newspaper advertising has reduced demand for black newspaper ink,
Usher-Walker's main revenue earner.
Sun plans to keep Usher-Walker as a separate company, with its management
intact.
It plans to dispose of Surface Flatness, a printing plates producer bought
by Usher-Walker in September last year.

FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Costain applies to courts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COSTAIN, the UK construction group, has asked the US Federal Court and the
High Court in the UK to dismiss proceedings designed to prevent it from
selling its Australian coal mining business to a higher bidder.
This follows legal moves to prevent Costain from selling the business to
Altus Finance, a subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank.
Peabody Holding, the US-based coal-mining subsidiary of Hanson, the UK
conglomerate, has asked the US courts to enforce an earlier agreement which
would have allowed it to buy the New South Wales coal mines.
Altus earlier this month agreed to pay Dollars 245m (Pounds 162m) for the
mining operations and Costain's remaining Australian commercial property
interests.
This compares with an offer of Dollars 200m from Peabody for just the coal
mining business.

year to July 31.
And the current year 'should prove to be much better', following a good

Turnover declined to Pounds 12m (Pounds 13m).
Earnings per share rose to 9.2p (8.9p).

The proposed final dividend is held at 1.4p for a maintained total of 3.2p.

FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: S Jerome approaching break-even
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE continuing improvement at S Jerome &amp; Sons (Holdings) was reflected in
the 1992 first-half figures, which showed a near break even position.
Mr Alan Jerome, chairman, said the group was 'moving towards a satisfactory
performance with the eventual return to profitability.'
The pre-tax loss was cut from Pounds 576,000 to Pounds 9,000, on turnover of
Pounds 21.5m (Pounds 16.9m).
The specialist textile side turned round to an operating profit of Pounds
54,000 (loss Pounds 262,000) on turnover ahead 12 per cent.
Now that the balance sheet had been considerably strengthened by the sale of
CMR, the electronics division, Mr Jerome said it was intended to concentrate
on the core textile interests via expansion into new areas.
The electronics side lifted operating profit from Pounds 137,000 to Pounds
422,000. But that growth meant increasing calls on working capital and
management resources, so it was sold to Westinghouse last month.
As a result net bank borrowings fell from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 3.2m and
gearing from 70 per cent to 33 per cent.
Losses per share were 0.08p (4.9p). There is no interim dividend; last year
it was 1p but the final was passed.

FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Flotation proceeds lift Anglian Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLIAN GROUP, the maker of double glazing which floated on the stock market
in July, yesterday reported only a slight dip in interim operating profits
despite the continuing low level of consumer confidence.
But at the pre-tax level profit for the six months ended September 26 1992
rose from Pounds 8.86m to Pounds 10.3m, on sales down marginally at Pounds
71.4m, compared with Pounds 72.5m.
This pre-tax profit growth disguised a much higher interest charge in 1991 -
Pounds 2.53m against Pounds 597,000 this time - before the proceeds of the
flotation.
Earnings per share were up from 8.9p to 9p and an interim dividend of 3.7p
is declared.
Mr Bill Hancock, managing director, said in the first seven weeks of the
current period retail sales had improved year on year, despite the shock of
a collapse in sales in September around the departure of sterling from the
ERM.
During the first half retail sales fell from last year's levels while public
sector sales in the commercial division increased from 10 per cent to 11 per
cent.
By year-end they were expected to account for up to 15 per cent of sales. Mr
Hancock said the margins on the public sector side were only slightly lower
than they are in retail sales.
Overall, group operating margins fell from 15.7 per cent to 15.2 per cent.
On a pro-forma basis - restated to take account of the issue of the new
shares - pre-tax profits rose in the period from Pounds 10.8m to Pounds
11.4m and earnings were 0.5p higher at 8.5p.
The group reached the half-year stage with net cash in hand of Pounds 16m.
COMMENT
Anglian has had a chilly reception since coming to the market. But the
results suggest it has weathered the storm remarkably well, thanks partly to
its vertical integration and partly to the foresight of developing the local
government market. An acquisition in this area would be an obvious use for
some of its post-flotation cash pile and would use spare manufacturing
capacity, although taken too far expansion in this area must lower overall
margins. But Anglian is still faced with what to do with its cash.
Diversification carries with it risks that this management team may not have
previously met. Meanwhile, Anglian is likely to produce profits of Pounds
22m before tax this year, or earnings of 17p per share, giving a prospective
multiple of under 13 that is undemanding.

FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: ICI decision on split fixed for February
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR DENYS Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, yesterday
admitted there had been a deterioration in market conditions since July,
when he announced the company's intention to split into two separately
quoted entities.
A decision whether to go ahead with the split would be made in February and
be dependent on market conditions, Sir Denys said. The fall in UK interest
rates and decline in sterling would prove beneficial, he pointed out.
However, the board would consider the group's trading outlook for next year
and the willingness of stock markets to accept a share issue by the
bioscience business, yesterday renamed Zeneca, which includes the
pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and most of the specialities divisions.
Mr David Barnes, chief executive designate of Zeneca, said the split
increased the possibility that Zeneca might make a series of acquisitions.
Although the group had a viable base it did not have critical size in a
number of markets. There was no detailed master-plan of acquisitions,
however.
The new ICI executive team will be headed by Mr Ronnie Hampel, as chief
executive officer. It will include Mr Colin Short, presently ICI finance
director, Mr Chris Hampson and Mr Rob Margetts. Mr Victor White will
continue as solicitor and secretary, while Mr Alan Spall will remain general
manager of finance and Mr Trevor Harrison general manager of planning.
As well as Mr Barnes, the Zeneca board will involve Mr Peter Doyle and Mr
Tony Rodgers, together with Mr John Mayo, finance director. Mr Graeme Musker
will be secretary and solicitor, Mr Norman Lyle, general manager of finance,
and Mr Hugh Donaldson, general manager of corporate resources.
Sir Denys, who will be non-executive chairman of both companies, said
non-executive directors would be announced when and if Zeneca became a
public company.
The Zeneca name was one of 1,000 considered with the help of Interbrand, the
branding consultancy. Mr Barnes said some non-UK subsidiaries were compelled
for legal and commercial reasons to change their name. He refused to detail
the costs involved, but said it was a five-figure sum. Zeneca would
initially use ICI's Millbank headquarters, but would seek another site in
London.
Sir Denys said the new ICI would have a number of powerful businesses which
were sector leaders.

FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: IDV sizes up 33.8% Buton stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Distillers &amp; Vintners, the drinks arm of Grand Metropolitan,
is to acquire a 33.8 per cent stake in Buton, the Italian premium spirits
producer.
The Pounds 21m deal, with a group of minority shareholders, follows IDV's
acquisition earlier this week of a 30 per cent stake in Gonzalez Byass, the
Spanish sherry and brandy company.
IDV stressed yesterday the move did not signal a full bid for the Italian
company, which is controlled and managed by the Sassoli de Bianchi family.
'An approach will be made proposing a commercial relationship between IDV
and Buton on a worldwide basis,' it said.
'In the event that IDV is unable to develop such a long term relationship,
it has made arrangements which will allow it to sell the 33.8 per cent
interest back to the vendor shareholders.'
A partnership agreement with Buton, on the lines of those being developed
with Gonzalez Byass and Jose Cuervo in Mexico, would give IDV access to
Italy's leading spirits brand, Vecchia Romagna, a premium brandy, together
with a range of liqueurs and wines.
Italian sales of Vecchia Romagna amount to nearly 800,000 cases a year.
Another 200,000 cases are exported, according to International Drinks
Bulletin.
Buton has been trying to expand export sales and access to IDV's
international distribution network would offer considerable opportunities.
The Italian group, which is the only drinks company quoted on the Milan
stock exchange, also has a speciality foods business.

FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: ACT metamorphosis attracts admirers -
Profits of up to Pounds 10m are expected from the computer group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE wakening from a decade-long slumber might wonder what the fuss over
ACT Group is all about.
The Birmingham-based computing services company is expected today to release
interim figures showing growth and profitability that would be the envy of
larger competitors. Nothing very unusual about that, the erstwhile sleeper
might think. ACT was always a quality stock.
But in those ten years the sleeper would have missed a remarkable
metamorphosis.
The company has gone from computing services to hardware manufacturing under
the Apricot banner and back again to computing services under its original
name, the barely profitable hardware arm disposed of to Mitsubishi Electric
of Japan.
The quality of the company's earnings over the past 30 months is convincing
observers that ACT is fast becoming a kind of computing services company new
to the UK; a supplier of packaged software with a range of products
international in appeal and broad enough to protect its profitability in the
worst trading environment the industry has ever experienced.
It is expected to announce pre-tax profits of between Pounds 9.5m and Pounds
10m, up as much as 30 per cent on the same period last year, which itself
was boosted by Pounds 1m from the sale of shares in SD-Scicon, another
services company, to Electronic Data Systems.
European services companies have traditionally been weak in the package
business, having neither the homogeneous market nor economies of scale (or,
sadly, the money-spinning ideas) which have been the keys to the success of
US packaged software companies like Microsoft or Lotus.
There are only a few exceptions: Micro Focus of the UK, whose software
engineering tools are the justification for its Pounds 24-plus share price,
or SAP of Germany whose corporate accounting package is used by a clutch of
international companies.
ACT, however, now derives more than half its profits from the package
business. Through a combination of internal development and acquisition, it
has built up a portfolio of products in a diversity of market sectors.
The City seems encouraged to believe that ACT has got the recipe right,
predicting pre-tax profits for the full-year of about Pounds 22m on sales of
more than Pounds 150m, the second year in succession in which profits will
have risen by about 30 per cent. Results of that order would put ACT on an
unambitious prospective p/e of about 15, in line with the sector average.
ACT operates in five very different areas: finance, healthcare, the public
sector, corporate networks and computer support.
Computer support - essentially hardware and software maintenance - is a
mature business growing slowly but providing a steady revenue stream.
Networking is expanding vigorously, but revenue growth is affected by the
falling cost of hardware.
The market for finance and healthcare packages, however, is growing rapidly,
a phenomenon ACT has exploited through a series of shrewd, sometimes
opportunistic acquisitions.
Financial services, the company's strongest suit, generated 30 per cent of
total revenues in 1991 and substantially more is expected this year.
In 1991 ACT bought Kindle, Ireland's largest software house, and the City of
London firm, Quotient.
NMW, the stock processing company, went earlier this year to ACT for Pounds
3.8m, representing 18p a share, or 43 per cent of the price prior to the
bid, a reflection both of NMW's problems and a sharp rise in the company's
price as rumours of the bid spread.
Quotient had a string of overseas offices, but Mr Roger Foster, ACT chairman
and founder, says the Pounds 34m Kindle acquisition took the company out of
its traditional role of developing departmental systems for banks and
insurance companies and into the emerging financial centres of the Middle
and Far East and retail banking packages.
Through Quotient and Kindle, ACT took the critical step to become an
international software company.
Mr John Patterson, electronics industry analyst with Albert E Sharp, ACT's
broker, points out that the group now has 10 developed financial software
packages which could be sold in seven different countries, a matrix of 70
marketing opportunities, of which ACT is currently exploiting 28.
'There is still an enormous amount to go for,' he says. An example is the
pioneering sale of ACT Citydesk market information delivery system to Kemper
Securities Group in Chicago.
ACT Medisys, a Pounds 13m healthcare operation, is small compared with
financial services, but growing vigorously. It develops 'open software'
applications which run on a wide range of hardware under the Unix operating
system. It acquired Stemm Computing, which supplied patient management and
administrative systems for hospital departments in 1991 and Medical Computer
Services, which provides software for private sector hospitals, in 1992.
The vigour of the financial and healthcare sectors is at least partially
explained by the effects of recession. Both have turned increasingly to
packages rather than expensive tailor-made software as the financial
situation has tightened.
Logsys, its public sector systems operation, is a sizeable problem for ACT.
It is expected that it will have lost money in the first half of the year.
The problem, according to Mr Mike Hart, group managing director, is speed of
change. Logsys was a supplier of computer hardware, typically Apricot, to
government departments, a low margin business and an increasingly
unprofitable one as government moved to direct procurement from
manufacturers.
ACT's answer has been to transform Logsys into a systems integration
company, a specialist in linking equipment from different vendors into
sophisticated information technology systems. This has meant 18 months of
pain as people and skills have had to be changed. Mr Hart says there is
light at the end of the tunnel, however. The division has already secured
contracts worth Pounds 4m a year in connection with Department of Social
Security projects.
Can ACT maintain its momentum and become as Mr Richard Holway, editor of the
Holway Report and a seasoned observer of the computing services business,
suggests the 'most profitable UK computing services company?'
It still has some Pounds 20m cash from the Apricot disposal to spend on
acquisitions and there is no sign that the present management is tiring of
the struggle.
Analysts believe the company is tightly managed and that Mr Foster is worth
the Pounds 273,000 he was paid in 1991, putting him at the top of Holway's
league table of computing services salaries.
Mr Foster says he believes ACT's progress is due to strong management at
head office and in the branches and a strong team aimed at mergers and
acquisitions.

Rules governing the new series of UK indices.
The Steering Committee adopted the Ground Rules for the management of the
indices and set up a review of the existing FT-Actuaries and Stock Exchange
classification system.
The Steering Committee wants to see a standard method established for
calculating total returns, and has asked the Institute and the Faculty of
Actuaries, together with Keith Percy, chief executive of Morgan Grenfell
Asset Management, to make proposals to achieve this.
The FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices consist of the FT-SE 100, FT-SE Mid 250,
FT-SE Actuaries 350, FT-SE Actuaries 350 Industry Baskets, FT-SE SmallCap,
FT-Actuaries All-Share, FT-SE Eurotrack and FT-SE Eurotrack 200.
The FT-SE Mid 250, FT-SE Actuaries 350 and Industry Baskets were introduced
on October 12 1992.
The FT-SE SmallCap will be introduced from December 31, when the
FT-Actuaries All-Share will be extended.
The constituents to be included in the FT-SE SmallCap and the extended
All-Share will be approved by the FT-SE Actuaries UK Indices Committee on
December 3.
The new practitioner committees wil take effect from January 3 next year.

FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Asda chief says halcyon days are over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ARCHIE Norman, chief executive of Asda, the food retailer, said yesterday
the industry was set for a less profitable future, after the golden age of
the last five years.
Addressing the Marketing Society, he said last year was the annum mirabilis
for grocery retailers when profits exploded. However, the industry now faced
'saturation.'
Mr Norman, who joined Asda 11 months ago from Kingfisher, the non-food
retail conglomerate, where he was finance director, said that as a newcomer
to the industry 'it is hard to understand why people believe the current
situation is sustainable'. But he said 'the halcyon days are over'.
Lower inflation, slower growth in demand and 'dog eats dog expansion' were
now affecting food retailers. Discount retailers were 'only at the first
stage of development' in Britain.
In his first public speech about how Asda is being revamped, he said the
chain was being recreated as a retail brand. Asda would aim to meet the
needs of ordinary working people who demand value.

FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Tomkins' offer boost after RHM profit fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RANKS HOVIS McDougall, the milling, baking and grocery products group,
yesterday confirmed the slide in profits that has led to its board
recommending a Pounds 935m offer from Tomkins, the UK conglomerate.
In what seems likely to be its last results statement, RHM said pre-tax
profits in the year to September 5 had fallen from Pounds 150.2m to Pounds
92.6m on sales of Pounds 1.56bn.
The figures were broadly in line with expectations, although the decline in
the Manor Bakeries business was worse than expected while grocery products
produced a marginally larger increase in profits than forecast.
RHM brought forward its results as Tomkins' share price continued a recent
drift, ending yesterday down 2p at 206p.
The price is now only 6p above the 200p price at which Tomkins is planning
to fund part of the acquisition through a Pounds 653m rights issue.
With 11 days to go before the November 30 deadline for acceptance of the
first instalment of the rights issue, City observers expect the size of this
premium to be carefully monitored.
The rights issue has been fully underwritten. But a widespread decision by
shareholders to ignore the rights would leave the share registry with the
wrong composition of shareholders. This could lead to a price-depressing
hangover of Tomkins shares in the market.
In meetings with fund managers and City analysts, Mr Greg Hutchings, Tomkins
chief executive, has stressed new management can enhance earnings and limit
downside risk.
The message institutions are hearing is that the milling and bread baking
side, where RHM yesterday said profits had fallen from Pounds 59.8m to
Pounds 20.3m in the last year, is only one area where a turnround can be
achieved.
There is potential to reverse the decline in profits in the US - where RHM
said yesterday profits fell from Pounds 13.7m to Pounds 3.1m as a result 'of
the recession and abnormal crop conditions for peanuts and tomatoes'. RHM
said a capital investment programme was nearing completion and 'profitable
progress should be resumed shortly.'
There was also more potential from the grocery division, where profits rose
from Pounds 35.4m to Pounds 39.9m. Manor Bakeries also had potential after
last year's fall in profits from Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 10.9m.
Hauling the UK baking division out of loss remains a priority.
According to one City observer, Mr Hutchings made headway in convincing the
City of the deal's logic after the frosty earlier reception.
The City was uncertain whether the downward rating of Tomkins shares
reflected a new view of the company. Since the bid, Tomkins shares have
fallen 21 per cent, or from a 35 per cent premium to the market's
prospective p/e ratio to a 6 per cent premium.

FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Unigate declines to Pounds 42m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK recession's impact on the food industry hit Unigate's first-half
profits which fell from Pounds 43.3m to Pounds 42m at the pre-tax level.
However, the group expects to maintain profits for the full year at about
the Pounds 92.9m reported for the fullyear.
A slightly lower tax rate meant earnings per share dipped to 12.6p (12.7p).
The interim dividend is held at 5.7p.
Mr Ross Buckland, chief executive, said he was concerned about the future of
the milk industry in the UK. The Milk Marketing Board is to be abolished,
and Mr Buckland said that whatever replaced it should not be allowed to
become a non-statutory, unregulated, monopoly.
Sales were 2.4 per cent higher at Pounds 958.7m but a squeeze on margins cut
operating profits to Pounds 39m (Pounds 43.3m). Mr Buckland said that extra
advertising and promotion to support the group's brands had cost Pounds 3m
in the half.
Associated company income rose from Pounds 5.9m to Pounds 7.7m, as the
group's stake in Nutricia, the Dutch food business, was increased from 30 to
33 per cent and its profits rose 12 per cent.
Interest fell from Pounds 6m to Pounds 4.7m, despite a higher level of debt
of Pounds 135.3m (Pounds 129m) at September 30. This is a seasonal peak, and
borrowings are expected to fall by the year-end, helped by the receipt of
Dollars 75m (Pounds 50m) from the sale of the US cheese business.
Operating profits from UK dairy activities fell from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds
12.4m. Unigate has given up some supermarket business where prices were too
low.
Fresh foods, such as cheese and dairy desserts, saw profits down from Pounds
10.9m to Pounds 7.3m. The meat companies suffered a drop from Pounds 2.6m to
Pounds 300,000 as higher pig prices hit the bacon side.
The US restaurant chains increased profits from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 8.4m,
while the Wincanton distribution side rose from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 7.3m.
Vehicle sales profits rose to Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 1.7m).
COMMENT
Unigate's policy of concentrating on its food activities may look odd in a
period when its non-food side produced nearly all the growth. But in the
longer term it should prove the right strategy so long as new management can
improve the margins. Its refusal to supply supermarkets with milk at
unprofitable prices is some encouragement, though it assumes that other
suppliers will be shaken out. In other areas though, margins have clearly
been sacrificed. Assuming Unigate can reach last year's profits, the
prospective p/e of 10.5 is still below the market, while the yield on a
maintained dividend is just above base rate. The shares are worth hanging on
to.

FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Willis Corroon tumbles to Pounds 61m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION IN the UK and the continuing weakness of the US insurance market
again depressed profit growth at Willis Corroon.
The UK's largest insurance broker yesterday reported a sharp fall in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 89m to Pounds 60.9m for the nine months to September 30
1992.
Turnover from broking activities rose marginally to Pounds 460.3m (Pounds
457.9m), with growth in new business offset by a decline in premium rates in
the US and the UK downturn.
Income from the underwriting subsidiaries fell to Pounds 36m (Pounds 46.9m),
while interest and investment income fell to Pounds 39.8m (Pounds 52m).
Losses from Hurricane Andrew, which caused widespread damage in parts of
Florida and Louisiana in August, could lead to increases in US premium
rates.
Mr Roger Elliott, executive chairman, was cautious about prospects. He said
that 'for the moment rates remain depressed and, coupled with the normal
seasonal pattern of our business, mean that in the last quarter of this year
we are likely at best to break even.'
Expenses rose to Pounds 419.1m (Pounds 388.5m), but only by 3 per cent on an
underlying basis, largely reflecting the cost of new start-up operations in
Europe and North America. Mr Elliott said the figures for brokerage left out
earnings from many of these new acquisitions in the last 18 months.
'These are generating business for the group, revenues from which will
appear increasingly in our results from 1992 and beyond,' he added.
Claims from underwriting activities fell to Pounds 16.8m (Pounds 28.4m).
Associated undertakings produced profits of Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 4.2m), while
interest payable rose to Pounds 4m (Pounds 3.1m).

FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Courtaulds dips to Pounds 89m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COURTAULDS, the specialist materials group reported pre-tax profits down 9
per cent from Pounds 97.7m to Pounds 88.8m for the six months to September
30.
Mr Sipko Huismans, chief executive, said he was pleased sales had increased
from Pounds 968m to Pounds 975.6m given the depressed state of most of the
group's markets.
He refused to predict if trading would improve. He said: 'I don't mind being
wrong, I just hate being laughed at. However, my chemicals friends say
October was a significantly better month, and that the trend continued in
November.'
He was optimistic about prospects for fibres, films and chemicals. The
stronger dollar would help, although benefits would be partly off-set by a
higher dollar interest billThe group has Dollars 665m (Pounds 440m) of
dollar debt.
The results benefited Pounds 9.1m from a pensions surplus. Mr Michael
Pragnell, finance director, said the average tax charge was 17 against 19.7
per cent and was unlikely to rise above 23 per cent during the full year.
Earnings fell 5 per cent to 18.3p (19.3p). The figures were compiled
according to the new FRS3 standard.
The results were hit by the weakness of the dollar. As much as 60 per cent
of group turnover is in the US, or dollar-denominated. Pricing pressure had
meant operating rates had been poor, with about 10 per cent of fibre
capacity standing idle during the summer. 'July and August were pretty
bloody,' said Mr Huismans.
North American operations performed poorly. Trading profits fell 32 per cent
from Pounds 37m to Pounds 25m on turnover of Pounds 268m (Pounds 286m).
Sales there had been hit by the poor performances by the aerospace, viscose
and coatings businesses.
Mr Huismans said: 'Aerospace is in dead trouble. We've been doing a lot of
cost-cutting. In spite of its present difficulties we see aerospace as an
absolute core business.'
European operating profits increased 11 per cent from Pounds 47m to Pounds
52m on sales of Pounds 593m (Pounds 562m). Mr Huismans said the improvement
was mainly due to better results from Cellophane and Acrylics.
Asian Pacific profits rose 9 per cent from Pounds 11m to Pounds 12m on
turnover down 4 per cent from Pounds 104m to Pounds 100m.
UK operating profits rose 5 per cent from Pounds 39m to Pounds 41m on
turnover down 4 per cent at Pounds 381m (Pounds 395m). Margins were helped
by the closure of the Barrow plant.
Coatings operating profits were Pounds 27m (Pounds 28m) on sales of Pounds
344m (Pounds 343m). Performance materials profits were Pounds 7m (Pounds 9m)
on turnover of Pounds 94m (Pounds 95m). Packaging profits reached Pounds 13m
(Pounds 11m) on sales of Pounds 125m (Pounds 120m). Chemicals were Pounds
19m (Pounds 18m) on turnover of Pounds 108m (Pounds 112m). Fibres and films
profits were Pounds 31m (Pounds 36m) on sales of Pounds 323m (Pounds 318m).
Costs had been held back through 875 jobs lost since March. Mr Huismans said
a larger number would go next year. The interim dividend is increased 4 per
cent to 3.8p per share (3.65p).

FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Land Securities feels pressure - Rise to
Pounds 116m midway, but rental market deteriorates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAND SECURITIES, the UK's biggest property company, yesterday announced a 4
per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 112m to Pounds 116m for the six
months to September 30.
The improvement, in the face of a sharp decline in the property market,
reflected the stability of Land Securities' portfolio, three quarters of
which is secured by leases that expire after the year 2000, with
upwards-only rent reviews.
However, profits growth is coming under pressure from the further
deterioration in the rental market and the impact of interest rate cuts on
earnings from cash deposits.
Mr Peter Hunt, chairman, warned that the slowdown in profits growth,
highlighted by a comparison of these results with the Pounds 115.7m earned
in the second half of last year, indicated 'a flattening trend which will
continue until such time as rental growth returns.'
The board said it was concentrating on maintaining and wherever possible
increasing rental income and minimising voids, irrecoverable outgoings and
other costs.
Outgoings it could not recover on empty properties have risen to 3 per cent
of the annual rent roll. The rental value of unlet premises within the
development and refurbishment programme is now Pounds 10m, compared with
over Pounds 12m in May.
Other voids, excluding vacant properties held for future development or
refurbishment, had increased slightly to just over 2.5 per cent.
Earnings per share rose from 14.85p to 15.43p. The interim dividend is
increased from 6p to 6.3p.
COMMENT
The defensive qualities that protected Land Securities' investors since the
start of the property crash have stood them in less good stead over the last
month. The shares underperformed the sector as the attractions of
conservative management and relatively low gearing dulled in favour of
cheaper and more interest rate sensitive stocks. Indeed, interest rate cuts
have been positively harmful to Land Securities, which has fixed-rate debt
and a substantial cash balance. This is one among several pressures on the
company's income - diminishing reversionary growth, increased outgoings on
empty properties and impending lease expiries, especially in the London
market. But the security of the company's dividend is reassuring at a time
of widespread dividend cuts in the sector - even though this dividend
increase is the first below 10 per cent for the past 14 years. A prospective
dividend yield of 7 3/4 per cent provides support for the shares, although
on the basis of full-year net asset forecasts of between Pounds 4.70 and
Pounds 5, the shares at 423p are on a tight discount.

FT  19 NOV 92 / PowerGen rises Pounds 1m after cost savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT review of UK energy policy has raised questions over the
operations of PowerGen, the UK's second largest generator, according to Mr
Ed Wallis, chief executive, who unveiled interim profits yesterday.
It was unclear how the review would affect the electricity industry's
operating environment, he said. It was also uncertain whether PowerGen would
obtain authorisation for a new gas-fired powered station at Connah's Quay in
Clwyd, which forms a large part of its future plans. The increase in gas
power has been blamed for contributing to the coal industry crisis, and the
government has been under pressure to curb its growth.
Mr Wallis said the government was unlikely to overturn agreed projects. But
PowerGen would maintain a cautious dividend policy until the future of the
industry became clearer. Yesterday saw the dividend raised 9.8 per cent to
3.35p.
PowerGen earned Pounds 98m in the six months to September 30, up from Pounds
97m. The increase was more marked at the operating level which excludes
interest earnings from cash holdings. Here, PowerGen's earnings rose 24 per
cent from Pounds 79m to Pounds 98m as interest fell from Pounds 18m to zero.
The underlying increase was due entirely to cost savings, Mr Wallis said.
Some 40 per cent of the staff at the time of privatisation in 1990 had gone,
and productivity had improved by 28 per cent over 1991. Sales in the half
year were fell 3 per cent, and PowerGen had lost some market share, mainly
to nuclear power.
PowerGen continued its heavy investment programme with outlays of Pounds
475m, and the period saw the start-up of its new Pounds 300m gas-fired plant
at Killingholme on Humberside. The rate of spending will tail off in the
second half.
One of PowerGen's heavier costs is the high level of coal stocks,
accumulated as a result of its long-term contracts with British Coal. These
stand at 16m tonnes, compared with a need for 6m. Mr Wallis said PowerGen
hoped to run these stocks down under the new contracts with British Coal
next year. But there was a chance that the government might mandate higher
stocks to boost coal demand.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Union Discount talks to bidder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION Discount, the troubled discount house group, is in talks with a
potential bidder that could lead to the takeover of what is one of the
City's oldest independent financial institutions, it was announced
yesterday.
Cater Allen, London's second biggest discount house behind Gerrard &amp;
National, was strongly tipped yesterday as the potential bidder. The
company, which already owns nearly 3 per cent of Union's shares, refused
comment.
The terse announcement from Union that it was in the 'very preliminary
stages of discussions which may or may not lead to an offer being made' was
prompted by a leap in the group's shares. They ended at 71p, up 10p on the
day, compared with a peak two years ago of 500p.
Union, one of a shrinking band of discount houses, which play a pivotal role
in the Bank of England's dealings with the money markets, has been brought
low in recent years by a disastrous move into leasing and property lending.
Its ill-fated diversification stemmed from the mid-1980s when, along with
other City specialists, it tried to move into a wider range of activities to
reduce its reliance on its core business.
Leasing was responsible for losses of Pounds 5.7m in the first half of the
year, out of a total of Pounds 14.8m, with the core discount house business
returning a loss of Pounds 4m.
The group was forced to take on substantial property interests after a loan
to a property company went bad. It finally sold an Edinburgh property, known
as Apex 123, for Pounds 15.5m two weeks ago at a loss of nearly Pounds 1m.
Discount house shares jumped a week ago as the market digested the impact of
September's upheaval in financial markets on the results of King &amp; Shaxson,
another specialist money market dealer.
However, the reorganisation at Union, under way since Mr George Blunden took
over as chief executive earlier this year, is believed to have led it to
take a cautious approach to the markets. As a result, it is thought to have
benefited far less from the market upheaval than its rivals.
Mr David White, deputy chairman of Cater Allen, which announces results
today, said yesterday: 'We're not making any statement. It's been suggested
on one or two occasions in the past, and we didn't make any statement then
either.'

FT  19 NOV 92 / A change in policy pays off: The turnround by insurers has
surprised analysts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK insurance industry may have reached a turning point after it suffered
record losses in 1990 and 1991. Furthermore, the turnround has been quicker
than many expected. Although modest, the Pounds 19.6m third quarter pre-tax
profit reported yesterday by Commercial Union, the most successful composite
insurer, comes hard on the heels of improved figures at General Accident and
Royal Insurance.
Mr David Hudson, analyst with Credit Laing Lyonnaise, describes the third
quarter results achieved by CU, Royal and General Accident as 'almost
unbelievable. It is very much a UK story. It is coming through more rapidly
than anyone would have expected earlier this year.' Mr Youseff Ziai, who
follows the UK insurers for Morgan Stanley, adds: 'The magnitude of the
recovery, especially in the UK, is truly surprising.'
The recovery is centred on a turnround in the domestic UK market, where
companies were hit by a combination of weather and recession-related losses,
and a seemingly inexorable rise in crime.
During 1990 and 1991 claims from subsidence and storm damage soared to
record levels. In autumn 1991 insurers found themselves on the end of huge
claims stemming from the problems of the housing market.
Insurers were hit by claims on mortgage indemnity policies, by which they
had insured banks and building societies for losses arising on sales of
repossessed properties.
Claims and provisions on mortgage indemnity business are still at high
levels, and are undermining the pace of recovery of companies most heavily
exposed. Together Royal Insurance, Sun Alliance, Eagle Star and Legal &amp;
General, which have a market share of some 70 per cent of mortgage indemnity
business, face total losses in excess of Pounds 2bn for the three years
between 1991 and 1993.
Yet elsewhere the picture is much brighter. CU reported underwriting profits
on its private and commercial motor accounts.
The industry is recording small profits or breaking even in problem areas
such as industrial fire, while the business of insuring homeowners against
the risks of theft and fire is again proving to be profitable.
One of the reasons for the improvement is that claims trends certainly seem
to moving in the industry's favour. To some extent the industry has been
lucky.
Last winter was unusually benign. Throughout the year there has been more
rain and fewer storms. In the first half of 1992 losses from subsidence were
35 per cent lower than in the first half of 1991, according to the
Association of British Insurers, the industry's trade association.
CU says subsidence claims are now running at between 50 per cent and 60 per
cent of last year's levels.
Industry figures indicate that there are fewer road accident and motor
insurance claims, partially because motorists have less money available to
pay for petrol. Royal and GA say that as the density of traffic flows have
declined, only one in four of their motor policyholders have claimed on
their insurance this year. Motor claims frequency is declining by around 10
per cent.
The industry appears to be beginning to see the benefit of what it calls
'corrective actions' taken over the last two years. Premiums have risen,
with sharp rises in home and motor insurance.
Since early 1991 the average cost of motor insurance has increased by
between 20 per cent and 30 per cent a year. Household premiums have risen by
more than 100 per cent in areas which insurers regard as susceptible to
subsidence.
Insurers have also become more selective about the risks they underwrite,
fine-tuning premium rates to take into account a greater range of possible
risks and rejecting many potential customers.
In motor insurance Royal and GA are increasingly persuaded by the success of
the 'direct writers', companies such as Direct Line and Churchill, which
underwrite motor insurance via direct telephone sales and mass media
advertising. In particular direct writers are able to retain greater numbers
of customers each year, which reduces their cost base.
Royal and GA are now more prepared to promote their direct writing
subsidiaries even if it means offending brokers, the industry's traditional
intermediary.
Three in 10 Royal motor policyholders now buy their policies from the
Bristol-based The Insurance Service, a Royal subsidiary. Mr Bob Scott, who
heads GA's UK operation, says: 'Accounts have to be restructured in order
for us to obtain more control of the business. We can't just be pushed and
pulled by what's on a broker's screen. That is a path to nowhere.'
Insurers have also reduced staff numbers and their own expense base. Since
1990 General Accident has reduced its staff numbers by 20 per cent, for
example.
Some observers even believe that the worst of the domestic mortgage
indemnity problem may have passed. Royal would already be comfortably in the
black if it were not for its exposure to domestic mortgage indemnity, which
will cost it at least Pounds 450m in the the three years to 1993.
Insurers only assume a first tranche of losses - usually equivalent to the
first 25 per cent to 30 per cent of a loan's value. But such has been the
fall in house prices already that a further drop in prices and increase in
repossessions could affect building societies directly.
Pessimists point to the weakness of the industry's capital base, which will
undermine its capacity to compete if overseas companies enter the market.
The industry may have its stiffest challenges still to face but at least it
will do so with its domestic market in better shape.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Whitbread cautious despite marginal first-half increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITBREAD, the UK brewing and retailing group, showed resilience in
'depressed and highly competitive markets' with a marginal increase in
first-half pre-tax profits from Pounds 142.5m to Pounds 143m.
The results were at the top end of City forecasts but Sir Michael Angus,
chairman, said: 'The outlook must be one of caution. The market place
continues to reflect general uncertainty, trading conditions have not yet
improved and margins are under pressure.'
Performance in the second half will depend largely on the Christmas trading
period but analysts forecast full-year profits of about Pounds 256m against
last year's Pounds 222m.
Earnings per share for the six months ended August 29 fell 3.9 per cent to
22.65p; the interim dividend is raised from 4.55p to 4.75p. Group trading
profits increased 4 per cent to Pounds 129.6m on turnover 11.6 per cent
ahead at Pounds 1.18bn.
Beer profits rose from Pounds 39.1m to Pounds 44.1m and the group increased
its share of the UK market from 12.8 per cent to 13.4 per cent. Volume sales
grew 3 per cent against an overall market decline of 1 per cent.
Boddington bitter led the advance with a 30 per cent increase in volume to
become the best-selling ale brand in the take-home market. Murphy's stout
volumes rose 30 per cent; and Stella Artois recorded a 10 per cent increase.
The accounts include a Pounds 5m provision for bad debts and a similar
charge is likely in the second half.
Profits of the Pub Partnership leased and tenanted pubs fell 9 per cent to
Pounds 30.8m following the disposal of a further 230 pubs to comply with the
government's beer orders.
However, Whitbread Inns, the 1,600 managed pubs, was the best performing
business in the group's retail operations which lifted overall profits from
Pounds 63.6m to Pounds 70.3m.
Sales at Beefeater restaurants fell 5 per cent, but profits increased 5 per
cent. Pizza Hut achieved profits in line with last year; and TGI Friday's
and Thresher off-licences recorded 'significant increases' in sales and
profits. The Travel Inn chain achieved occupancies of 85 per cent to 90 per
cent and is being expanded. The group's net borrowings were virtually
unchanged at Pounds 434.5m, 16.3 per cent of shareholders' funds.

FT  19 NOV 92 / CU plans expansion after return to profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL Union, the composite (life and general) insurance company,
yesterday announced that it is back in the black and said it is raising
capital to pave the way for further expansion.
Pre-tax profits for the nine months to September 30 were Pounds 6.1m,
compared with a Pounds 42.4m deficit for the same period last year.
The improvement in the third quarter was particularly strong, with pre-tax
profits amounting to Pounds 19.6m.
Mr Paul Found, group financial controller, said the results 'clearly
confirmed an upward trend', while Mr Tony Brend, chief executive, said the
recovery had been pronounced in the UK where pre-tax profits amounted to
Pounds 33.3m over the nine-month period, compared with a loss of Pounds
21.2m.
The group is launching a Pounds 100m cumulative irredeemable preference
share issue, the second time it has turned to the markets this year. The
issue will allow CU to continue its expansion in life assurance, as well as
write additional non-life business in order to take advantage of increasing
premium rates.
The preference shares, for which Hoare Govett and Cazenove are joint
brokers, will pay a net dividend of 8.375 per cent. CU's last issue paid a
net dividend of 8.75 per cent.
CU, the UK insurer least affected by losses from mortgage indemnity
business, has increased business at a steady pace. Non-life premium income
increased to Pounds 2.46bn (Pounds 2.14bn), a rise of 12 per cent in
underlying terms, while life premium income grew to Pounds 1.30bn (Pounds
945.5m) in the nine months. Premium income in the UK market rose 25.3 per
cent to Pounds 1.10bn.
Investment income amounted to Pounds 212.4m (Pounds 209.9m), after charging
external loan interest of Pounds 35.1m (Pounds 37.6m) and the costs of
non-insurance activities of Pounds 4.9m (Pounds 4.2m). Underwriting losses
were cut to Pounds 302.3m (Pounds 338.1m), with UK losses down from Pounds
157.7m to Pounds 128.6m.
Non-life operating losses of Pounds 75.9m (Pounds 123.1m), were offset by
life profits of Pounds 82m (Pounds 80.7m). Earnings from associated
undertakings amounted to Pounds 14m (Pounds 5.1m). Shareholders funds
increased by Pounds 96m over the nine months to Pounds 1.3bn.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Brussels to ease steel cuts with Ecu900m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN STEELMAKERS are to receive Ecu900m (Pounds 732m) of EC funding
between 1993 and 1995 as part of a special aid plan agreed yesterday by the
European Commission. The aid will contribute to the cost of restructuring in
the industry and ease decisions on capacity cuts.
The Commission has also pledged to clamp down on cheap imports from east and
central European countries with which the EC has signed trade deals.
Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, said: 'We are prepared to
allow products produced in these countries on to our markets, but at the
same time it has been clearly stated that fair conditions should be
applied.'
He said the EC would begin talks, particularly with Czechoslovakia and
Poland, on possible 'additional measures' to curb cheap imports and avoid
the EC having to impose anti-dumping duties. Commission trade officials have
suggested that east and central European governments might be asked to
impose taxes on steel exports.
Half the Ecu900m should come from the resources of the European coal and
steel treaty and EC structural funds.
Some Ecu240m will be allocated to the cost of shedding up to 50,000 steel
jobs, and Ecu210m has been committed for plant closures and rationalisation.
Under the treaty, the 12 EC member states must match that central
contribution.
European steelmakers, hit by recession, overcapacity and cheap non-EC
imports, asked the Commission a month ago for political, financial and
commercial help in return for big capacity cuts. They estimated the overall
cost of their plans at as much as Ecu4bn.
Mr Fernand Braun, the Luxembourger who used to head the Commission's
industry directorate, has been asked to consult individual steel companies
about capacity cuts and prepare a report. The aim is to avoid
anti-competitive collaboration bet-ween steelmakers to cut capacity.
The aid plan, together with the controversial short-term question of how to
react to planned state aid for the Spanish steel sector, will be discussed
at next Tuesday's meeting of EC industry ministers in Brussels.
Anthony Robinson, East Europe Editor, writes: Central European steel tube
producers have reacted angrily to the Commission's decision to impose
anti-dumping duties of up to 30.4 per cent on seamless tube imports from
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Croatia. Mr Vladimir Petr, director of
the steel division of the Czech ministry of industry, contested the EC
figures and argued that the case for dumping was 'not proven'.

FT  19 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: PowerGen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Those looking for a duopoly can easily spot the similarities between
PowerGen and National Power. Indeed, it is tempting to argue that the
technical accounting differences which separate their earnings figures at
the half-way stage are needed to tell the companies apart. After
privatisation, however, PowerGen's shares traded at a premium as its
management seemed more aggressive. That premium has disappeared since the
coal row erupted.
In part this may reflect disquiet at the robust criticism PowerGen's chief
executive, Mr Ed Wallis, dished out over the continued operation of ageing
nuclear stations. PowerGen's stations are also slightly better placed than
National Power's to take imported coal, so if more domestic coal is burnt,
the company will lose a marginal cost advantage. But these differences are
dwarfed by a common interest. If the generators help the government with a
larger coal deal, they are less likely to feel the hot breath of the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In dreadful trading conditions Whitbread did well to maintain pre-tax
profits in the first half, and deserved to see its share price yesterday
claw back part of the recent losses. Market share in beer showed an increase
without any margin loss. Boddington looks to have been a big success,
particularly in the fast-growing take home market where it has come from
nowhere to become the leading brand. Perhaps the most impressive
performance, though, was in food sales where Whitbread seems to be reaping
some reward for its recent heavy capital investment.
Success in striving with recession, though, cannot disguise the lack of
market domination in any one region, or the continued dependence on the UK.
The shares remain a geared play on recovery in the south-east in particular.
The outlook is not good enough to justify an improvement in its
below-average market rating.

FT  19 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: BT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The exact timing yesterday of the chancellor's announcement of another BT
share sale may have caught the market on the hop - but there is no obvious
reason why the news should unsettle UK equities. Another BT issue was needed
to meet next year's Pounds 5.5bn target for privatisation proceeds; even
before the coal fuss, that was likely to take precedence over disposal of
the government's remaining stakes in the electricity generators. Moreover,
on the far-from-clear assumption that the entire 22 per cent BT stake is put
on the block at once, retail demand and a part-payment structure could limit
the call on UK institutions next year to just Pounds 1bn-Pounds 1.5bn.
From institutions' point of view, of course, it all forms part of the same
large pot of money required to finance the government's widening deficit
next year. In this respect, though, the bright prospects for retail demand
must be encouraging. The effect of falling interest rates  - and widening
bank and building society margins - is already evident in the behaviour of
savers. The more rates converge with BT's prospective yield - currently
around 5.4 per cent for 1993 - the more attractive BT's mix of income and
capital growth becomes. There is also a convenient regulatory lull, though
investors may worry that once unburdened of its BT shares the government
could really let Oftel off the leash.

FT  19 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Courtaulds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by yesterday's interim figures, Courtaulds had a miserable summer. A
seasonal lull in demand and a weak dollar left manufacturing capacity idle
and margins squeezed. But events are now moving in the company's favour. A
strong dollar will boost US profits on translation. Operating margins in
dollar-priced products like cigarette filters will improve. European markets
may be slowing, but Courtaulds is helped by manufacturing in the UK, Italy
and Spain, which have all devalued.
The broader question is whether Courtaulds can maintain earnings growth
without the kind of vigorous cost-cutting that has underpinned progress
since the demerger. Under accounting rules adopted yesterday reorganisation
provisions will have to be charged against earnings from now on. The growth
prospects in mature markets like viscose are hardly breathtaking even
allowing for an upturn. But Courtaulds' cyclical businesses from marine
coatings to packaging should benefit on any recovery.
Admittedly, yesterday's figures are flattered by a pension fund surplus
which contributed some Pounds 10m in the first half but without generating
hard cash. The surplus shows every sign of growing though, after this year's
revaluation. Besides, Courtaulds is likely to generate net cash this year
despite maintaining a healthy investment programme and raising the dividend.
Yesterday's 4 per cent rise in the shares is well justified.

FT  19 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Discounted sales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the gloomy tone of consumer confidence surveys, the last few months'
consumer spending figures have proved unexpectedly robust. Indeed, the
government is keen to stress the current quarter's improvement over the
previous three months. However, it would be unwise to rely on consumers too
much. August's improvement followed a very weak July - suggesting that
buyers were waiting for the summer sales before spending. The last two
months have shown only small gains. And while volumes may be holding up,
retailers' margins are still under severe pressure.
The key question is the extent to which savings on mortgage payments and
real income rises are used to spend rather than to reduce debt. The US may
be an imperfect guide, but zero real short-term interest rates there have
not tempted consumers. In the UK short-term real rates are about 3 per cent
and on many mortgages real rates are still over 5 per cent. Yet as asset
prices continue to fall and unemployment again accelerates, the incentive to
save remains strong. With investment and exports under pressure, the
government must hope consumers will produce a recovery. The danger is that
there will be precious little recovery at all.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Letter: Independent advice would aid credibility of economic
policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof JAMES MCGILVRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Wise words on Germany' (November 17), reviews the
economic report of Germany's 'five wise men' and quite rightly commends this
as 'a good case for independent economic advice'.
In previous editorials you have strongly advocated an independent Bank of
England, with constitutional responsibility for monetary/price stability.
There is surely an equally strong case for an independent UK institution or
authority, akin to Germany's wise men or the US president's Council of
Economic Advisers, to pronounce on macroeconomic trends and policy
implications. Such a body would be independent of the Treasury or any other
ministry and, as in Germany, influence the agenda for debate and policy
formulation.
It has been obvious for a long time that the Bank of England, responsible
for monetary policy, and the Treasury, responsible for fiscal policy (and
both subject to political control), are not able to provide the kind of
authoritative independent commentary and advice on economic trends and
policy options which are needed, not only to establish a more rational
framework for debate but also (as you have argued with respect to an
independent Bank) to restore some credibility to UK macroeconomic policy.

<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to your headline 'Recession and fares war take BA down 23 per
cent' (November 18). I have just arrived back from Milan by BA, travelling
economy class, having paid Pounds 341.50 return. On the outward journey I
met an American businessman on the flight who had come from Philadelphia by
BA. We compared costs and I was amazed to find that, even at today's
exchange rate, he had paid roughly the same for his Philadelphia-Milan
return ticket.
I export 100 per cent of my services to Europe and, like many other small
companies, find the going tough. There is no fares war where I work, only
recession.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Letter: Commitment to Personal Investment Authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M A JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report, 'Insurers challenge proposed regulator' (November 14),
seriously misrepresents ABI's attitude towards the proposed Personal
Investment Authority. On November 12, we stated publicly and in writing:
'ABI remains committed to the establishment of the PIA but it is not
realistic to expect insurance companies to continue to offer support unless
a very large majority of other product providers and advisers agree to
join.'
It is therefore totally incorrect to state that we have advised our members
to steer clear of PIA.
We have defined 'a very large majority' as at least 95 per cent of all
product providers and advisers in the retail investment market. We should
hope for this level of commitment from life companies if PIA receives a
similar level of support from product providers and intermediaries currently
regulated by the Securities and Investments Board and and IMRO.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Letter: British Gas not barring competitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CEDRIC BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You reported ('Regulator defies British Gas', November 17) that our
regulator, Sir James McKinnon, had told the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission that he had rejected our proposals for a rate of return higher
than 4.5 per cent. He also pointed to the difficulties experienced by two
companies in their efforts to enter the pipeline market.
I must explain, therefore, that British Gas worked hard to find a way for
these potential competitors to enter the market by transporting some of our
gas. We also took the initiative some six months ago to raise the matter
with Sir James in order to find a solution; at that time he took no action
to address the situation.
The companies' proposals came to naught because their required rate of
return to make a success of the proposals was several times higher than the
rate of return British Gas was allowed to charge on the transportation
business under the regulatory regime.
This goes some way to explaining the impasse which led British Gas to seek
the present wide-ranging MMC investigation of the UK gas industry. Cedric
Brown,

FT  19 NOV 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Tour of world economy after the Berlin
Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every successful human society works with a mixture of rules and spontaneous
decentralised endeavours. You only have to go to any city shopping street to
see stores driven by the profit motive and shoppers trying to gain the most
for every pound or dollar or D-Mark they spend. You will also see traffic
lights regulating the vehicles and policemen enforcing traffic rules -
although the most important of the rules, such as driving on one side, do
not depend mainly on coercion. But there will be no overall plan for the
whole street and its activities.
I have laboured the obvious to show that all-or-nothing arguments about
markets versus planning or private versus public spending are inherently
absurd. But there are reasons for preferring markets and private spending
where there is a choice. One is freedom of choice by consumers, workers and
investors. Another, more subtle one is that markets can make use of
dispersed knowledge and discovery methods unavailable to a state planner.
There is a different reason why writers like William Keegan, the Observer
economics editor, have an inherent distaste for the market. This is that 'it
brings out the worst in human characteristics'. Economists make a huge
mistake in ignoring this moral dimension.
I will readily concede that the gain motive is not the most beautiful on
earth; but I have a prize for the first non-economist reader who can guess
who wrote: 'It is better that a man should tyrannise over his bank balance
than his fellow citizens; and whilst the former is sometimes denounced as
being but a means to the latter, sometimes at least it is an alternative.'
Such arguments were rudely terminated when the only developed system of
'real existing socialism' came crashing down with the Berlin Wall in 1989.
(The system was never called by true believers Communism - that would only
come when the state had withered away.) The Soviet downfall was a bitter
pill for many western intellectuals. This is not because they were secret
sympathisers, but because it became more difficult to talk of a Third Way
between two extremes, one of which no longer existed. More specifically, it
became more difficult to use terms like 'market forces' and 'capitalism' in
a condescending way when the old Soviet bloc was crying out for them.
Since then, the economic interventionists have recovered their nerve. The
ex-Soviet countries have found their road to capitalism hard, while the
capitalist economies have been suffering an unusually prolonged recession.
Above all, the interventionists have taken heart from Clinton's election.
In the UK, a Conservative prime minister has resurrected sectoral preference
for manufacturing, is in danger of shunting backwards to generalised incomes
policy by exhortation, and is also whipping up populist hostility to
financial institutions, which could end up by prolonging the recession.
These developments have given William Keegan the opportunity of a tract in
favour of a much more managed form of capitalism. In The Spectre of
Capitalism (Hutchinson, Pounds 16.99) he has provided a useful Cook's tour
of the world economy before and after the Fall of the Wall. One cannot blame
him for going to town on what the Left was quick to call capitalist
'triumphalism' and the disappointments it experienced. His favoured whipping
boy is 'the US-IMF free market model', including its Czech and Hungarian
followers.
His own recommendations give pride of place to the German and Japanese
models of capitalism over the Anglo-American variety, a return to Keynesian
techniques and 'the rescue of the world trading order and the reinvigoration
of the commitment to an orderly working of the international economic and
financial system that characterised much of the 1945-73 period'.
I can agree with the objective, although I wish the author would tell us a
little bit more about how to achieve it. How in fact did Bretton Woods work?
Nigel Lawson makes a powerful case in The New Conservatism - a 1980 speech
reprinted at the back of his book The View From Number 11 and which is,
despite its title, the best piece of political economy in the book - that
the dollar standard of these years served as monetarism at one remove, until
it was undermined by the inflationary financing of the Vietnam war. This is
the case that Keegan has never answered, despite his personally generous
review of Lawson's book.
As for the trade side of the goal: surely the Uruguay Gatt round is an
attempt to extend competitive market forces to an unprecedented range of
goods and services - which is why the French farmers so hate it. But if
Keegan wants to call the exercise international co-ordination, why quarrel?
Where, however, I redraw the line is at Keegan's adulation of the Japanese
and German models. If you are looking for any country that has experienced
the succession of easy credit, inflated property values and debt overhang,
it is Japan.
The tables in this article, which are also in the statistical annexe in
Lawson's book, suggest that, although Japanese growth rates have until
recently been faster than elsewhere, there is a large catching-up element.
Real output per head is much lower than in the US and slightly lower than in
Europe. Even manufacturing productivity is well below American levels.
Germany actually experienced slower productivity growth than the UK up to
the peak of the last economic cycle. Much more important: the highly
centralised and unionised German wage determination system was responsible
for a wildly premature attempt to unify pay and social security levels in
the two parts of the country - which had made unification so painful both
for Germany and the rest of Europe. Not all good things go together; what
Germany has to offer Europe is not its system of pay bargaining, but an
independent Bundesbank intent on price stability.
But I must be fair. Keegan's chapters on Japan and Germany are not
starry-eyed; and the discerning reader can learn a lot. The problem is that
someone who basically dislikes capitalism, but sees that socialism does not
work, and is stronger on examples than analysis, will hanker for another
country's version of capitalism - just as German radicals denounce
anti-competitive bank domination of industry in their country.
The Golden Age of the pre-1973 mixed economy was able to work as well as it
did because inflation-blindness restricted real pay, the dollar standard
restrained inflation and interest groups had not become as influential as
they are today, especially in continental Europe. Ideological history is
great fun. But I wish Keegan would look at the real obstacles in the way of
going back to the soft Keynesianism of the postwar enlightenment, which go
far beyond so-called extreme free-market writing.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Letter: Continental chambers are not so all-providing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN WRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As someone involved in the discussions about one-stop shops, I read
Gisela Davis's letter (November 16) about the chambers of commerce and the
Department of Trade and Industry proposals for one-stop shops with interest.
However, she has fallen into the trap of thinking everything in continental
Europe is well organised and everything in the UK is not.
There are strong chambers of commerce in Germany, France and the Netherlands
which manage activities such as apprenticeship training and company
registration. But they are not market-driven and many do not provide the
small firms advice service.
Indeed, there is a growing number of small firms initiatives all over the
continent which are being set up to compensate for the institutional nature
of the chambers. Furthermore, many of them are using UK experience of
enterprise agencies.
However, I acknowledge we have a lot to do in the UK and it is my hope that
the one-stop shop discussion will result in a rationalisation between the
250-plus public service enterprise agencies and 100-plus voluntary
membership chambers. But we do not want to lose the market-driven, bottom-up
approach to customer service.
The reasons for supporting small firms is to encourage growth and job
creation. This means that the agencies which are going to work with them
have to be in tune with their needs: we have a chance to do that in the UK
which I believe some other European countries will, in time, wish to
emulate.

Being fleeced by the bank is now a regular experience for farmers in
south-west China. Formed in 1989, their state-financed bank in Sichuan
province deals solely in sheep.
It buys high-quality ewes to lend to the farmers, who then hand over wool as
interest until they have bred enough of their own ewes to repay the loan in
kind. The result, says the official Xinhua news agency, is a near halving of
the local population living below the poverty line.
If Premier Major wishes to set up a similar outfit to cushion the effects of
recession in Britain, there's an obvious candidate to run it  - Baaclays.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Observer: Eurospeak?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'Subsidiarity' is child's play compared with some of the Eurospeak terms
bandied about by former top OECD official David Henderson in his lecture on
European Community developments at the London School of Economics.
One was 'deepening', approfondissement in French, signifying a strengthening
of central control in the EC so decision-making does not become paralysed by
being spread among too many member states.
Another he cited was acquis communautaire - the principle that new entrants
to the Community must accept everything countries already in it have
previously agreed.
Not content with those, however, he suggested that at least two more will be
needed if the EC continues to expand. The first was desacquisition, or
ditching unwanted acquis such as the Common Agricultural Policy. The second
was deprofondissement, the opposite of deepening.
Although Observer's pedantry specialist thinks the latter should be
desapprofondissement, it's to be hoped that Henderson proves right.

Four in every five of them say they stay working in their hotel rooms, says
a survey by Official Airline Guides. Swiss businessmen are either even more
diligent or less truthful, with nine out of 10 claiming that they do the
same.
By contrast, more than half of their counterparts from Germany as well as
two-thirds of those from Italy admit to indulging in other pursuits. The
difference is that, whereas the Italians typically go out on the town, the

The abrupt resignation of Lord Williams from Mirror Group Newspapers means
Lord Hollick is now the Labour party's undisputed standard-bearer in the
City. Will he do a better job than his predecessor, whose association with
the late Robert Maxwell probably explains why he wasn't elected Labour's
leader in the House of Lords this week?
Williams and Hollick are both on the modern wing of the party. But beyond
that, they could hardly be more different.
Not only is Williams a dozen years older, but he used to work at Barings,
captained Oxford at cricket and is married to a Cazenove.
The bearded Hollick went to Nottingham University and is married to a TV
producer. His main claim to business fame is that the company he built, MAI,
is one of the few sizeable financial conglomerates to have survived the
recession.
With Williams gone, it will be up to Hollick to make sure the Daily Mirror
remains the Labour party's most powerful media ally. There's even talk of
his adding the MGN chairmanship to his board seat at troubled British
Aerospace and full-time chieftaincy of MAI which is about to launch its new
TV franchise.
For someone who is also a working peer, that would seem a bit much. Perhaps
if he wants to out-do Williams as a Labour party power-broker, he should
rein himself in somewhat.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Politicians on Poland's Catholic right may soon regret the removal of the
censorship that went with communism.
Some of their number, along with rivals on the left, are allegedly among the
dozen or so parliamentary deputies seduced last summer by authoress Marzena
Domoros, who has now named as well as described her apparently effortless
conquests in a 140-page typescript.
True, it has yet to find a publisher. Although it was originally
commissioned by the fast-growing publishing house BGW, the company's chief,
Roman Gorski, has decided not to bring it out.
But the decision is unlikely to stifle the ambitions of Domoros, a striking
blonde, who gained entry to parlia-
ment by claiming to work for Figaro. She wrote the book, she says, 'so that
people would know why deputies are absent from the chamber during important
debates'.
Since Poland has yet to experience a high-level public sex scandal, no one
can forecast the effect of publication on the electorate. Perhaps, like the
French, the Poles might admire politicians with exciting private lives.
In any event, however, the left-wing deputies Domoros deflected from their
duties stand to suffer less from her revelations than her bedfellows on the
opposite side. The Catholic right is just preparing to battle for a
statutory ban on abortion.

FT  19 NOV 92 / The winter of discontent: The three Baltic states are
struggling with economic hardships and the problem of Russian minorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first Soviet republics to achieve independence - Latvia, Lithuania and
Estonia - have also been among the first to experience the harsher side of
freedom. Half their population of some 8m live in poverty; heating and
lighting are minimal. The leaders of the three Baltic states are concerned
about surviving the winter - rightly, since the Lithuanians have just
rejected the government of the Sajudis nationalist movement in general
elections.
The three states assume that, when winter is over, the worst will be behind
them. But the worst could be to come. Unemployment is starting to rise
sharply; prices, which have risen steeply in recent months, are expected to
increase further, albeit at a slower rate; and the big state-owned
enterprises have yet to be restructured or privatised.
The difficulties facing the Baltic states are manifold: their economies are
in decline; their criteria for citizenship are undefined or controversial;
government institutions are embryonic.
Lithuania's nationalist government, headed by Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, was
rejected because of the country's privation. The weakness of the country's
political institutions has now provoked a dogfight over the transfer of
power to the Democratic Labour party of Mr Algirdas Brazauskas, the former
Communist leader. The Estonian and Latvian leaderships fear unemployment -
most of all among their large Russian minorities, which they have not yet
granted full citizenship, and which could rebel against the building of
states of which they are not yet members.
Yet these are societies in transition. They have formal statehood, political
plurality, constitutions in place, membership of the main international
organisations, embassies at home and abroad. They have flags, anthems,
national guards, sports teams, media and airlines. All have re-established
the independence they enjoyed until 1940.
There is no present danger that these states will collapse back into a
Russian embrace. At stake, rather, is whether they will for years be plagued
with instability and poverty, or instead achieve a modest but productive
place in the north-eastern corner of Europe.
First, their successes. All have introduced a currency - though only the
Estonian kroon is hard, backed by gold returned to the republic from the
Bank of England and pegged at 8 kroon to the D-Mark. The link with the
German currency has helped bring inflation down from 24 per cent a month in
July to 7 per cent in September. The Latvian rublis has remained more or
less stable against the hard currencies - now about 160 to the US dollar -
but is backed 'mainly by faith', according to Mr Uldis Klauss, a central
bank adviser. The Lithuanian talonas is less stable, with a market price of
200-plus to the dollar, and fluctuates widely.
All the Baltic countries have begun privatisation: Lithuania claims to have
privatised more than 50 per cent of state-owned dwellings; all have at least
begun the sale of shops and small businesses. On Tuesday, the Estonian
Privatisation Agency announced an international tender to privatise 38
state-owned companies. Mr Andres Bergman, the agency's head, said the aim
was to tempt foreign investors to become 'part of a manufacturing centre for
northern Europe'. The first list of Latvian companies to be privatised had
to submit their plans yesterday - both foreigners and Latvians can bid for
shares.
But to most Balts the price they are paying for the transition to
independence still seems high. The International Monetary Fund, of which all
three are members, has laid down a standard programme of monetary and fiscal
discipline and rapid movement towards convertible currencies and privatised
property.
'We are sticking to the IMF plan, absolutely, 100 per cent,' says Mr Ivars
Godmanis, the Latvian prime minister. 'But it's very hard: how our old
people will live this winter I don't know.' Mr Teet Rajasalu, of Estonia's
Institute of Economics, reckons purchasing power has dropped by more than
half since the currency was introduced earlier this year because of the
steep rise in the price of imports, including energy. 'By early next year
our prices might reach world market levels - but not our wages.'
Only Estonia, under President Lennart Meri and Premier Mart Laar, is
unambiguously pro-market. One deputy from the ruling Fatherland bloc of
parliamentary parties spoke of the ethical nature of sex shops (now opening
in Tallinn) because they efficiently match demand with supply. Mr Ivar Raig,
head of the parliament's budget committee, calls for a 'real privatisation
of land and companies, not the timid steps we have so far taken. This is the
basic mission of our government.'
The other two states, while seeing no alternative to market reform,
hesitate. The Latvian premier, Mr Godmanis, heads a fissiparous coalition.
To make his ambitious privatisation plans work he will need a more coherent
government to be elected next spring. The central bank under Mr Eynart
Repshe has a tight control of the money supply - so much so that Latvia's
credit-starved enterprises are threatening strikes. Lithuania's state
companies are still receiving credit from the central bank but production
has tumbled and productivity has halved over the past year.
Lithuania, where a new left-of-centre government is now being formed, is the
first to suffer a backlash against market policies, though all agree that
the attempts to break up and sell off the state farms in the country were
badly handled. 'There could be real hunger this winter,' warns Mr
Brazauskas, although he insists the country will not 'in principle' deviate
from the IMF's narrow path.
For the politicians and the people throughout the region, economic problems
dwarf the crises of the state and of citizenship. The fall of Mr Landsbergis
is a warning that patriotism - and the hatred of the Soviet past which saw
hundreds of thousands of Balts slaughtered or sluiced through the gulag a
mere four decades ago - are not enough to keep voters' support. Yet in
Estonia and Latvia, where most Baltic Russians live, there is no question
that the state's policy of withholding citizenship is popular with the
ethnic majority.
Mr Meri, urbane in his presidential mansion, is inclined to dismiss Russian
protests against unequal treatment of the minority. He regards the threat by
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, to delay the withdrawal of troops
from the Baltics as no more than posturing for the nationalists in his own
country.
After talks with Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian deputy foreign minister, Mr
Meri said: 'We have agreed a kind of truce. Mr Churkin said that the
impression given that troop withdrawals were linked to human rights here is
wrong.' In practice, said Mr Meri, laws demanding two-year residence and
command of the language will be relaxed to allow more non-ethnic Estonians
to become citizens.
Both Estonia and Latvia have returned to the independent status they enjoyed
in 1940 and based citizenship on those people, and their descendants, who
were citizens before the Soviet annexation. This excludes nearly all
Russians, since the Soviet immigration was of workers, bureaucrats, soldiers
and secret policemen. It means, as Mr Meri cheerfully explains, that the
Russians are 'not second-class citizens, they are non-citizens'. Mr Godmanis
says he is content to see Russians become Latvian citizens, though less
relaxed about the presence of 40,000 Russian troops, the largest presence in
the Baltic states. He says that 'the citizenship question will have to be
defined by the next parliament' - though since most Russians presently
cannot vote, it will not represent them.
A UN human rights commission, invited into Latvia by Mr Godmanis, is now
preparing a report on the civil rights of non-ethnic Latvians. Mr Godmanis
rejects any suggestion that the state is discriminatory. His - and the
Estonians' - overriding need is to re-establish the state on the basis of
its ethnic majority, and to ensure thereafter that the admission of others
to citizenship is done on an individual basis.
Mr Churkin said on a flight back to Moscow that he was sure that the
pull-out of his country's troops by next August would go ahead as agreed. Mr
Brazauskas, who does not have this problem, believes the Russian threat in
the Baltics no longer exists. He dismisses the possibility of a reactionary
takeover in Moscow followed by a renewed thrust to the north on the pretext
of protecting ethnic Russians. Neither Mr Meri nor Mr Godmanis share that
insouciance. Mr Godmanis makes the point that 'until the people see their
government control the army, they will not feel that they have a real
government'. But none of the new crop of western ambassadors in the Baltic
states believes that there is a serious Russian threat.
The last crisis, that of the state itself, can only be solved with time. It
is first a matter of people; none of the new politicians were in the habit
of making decisions, and thus they tend not to.
Some ministers are learning. Mr Godmanis in Latvia is determined and tough;
Mr Laar and Ms Lia Henne, Estonian deputy prime minister for economic
reform, appear intelligent and quick; in Lithuania, Mr Vytenis Aleshkaitis,
the economic reform minister, has won glowing reviews from the little circle
of foreign advisers and may stay in the new 'technocratic' government
promised by Mr Brazauskas.
But the ministries they run are still rudimentary. One minister spent a day
adjudicating on where to put a photocopier donated by a foreign government.
In all the Baltic ministries, groups of men and women sit gossiping just
like in the old Soviet days when it did not matter if they worked or not.
It is on the streets where the real money is being made - much of it
illegal. The Baltics have become conduits for metals traders - men who make
unwritten contracts for the supply of lead, copper, zinc and aluminium and
ship it across lightly guarded borders and ports. Bribery is not uncommon.
They are the nouveaux riches of the cities, flashing about in Mercedes cars
and frequenting the hard-currency bars, where they are tolerated for the
business they bring.
And the old reflexes of cheating the state live on. Yet there are also men
and women, young and old, who will remain in cold offices late into the
night, trying to master the new demands. This will be a hard time, but the
three states on the Baltic are still moving westwards.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Safe haven for Moslems
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE spring of last year western governments were in a quandary about
Iraq. They did not like what was going on there, but were fearful of the
consequences of doing anything about it, and tried to escape doing so by
disclaiming any responsibility for the Kurdish uprising. But they found they
had misjudged public opinion and moved sharply into a different gear. Troops
were sent in, President Saddam Hussein withdrew his forces, and a 'safe
haven' was established in which the Kurds could return to their homes.
We may now be close to a point where something similar will happen over
Bosnia. Public opinion in Britain has been aroused by the Home Office's
mishandling of an attempt by a British charity to bring a small group of 183
refugees to Britain. By saying that these particular refugees are no
different from 2m other displaced people in former Yugoslavia, Mr John Major
has simply highlighted the scale of the problem, and the inadequacy of
Britain's response.
His government argues, rightly, that accepting those 2m people in foreign
countries would not be the right solution to the problem. It would amount to
validating the odious Serb tactic of 'ethnic cleansing', that is, mass
expulsion. They should, where possible, be enabled to return to their homes,
or at least resettled in their own country. Britain claims that, through its
small contingent in the UN force in Bosnia, it is making a contribution at
least as important as is Germany by taking larger numbers of refugees. Far
better to feed and protect the people on the spot than to evacuate them
hundreds or thousands of miles from their homes.
Intervention force
Yes, but the UN force is neither large enough nor adequately equipped or
mandated for the task. It is getting food through intermittently to Sarajevo
and other beleaguered cities, but not in large enough quantities to avert
the prospect of tens of thousands dying of cold and starvation within the
next few weeks. And even if people are fed, they cannot be expected to stay
in their homes under constant shelling. If the war is to be stopped on any
other basis than acceptance of Serbian victory and removal of most of the
Moslem population, a much larger intervention force is needed, with a clear
mandate to secure a 'safe haven' for that population, as was done for the
Kurds last year.
Legally such a move is less problematic than it was in Iraq, because it does
not involve overriding state sovereignty. The Bosnian government,
internationally recognised as sovereign, has been calling for military
intervention for months.
Actively opposed
The practical objections are of course more serious. The operation might
well be actively opposed by Serb forces. Neither its outcome nor its
duration could be guaranteed. The objective could not be the liberation or
conquest of all Bosnia, since most of the Serb community (comprising roughly
one-third of the population) must be presumed to be hostile. It could only
be to secure a sufficient area for the Moslem population to live in safety,
and to put them in a position from which they would have some hope of
negotiating an equitable political settlement with the other two
communities. It would require an explicit mandate from the UN Security
Council, backed up by tighter enforcement of sanctions to choke off Serbian
aid to the Bosnian Serb forces. The intervening force could be supplied by
Nato or the Western European Union, with the US providing air cover and
logistical support even if it does not commit ground troops.
Western governments are rightly cautious about embarking on such an
enterprise. But they have to face up to the consequences of not doing so:
acceptance in EC countries of most of the 2m already displaced and probably
many more yet-to-be-displaced persons, with much more bitter arguments about
the share each country should take; a wave of similar conflicts elsewhere in
central Europe and the former Soviet Union, as ethnic cleansing is seen to
be the effective way to deal with unwanted minorities; and a wave of
anti-European anger throughout the Moslem world, where it is already
universally believed that the Bosnians are being left to their fate only
because they are Moslems.

REJUVENATING THE MATURE BUSINESS: The Competitive Challenge By Charles
Baden-Fuller and John M Stopford Routledge, Pounds 10.95, 232 pages
At a time of extreme and exaggerated gloom about British industry, it is
refreshing to read a book which shows how, even in the most unpromising
circumstances, good management can turn sick companies into world leaders. A
pump maker in Scotland, a cutlery business in Sheffield, a steel castings
producer in the Midlands - such companies may not catch the popular
imagination like an Amstrad or a Sinclair, but they are what most of
industry is about. In these and other cases reported by Baden-Fuller and
Stopford, the much-maligned British manager has been doing an admirable job,
not just in rooting out inefficiency, but in building new sources of
competitive advantage over international rivals.
Hotpoint was almost broke when Schreiber took command in 1974. 'Ten years of
hard work . . . converted one of Europe's worst performing appliance firms
with an appalling failure rate into a shining star, envied by all the
industry leaders.' When Bryan Upton became managing director of cutlery
maker Richardson in 1966, the company was 'small, broke and part of the
smoke-stack and rust bowl of Sheffield'. By the late 1970s it was making
profits and growing. By 1990 'it was staking its claim as the world's
largest, most profitable and most innovative producer of knives'.
Leadership is important, but this is not a story of supermen, still less of
quick fixes. Rejuvenating a mature business calls for teamwork at all
levels. Top management has to instil a shared vision and an atmosphere of
trust between previously distant groups - such as the service and production
departments at Hotpoint, or the mechanical and electronic engineers at
Richardson.
Going for a big hit - such as a massive investment in state-of-the-art
technology - is almost always wrong. Progress is best made by many small
steps, which spread the risks and prevent the organisation from betting
everything on one initiative. 'It takes years to build an entrepreneurial
organisation and the foundations need to run deep.'
One of the merits of this book is its challenge to conventional wisdom - for
example, the notion that there are 'good' and 'bad' industries. The authors
show by their examples that what determines a company's performance is not
its choice of industry, but its choice of strategy.
Again, they question the idea that being number one or two in an industry
gives a business unique advantages, or that economies of scale are always
crucial. Hotpoint, for instance, had no ambitions to be a global player
along with Electrolux or Philips-Whirlpool or to cover the full range of
household appliances; with plants below the commonly accepted minimum size,
it outperformed its larger rivals in flexibility, quality and profits.
The authors suggest a four-stage path to rejuvenation: galvanise, simplify,
build and then exert leverage. The first step, usually prompted by a
financial crisis, is to create a top management team dedicated to renewal.
The second is to concentrate scarce resources on a smaller agenda. The third
is to set about building new competitive advantages, and the fourth is to
keep up the momentum, extending the new-found capabilities into a wider
sphere of activity.
The transformation often involves what the authors call 'frame-breaking'
investments. Edwards, the BOC subsidiary, decided to attack the Japanese
market for vacuum pumps - a radical move in an industry which had
traditionally been bound within countries or regions; it demonstrated to
everyone in the company the standards that had to be met in the world's most
demanding market. Richardson defied convention by packaging its Laser knives
as gifts. While the trade association thought the industry's future lay in
classic silverware, with high margins and low volume, Richardson's focus was
on fashionable, mass-market products.
At all stages the rejuvenators must be careful not to do too many things at
once. 'Problems arise when the sequences are rushed through in ways that
lead subordinates to view them as no more than passing fads.' To expect
instant results from such over-hyped programmes as total quality management,
time-based competition and empowerment leads to disappointment and
disillusion.
There is no suggestion here that the patient rebuilding of a business is
made more difficult by stock market pressures for quick returns. Most of the
companies analysed by Baden-Fuller and Stopford were quoted or parts of
quoted groups. They delivered excellent value to shareholders. Many of them
managed a consistent record of pre-tax profits amounting to 25 per cent of
capital employed, well above the level achieved by their competitors.
This book is both a description of how mature businesses have become
entrepreneurial and a guide for managers who wish to follow their example.
The message is optimistic: the survival of struggling companies is in their
own hands. Instead of urging the government to 'do something', managers
would do well to read this book, and act on it.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Tunnel vision in Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN MR Filippo Maria Pandolfi became European research commissioner four
years ago, he inherited in the EC's high definition television (HDTV) policy
a costly prestige project which had lost its way. But instead of setting the
policy back on track, Mr Pandolfi and his colleagues appear intent on moving
it still further in the wrong direction.
The HDTV programme was conceived in the mid-1980s chiefly as a means of
bolstering Europe's embattled electronics industry. Pioneered in Japan, the
technology promised not just to revolutionise home entertainment by bringing
cinema-quality pictures to the small screen, but also to trigger a bonanza
for makers of television sets, video recorders and advanced electronic
components.
Urged on by Philips and Thomson, Europe's two main consumer electronics
manufacturers, the EC agreed to fund the development of its own HDTV
technology and broadcasting standard, HD-Mac. Central to its approach was
the belief that gaining supremacy over standards would put the Japanese at a
disadvantage by forcing them to compete on a battleground defined by
European manufacturers.
However, two obstacles have emerged to frustrate the grand strategy. First,
European broadcasters have balked at committing themselves to supply
services and programmes in an HDTV format while there are still no
television sets to receive them. After trying to impose its will on the
broadcasters by legislative diktat, Brussels sought to persuade them to make
common cause with equipment manufacturers. Both tactics have failed.
Different tack
The Commission is now trying a different tack. It will today ask
telecommunications ministers for authority to spend Ecu850m over five years
 -on top of the estimated Ecu1bn in subsidies already invested in HDTV
technology - in an effort to win the broadcasters' co-operation. The money
would finance production of programmes and studio equipment needed to
broadcast wide-screen television services, as a stepping-stone to full HDTV.
It is claimed that it could stimulate sales of television sets and video
recorders worth Ecu27bn in the next 10 years.
But this proposal runs up squarely against the second obstacle. HD-Mac risks
being made obsolete by more advanced, fully digital, HDTV systems under
development in the US and other parts of Europe. These would make possible
still more sophisticated services, carried on more channels using
lower-powered transmitters. Some EC officials now admit privately that
HD-Mac may never become widely established, while Brussels' public position
on the standard has grown steadily more equivocal.
Taxpayers' money
Even if HD-Mac's future were assured, the case for using taxpayers' money to
create a market for it would be highly questionable. But the growing
uncertainty over the standard's fate robs the Commission's proposal of any
semblance of a coherent rationale. Indeed, the whole HDTV exercise is
starting to look like an expensive European champion policy in search of a
champion to back.
The EC needs to rethink its priorities and recognise that its HDTV policy
started from the wrong premise. From the outset, it has been driven chiefly
by the interests of equipment manufacturers and their national governments,
which saw the programme as a way to create a market sheltered from Japanese
competition. Whether broadcasters, programme makers and viewers needed, or
were ready to accept, what the producers were determined to provide was at
best an after-thought in the formulation of strategy. It is hardly
surprising that their response has ranged from indifference to outright
hostility.
The sensible course for the Community is to abandon its costly dreams of
technological hegemony and attempts to massage demand. Instead, it should
seek to agree with the US on a common digital standard to be adopted on both
sides of the Atlantic. That would not guarantee a rapid take-off for HDTV.
But it offers the best hope of creating the mass market needed to bring HDTV
out of the laboratory and into millions of living rooms.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Arts: Ibsen and Bergman - a marriage made in heaven / The
first European theatre festival in Dusseldorf is proving a heady experience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Mitterrand paid for it, Giorgio Strehler opened it, and Ingmar
Bergman was the catch of week one. At the first European Theatre Festival
launched last week in Dusseldorf, radical chic has never been more
sparkling. Bergman and Ibsen; Strehler and Goldoni; Brecht directed by his
son in law; a revolutionary Catalan Figaro; from London the RNT's Angels in
America: stars stud the stage, tickets are gold dust, visitors fill smoky
bars for midnight post-mortems. The mood recalls Edinburgh, the variety
Vienna and the quality Salzburg: on the first few days' tasting this new
festival, whose venue will change each year, looks set to become Europe's
most heady and prestigious theatre binge.
Bergman doing Ibsen is a marriage made in heaven, and the Royal Theatre
Stockholm's Peer Gynt offers a rare chance to see film-maker as stage
director. Peer Gynt, its series of frozen scenes in Peer's life unravelled
like magic boxes, is a natural vehicle for cinematic theatricality; in to it
Bergman, always an autobiographical artist, injects a personal vision which
transforms this often wooden piece into an emotional coup de force. A
century on, Bergman's art is rooted in scenes close to Ibsen: moral
integrity; a sense of sin powerfully visualised; individual expression
within claustrophobic relationships; the meeting of dream and reality.
Bergman's set is a sinister red room, centre stage, enclosed within the
larger frame of Peer's home. High, thick wooden walls carved with flowers,
dim gaslights, a grandfather clock, a sturdy crib, hem it in on three sides.
Actions, memories, are compressed into this chamber of the imagination; like
dreams, each seen has its own visual logic. The wedding guests, in flame-red
folk-dress buttoned up to neck and wrists, weighed down with gold brocade
and buckles, hijack the room for a hellish, anti-erotic tap dance full of
jerkily suppressed lunges for freedom. The trolls, green tarts in flounces,
frills and dreadlocks, drag Peer on a rhino to an orgy in a madhouse. They
hang over the roof of the room swinging erect green tails and snorting
lewdly. Sex screams out, Peer hurtles about trying to conceal a huge rubber
penis emerging between his legs.
Later, laser beams focus on top-hatted men in black encircling Peer; their
accusations echo as distortions from loudspeakers across a vast auditorium
and against a chorus of church bells: a choking vision of guilt.
Loneliness, repression and sin are the motifs. Solveig's family, Amish-style
puritans, march in line like geese, fall to their knees chant prayers, a
young child spies on Peer from a doorway. Based on Bergman's own upbringing,
they are as chilling an emblem of cruel rectitude as the father in his film
Fanny and Alexander. Lena Andre's Solveig, symbol of love, unwinds with
conviction and subtlety from torment into a mix of nervousness/grace,
fear/determination.
As Peer, Borje Andersson is Everyman: chubby, dazed, endlessly flexible
face; round, hapless body; a dreamer whose desires are now pathetic, now
comic, now horrifying. He sticks out his tongue at us, drops his trousers at
the whiff of a woman; he is also the desperate loner; seeking warmth,
meaning, justification. A magnificent, inexhaustible performance.
The European Theatre Festival to November 27 at the Dusseldorf,
Schauspielhaus. Festival information 0211 36 87 136.

SINGLE WHITE FEMALE (18) Barbet Schroeder
TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME (18) David Lynch
SISTER ACT (PG) Emile Ardolino
Imagine that you are a single white male and that into your darkened bed
glides your supposed girlfriend. She is in the midst of doing unpublishably
intimate things to you when you realise - horror] - that it is not your
girlfriend at all. It is your girlfriend's girlfriend.
Barbet Schroeder's Single White Female is a delectably creepy tale of
role-exchange from the director of Reversal Of Fortune. Much psycho-nonsense
is spoken in the press notes about 'delicate symbiosis,' 'dyadic conflict'
and the like. But we know where we are - grand guignol country - from the
first spooky play with malfunctioning lift-doors to heroine Bridget Fonda's
warning prowl around her plain-Jane new flatmate's suspicious personal
effects. Expensive perfume? Pearl earrings? Jewelry?
Miss Fonda, a comely computer software expert, has placed the personal ad
('Single white female seeks same') after the loneliness-inducing crisis of a
broken romance. Dumpy Jennifer Jason Leigh answers. But the new
rent-sharer's initial input of love, labrador pups and shoulders-to-cry-on
is soon modulating to sexual jealousy, knifed neighbours and defenestrated
pooches.
Like most mystery thrillers, the film is better with the mystery than the
thrills. These last come tumbling down on us in the final reel as if someone
has opened a cupboard in the Gothic Props department: 'dead' persons
returning to life, hairsbreadth chases through boiler rooms, zappings with
iron hooks . . .
How much less frightening than the early drip-drip of anxiety as Ms Fonda
watches the schizophrenic Ms Leigh titrate one personality into another,
recolouring her little girl lost as waif-with-a-vengeance. Schroeder and
screenwriter Don Roos, adapting a novel by John Lutz, know when to leaven
suspense with laughter. (Protective gay neighbour to frightened Fonda: 'I
can be butch when I want to. I get it from my mother.') And designer Milena
Canonero turns the European-style New York apartment - all high ceilings,
ornately jaundiced walls and crumbling balcony grilles - into a crucible for
terror as resonant as any since Rosemary's Baby.
David Lynch's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is a strange film. Is it the
exhausted ravings of a writer-director still trying to coax money from a
cult TV series? One suspects it is. This two-hour prequel discloses the
before-death hi-jinks of murdered 'heroine' Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). Once
supposed a small-town innocent, Palmer is here revealed as Miss Loose Morals
of the 1990s. She is a girl who sleeps around, sniffs coke, tears off her
top in red-light dance dives, has sex a trois, and wears a smouldering
come-hither look that Jean Harlow would be proud of.
Meanwhile Agent Cooper (Kyle McLachlan) flexes his storm-lantern jaw
somewhere in the spirit world; David Bowie, Kiefer Sutherland and others
float through in guest cameos; and there are walk-in mirrors, secret
diaries, bloodthirsty prowlers and sudden deaths. In short, anyone caught
mentioning the words 'Norman Rockwell' in this American small town would
probably be lynched.
The charm of the TV Twin Peaks was its elusiveness. Evil was present but
metamorphic. The audience was kept hungry for the solid food of information
through endless servings of weird canapes and surreal titbits. The movie
instead, knowing it cannot keep a tapas bar going through a two-hour film,
heats up the red meat, sloshes on the wine, hurls in the gypsy violinists
and ends up effectively raping the audience's taste-buds.
With this film David Lynch becomes the most annoying director in America. He
looked like a genius in Blue Velvet; he blew it with the kitschy hyperboles
of Wild At Heart. He looked like a genius again in early episodes of Twin
Peaks; the peaks blow it here, creating the most ozone-destroying,
tourist-deterring eruption since Mount Saint Helen's.
Whoopi Goldberg in Sister Act is the week's third heroine in search of a
cogent plot. American audiences clearly think she found it: the film made
Dollars 137m, third only this year to Lethal Weapon 3 and Beauty And The
Beast. Indeed combine a police chase thriller with a fairy story and you
have this tale of a mob-hunted black cabaret singer (Miss G) who finds
sanctuary and - yes - salvation in the nunnery where the police hide her as
a protected witness.
Think of Nuns On The Run and multiply by minus six. Jokes are thin,
sentimentality is rife and among those peering into the camera lens making
funny faces are Maggie Smith (Mother Superior), Harvey Keitel (chief
mobster) and Miss Goldberg herself, whose unlikely sexpot-chanteuse is
matched by her more unlikely 'sister act.' When she coaches the rickety
convent choir in hip hymns and swinging spirituals, and they perform them
before the visiting Pope (see the back of His Holiness's head as he bops
along in the organ gallery), all sane British filmgoers will run screaming
to the nearest pub.
Why America's filmgoers stayed and paid is a puzzle. Perhaps the glutinous
message about sisterly love transcending self-interested hide-and-seek
appeals to popular taste in the age of post-yuppie piety. Then again perhaps
audiences just like seeing Misses Goldberg, Smith and company going over the
top and staying there, even though rightminded cinephiles wish they would
return to the trenches.
Talking of rightminded cinephiles, Sight and Sound magazine has published
its latest Top Ten Films Of All Time international critics' poll.
It has its its share of non-surprises. Citizen Kane tops the chart for the
fourth decade running. Renoir's La Regle du Jeu and Eisenstein's Battleship
Potemkin are once more the arthouse favourites. And Hitchcock's Vertigo and
John Ford's The Searchers still carry the torch of popular Hollywood up the
pantheon steps.
The casualties are more interesting than the survivors. Italian cinema has
fallen down the stairway completely. No Bicycle Thieves nor L'Avventura nor
8 1/2 . Singin' In The Rain has plummeted from third-equal in 1982 to
nowhere in 1992. And Buster Keaton's The General has tumbled into oblivion
from a precarious tenth.
Meanwhile Eastern cinema has crept back in with Ozu's Tokyo Story and Ray's
Pather Panchali. So have those austere hermit-mystics Carl Dreyer (The
Passion Of Joan Of Arc) and Stanley Kubrick (2001: A Space Odyssey).
What does it all mean? My theory is that the new list is pre-millennial:
suggesting a nervous alertness in us all to those new slabs of time, and
perhaps space, awaiting us eight years hence. Localised angst or antics from
such as Antonioni or Keaton - Mediterranean alienation, Civil War knockabout
 -have yielded to more mystical echoes from distant lands and times. Even
the two American crowd-pleasers ascending the chart - Vertigo and The
Searchers - are about loss and being lost; about precise places turning into
landscapes of infinity.
Or then again, perhaps the poll just reflects the knock-on processes of
movie fashion and research. Such-and-such a film is restored or reassessed
(like Vigo's L'Atalante, back in the list after a three-year absence); while
others (Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai, third in 1982, out this year) have a
decade of benign neglect.
Only Kane seem immune to all caprice. It must be magic. There it stands, the
greatest movie conjuring trick of all time: a film whose feats of technical
prestidigitation have been analysed countless times, a film that even gives
away its own plot secret (Rosebud equals sled), yet a film so sublimely
convoluted that it has a dozen enigmas for each one that is solved.
Sight and Sound Top Ten: Citizen Kane, La Regle Du Jeu, Tokyo Story,
Vertigo, The Searchers, L'Atalante, The Passion Of Joan Of Arc, Pather
Panchali, Battleship Potemkin, 2001: A Space Odyssey.

The BBC, bless its little cotton socks, is now providing two solid hours of
comedy in the centre of Thursday evenings. Will this see off the ever
popular Rumpole on ITV? Probably not. Today the old dear is very impressed
by She Who Must Be Obeyed when she pursues a thief (9.00).
BBC1 starts its comedy blitz at 8.30 with the first of a new series called
Sitting Pretty, written by John Sullivan, author of 'Only Fools And Horses'.
This new series centres upon a female character: Annie Briggs, known in the
60s, we are told, as 'the Jackie Onassis of Bethnal Green', now living in
luxury and loneliness in the stockbroker belt. When that finishes at 9.00
you can switch to BBC2 for the second episode in Absolutely Fabulous, set in
the fashion world, written by Jennifer Saunders, who also stars alongside
Joanna Lumley. At 9.30 it's back to BBC1 for Smith And Jones who carry on
much as they always have, with the repeat of One Foot In The Grave following
at 10.00. C4 begins a five-part drama, The Big Battalions, shot in Britain,
Ethiopia, Israel and Saudi Arabia, which 'expresses strong views on
religion' (9.00).

FT  19 NOV 92 / Arts: Hagegard and Bonney 'Tender is the North' - Song
recitals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the re-opening of the Wigmore Hall had been delayed more than one month,
there would have been problems. The festival of music from Scandinavia and
the countries thereabouts, entitled 'Tender is the North', is being shared
between the Barbican and the Wigmore: the first pair of song recitals fell
within what turned out to be the hall's opening week.
There is a good range of songs from which to choose. Any fear that this
series of recitals would be heavy with Nordic gloom was quickly dispelled.
To balance every song that has a chill in its bones - Stenhammar, for
example, setting to music the story of a traveller blue with cold seeking
refuge at night - there is another which will take as its theme the
blossoming of spring. To that composers from Grieg to Sibelius have eagerly
warmed.
This first pair of recitals came in tandem from Hakan Hagegard and Barbara
Bonney. As far as the baritone's programme on Tuesday was concerned, the
North may not have seemed as tender as the title would have us believe. The
days
when Hagegard was a soft-grained singer are behind us. He opened his
programme with Sibelius, took
the songs in high keys and gave them a brazen, heroic force, which
set the voice bouncing off the back
wall.
No doubt this is a good way
to clear the tubes at the outset, but a tendency to sing big beyond the
Wigmore's intimate needs ran
through the evening. His main Scandinavian contribution comprised a group of
five songs, King Erik's Lieder, by Ture Rangstrom. This was admittedly
fairly glum Nordic stuff about a King ending his life in
prison, but its dark (medieval?) feeling of oppression was chillingly caught
by the baritone's concentrated
singing.
There were some standard German songs, too, and it is worth noting a rare
performance of Frank Martin's Six Monologues from 'Jedermann'. Again,
Hagegard brought force and tension to these awe-inspiring
songs, while his pianist, Thomas Schuback, played as if he was
tackling piano transcriptions of an orchestral accompaniment rather
than a piano original, as is the
case.
To catch more of the sun which dispels the Northern gloom, one had to be
present at the companion
recital on Sunday afternoon. Calling on the songs which she had chosen for
her Edinburgh Festival
programme, Barbara Bonney put together a selection of brighter Scandinavian
settings, starting with a first half devoted to Grieg. This
was unrelieved sunshine, forests and lakes, all sung with lovely
simplicity by Bonney - fully deserving of Grieg's description, 'beautiful
child of spring'.
Not much variety there, though. By the second half it was time for the
darker clouds that sometimes cast a shadow over Stenhammar and Sibelius (the
latter's songs are already looking the most impressive the North has to
offer) even if Bonney was pushed to find the vocal depths for which some of
them call. Geoffrey Parsons was her admirable pianist. Incidentally, the
baritone and soprano are also husband and wife, though that was nowhere
mentioned in the programme.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Technology: Driving down a 'superhighway' / A look at US
president-elect Bill Clinton's plans for boosting technological
competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As speculation grows about US president-elect Bill Clinton's likely changes
in policy, there is one safe bet at least: the new democratic administration
will take a far more vigorous line on technology than its predecessor.
Clinton has pledged to make research and development no less than a national
priority, in line with his vision of technology as 'an engine for economic
growth'. Thus his technology policy is set to be activist, aimed at boosting
private and public spending on the development of technologies with broad
potential economic benefits.
Before the election, Clinton asserted: 'Leadership in developing and
commercialising new technologies is critical to regaining industrial
leadership, creating high-wage jobs and ensuring our long-term prosperity.'
He has cited Japan and Germany as countries to emulate.
To some, his approach signals a radical and disturbing change in Washington:
a switch to interventionist 'industrial policy' with bureaucrats 'picking
winners and losers', an idea anathema to Republicans.
Yet Clinton stresses that the primary responsibility for industrial
competitiveness lies with the private sector. He adds, however: 'It is
imperative that we recognise that government has a role in encouraging
pre-competitive technology development, encouraging dual-use (military and
commercial) technologies, supporting industry-led consortia and making the
most of technological advances.'
While there may be deep philosophical differences between the new president
and his predecessor, Clinton's approach to boosting industrial
competitiveness does appear in many ways remarkably similar to that of
President Bush.
Bush has, for instance, supported funding for Sematech, the semiconductor
industry consortium, and significantly increased funding for civilian or
dual-purpose research and development. On the campaign trail, Bush trumpeted
his support for greater co-operation between federal laboratories and
business.
But among high-technology industry executives, who have long urged more
government action to stem the declining technological leadership and
international competitiveness of US industry, Clinton is expected to give
higher priority to stimulating competitiveness than did president Bush.
The man charged with putting this policy into effect will be vice
president-elect Al Gore, a decade-long campaigner on technology and
telecommunications policy issues. Its key elements are contained in a
blueprint of Clinton's technology policy, circulated in September:
Investment in 'information superhighways', or advanced communications
networks linking research laboratories, universities, hospitals, schools,
and ultimately even homes.
Reform of federal R&amp;D programmes to focus on critical technologies such as
advanced materials, information technology and new manufacturing processes.
Reform of the National Laboratories, reassigning 10 to 20 per cent of their
Dollars 23bn (Pounds 15bn) annual budget to joint ventures with industry.
Creation of a 'world-class business environment' through changes in US tax,
trade and regulatory policies. This means making the R&amp;D tax credit
permanent, providing tax credits for investment in new equipment, and
ensuring that depreciation schedules reflect rapid technological
obsolescence. A 50 per cent tax exclusion would be provided for
entrepreneurs who make long-term investment in new businesses.
Investment in technology programmes aimed at small businesses, establishing
170 manufacturing extension centres. The budget of the National Institute of
Standards and Technology would be doubled and industry-led R&amp;D consortia
supported by matching industry funds.
Establishment of education and training programmes for a high-skill
workforce. This would include set standards and a national examination
system in core subjects, a new national apprenticeship programme, and
incentives for industry to invest in worker training.
The most ambitious, and potentially most expensive, of Clinton's proposals
is the development of advanced communications technology for information
superhighways.
Clinton aims to make this project a symbol of a national effort to regain
technological leadership, akin to the space race of the 1960s.
His proposal builds upon the existing High-Performance Computing and
Communications (HPCC) programme, a pet project of Gore, which last year won
the support of the Bush administration. HPCC already includes research to
deploy a high-speed research and education network linking universities and
government laboratories.
Clinton wants to broaden the scope of HPCC to include funding for national
networks linking schools, hospitals and libraries, which would serve as a
catalyst for commercial developments.
Such a network 'could do for the productivity of individuals at their places
of work and learning what the interstate highway of the 1950s did for the
productivity of the nation's travel and distribution system,' Clinton
predicts.
His plan to create a network of 'manufacturing extension centres' throughout
the US is designed to 'diffuse' technical knowledge and new manufacturing
techniques among small- and medium-sized businesses. Currently there are
fewer than 30 government-funded manufacturing technology centres in the US.
Clinton maintains that the US government must match the efforts of foreign
competitors such as Japan and Germany.
Critics charge that existing US manufacturing centres have not yet proved
their worth. A more fundamental question is, however, raised by the
possibility that if these manufacturing extension centres succeed in
encouraging many businesses to adopt the latest automated manufacturing
technology, many job losses will follow, which is not what the
president-elect has in mind.
Overall, Clinton proposes giving 'generic industrial technologies' a higher
priority in the federal research and development budget. Currently, the US
government spends about Dollars 76bn per year on R&amp;D of which military work
consumes about 60 per cent.
The president-elect aims to shift the balance to 50 per cent defence and 50
per cent commercial, providing about Dollars 7bn in new spending for
civilian R&amp;D programmes. Even then, the US would trail Germany and Japan in
private and public spending on non-defence R&amp;D as a percentage of gross
domestic product. 'Civilian industry, not the military, is the driving force
behind advanced technology today,' Clinton says. 'Only by strengthening our
civilian technology base can we solve the twin problems of national security
and economic competitiveness.'
A central element of Clinton's technology policy is to forge a 'new
partnership' between government and business. He plans to 'create a forum
for systematic private sector input into US government deliberations about
technology policy and competitiveness'. This represents a fundamental change
in the US, where government has traditionally been a watchdog over business
with a relationship that is frequently adversarial.
It is a measure of Clinton's success in moving toward this 'new partnership'
that he is backed by several high-technology industry leaders, among them
John Sculley, head of Apple Computer, and John Young, former chief executive
of Hewlett-Packard.
Perhaps the biggest challenge facing Gore will be to establish a central
focus for the co-ordination of technology policy, drawing together
programmes which currently span several departments and agencies.
This may involve the formation of a civilian version of the Pentagon's
Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency which has taken a controversial
leadership role in government funding for dual-use technologies over recent
years. However, such plans remain vague.
Clinton also recognises the need to seek changes in the way multiple
congressional committees authorise R&amp;D spending, 'making it nearly
impossible to set priorities among competing programmes'.
But however his ambitious plans work out, the fact that Clinton looks like
being the first president to put technological competitiveness high on the
policy agenda is alone seen by many industrialists as an important step
forward.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Technology: Satellite patrol goes on farm alert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NUALA MORAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While European and US trade negotiators fight over oilseed subsidies, EC
officials are seeking to tackle a less controversial but highly practical
problem - how to police the subsidy payments made to farmers.
At the moment, claims are monitored by officials trudging around to check
that farmers are growing what they say they are. This is a daunting task,
since the EC grows more than 12m tonnes of subsidised oilseed. The problem
is about to be compounded by the introduction of 'set-aside' schemes under
which payments will be made for land taken out of production.
But a new weapon is now being used in the struggle to catch those farmers
who might try to wriggle round the rules - the satellite. Earlier this year,
the EC set up several projects to investigate the technical feasibility of
using remote sensing by satellite to verify subsidy claims.
From 1993, farmers will be able to claim subsidies for taking 15 per cent of
their arable land out of production in a scheme set up as part of the reform
of the Common Agriculture Policy. Although the scheme is voluntary, the
terms are such that most cereal growers are expected to participate.
In the UK, the pilot projects to monitor oilseed crops and set-aside land
are being carried out by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) in
Farnborough in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food, responsible for processing UK claims.
The study involves the comparison of images of the land surface obtained by
the US Landsat and European Spot satellites with subsidy applications
received by the ministry. The NRSC receives the digitised satellite images
on computer tapes and these are fed into an image processing system which
produces the familiar satellite pictures of the ground.
Project staff at NRSC outline the fields which farmers say are set aside or
under oilseed on large-scale Ordnance Survey maps. These are then digitised
on to the NRSC's geographical information system.
A template of individual farms highlights the fields for which farmers are
claiming subsidies. The system also relates the co-ordinates of the farm to
the much larger area of the satellite image (each Landsat image covers 185
square kilometres and each Spot image 60 sq km) and overlays the template
exactly.
Bright yellow fields of oilseed rape in flower have become a familiar - and
some say jarring - sight in the UK. The satellite images are taken in the
infra-red part of the spectrum, so oilseed rape shows up as white rather
than yellow.
Set-aside land is more difficult to identify because the rules only specify
that the fields must have green cover. This could be confused with other
crops or pasture, and so interpreting the infra-red satellite images
requires trained analysts.
'There are a number of crops you can have in set-aside and the type of image
you get is a function of the time of year; for example, most cereal crops
show up as blue when they are young,' says Duncan Jenkins, project director.
The level of detail shown on the images does allow one green crop to be
distinguished from another by its structure. For example, a field of
sprouting green wheat looks different from a leafy cover such as clover.
Debbie Hindley, the project's applications specialist, says: 'We know from
the information supplied by the ministry which field we should be looking
at. To confirm that a claim is valid, we don't actually have to identify
each crop from its satellite picture.'
No one will be accused of making a fraudulent claim solely on the basis of
remote sensing. 'The aim is to throw up queries which will then be checked
on the ground,' says a ministry spokesman. But knowing that satellite checks
are possible will be a strong deterrent.

FT  19 NOV 92 / People: Sach - 'intensive care' at RBS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Derek Sach, formerly a director of 3i, has joined Royal Bank of Scotland. He
is setting up a new unit, Specialised Lending Services, to help faltering
businesses.
Unlike banks' all too active intensive care and recovery operations, aimed
at picking up the pieces of sick or dead companies, this unit is intended to
provide assistance to businesses whose problems have not yet become critical
but may deteriorate, and thus protect the bank's loans.
The idea of setting up Specialised Lending Services came from within the
Royal Bank and Sach was approached by George Mathewson, chief executive,
himself once with 3i.
Sach, now 44, spent 20 years at 3i, becoming group managing director for UK
investments. He left at the beginning of this year because, he says, he was
not wholly in agreement with 3i's proposed flotation, since postponed.
Sach says there are many more companies that may be faltering than those
actually needing intensive care. 'They may have made one acquisition too
many, or become over-exposed on property,' he says.
'By developing and using our understanding of a company's business, and
working together to achieve an early identification of future problems, we
are far more likely to be able to offer a remedy to their malaise - and
therefore ensure their survival.'
He says that in the 1981/82 recession venture capital companies provided a
similar service to that now being offered by the Royal Bank: 'Companies were
backed then which often came good later.'
The unit is absorbing the Royal Bank's intensive care and recovery
operations and will employ 300 people. Sach, who pronounces his name
'saitch', will be based in London but the unit will also operate from
Manchester and Edinburgh.

Chris Wright, 48, the chairman and founder of Chrysalis Group, has turned to
Steve Lewis to help rebuild the recording interests of his music publishing,
communications and media company.
Lewis, 39, who has one of the music industry's most successful track records
after 20 years with Virgin, will be chief executive of a new music division
which will encompass a new record company (as yet unnamed) and all the
group's record publishing activities in the UK, Europe and the US.
Chrysalis last year sold its remaining 50 per cent stake in the Chrysalis
Records joint venture with Thorn EMI for Dollars 30m in cash and Wright is
now freed from a non-competition agreement. He says: 'I have been waiting
for the right opportunity to bring in an individual who shares my vision and
philosophy. Steve Lewis is that person.'
During his five years as deputy managing director of Virgin Records, Lewis
was involved in launching artists such as Phil Collins and Simple Minds.
From 1983, he was managing director of Virgin Music Publishers. In March,
Virgin Music Group was sold to Thorn EMI for Pounds 510m.
Lewis, who will have an equity stake in the new record company, will also
retain his shareholding in the Tuchwood Label which he established with Rob
Melbourne.

FT  19 NOV 92 / People: Dalgety settles succession - picks Clothier
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dalgety has named Richard Clothier (right), a 15-year veteran of the food
group, to succeed Maurice Warren, who retires next June at the company's
standard retirement age of 60. There will be a six-month handover period;
Clothier, 47, becomes chief executive designate in January.
In his four years at the top of Dalgety, Warren has effected a fundamental
restructuring. This involved a series of disposals, including the commodity
business Gill &amp; Duffus as well as the Australian agricultural interests;
installing a younger management team; and generally winning the confidence
of the City.
Under John West, who became non-executive chairman in September, the company
searched both externally and internally for Warren's successor. Of the two
other internal candidates, one is assumed to have been Hugh Thomas, who
joined from Nestle in 1990 and is in charge of the consumer food business,
and had, at least from outside, for a while been perceived as the most
likely new boss.
The other was Paul Kirk, chief executive of Dalgety Agriculture, who joined
the board this April, as did Clothier. 'We are all the same age, but with
quite different experience and I do hope we can continue to work well
together,' says Clothier.
Clothier, who was born in Rhodesia and took a degree in agriculture at the
University of Natal, joined Dalgety Agriculture in 1977 after seven years
with the Milk Marketing Board. He has been in charge of The Pig Improvement
Company since 1988, currently the fastest growing part of the group, with
turnover doubled and profits more than tripled under his watch. But it is
Thomas's area, consumer foods, that probably offers the most growth
potential, according to Clothier.
If analysts perceive any weakness in Clothier it is that he, in common with
Warren, has no direct experience of consumer branding. 'It is quite
understandable if they do,' Clothier says philosophically, 'but we have very
strong people who do understand that sector.'
One of those is Jack Rowell, 56, who runs Golden Wonder snacks, the largest
individual business within the consumer food division, and who is now
appointed to the main board.
Meanwhile, Warren says he will not be retiring from the business and says he
has 'another appointment waiting in the wings, out of the sector' but will
not be drawn further.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Survey of Lancashire (8): Dilemmas amid the glitter / Town
profile of Blackpool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLACKPOOL, Britain's largest, brashest and, in terms of money spent, most
successful resort, is an overwhelming experience no matter what time of year
you visit.
At 10 o'clock in the morning on a grey, drizzly day in late September the
ornate ballroom in the Blackpool Tower is full of pensioners waltzing to a
thundering organ. The streets are full of shoppers. The seven live shows are
already taking bookings.
By lunchtime it is difficult to get near the bar of Yates wine bar
(champagne on draught is its proud boast).
At a time when most British seaside resorts are pulling down the shutters
for the end of the season, Blackpool remains in full swing. The famous
illuminations, which remain switched on into November, also ensure that
Blackpool has a longer season than other English resorts.
But beneath the glitter of the lights along the Golden Mile, Blackpool has
its problems.
One cloud hanging over town is the future of the British Aerospace works at
nearby Warton, where some 7,200 are employed, from various parts of
Lancashire, including Blackpool. If the European Fighter Aircraft does not
proceed, there will be severe job losses compounding an already serious
unemployment situation.
Tourism is Blackpool's most important industry. Some 15,000 people are
directly or indirectly associated with the trade or 25 per cent of the
working population. (If retailing, distribution and catering in the broad
sense of the term are included, then the figure is much higher). About 80
per cent of the working population is involved in service industries,
compared with a national average of under 70 per cent. Only 15 per cent is
involved in manufacturing compared with 24 per cent nationally.
Tourism is, however, a seasonal business which is slanted towards female
employment. Even if Blackpool has a longer season than most resorts,
unemployment is still high - more than 10 per cent overall, and in some
inner city wards unemployment among young males is more than 20 per cent.
Tourism is also a poorly paid industry. Mr Ivan Taylor, the leader of the
Labour party-controlled city council, estimates that incomes in Blackpool
are 35 per cent lower than average incomes in the south-east.
'Blackpool has survived the change from old style long-stay family holidays
very well,' Mr Taylor says. 'We have managed to extend the season with
conferences and the illuminations. We have constantly brought on new
products, such as the Pleasure Beach. There continues to be new private
investment. First Leisure, which owns the Tower is spending Pounds 13m over
two years on refurbishment and upgrading. We have been able to keep the
visitors rolling in.'
But the very success of Blackpool is at the heart of the borough council's
dilemma.
'We project the image of success in order to keep the visitors coming, but
the heavy dependence on tourism means that the government in Whitehall does
not see or accept that we have inner city problems as bad as anywhere in the
north of England. We also have infrastructural problems.' Mr Taylor feels
Blackpool should receive more help in diversifying its economy.
'On the so-called Z-score, an index drawn up by the Department of Social
Security for inner city deprivation, Blackpool came in the bottom 20 per
cent of towns in the north of England. But we are not even in the urban
programme.'
Not being in the government's programme for urban aid means that Blackpool
cannot participate in City Challenge bids for urban renewal. Furthermore,
because Blackpool no longer qualifies for British government assisted area
status, the town receives no help from the European regional development
fund (ERDF) towards infrastructure projects.
Mr Taylor says: 'Our sea defences are in need of repair. Also we have the
oldest electric tramway system in the country: together with the
illuminations, this taxes our electricity system. We need new cabling. This
would cost Pounds 6m. The borough council has not got this kind of money.'

FT  19 NOV 92 / Survey of Lancashire (6): Brain drain goes into reverse /
Review of higher education provision in the county
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REMARKABLE new industry has erupted in Lancashire in less than a
generation. It turns over more than Pounds 100m a year and has grown
continually; about half its turnover is spent locally, generating three jobs
outside for every two within the industry itself. By the end of the decade,
more than 30,000 people will be involved.
The 'industry' is higher education. Size - and the monies involved - are
more than mere indicators of economic importance: the speed of take-off says
much about previous pent-up, unsatisfied needs and markets; a big hole in
Lancashire's social and economic infrastructure was waiting to be filled.
Mr Brian Booth, an economist who is now rector of the new University of
Central Lancashire, sums up the raison d'etre of the sector: 'Lancashire and
Cumbria have long been net exporters of students. They had about
one-thirtieth of Britain's population but well under one-thirtieth of the
nation's student places. Two universities are now trying to redress the
balance.'
The other university is Lancaster, one of the 'new' ones of the early 1960s,
built on a greenfield site to the south of Lancaster itself. Central
Lancashire is 'new' in the 1990s' sense, springing from Lancashire
Polytechnic in the middle of Preston. Previously, there were no universities
in the region west of the Pennines north of Manchester and Liverpool.
Central Lancashire's origins lie in the Institution for the Diffusion of
Knowledge, founded in Preston in 1828. Although this eventually became the
Harris College in 1956, it never attained the size and status of the
regional technical colleges on which other polytechnics were founded.
When Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then education secretary, designated Preston
Polytechnic in 1973, it started with 500 students. Mr Booth says this
weakness proved the new institution's strength; it could build from scratch,
based on market need.
It has done so: there are 14,000 students now. About 8,500 are full-time
undergraduates and another 1,000 are part-timers studying for their degrees
in the evenings. Others are doing diplomas and postgraduate work.
Being in a large town like Preston has helped rapid growth, although there
have inevitably been strains. There is usually a student lodgings crisis at
the start of each academic year, for example, forcing the university to rent
Pontins holiday camp at Southport to tide people over while the situation is
sorted out.
Meanwhile, Lancaster University's growth has been no less impressive,
although it has been constrained by its island status in green fields. Mr
Colin Adams, its planning officer, says it could only grow as fast as it
could build, and many students have long used the seaside resort of
Morecambe for accommodation.
Nevertheless, Lancaster now has 6,200 students, of whom a fifth are mature,
but few part-time. The university is working closely with the local
authority to expand without overstretching local housing provision. It
expects to have 8,500 students by 1994 and 10,500 by 2001.
From a strategic economic point of view, what is going on is a form of
import substitution, with consequent benefits to Lancashire's balance of
trade in human resources.
Previously, the cream of local talent went away for higher education and
much of it never came back. At the same time, large numbers of capable
people had no means of furthering their potential if they could not get
away.
It is hard to judge the exact size of this latter market, but one indicator
is the success of an institution called the Open College of the North West.
This is jointly sponsored by the two universities and consists of all
community-level colleges in the Lancashire and Cumbria sub-region.
It enables people to do a 'year zero' at their local college, where they can
qualify for a three-year degree course at Central Lancashire or Lancaster
without having to leap the conventional GCSE 'A' level entry hurdle. It is
proving ideal for mature students, enabling them to prove they are capable
of benefiting from a university education without having to pretend they are
17-year-olds all over again. Several thousand students are now involved.
Starting from scratch has also enabled both universities to tailor faculty
structures to market demand. Central Lancashire now has five faculties:
science; design and technology; a business school; health; and cultural,
legal and social science.
Design and technology includes fashion, graphic and three-dimensional
design. It aims to use the institution's good engineering reputation to
marry design and manufacturing, producing better products that are easier
for industry to make.
Courses available at Central Lancashire range from astronomy and journalism,
to fashion design and midwifery. Its law school also has a good name. Mr
Booth believes market relevance was borne out by 30,000 applications for
3,000 first-year full-time places this year.
Lancaster's five faculties are a management school; humanities; social
science; science and engineering; and teacher education. The management
school has proved particularly successful as a bridge to industry and
commerce, with relevant undergraduate, postgraduate and management training
functions.
The school's seven departments - accounting and finance; behaviour in
organisations; economics; management learning; marketing; operational
research; and systems and information management - are in themselves
indicators of the main thrust of teaching and research.
Lancaster has strong links to British Airways, British Nuclear Fuels and
VSEL, the Barrow-in-Furness nuclear submarine builder. About 300 British
Airways managers have been involved in company-sponsored masters of business
administration (MBA) degrees or management diplomas.
There is also an MBA programme for a consortium of 10 companies, although
recession has reduced the intake to one per year of 30 students, instead of
two per year of 25 each. MBA degrees can be taken full-time or part-time,
but Lancaster also stresses the value to industry of other masters courses,
such as in accounting and finance, or operational research.
Both universities attract students nationwide; many leave the region after
graduating. Mr Booth says one of Lancashire's tasks as a community will be
to develop its economy, ensuring more job and career opportunities to keep
as many qualified people as possible.
Lancaster University is therefore working hard with small and medium-sized
companies to help them grow, thus helping the long-term potential jobs
market. Central Lancashire intends to play a significant part in Preston
Technology Centre, which is being developed near the campus in British
Aerospace's Strand Road factory as it runs down.
Mr Booth also hopes that a Fashion Design Centre, which the university is
setting up with Preston Council, will help develop a widely-based cottage
industry for graduates using personal computer-aided design and manufacture
software to sell to large clothing companies.
Meanwhile, Lancaster University is planning joint property development in
Lancaster to clear up derelict sites and bring old buildings back into use.
It hopes to build an urban equivalent of the greenfield science park
favoured by universities in 1980s, broadening the economic base of the local
community at its very heart.

PRESTON, although a traditional manufacturing town dependent on engineering
and textiles survived the l980s well. While other industrial towns in the
north of England exerienced high levels of unemployment, Preston
consistently registered a jobless number below the level for the north west
and often below the national average.
In September this year, unemployment in the Preston travel-to work-area was
11.7 per cent compared with 10.8 per cent for the north'west and 9.9 per
cent for Britain as a whole. (In the inner town, however, male unemployment
is over 20 per cent in some wards).
The reasons for the relative buoyancy was that a large industry - aerospace
 -held up well, thereby helping to support service industries, particularly
retailing.
Preston is the administrative centre for the county. Lancashire County
Council's headquarters are there; so are the crown courts and other
subregional offices of public bodies. It is also the home of Lancashire
Polytechnic which is in the process of becoming the University of Central
Lancashire.
Public administration accounts for more than 8 per cent of total full time
employment; education for a further 9 per cent. Retailing distribution is
put at 10 per cent.
In the past decade Preston, the sub-regional shopping centre for a catchment
area of 400,000, has built up its central shopping area. There is also a
thriving indoor market, and an outdoor market operating four days a week.
The town has also attracted some headquarters of banks and insurance
companies.
Mr Peter Bulmer, assistant director of planning, says: 'We estimate that of
the 2,221 jobs created at Preston Riverways, the docklands redevelopment,
810 are office based.'
Despite these successes in service industries, including tourism, the
backbone of the economy has been aerospace, where
British Aerospace has announced that by l993 its Strand Road plant is to
close down. EAP Consultants, asked by the borough council to study the
impact of the closure suggests that unemployment could rise from 11 to 17
per cent by l993. About 2,000 jobs will be shed from the original Strand
Road workforce of 4,500; a further 500 through natural wastage. Further jobs
will be lost among sub-contractors to BAe.
Even if pessimistic forecasts are not realised, Preston will still have a
job on its hands to find new employment. The strategy is to try to encourage
home grown companies and to secure the relocation of outside companies,
ideally small to medium high technology companies which will avail
themselves of the existing skills base.
Mr David Borrow, leader of Preston borough council, says: 'We need to make
sure we do not lose the highly skilled labour that we have here. We want
smaller companies because we want to avoid the branch factory mentality
where decisions to close factories are taken by distant parent companies.'
In the past a shortage of industrial land has acted as a brake on attracting
new manufacturers, but 1m sq ft of space should become available at the
Strand Road plant. A further 200 acres for industrial use have been
identified; some belong to the Commission for New Towns (CNT), which took
over from the Central Lancashire New Town Development Corporation. At about
Pounds 100,000 an acre, it is competitively priced compared with other
locations in the north west.
Preston receives aid under the urban programme and also derelict land
clearance grants, but it does not qualify for assisted area status.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Survey of Lancashire (5): Those clouded hills - Tourism
around the county
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY

<TEXT>
BLACKPOOL may be the largest tourist resort in Britain but it is not the
only visitor destination in Lancashire. Other attractions range from
heritage sites to industrial museums and markets in old manufacturing towns.
There is good walking, fishing and riding in countryside areas such as
Pendle Hill, the Ribble Valley and the Forest of Bowland - with a well known
beauty spot, the Trough of Bowland.
Lancaster has a Norman castle owned by the Queen in her capacity as the Duke
of Lancaster. (John of Gaunt, Shakespeare's 'time honoured Lancaster,' was
the first duke). There is a Benedictine priory church and a judges' lodging
house containing fine Gillow furniture. The Georgian custom house on the
quay is now the home of the maritime museum, and there are lots of Georgian
streets. The city authorities have forged a link with the nearby resort of
Morecambe to form a 'holiday corridor'. Morecambe, with grand old hotels and
attractive gardens along the sea front, offers a more genteel seaside
alternative to brash Blackpool.
All the main towns in Lancashire, as elsewhere in the old manufacturing
centres in the north of England, have turned former factories and dark, dank
mills into industrial museums. Blackburn has its Lewis textile museum;
Burnley has the Weavers Triangle visitors' centre, with displays showing the
manufacture of cotton, and the Leeds and Liverpool canal.
From any of the towns access to splendid countryside is easy, whether to the
West Pennine moors in the south of the county, the Ribble valley in the
centre, or the Forest of Bowland in the north.
But Blackpool dominates tourism in Lancashire, accounting for more than 70
per cent of all tourism destinations in the county.
The town had 16.8m holiday visits in l989, showing an expenditure of Pounds
445m. (It is estimated that this year's visits will show a decline of about
6 per cent from the 1989 mark.) Blackpool has 120,000 holiday beds - more
than in the whole of Portugal - in 3,500 hotels and guest houses. On a
typical summer's day, 1m ice creams are consumed and in high summer 25,000
vehicles a day enter Blackpool. (There are 15,000 parking spaces.)
More than half all visits come from people living in the north west region.
A further 18 per cent of visits from elsewhere in the north of England. Very
few foreign visitors go to Blackpool: it is quintessentially a British
resort.
Conversion of the old central station into a coach and car park makes the
resort ideal for coach parties; the large number of these is reflected in
the figures for day trippers: 75 per cent of all visits. (Although day
trippers spend only Pounds 100m of the total holiday expenditure). But it is
not just the geography and ease of access which account for Blackpool's
continued popularity.
Developing new attractions has helped Blackpool to extend its season.
Switched on each year by a celebrity amid great fanfare at the beginning of
September, when other resorts are beginning to close down, the illuminations
continue until November 9. They cost the local council Pounds 1.8m a year to
install and run, but it is estimated that the illuminations alone attract 8m
visits and Pounds 180m worth of tourist spending. Conferences similarly
extend the season well into the winter.
Originally opened in 1878, the Winter Gardens are now covered over. They
contain the Empress ballroom and the Opera House (claimed to be Britain's
largest theatre), along with bits and pieces of dream palaces of different
cultures. Sprawling over 4.5 acres, the Winter Gardens can thus accommodate
all kinds of conferences and meetings and
make a small profit for the borough council.
For ordinary tourists there is no end of diversion. The Pleasure beach is a
42 acre amazement park; the Tower has a circus and a ballroom as well as
shops and amusements at its base; the Golden Mile is an unbroken ribbon of
shops selling hamburgers, chips, ice creams and candyfloss, interspersed
with cabaret spots and arcades. The latest addition is the Pounds 6m Sea
Life centre, complete with shark tunnel.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Survey of Lancashire (3): A model for the modern - Ian
Hamilton Fazey examines Lancashire Enterprises, 'a business in itself'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lancashire Enterprises is now widely regarded as a successful model for
achieving regional economic development in most of Europe - except Britain.
Its Luxembourg office evaluates economic development projects for the
European Commission, giving the yea or nay for help from a Pounds 160m EC
fund. Its specialists export their know-how directly into east European
countries. Next year Khazakstan will use Lancashire expertise for a Pounds
1.2m training programme.
Projects range from establishing economic development agencies to setting up
business schools, or converting former Soviet barracks into managed
workshops.
The approach is an integrated one, involving public and private sectors
jointly in investment, property development and training. Lancashire
Enterprises has found a way of turning the process of regeneration into a
business in itself, making substantial profits for reinvestment and further
development.
The scale has more than passed the government's 2-for-1 test for backing
economic development, where at least Pounds 2 of private sector spending has
to be levered by every public Pounds 1. The first Pounds 4m of Lancashire
ratepayers' money used to launch Lancashire enterprises 10 years ago has
levered Pounds 200m of private investment.
It began in 1981, in the depths of the last recession, when Labour won
control of Lancashire county council. If Labour was riven nationally at the
time by a leftward lurch, the party in Lancashire was firmly in moderate
hands.
Mrs Louise Ellman, the pragmatic leader, knew the private sector was
suspicious of Labour but was sure that public and private sector had to be
partners.
There was also an eminence grise: Mr Jim Mason, a former chairman of the
Co-operative Wholesale Society, deputy chairman of the Co-operative Bank,
and once the chairman of Warrington New Town Development Corporation.
The first Thatcher government sacked him from this last appointment. It was
nothing personal, Mr Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary,
explained. Mr Mason's skills were admired - but he was a Labour supporter,
and all Labour-appointed holders of similar public jobs had to go.
Mrs Ellman says: 'We were faced with recession, economic decline and
unemployment. We decided to try and construct a new type of economic
initiative which would involve the private sector and help build their
confidence to work with us.'
The exact formula was worked out by Mr Len Collinson, chairman of Collinson
Grant, a Manchester management consultancy.
The mechanism was simple: take the product of a 2p rate - which councils
were then allowed to spend locally on anything they wished - and use this as
capital to fund a company which would take over Lancashire's economic
development functions. The deal was a good one for Lancashire's ratepayers;
the money - all Pounds 4m of it - did not disappear as non-returnable
grants, but was capitalised and put to work.
For all his left-of-centre credentials, Mr Mason's views were
capitalistically correct. 'Where we were unique compared with all other
regeneration agencies at the time is that we went into property. My
experience at the CWS had taught me to borrow only against tangible assets.
There was lot of bricks and mortar around.'
Here was a coincidence of needs and interests. Mr Mike Hynes, now managing
director, says: 'We had a shortage of places for small and medium-sized
businesses, but we had a lot of old mill buildings.'
These were too well-built to knock down, but in need of too much work to
appeal to private sector property developers who had more profitable fish to
fry in southern markets. The new agency, with Mr Mason as chairman and Mrs
Ellman as his deputy, took the job on, carefully investing and nurturing
unused capital while doing so. The council topped up resources as needed.
The approach attracted cross-party support and private sector partners both
on the agency's board and in projects. An early test was the decision of
Turner and Newall to shut down in Lancaster, where the company occupied a
15-acre site in the town centre.
Lancashire Enterprises bought it for Pounds 9m. Nine years on, the site now
houses 120 companies employing 850 - 250 more than when Turner and Newall
left - and has achieved a 9 per cent return on the Pounds 13m used to
develop it. Lancashire Enterprises put in about half and got most of the
rest from the European Investment Bank.
Other big projects have included the redevelopment of large sections of
Leeds-Liverpool canal, a derelict relic predating even the industrial
revolution; Eanam Wharf, a rundown canalside part of central Blackburn; the
redevelopment of Hardman's Mill at Rawtenstall; and a systematic training
programme to improve the skills of the old British Leyland workforce at
Leyland, so that they and their factory could successfully transfer to Volvo
bus manufacture.
Lancashire Enterprises also set up venture and development capital funds to
finance new and growing businesses in the county and established a network
of 'hands-on' help to improve survival rates.
It now has two offices in Brussels, as well as the one in Luxembourg. Grants
and work have been the reward.
The ultimate test, however, came when the government forced all local
authorities to stop trading activities. Lancashire Enterprises, although at
arm's length from the county council, fell foul of the legislation and was
forced to privatise itself by going public.
Lancashire Enterprises itself now employs 230 people, compared with six when
it started. It is a profitable and successful property owner.
The question is why Lancashire Enterprises is without much national honour
in Britain, when it is so well-regarded elsewhere in Europe.
The answer has to be political. Capitalistic and profitable as it has been
in practice, it is the child of a Labour administration. It is
interventionist and its directors and managers believe in economic planning,
at least at regional level. This was anathema to government in the Thatcher
decade.
But it works, encouraging private sector investment, reclaiming derelict
land, bringing seemingly dead buildings back to life, and making money while
doing so.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Survey of Lancashire (4): Each town has decided to beat its
individual drum - Strategies to attract inward investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT A time when local authorities and regional development bodies throughout
the UK and Europe are seeking to attract inward investment, the approach in
Lancashire is worth noting. What is possibly a little odd about the
Lancashire towns is that they are individually setting out their stalls.
Lancaster's decision to beat its own drum is perhaps not so strange. It is
isolated from the other towns and has a different economic structure. The
city has benefited from the expansion of the port of Heysham, where British
Gas's 20-acre purpose built operations base for the Morecambe Bay gas field
is located. But Lancaster has also developed a strong service sector.
The three towns of Preston, Blackburn and Burnley are close together
physically. Preston is the largest, with a population of 120,000, but the
two other towns have catchment populations of more than 100,000. The three
have similar economic structures: traditional industrial centres, where in
spite of some diversification there remains a heavy dependence on
manufacturing.
In this belt of towns along the M65, employment in manufacturing accounts
for over 40 per cent of all employment. Moreover, they now face similar
problems with the possible rundown of defence industries. Would it not make
better sense to pool resources to attract new investment?
Mrs Louise Ellman, leader of the Lancashire County Council, says: 'There is
little rivalry between the county and the district councils. We all realise
we are part of the same problem - we are facing a potential problem with the
rundown of defence industries. There could be 21,000 jobs lost from
aerospace alone.'
Mr David Borrow, the leader of the Preston borough council, areas says:
'There is little rivalry between the councils. We would rather a new company
came to Preston rather than Blackburn, but we are all close, so any new
investment to the region is welcome.'
Mr Peter Greenwood, the leader of the Blackburn borough council district
says: 'Rivalry is the wrong word. We all talk together. The county council
does a good job. But the district councils should concern themselves with
the individual needs of the areas.'
Mr Kenneth McGeorge, leader of the Burnley borough council, points that in
discussing the towns like of Blackburn, Burnley and Preston are parts of
overlapping travel-to-work areas. He says: 'People come to work here in
Burnley from Blackpool and Lancaster. We also have people commuting out to
work in Preston and Warton. Any new company benefits us all.'
Mr Stanley Henig, leader of the Lancaster city council, sums up: 'You need
both. You need a regional organisation which is going to take a strategic
overview. But the individual towns and councils must involve themselves in
economic development. Only they know what the local needs are in terms of
economic structure. One problem has been dissatisfaction with regional
organisations in the past. But the county council does well it has the
resources to promote economic development.'
If there is little disagreement that both the county and the boroughs should
involve themselves in economic development, there is a sharp divergence of
views about the reform of local government. Both Blackburn and Burnley would
like to be unitary authorities if the offer should come when the local
government commission reports next July.
Mr David Borrow in Preston feels no pressure to become a single tier of
local government. Mr Henig in Lancaster says his council is broadly in
favour of a single tier of local government; the city would probably opt for
unitary status if it were offered, but he adds:
'The worst of all possible worlds would be if some of the boroughs were
offered unitary status but not others. This would leave an enfeebled county
council with fewer resources and less power to deal a very large area. That
would be a real botch.'

FT  19 NOV 92 / Survey of Lancashire (1): Waiting and worrying - Lancashire
faces an economic reconstruction during the 1990s. Previously cushioned by
its defence industries, now threatened by the new world order, its prospects
depend crucially on the EFA
</HEADLINE>

ACCORDING to Ms Gillian Beeley, Lancashire is one of Britain's great
secrets. About 43 per cent of the workforce is in manufacturing, most of it
high technology. The worry at present is of the secret being carried to an
early grave.
It is not so much the recession, but the end of the cold war, for much of
the industry is in the defence sector, and most of that is aerospace,
accounting for 21,000 jobs and 34 per cent of the county's manufacturing
output. No other county in Britain has more jobs in the aerospace industry.
Lancashire has one-eighth of the national total.
It does not stop there. Mechanical and electrical engineering between them
account for another 15 per cent of output, rubber and plastics another 5 per
cent. These sectors depend heavily on aerospace for work, making 54 per cent
of the local economy vulnerable in some way to the international recession
and changes being wrought by the new world order.
Just how things have changed from the county's traditional image is shown by
only 6 per cent of output now coming from textiles. Footwear and cloth,
another traditional Lancashire sector, produces only 4 per cent now.
Chemicals, food and drink, paper and publishing, are all bigger industries.
Past official secrecy and geography help explain why Lancashire's transition
to a place at the leading edge of technology has remained relatively unsung.
The county is on the periphery of England, with many communities dotted
about the hills, dales and moors of the western Pennines. This made it
difficult either to reach or bomb in the second world war, but comparative
remoteness has also limited national perceptions today.
As Ms Beeley, deputy director of East Lancashire chamber of commerce, points
out, few appreciate that the letter B in the RB211 jet engine stands for
Barnoldswick, the small town between Pendle Hill and the Yorkshire Dales
where Rolls Royce has one of its most advanced factories.
Today, the future of the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) - a joint venture
between Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain - dominates Lancashire's
prospects. Germany has left EFA out of next year's national defence budget
and its future is in doubt as the other partners look at ways to trim costs
and manage on their own.
The second prototype sits in a hangar at Warton aerodrome near Blackpool.
The first is in Germany and is supposed to fly first. The Lancashire
aircraft has been towed out and has revved up its twin Rolls Royce EFA EJ200
engines on local television, as though challenging the reluctant Germans to
take off.
Lancashire needs EFA to carry on where production of the war-proven Tornado
will leave off. There are worries about the latter, too, with an order from
Saudi Arabia awaited, but EFA is Lancashire's future.
Mr Michael Hynes, managing director of Lancashire Enterprises says as many
as 40,000 local jobs probably hinge on it. 'Many companies have already
tooled up for EFA sub-contract work,' he says. 'They had to invest well in
advance to be sure of the work. They cannot just switch to something else.'
Lancashire Enterprises, which was set up 10 years ago as the economic
development arm of Lancashire County Council, is now an independent regional
agency, having privatised itself by flotation when the government stopped
local authorities from trading.
It cut its teeth on large local casualties of the 1980-82 recession, such as
the withdrawal of Turner and Newall (now the T&amp;N group) from the centre of
Lancaster, the collapse of the Fleetwood fishing industry, and decimation of
the footwear, leather and textiles industries in the Rossendale Valley.
Mr Jim Mason, Lancashire Enterprises' chairman, says: 'We are in the
unemployment business. We know a lot about it; how to avoid it, how to fight
it. The Lancashire economy will be devastated if EFA stops. From our very
extensive experience of this sort of work, we can't see it being possible to
regenerate the regional economy for at least a decade if EFA goes down.' Ms
Beeley says: 'It's jobs lost, rather than unemployment, that matters,
because of difficulties in ever being able to re-employ or re-use skills
that go with the jobs concerned. We are talking of 3,000 in Blackburn, 2,200
in Burnley and 2,000 in Pendle.'
Even if it were possible for people to move, the scale of exodus from these
small towns would cause domestic property markets to collapse, leaving
widespread dereliction and local economies ruined. In any event, national
recession inhibits mobility. The large numbers involved are also their own
argument against solving the problem by inward investment or trying to grow
small businesses to fill the gap.
In spite of these threats, much of Lancashire's industry and commerce has
weathered recession. Mr Jim McKinstry, director of the East Lancashire
chamber, says some companies in export markets such as carpet-making
machinery, have been 'laughing all the way to the bank.'
A survey last month of 300 companies in the county by Latham Crossley and
Davis, a leading indigenous Lancashire firm of accountants based in the new
town of Chorley, showed 80 per cent confident of upturn within nine months.
Three-quarters believe north-west England as a whole would be better placed
than the south-east to take advantage of recovery when it happens.
The names of some of the companies located in Lancashire give a clue to the
county's success in resisting recession: ICI chemicals and polymers at
Fleetwood, Baxi, the gas fires and central heating boiler manufacturer at
Preston, Crown Eyeglass, the spectacles manufacturer at Blackburn, where the
Scapa Group of specialist-niche engineering companies is also based.
Defence spending has also cushioned Lancashire, just as cutbacks threaten it
now. The role of giants such as British Aerospace and Rolls Royce is obvious
but more than 50 other substantial, highly skilled businesses are part of a
widespread, interdependent, intertrading network.
This base of sound, well-run companies did well for the county in the latter
half of the 1980s, when unemployment in the Clitheroe travel-to-work area
fell at one stage to 3 per cent - or full employment, for all practical
purposes.
Recession has bitten, but in some places the effect has yet to show much in
the statistics. Clitheroe's jobless rate had risen to 4.9 per cent by the
time Britain left the ERM in September but Burnley's, at 8.8 per cent was
only 0.4 percentage points worse than in July 1989.
Lancashire as a county reported 8.6 per cent unemployment in September,
compared with 10.8 per cent for north-west England and 9.9 per cent for
Britain as a whole.
This has produced an interesting reversal of previous north-south divide
conventions. 'Everyone is checking up very carefully on whom they do
business with because of the risk of giving credit to someone who is put
into liquidation before they can pay you,' Mr McKinstry says.
'The majority of the companies most at risk these days are in the
south-east. You have to be very careful about accepting non-cash customers
from that part of the country,' he adds.
This is no cause for complacency. Whether or not EFA survives, Lancashire
has too many eggs in one basket; long term, it must spread its risks. Better
infrastructure is seen as crucial.
Improved roads have cut the journey to Manchester to half an hour. Mr
McKinstry says extension of the M65 across the moors to Leeds would open
high technology skills to West Yorkshire's diverse opportunities and improve
access to the Humber ports.
He also echoes a widening northern view: the channel tunnel will be
irrelevant to most northern businesses; Mr McKinstry believes they would do
better from an improved west coast main railway line and a second runway at
Manchester Airport.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Soft soap and high
drama - Mass-appeal TV programmes which sell a wide range of consumer goods
and services as part of the story line are big business in Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The attractive young woman walks along the road, hips swaying provocatively
and a boutique bag swinging from her shoulder. Stopping at a bar, she sits
down and takes out a shoe box.
Suddenly Reginaldo, her punk haired would-be paramour, appears as she opens
the box and removes a sports shoe. Caressing it lovingly, he places it on
Yasmin's foot.
After a tantalising few seconds she flounces away leaving Reginaldo holding
one of the shoes which he takes to his room, kisses, and holds up to Ze, his
pet skeleton. Dancing round the room with the shoe, he finally places it on
his bedside table next to Yasmin's photo.
The scene is from De Corpo e Alma, Brazil's top soap opera which draws a
50m-plus audience six nights a week. To the innocent viewer it all seems
part of the story of Reginaldo's obsession with Yasmin. But by the end of
the 90-second sequence, the camera has focused seven times on the Azaleia
label and the shoe company can expect an instant increase in sales.
For what the viewer has just experienced is a lucrative spot of
merchandising - the Azaleia shoe company cashing in on the Brazilian
national obsession with novelas or soap operas. TV Globo, Brazil's main
channel, claims that seven out of 10 televisions are switched on to the
novelas which make up two-thirds of programming between 6pm and 10pm.
And so powerful is the force of novelas in promoting new trends that Marcos
Grahl, media planning director at Standard, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, says: 'If a
star of a popular series appears with her hair dyed red, you can bet you'll
suddenly see a whole lot of dyed redheads in the street.'
Boutiques frequently report selling out of particular lines the day after
they are worn in a novela and, currently, male strip clubs are springing up
everywhere because of the prominent role of one such Clube das Mulheres in
De Corpo e Alma.
Ingrid Buzkman from the Contemporaneo advertising agency recently used the
Doce do Amor soap opera to launch a new range of Triumph lingerie and has no
doubt of the medium's pull: 'It's fantastic. You have an enormous audience
and you're speaking to your consumer when he's absorbing 100 per cent and is
not unresponsive as he would be during a normal commercial slot.'
Banned in many countries - though used increasingly in the US film industry
 -perhaps nowhere is merchandising used as blatantly as in Brazilian soaps.
Conversations take place over bottles of Antarctica beer, business deals are
struck in Itau bank, dinner parties use Santa Marina glassware. Jeans,
watches, fridges, even underwear, are all making appearances, sponsored by
their makers. In last week's episodes of De Corpo e Alma eagle-eyed viewers
could spot the camera zoom in on Renner paint as young Junior watched his
room being redecorated, admiring the colour at some length, or catch his
father using his Itau credit card in a toy store, lingering over the trade
name.
Merchandising is used so extensively that the Brazilian advertising industry
defines it jokingly as 'advertising which sometimes has a novela in the
middle'.
TV Globo has been selling merchandising spots for the last 15 years and now
has a 120-member support department largely for this purpose. Its director,
Jorge Adib, is a staunch defender: 'Merchandising exists because of the need
to give authenticity to a novela. Novelas focus on the day-to-day lives of
people - they travel by car, they drink beer, they catch flights, they check
the time, so we need real cars, beer, planes and watches. As good
capitalists, we use the products of those who pay.'
TV Globo's only rule is that it will not allow merchandising of cigarettes,
drugs or hard drink, nor anything of a dubious nature. Each series can
feature only one bank and one brand of beer and no product can appear more
than eight times.
A bank will appear roughly every 20 episodes. Merchandisers pay about the
same per product appearance as they would for a commercial spot at that time
 -an average Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 19,800).
According to Adib, the company aims to cover a third of the production costs
of each soap-opera through merchandising, which averages Dollars 33,000 in
revenue per episode and around Dollars 20m a year.
He has no doubt about the pull: 'It's a very powerful vehicle because you're
not obviously promoting a product, but rather creating the sympathy of the
viewer for it.'
Washington Olivetto, who runs the creative agency, W/Brasil, agrees. 'If
well used, merchandising can be very effective. A couple kissing in front of
a bank might just irritate a consumer but a man dreaming of owning a brand
new Volkswagen seems like part of the story. It needs to appear as reality.'
To achieve the natural touch, as soon as Adib's team receives the synopsis
of a new novela, it starts focusing on 'sales opportunities'.
'We don't change or destroy characters or interfere with the story line, but
we may alter a character's trajectory,' Adib says.
'Say for example that the writer has a scene involving an English journalist
going to interview a businessman. We might suggest to the author that the
journalist uses a Bic pen and, if he or she agrees, then whenever this
character does an interview the same pen will be used. Then we might choose
a Ford car for the journalist to travel in and may even suggest stops on the
way to the interview to buy shoes,' he says.
Once this has been cleared with the writer and the artiste, both of whom
will receive a bonus, Adib approaches his clients to suggest the
appearances. Unlike normal advertising, the client cannot see the clip
before it goes out.
In some cases the product even becomes part of the story. In this year's
hit, Pedra sobre Pedra, the main character, Jorge Tadeu, is a denim-clad
photographer with whom all the women in the village fall in love. After his
death, the women remember him every time they sees a pair of his trademark
Onix jeans.
Another case this year where merchandise became integral to the story was
the policeman in Perigosas Peruas who was almost stripped of his commission
after modelling Y-fronts on billboards around the city.
Soap operas are frequently used to launch products or to change the image of
a well-established product. Itau bank has been appearing in Globo novelas
for 10 years as part of a long-term campaign to change its sober image and
appeal more to the younger and less monied classes.
And Melissa plastic sandals, which are now the rage in trendy Copacabana and
Ipanema, were mostly only bought by poor slum dwellers until they started
appearing on the feet of sophisticated soap opera characters five years ago.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising: Going underground is
just the ticket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Travellers on London's underground railway have long been accustomed to
whiling away spare moments by studying the highly inventive and often
attractive posters and artwork which line the stations and trains.
From today the 2m passengers a day who use the Tube have something else to
study - the backs of their tickets. London Transport Advertising has reached
agreement with Mercury Communications - tussling hard with BT for the ears
of the telephone-using public - to carry Mercury ads on the back of Tube
tickets.
Mercury is spending Pounds 2m on a television, poster and back-of-ticket
campaign to spread its message. The slogan will appear on 20m daily and
one-day travel card tickets. The message - 'I must remember that Mercurycard
Phones take credit cards' - is aimed at reinforcing the growing trend of
using ordinary credit cards to make telephone calls.
LTA acts for London Transport, which runs London's buses and underground,
and carries 11,000 different advertising campaigns, from the mammoth to the
tiny, at any one time. LTA's turnover from selling advertising space is
Pounds 28m annually, which, after costs, is ploughed back into LT.
In recent years the Tube, the first stretches of which were constructed in
the 1860s, has been showing signs of its age. But its ingrained dirt has
been enlivened by wonderful poster representations of paintings as well as
mini-posters of some of the best poetry in English, the brainchild of a New
York emigre, Judith Chernaik, who badgered London Transport into the scheme.
But the Tube is also home to some of the most creative outdoor advertising.
Unlike most other outdoor poster sites, rapidly passed by and swiftly
forgotten, underground passengers often have little to do but wait for their
train and gaze around, giving copywriters and graphic artists the almost
perfect, cross-class and multicultural captive audience.
Not that anything goes. Tube adverts are subject to close scrutiny by LT. In
September 1988 it declined to carry posters for Martin Scorsese's film, The
Last Temptation of Christ. In June it rejected one on behalf of the English
Shakespeare Company, featuring a 1514 drawing by the German artist, Hans
Baldung Grien, of (naked) witches from Macbeth. In July a poster
commissioned by the Barbican art gallery from cartoonist Ralph Steadman, who
has a dramatically violent style, was turned down. But the Mercury ads, both
on the tickets and in every carriage, are likely to offend no-one, perhaps
alarming only BT.
London Transport says that though Mercury's back-of-ticket advertising
scheme is a first, other advertisers are beginning to form a queue. Indeed,
according to Brian Robinson, managing director of LTA, back-of-ticket
advertising could offer advertisers a highly targeted opportunity, with
corner shop businesses potentially able to buy space on the back of tickets
sold from a single station.
But as ill-luck would have it, Mercury's campaign looks like it will
coincide with one of the Tube's most serious industrial protests for several
years. Tube staff are threatening an all-out strike next week against
planned redundancies. What chance a refund?

FT  19 NOV 92 / Accountancy Column: Act of charity brings audit day of
reckoning - Andrew Jack explains why non-profit organisations have to take
financial reporting more seriously
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH CHARITIES may soon be forced to drop their collecting tins and
cheque books and turn instead to their computer spreadsheets as a whirlwind
of change forces them to take financial reporting seriously.
After years of neglect, a substantial cultural shift and a series of new
guidelines and legislation are rapidly bringing accounting matters in the
sector to the fore. Moral suasion is being replaced with tougher demands for
compliance.
The next few months should bring considerable reform. Most important are
several regulations to supplement the 1992 Charities Act, specifying how
charities present and audit their accounts, and an up-dated version of SORP
2, the statement of recommended practice for charity accounts.
The Charities Commission is expected to issue a consultation document
up-dating SORP 2 by the end of January. The Home Office will be releasing
details of several statutory instruments by early next summer to cover the
elements to be contained in accounts; the content and format of reports; and
the duties of auditors.
By next September, there should be requirements in place on what accounts
will contain. All charities with annual income in the current or previous
two years above Pounds 100,000 will require annual scrutiny by a
professional auditor, and those with income above Pounds 1,000 by an
'independent examiner'. All will also be required to file accounts each
year.
The current pace of reform is not limited to Britain. Last month the
Financial Accounting Standards Board in the US issued a consultative
document on financial statements for not-for-profit organisations as part of
a wider programme of sector reform.
There is undoubtedly a need for greater attention to responsible financial
management and accountability. Charities have substantial tax privileges.
They rely on contributions made in good faith by the public or government.
They are also big business. Estimates suggest there may be 300,000 or more
total charities, with annual income of at least Pounds 16bn.
Yet observers do not need to look very far to see the extent of existing
neglect. Last year there were nearly 135,000 principal charities registered
with the Charity Commission. The proportion of these that got as far as
submitting accounts was just 11 per cent in 1989.
Thanks to computerisation and greater efforts to chase up delinquents, that
figure has risen substantially and the commission is confident it can
collect more than 80 per cent of accounts by 1994. Yet last year it still
remained at only 46 per cent.
There is little guarantee of the quality of financial information even among
those charities which do file accounts. In 1988, the Accounting Standards
Committee issued SORP 2. But the guidelines are entirely voluntary. They
have also been criticised for being too flexible.
There is also little data on the extent of compliance with SORP 2. But one
barometer of the quality of information is this week's charity annual report
and accounts award sponsored by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales, the Charities Aid Foundation and the Charity Forum.
This year there were only about 330 entries, down from a peak in one year of
500. The judges believe charities may have been put off by details in the
application form showing elementary mistakes made in the past. But a good
number of submissions still suffer the same faults, including points as
basic as no accounts attached or the balance sheet being unsigned and
undated, let alone failure to comply with SORP 2.
That said, Sir Christopher Collett, chairman of the judges, believes there
has been a marked improvement in the quality of charity accounts in the last
few years. There has also been a great rise in interest in the subject.
Mr Adrian Randall, finance director at the Cancer Research Campaign and
another judge, says: 'There has been tremendous improvement in the last two
years. Charities are waking up to the fact that we are publicly
accountable.'
Given the diversity of the sector, it is difficult to generalise. Many
thousands of charities are limited liability companies, registered with
Companies House and obliged to file annual accounts. Many of the larger
organisations are already externally audited, and show a high degree of
compliance with SORP 2. For smaller charities, the pattern is more
disappointing.
There is understandable caution about what they want to reveal. Mr Peter
Scott, an accountant and financial publisher compiling a directory of
charity accounts, says: 'While companies have a tendency to enhance their
figures, charities wear the most poverty-stricken clothes possible and tuck
away income for fear that contributions will dry up.'
Being too explicit about income could bring a lack of sympathy, since donors
tend to contribute when they believe a charity is in financial difficulty.
It might also give rival charities ideas on potential new donors.
Mr Scott says charities very often write off all expenditure immediately.
They try to avoid passing money through income and expenditure. There is
little indication of how much of their funding is tied or committed. They
also provide scanty information on the value of their assets.
He would like to see improvements in the information provided in these
areas. He also believes that SORP 2 allows too many alternative methods of
treatment and needs to be made more rigidly applicable.
A paper submitted by a group of researchers to the Charity Commissioners
argues that SORP 2 should be revised to reflect factors such as greater
information on charities' sources of income; expenditure by areas of
activity; and details of costs. It calls for clarification of which
subsidiaries or related organisations should be consolidated, and much more
on the valuation of assets.
But Scott - like many charity accountants - is also conscious of the dangers
of drawing comparisons based on the accounts. Focusing on overheads and
administration expenses can give rise to unfounded criticism, for example.
The charity accounts award highlights one such instance. One winner,
Community Network, showed administration expenses as 90 per cent of income.
There was little explanation of these expenses, which might appear very
high. In fact, one of the Network's principal activities is telephone
counselling, and the telephone bill accounts for most of these costs.
The figures will vary widely - and justifiably - between a wide range of
different sorts of charities, from fund-raisers to those carrying out their
own activities, and from those reliant on volunteers to those staffed by
highly-qualified professionals.
Mr Pesh Framjee, senior consultant in the charity unit at accountants BDO
Binder Hamlyn, argues that accounts tend to focus on inputs and are far less
valuable in assessing outcomes. He says there is a need to look at other,
more qualitative criteria which could be included in the trustees' reports
to accompany charity accounts.
He proffers a rather heretical view of his profession. 'Accountants think
accounts are the be-all and end-all. But charities have no bottom line or
earnings figures. The numbers do not measure their effectiveness.'

FT  19 NOV 92 / Political Notebook: When innocence is not enough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government was guilty. John Major is innocent. Such was the judgment
offered by a former member of the Thatcher government on the Iraq arms trade
saga. As the story unfolds, it looks as good an assessment as any of the
state of play so far of what Mr Alan Clark refers to as the 'actualite'.
The charge of government guilt was not meant to imply a great conspiracy to
arm Saddam Hussein. For all the talk of a smoking gun, nothing has emerged
so far to suggest that ministers and their officials conspired from their
smoke-filled Whitehall offices to help build the Iraqi war machine.
We now know, for example, that officials agonised before granting an export
licence for four, yes four, shotguns destined for Baghdad. Many other
borderline requests were turned down.
But Downing Street has as much as admitted that the documents now in the
hands of the media demonstrate that overall the government's behaviour in
private was not consistent with its public stance.
After the ceasefire which ended the Iran-Iraq war in 1988, the guidelines
restricting defence-related sales were relaxed, in effect allowing the
export of more 'dual-use' equipment. Clever civil servants drafted
parliamentary replies which encompassed this shift but which effectively
concealed it from MPs. The government insists now the rules were
're-interpreted' rather than changed. But nine months ago it admitted to the
Commons trade and industry committee that one clause in the guidelines had
been replaced.
This all leaves enormous scope for semantic arguments when Lord Justice
Scott's inquiry gets under way. We can expect all sides to consult their
dictionaries to determine what constitutes a change of policy and what can
be more reasonably described as a re-interpretation.
The debate will be important because in the last resort the affair will
damage the government only if it is proved that ministers consciously misled
parliament over the guidelines.
Ordinary people may judge that the most important issue is whether companies
or politicians broke the law. Or whether ministers would have happily
allowed three directors of Matrix Churchill to go to jail to avoid the
release of some embarrassing papers.
But such are the peculiar values of Westminster that more often than not
politicians are punished not for the act of wrong-doing but for attempting
to conceal it from the Commons.
Some of his erstwhile colleagues hope that Mr Clark - at the centre of the
web in his roles as a trade minister and then a defence minister - will be
'fall guy'.
But there is also considerable anxiety in Whitehall about the police
investigation into Mr Clark's apparently conflicting statements. If there
are skeletons to be found - and it is clear that Matrix Churchill was far
from alone in supplying controversial equipment - Mr Clark knows which
cupboards to open.
That leads to Mr Major's role. So far there is no evidence that during his
brief sojourn as foreign secretary or during his longer spell as chancellor
Mr Major had anything that could be called a significant role in the
discussions over trade with Iraq.
But both Mr John Smith and Mr Paddy Ashdown judge that his failure in
subsequent exchanges to acknowledge that the guidelines were relaxed in 1988
leaves him vulnerable to charges of abetting a Whitehall 'cover-up'.
The opposition leaders want to harry Mr Major into making mistakes. They
want to implant also the notion that the only excuse he can offer for not
knowing the full story is incompetence. If it not a question of guilt, the
opposition argument runs, then it is one of competence.
Mr Major is taking the row seriously. He spent much of the weekend in 10
Downing Street poring over the files to confirm his recollection that he was
not implicated. Sir Robin Butler, his cabinet secretary, was relaxed enough
to go off to watch the South African rugby team. The prime minister thought
it more important to draft a detailed rebuttal of Labour charges.
But he must be careful. His obvious irritation at what he regards as
scurrilous accusations may provoke mistakes. Last week he blamed Mr Clark
for misleading him. This week he issued a blanket assertion that past
ministers had not misled parliament. It is difficult to square the two. Mr
Major has to demonstrate that he is competent as well as innocent.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour defends publication of list
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR LAST night defended its publication of a list of companies
'implicated' in the supply of defence-related equipment to Iraq, saying its
principal purpose was to indicate to Lord Justice Scott some of the ground
that could be covered in his inquiry.
Mr George Foulkes, a shadow defence spokesman, said Labour's intention was
not to criticise the companies individually or collectively.
'It is not meant to be a criticism of the companies but an indication of the
extent to which they were being actively encouraged to trade with Iraq,' he
said.
He said Labour had gone out of its way to be 'as rigorous as possible' in
its checking of the information used. He had decided not to release the list
at a press conference partly so as not to play it up.
The list of 36 companies was compiled from various sources, including local
and national press cuttings, anonymous informants and a selection of the
previously restricted documents released in the Matrix Churchill trial.
Many of those named have been featured in past articles about British trade
with Iraq published by the Financial Times and other newspapers.
Prior to the publication of the Labour list, a preliminary one was shown to
an independent defence expert who had weeded out a number of names.
The list was published as 57 Tory MPs signed an early-day motion accusing
Labour of resorting to smears in recent attacks on ministers.
The motion read: 'That this house recalls that the Labour leadership
shabbily and without foundation accused the prime minister of misconduct
over the BCCI issue, for which they never apologised and their allegations
were subsequently proved to be untrue by Lord Justice Bingham; notes that
the Labour leadership has again resorted to smears in the case of Matrix
Churchill and feels sure that the prime minister will again be vindicated;
and invites all parties to submit evidence to the inquiry by Lord Justice
Scott and then to await the outcome.'

FT  19 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Cabinet finalises summit agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR began finalising details of the agenda for next month's
European Community summit in Edinburgh with cabinet colleagues yesterday
before touring EC countries to win allies next week.
The prime minister, who chaired a meeting of virtually the entire cabinet,
is expected to begin consulting with other European leaders on Monday over
an ambitious agenda that Downing Street said would be dominated by the UK's
priorities for the EC. But it is likely to provoke fresh rows among the
community's members.
Dispute is expected over the future financing of the EC. Mr Major believes
he can win backing from Germany and France for his opposition to proposals
for increases put forward by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission
president.
The task of finding a package of changes to the Maastricht treaty to satisfy
Danes will also dominate the Edinburgh summit.
Britain, meanwhile, wants a clearer definition of subsidiarity - the
principle of decisions being taken at the lowest appropriate level.
Downing Street expressed confidence that headway would be made at Edinburgh
but appeared keen not to raise expectations.
Officials indicated that Britain does not want discussion at Edinburgh of
how economic policies could be co-ordinated to boost growth. They said that
the best way to help job creation would be a deal on in negotiations on the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Others items on the agenda will include the enlargement of the EC and the
completion of the European single market.
The Netherlands has been pencilled in as Mr Major's first destination. He is
expected to visit all other EC countries over the next few weeks.
Although Mr Major realises he faces an uphill task in reaching deals at
Edinburgh, officials at Downing Street stressed that such a tour was usually
organised by the country holding the EC presidency.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont leads Tories' retreat from
pay policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday appeared to draw further back from the idea of a
national pay policy as Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, insisted that the
1.5 per cent pay limit in the public sector was necessary, but failed to
repeat ministerial encouragement to the private sector to follow suit.
Opening the two-day Commons debate on last week's Autumn Statement, Mr
Lamont emphasised the critical role of a tight control on public spending in
restoring economic confidence and hastening recovery.
The need to protect capital programmes and invest in education and health
had made it essential to adopt 'a firm stance' on public-sector pay in order
to control public spending without restraining the growth of services.
Instead of echoing Mr John Major's urging of similar pay restraint in
industry and business on Monday, however, Mr Lamont contrasted the public
and private sectors, pointing out that many private-sector employees had had
pay cuts and that settlements were at a 25-year low.
The earlier invitation to pay restraint in the private sector drew a sharp
attack from a former Tory cabinet minister. Mr John Biffen criticised the
government for 'wheeling out the wayside pulpit', and said that if wealth
creation meant anything, it meant 'rewards for success'.
While Mr Lamont repeated the exhortation to business to take advantage of
the Autumn Statement measures for sectors such as the housing and motor
industries, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, warned that such moves
were costly and would not yield the expected benefits. They did not measure
up to the scale of the task.
He pointed out that the proposals made by the chancellor were of a scale the
Tories had derided when Labour had made similar suggestions before the
election as part of a national recovery programme.
Under pressure from Tory backbenchers and from Mr Lamont to explain how he
would finance the extra measures he thought necessary, Mr Brown said that
one possibility was a tax on the utilities.
But his central argument was that people would not have the confidence to
begin spending and investing until the fear of unemployment had receded, and
so an employment policy was a vital element in government efforts to assist
recovery, which even Tories now seemed to accept was necessary.
The government itself was now 'an obstacle to recovery', he added, because
people had no knowledge from week to week of its policy, and no faith that
it would keep to it.
Running through the economic 'experimentation' of the 1980s, Mr Brown mocked
the government's economic policy now as simply being based on Mr Lamont's
judgment. 'Every day is judgment day - Norman's wisdom,' he said.
Like Mr Brown, Mr Alan Beith, for the Liberal Democrats, complained that the
chancellor, having accepted the case for fiscal stimulus, had not done the
job properly.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Inner cities suffer from the drive for cuts: Paul
Cheeseright explains the distribution of cash for regeneration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN REDWOOD, the inner cities minister, has told Birmingham Heartlands
Development Corporation that funding for its first year of operation will be
halved to Pounds 5m. The corporation is the latest of the government's urban
regeneration agencies with statutory powers.
When the fledgling corporation was conceived last February, Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, promised it Pounds 10m a year for
five years. With its resources cut, the corporation is being forced to adopt
a gradual approach to the development of derelict areas in east Birmingham.
It has been caught in the government's drive for economy and is trapped in a
continuing shift of emphasis in funding methods.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said at a conference of the
Association of Metropolitan Authorities and the British Urban Regeneration
Association this week: 'City Challenge and the Urban Regeneration Agency,
together with the urban development corporations, provide the main
mechanisms for an effective and flexible approach to urban regeneration.'
But details in the Autumn Statement covering urban spending figures show
that, of these three 'main mechanisms', only the Urban Regeneration Agency
will receive an increased budget in the mid 1990s.
The agency will be responsible for handling expenditure on reclaiming
derelict land and on assisting private-sector ventures in the inner cities
with the administration of City Grant - a system of aid for private-sector
ventures in the inner cities. It will be headed by Lord Walker, who as Mr
Peter Walker was a Conservative cabinet minister for many years.
Some City Grant is now handled by urban development corporations, each of
which is responsible for regenerating a designated tract of land. The Autumn
Statement figures show that 1992-93 represents the peak of government
spending on development corporations. In the next financial year the
government will cut spending on development corporations by 33 per cent.
But the cuts are not evenly distributed. The development corporations of
Bristol, Leeds, Teesside, Trafford Park in Manchester, and Tyne and Wear are
understood to be maintaining their 1993-94 budgets at 1992-93 levels. The
cuts outside Birmingham Heartlands are believed to have fallen on London
Docklands and Merseyside, the first corporations to be established, and on
central Manchester, Sheffield and the Black Country, where the financial
position is complicated by provisions for roadbuilding.
City Challenge spending, however, will increase in 1993-94 and then flatten
out for the two following years. City Challenge is an innovation of Mr
Heseltine which provides for the 57 local authorities with the most severe
urban problems to bid competitively for government funds to assist the
regeneration of a small, specific area.
There have been two rounds: the first gave the prizes to 11 authorities, the
second to 20. Each attracts Pounds 7.5m a year of government money for five
years.
Provisions for City Challenge from 1993-94 show that:
The scheme will not be extended to cover any more areas than those already
designated.
The money will not cover the total which could be drawn by the authorised
City Challenge schemes. 'The government is counting on under-spending, and
maybe the failure of a couple of the schemes,' said Mr Victor Hausner of
Victor Hausner Associates, which advises the environment department on urban
policy. For the first time the environment department has separated City
Challenge spending from Urban Programme spending.
The Urban Programme, the source of regeneration funds for local authorities,
is being steadily reduced. Spending in 1995-96 will be a third of that in
1992-93, City Challenge excluded. This means local authorities which have
not succeeded in City Challenge bids have, at first sight, less central
government help with urban problems.
A clearer focus on that question depends on what happens to the government's
new Capital Partnership programme. This allows local authorities, using
their capital receipts on urban schemes in partnership with the private
sector, to bid for more funding from the government. Such funding would be
made available in the form of allowing the authority to borrow.
Mr Howard said: 'Our best estimate is that this could generate additional
spending power between Pounds 500m and Pounds 600m for capital projects in
our 57 urban priority areas.'
Capital Partnership may thus offset the fall in the environment department's
established urban spending. Once allowances are made for the revenue coming
in from the Commission for the New Towns - responsible for selling public
assets in the English new towns - the amount will fall from Pounds 838m in
1993-94 to Pounds 552m in 1995-96.
But, whatever happens to the figures, it is clear that the greater part of
urban spending will be not a response to a particular problem but a response
to a competitive bid, with the environment department as the client calling
the tenders, the judge of the tenders and the paymaster.
It is what the government calls 'targeting' - the need, as Mr Howard put it,
'to target resources to defined opportunities with opportunities that can be
realised'.

FT  19 NOV 92 / NHS pension scheme to be a Next Steps agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Health Service pension scheme is to become an agency under the
government's Next Steps initiative in which Civil Service functions are
hived off into arm's-length executive bodies.
An announcement launching the NHS Pensions Agency will be made tomorrow. The
new agency will take over responsibility for handling a pension scheme with
nearly 1.3m members. More than Pounds 3bn passes through the scheme each
year in benefit payments and contributions, and its liabilities are around
Pounds 20bn. Mr Alec Cowan, formerly an official at the Department of
Education, will be chief executive.
As well as being Europe's largest occupational pension scheme, the NHS plan
is also regarded in the pensions industry as particularly complex. It covers
all grades of staff in the service, in which it is not unusual for personnel
to move in and out of NHS employment several times during their working
lives.
The scheme is also unusual in providing pensions for many self-employed
contractors such as general practitioners and dentists.
Agency status will not change the scheme's benefits or funding, and pensions
policy issues will remain with the NHS management executive at the
Department of Health.
'But a range of benefits should flow from agency status,' said Mr Cowan. 'My
priorities will include making better use of computer systems and improving
links with NHS employers to ensure that the pension scheme has the best
possible information flow.
'This is a classic area for a Next Steps agency. The business is well
defined and we know our customers. It is clear, without criticising anybody,
that improvements in administration can be made, and agency status will help
give the pension scheme a stronger and more visible focus.'

FT  19 NOV 92 / Truck sales show further rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES of new commercial vehicles rose 5.3 per cent to 15,465 last month,
confirming signs in the summer of the beginning of a slow recovery in one of
the sectors hit hardest by the recession.
Sales in the first 10 months, at 173,111, were nevertheless 5.9 per cent
lower than in the corresponding period a year before. But they have risen
year-on-year in three of the past five months, the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders has reported.
Sales of new trucks (above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) have risen
year-on-year for four consecutive months to October after falling
continuously for 33 months from the final quarter of 1989.
The decline earlier in the year means that for the first 10 months UK truck
sales were still 4.4 per cent lower than in the corresponding period a year
before. Any recovery is coming from a very low base.
Since 1989, commercial vehicle sales have suffered a sharp fall into
recession. Truck sales have plunged 60 per cent in three years, dropping to
a level not seen since the early 1950s.
The first signs of a weak recovery appeared in the heavy truck segment
(above 15 tonnes), which was also the first to succumb to the recession.
Sales of heavy truck in the first 10 months, at 13,813, are running 0.6 per
cent higher than last year.
In the overall truck market, Leyland DAF, the UK subsidiary of the Dutch
commercial vehicle maker DAF, appears to be consolidating the narrow lead it
established last year ahead of the Iveco group, which includes Iveco Ford
and Seddon Atkinson, the specialist heavy-truck maker. In the first 10
months, Leyland DAF increased its sales volume by 1 per cent compared with
an overall decline in the sector of 4.4 per cent and a fall in Iveco group
sales of 4.6 per cent. In the first 10 months Leyland DAF captured a 25 per
cent share of the truck market compared with the Iveco group's 23.8 per
cent.
Renault and MAN are the main losers in the UK truck market this year, with
declines in sales of 30.4 per cent and 12.6 per cent respectively.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Affluent areas score highest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST striking feature of the exam results tables released yesterday for
England is that they are the first ever published by the government.
For decades, most schools and local education authorities have fought to
keep their results under wraps. As late as this summer the Financial Times
found strong hostility, even among leading private schools, to giving their
results to the press.
It is difficult to see what most of the fuss was about. There is nothing
unexpected in the national picture. The depressing statistic that barely one
in three 16-year-olds in England gains five or more GCSE passes at grades A
to C - generally the bare minimum for proceeding to A-levels - is well
known.
Nor does the regional breakdown offer many surprises. When England's 108
education authorities are ranked by the proportions gaining five or more
GCSEs at grades A to C within each, the bottom 35 are cities or inner-city
boroughs. Tower Hamlets in east London stressed yesterday that in a third of
its schools English was the second language of virtually all those taking
GCSEs; in only two schools were more than four fifths of candidates native
speakers.
By contrast, every English county south of Birmingham comes in the top 50
except the Isle of Wight and Leicestershire. The top table is a roll-call of
relative affluence and includes Harrow, Kingston upon Thames, West Sussex,
Sutton, Bromley, and Surrey.
At the local level the tables are more revealing. The variation in the
performance of schools in the same locality is graphic, and socio-economic
factors do not explain everything.
Consider Oxfordshire, which ranked 14th in overall GCSE attainment.
Excluding its special schools, the tables give results for 35 comprehensives
and nine private schools. The county average for the proportion gaining five
GCSE passes at grades A to C - 41.2 per cent of the 15-16 age group -
disguises wide variations.
In all but two of the nine private schools, all selective, 85 per cent or
more of the pupils gained five-plus GCSEs at A to C. In the top state school
 -Chiltern Edge, near Henley-on-Thames - 60 per cent achieved that.
Between those extremes, though, wide variations do not appear to be easily
explained in socio-economic terms. The town of Didcot has two comprehensives
drawing on an almost identical 'priority area'.
In the girls' school 52 per cent of pupils gained five GCSEs at grades A to
C whereas at the boys' school only 30 per cent did so. Similarly, Bicester's
two comprehensives, with comparable 'priority areas', gained starkly
divergent results.
The worst GCSE performance in the county was achieved by Milham Ford Girls
School, in Oxford, only 15 per cent of whose 15-to-16-year-olds gained five
GCSEs at grade A to C. It is the only secondary school in the county
balloting on opting-out for grant-maintained status.
Whatever the advantages of grant-maintained status, better exam results do
not appear to be among them. Lincolnshire's 18 opted-out schools perform on
a par with their counterparts controlled by the county's education
authority; eight are below the national average and 10 above, of which six
are selective grammar schools with results similar to those of the county's
grammar schools which have not opted out. The county's top school, Kesteven
and Sleaford High School for Girls - 97 per cent of whose pupils gained five
or more GCSEs at grade A to C - is still under LEA control.
Now that suppression is not an option, education authorities, teachers and
educationalists will have an incentive to devise meaningful 'value-added'
analyses. With the national tests for 11-year-olds and 14-year-olds
starting, there will soon be ample material with which to do it.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Art market defies recession: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the richest women in the world was selling the family jewels in
Geneva; advertising executive Mr Charles Saatchi was trading in contemporary
art in New York; and in London a Constable came under the hammer. There are
few signs this week of an art market in recession.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, a young widow, is clearing out jewels
from one of the largest art collections on the Continent. The 297 lots
fetched SFr19.7m (Pounds 9m), comfortably above the high Sotheby's estimate
for the auction of SFr16.5m.
The top price was the SFr2.53m paid by the London dealer S. J. Phillips for
a jewelled gold and hardstone snuffbox made for Frederick the Great of
Prussia around 1770. The price was within estimate but set an auction record
for a snuffbox.
A pearl and diamond tiara made for the Empress Eugenie of France in 1853 was
bought by the Friends of the Louvre Museum in Paris for SFr935,000, which
was double its estimate.
Meanwhile, in New York, a Sotheby's auction of contemporary art brought in
Dollars 20.26m (Pounds 13.34m) but was 26 per cent unsold. Mr Saatchi's most
expensive disposal, 'Marilyn x 100' by Andy Warhol, sold for Dollars 3.74m,
but failed to top the expected Dollars 4m and set a record for Warhol.
David Hockney's famous portrait of his friends Harry Geldzahler and
Christopher Scott just made its target at Dollars 1.1m. The real loser at
the sale was Sotheby's owner Alfred Taubman. He submitted important Dollars
1.5m-plus pictures by Clyfford Still and Franz Kline which failed to find
buyers.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Leading council praises parents

<TEXT>
MR BILL DICKINSON, director of education for Kingston upon Thames, one of
the top boroughs, believed its excellent results were based on the full
range of good local schools, and not just those that selected their pupils.
'Our schools, as well as being ably led by their head teachers and
management, are also strongly supported by parents and governors,' he said.
'This leads to generally well-motivated pupils.' According to the results,
46.3 per cent of Kingston pupils achieved A-C grades in five or more GCSE
levels compared with a national average of 38.1 per cent. Two schools,
Tiffin Girls' and the Tiffin School (for boys), achieved pass rates of 96
per cent and 92 per cent respectively for these top grades.
Mr Dickinson also thought strong primary schools and the relatively small
size of the borough, which allowed closer contact with schools, were factors
that led to good results.
Ms Sandra Buchanan, headmistress of Tiffin Girls', said it was not
surprising that selective schools such as hers were at the top of the table.
'Kingston is a fairly prosperous borough so it should have good results.'
Southwark, the inner London borough at the bottom of the league table, was
clearly taken aback by its position. It is introducing an action plan to
improve future GCSE results. The borough, which includes former dockland
areas, had an average of 15.1 per cent of pupils achieving top GCSE A-C
grades.
Mr John McTernan, chairman of the education committee, said local results
were better than last year, but 'unacceptable differences in attainment'
remained. He added: 'A lot of difficulties, particularly around teacher
staffing, have been resolved.'

FT  19 NOV 92 / Tables a roll-call of relative affluence: National exam
rankings have been published for the first time and contain few surprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST striking feature of the exam results tables released yesterday for
England is that they are the first ever published by the government.
For decades, most schools and local education authorities have fought to
keep their results under wraps. As late as this summer the Financial Times
found strong hostility, even among leading private schools, to giving their
results to the press.
It is difficult to see what most of the fuss was about. There is nothing
unexpected in the national picture. The depressing statistic that barely one
in three 16-year-olds in England gains five or more GCSE passes at grades A
to C - generally the bare minimum for proceeding to A-levels - is
well-known.
Nor does the regional breakdown offer many surprises. When England's 108
education authorities are ranked by the proportions gaining five or more
GCSEs at grades A to C within each, the bottom 35 are cities or inner-city
boroughs. Tower Hamlets in east London stressed yesterday that in a third of
its schools English was the second language of virtually all those taking
GCSEs; in only two schools were more than four-fifths of candidates native
speakers.
By contrast, every English county south of Birmingham comes in the top 50
except the Isle of Wight and Leicestershire. The top table is a roll-call of
relative affluence and includes Harrow, Kingston-upon-Thames, West Sussex,
Sutton, Bromley, and Surrey.
At the local level the tables are more revealing. The variation in the
performance of schools in the same locality is graphic, and socio-economic
factors do not explain everything.
Consider Oxfordshire, which ranked 14th in overall GCSE attainment.
Excluding its special schools, the tables give results for 35 comprehensives
and nine private schools. The county average for the proportion gaining five
GCSE passes at grades A to C - 41.2 per cent of the 15-16 age group -
disguises wide variations.
In all but two of the nine private schools, all selective, 85 per cent or
more of the pupils gained five-plus GCSEs at A to C. In the top state school
 -Chiltern Edge, near Henley-on-Thames - 60 per cent achieved that, with
five other schools, all in largely middle-class areas, at or above 55 per
cent. At the other end of the spectrum, in three schools, two of them
drawing largely from council estates, fewer than than one in five came out
with five or more at grades A to C.
Between those extremes, though, wide variations do not appear to be easily
explicable in socio-economic terms. The town of Didcot has two
comprehensives drawing on an almost identical 'priority area'. In the girls'
school 52 per cent of pupils gained five GCSEs at grades A to C whereas at
the boys' school only 30 per cent did so. Similarly, Bicester's two
comprehensives, with comparable 'priority areas', gained starkly divergent
results.
The worst GCSE performance in the county was achieved by Milham Ford Girls
School, in Oxford, only 15 per cent of whose 15-16 year-olds gained five
GCSEs at grade A to C. The authority tried to close the school in 1989, but
was refused permission by Mr John MacGregor, then education secretary. It is
the only secondary school in the county balloting on opting-out for
grant-maintained status. For the government, league tables are a
double-edged sword.
Whatever the advantages of grant-maintained status, better exam results do
not appear to be among them. Lincolnshire's 18 opted-out schools perform on
a par with their counterparts controlled by education authorities, eight are
below the national average and ten above, of which six are selective grammar
schools with results similar to those those of grammar schools in the county
which have not opted-out. The county's top school, Kesteven and Sleaford
High School for Girls - 97 per cent of whose pupils gained five or more
GCSEs at grade A to C - is still under the control of the education
authority.
Now that suppression is not an option, education authorities, teachers and
educationalists will have an incentive to devise meaningful 'value-added'
analyses. With the national tests for 11 and 14-year-olds starting, there
will soon be ample material with which to do it.
Yesterday's argument about the value of the tables took a predictable turn.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, welcomed them as a 'datum line' against
which parents could judge their local schools, while Mrs Ann Taylor, his
Labour shadow, condemned them as 'another government obsession'.
But Mr Patten is not letting up. Next year come tables of school truancy
rates and achievement in the standard assessment tasks. Primary schools will
be in on the act, too - adding a further 21,000 names to the lists. By then,
lists of schools in newspapers will be a way of life.

she explained. 'There would be something wrong if we didn't'
Southwark, the inner London borough at the bottom of the league table, was
clearly taken aback by its position. It is introducing an action plan to
improve future GCSE results.
The borough, which includes former dockland areas, had an average of 15.1
per cent of pupils achieving top GCSE A-C grades, and 56.9 per cent entering
at least one A/AS level examination compared with the national average of
86.1 per cent.
Local secondary schools are being set new attainment targets, governing
bodies are to undertake a comprehensive review of the results and inspectors
are to visit each school to discuss its performance and assess how
improvements can be made.
Mr John McTernan, chairman of the education committee, said that although
local results were better than last year, with more pupils entering and
passing GCSEs, there remained 'unacceptable differences in attainment'
between schools and departments.
He said the education department and schools had had to contend with a great
deal of change since Southwark assumed responsibility for education in 1990
(following the abolition of the Inner London Education Authority). 'A lot of
difficulties, particularly around teacher staffing, have been resolved and I
would expect to see a steady and significant improvement in exam results
over the coming years.'

FT  19 NOV 92 / Isles of Scilly tops GCSE table
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Isles of Scilly, the second-smallest education authority in England,
topped the league tables although it only had 28 pupils taking GCSE exams
this year, Bethan Hutton writes.
Mr Philip Hygate, chief executive of Isles of Scilly council, said: 'It is
not an aberration. It demonstrates the importance that education has on the
Isles of Scilly.
'It is a historical and cultural issue.'
The islands have five schools, only one of which caters for GCSE-level
pupils.

FT  19 NOV 92 / How the education authorities compare
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Until today, comparative results have been the private preserve of local
authorities, which, with certain notable and praiseworthy exceptions, seemed
to believe that parents cannot be trusted to understand or use the figures
wisely.  This attitude is now permanently consigned to the dustbin of
educational history.
John Patten, education secretary
This measure is yet another of Mr Patten's diversionary tactics - pretending
he is doing something while, in reality, failing to address the key issue in
schools today - underfunding.  And when it comes to the future of British
education, John Patten comes bottom of my league every time.
Don Foster, Liberal Democrat education spokesman
The arrangements were devised to fit the requirements of computers and are
not a sophisticated analysis to reflect the achievements of pupils or
schools.
Vivian Anthony, secretary of the Headmasters' Conference, representing
leading public schools
There is nothing misleading about it, it is putting information which
parents have a right to know into the public domain.
Baroness Blatch education minister
Just as there is more to life than exam results, so there is more to schools
than raw exam grades.  What about music, art, sport and giving children a
broad-based education for life?
Gillian Wood, assistant general secretary of the Assistant Masters and
Mistresses Association
The government might well reflect upon the fortunes of football where the
league table mentality reigns supreme.  The few clubs at the top attract all
the best players and the money, but what has happened to overall standards
and skills, not to mention behaviour?
Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the 179,000-strong National
Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Woman Teachers

London Underground dismissed the accusation as 'absolute and utter
nonsense'. The company, which has said it has enough staff willing to run a
strike-breaking service, said it would not operate outside safety rules.
The conciliation service Acas said it remained in touch with both parties.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Barclays cuts card rate to 22.9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYCARD is to cut interest charged on card loans by two percentage
points from January 1. The company said the cut will reduce its annualised
rate of interest to 22.9 per cent, the lowest since July 1978, John Gapper
writes.
Mr Richard Reay-Smith, Barclaycard chief executive, said the cut was a
planned move to keep interest rates in line with the base rate, rather than
a response to recent criticism of charges on credit cards.
The cut had to be delayed until January 1 because a cut of one percentage
point had been introduced from the start of this month, and Barclaycard
technology could not cope with another change so soon.
Nationwide Building Society is cutting its basic mortgage rate by 0.74
percentage points to 8.55 per cent. The cut will apply from yesterday for
new borrowers, and January 1 for existing borrowers.
Midland Bank is cutting its mortgage rate for new borrowers from 9.25 per
cent to 8.55 per cent. The rate for first-time buyers is being cut to 7.55
per cent. Existing borrowers' rates will fall on December 21.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Housing market continues to tumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLANNED pit closures, the demise of Dan-Air and the sterling crisis in
September continued to unnerve the housing market, a survey of 150 estate
agents indicates today.
The survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors found that house
prices fell again in spite of a reduction in interest rates of almost a
third in the past two months.
Three quarters of the agents surveyed in England and Wales reported a
further fall in prices during the three months to the end of October. The
rest said prices had stayed mainly static.
Worst affected was southern England, with the problems of Dan-Air - now
taken over by British Airways - affecting the area around Gatwick airport
particularly hard.
Prices in East Anglia have been further undermined by the repossession by
banks and building societies of homes, including some previously owned by
Names at the Lloyd's insurance market. Mr Michael Knight, a consultant
employed by Jackson-Stops &amp; Staff in Newmarket says: 'Every time a home is
repossessed it knocks another 20 per cent off the price.'
Estate agents in northern England said that the announcement of pit closures
had adversely affected housing markets in mining areas such as Pontefract
and Chesterfield.
The institution hopes that the housing market may have reached the bottom.
Mr Peter Miller, its housing spokesman, said: 'The market is waiting at the
traffic lights showing amber; whether they turn red or green hangs on
perceived economic stability.
'Fear of redundancy is the most commonly cited reason for potential buyers
not committing themselves.'

FT  19 NOV 92 / Tax collection costs jump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAX COLLECTION costs increased sharply during 1991-92 to the highest level
in at least five years, the Inland Revenue's annual report showed yesterday.
Costs as a proportion of revenue collected rose to 2.06 per cent - a total
of Pounds 1.6bn - compared with 1.7 per cent last year and 1.61 per cent in
the previous 12 months.
The Revenue stressed that the average cost of collection was only a partial
indicator of performance. The cost was influenced by changes in the
structure and level of tax, and movements in income and profit, as well as
departmental efficiency, The Revenue said.
It added that nearly half of the increase was the result of the new bank and
building society interest arrangements, and the balance reflected a 2 per
cent increase in expenditure above inflation and a 3 per cent fall in tax
yield.
Setting up the new arrangements for tax and building society interest
totalled Pounds 163m for 1991-92 and Pounds 46m for 1990-91.
Total tax received was Pounds 101bn against repayments of Pounds 21bn. The
Revenue collected a further Pounds 37bn on behalf of other departments,
principally from National Insurance contributions.
Tax yield from tackling non-compliance rose by more than a quarter to Pounds
5bn, including a contribution of Pounds 1.7bn from counter-evasion and
counter-avoidance.
The proportion of tax unpaid from the collectable total rose from 62 per
cent to 64 per cent in line with the target for the Revenue's collection
offices.
Employment in the last decade has fallen from 73,980 to 69,800.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Scargill claims pits 'cover-up'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ARTHUR SCARGILL, pres-ident of the National Union of Mineworkers,
yesterday accused the government of a 'Matrix Churchill-type cover-up' of
the facts surrounding the decision to close 31 mines.
His accusation to the Commons employment committee came as the Trades Union
Congress designated December 9 a National Day of Recovery - part of a series
of events aimed at keeping pressure on the government over the closures.
Mr Scargill said that British Coal was refusing to supply information to the
NUM, to both committees of MPs investigating the closures, and to the High
Court.
British Coal's lawyers, he said, had told the NUM that disclosure of all the
documents it requested would 'give rise to questions of public interest
immunity'.
Mr Scargill promised to supply the documents to the committee. He submitted
a copy of a letter from Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, in which Mr
Clarke admitted that it was 'exasperatingly difficult' to acquire clear and
reliable information about the pit closures.
The NUM leader claimed five of the 10 pits British Coal said were
loss-making were in profit, and two others were set to move into profit.
The TUC said that on December 9 workers were not being asked to take
industrial action, but it wanted trade unionists to raise the issues of job
security and employment creation with employers.
The TUC's general council will meet in Doncaster next week - the first time
it has met outside London - and members are expected to visit threatened
pits. A further 40 rallies are being planned between now and the end of the
year.
The TUC move came as Nuclear Electric claimed that up to 17,000 jobs could
be lost if the government decided to close the UK's Magnox nuclear reactors
to make more room in the energy market for coal.
Responding to suggestions by the electricity industry that the Magnox
reactors had reached the end of their useful lives, the state-owned utility
said a premature shutdown would cost the Treasury Pounds 2bn in lost
revenues.
The TUC hopes to keep up the pressure on the government to revise parts of
the employment bill, which has just received its second reading.
It has for the first time hired a political lobbying group, Connect Public
Affairs, which has been arranging informal meetings between small groups of
Conservative MPs and Mr John Monks, TUC deputy general secretary.
TUC officials say they have targeted parts of the employment bill which have
also been criticised by employers, including the new rules on automatic
check-off of union dues and the abolition of the so-called 'Bridlington
rules' which have been used to regulate inter-union disputes.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Mines could cut coal prices, MPs told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST half the UK pits earmarked for possible closure are capable of
producing coal at cheaper prices than those tentatively agreed between
British Coal and electricity generators, a consultancy advising the
government told MPs yesterday.
Mr Ronald Lewis, of the John T Boyd consultancy, told MPs an investigation
of 28 pits earlier this year demonstrated that within three or four years
they could produce coal at an average of Pounds 1.33p a gigajoule and that
this could fall to Pounds 1.15.
Mr Lewis also backed changes to an 84-year-old law that restricts miners'
underground shifts to 7 1/2 hours.
He said this was necessary partly because of the time miners often needed to
travel long distances to coalfaces, especially in the north-east of England.
Any move to change the law would be strongly opposed by the unions. Mr Peter
McNestry, general secretary of the Nacods pit deputies union, said yesterday
that longer hours would significantly increase the dangers of working in
mines.
British Coal has tentatively agreed contracts with the two main generators
in England and Wales by which it would sell coal at Pounds 1.50. Mr Lewis
said 15 or 16 of 31 pits earmarked for closure would be be able to reach the
Pounds 1.33.
Yesterday's revelations will increase concern that the pit closure programme
is being implemented too hastily. Nonetheless the question of finding a
market for the coal will have to be addressed.
Mr Lewis said: 'When you look at the future of British collieries it is not
a question of whether there will be 50 or 40. It is a case of 40 or less.'
Mr Lewis also disclosed to the Trade and Industry Committee inquiry into
energy policy that Boyd has been asked by the government to rank 21 pits
whose future is under review in order of viability.
The consultancy has not been asked by the government to consider 10 other
pits which British Coal has said will close but which are subject to 90-day
consultation procedures, an omission that surprised some MPs.
Boyd has asked for and been given government approval to look at the 19
remaining British Coal pits always scheduled to remain open, because it
wanted to see 'if they represented the best', Mr Lewis said.
In other evidence the Coalfield Communities Campaign said the market for
coal in the electricity sector could be sustained at 70m tonnes a year or
more throughout the 1990s.
Within the framework they suggested, no electricity supply option, including
nuclear, would be closed off. Power station coal imports could continue
though at a lesser level than present.
CCC's 'modest changes' would enable all pits to stay open and would reduce
the costs of electricity to consumers by Pounds 400m a year.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Treasury accused of seeking 'alibis'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treasury is being forced to seek outside advice to improve its
decision-making because of the view that it has made mistakes, Mr Howard
Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said
yesterday.
Mr Davies said one reason for the Treasury's efforts to step up
consultations with outside economists and industrialists was to give it
'alibis' in case policy-making errors were repeated.
Speaking at an Association of European Journalists lunch, Mr Davies, a
former Treasury official, said the Treasury habitually 'internalised'
discussions on economic policy. The Treasury's view - justifying its
customary secrecy - was that 'information, power and control (were)
synonymous'.
As controller of the Audit Commission, the government public spending
watchdog, Mr Davies helped advise the Treasury on reforming its internal
management structure.
He said the traditional Treasury approach was 'fine as long as you're
winning'. But if the Treasury made 'mistakes' it alone received the blame,
since the importance of external advice even from the Bank of England - was
seldom acknowledged. Signs that it was seeking more outside contacts were a
'sea change'.
Mr Davies, who criticised the government's handling of the departure from
the exchange rate mechanism, predicted that it might have difficulty in
maintaining its anti-inflation credibility. s

FT  19 NOV 92 / Fast reactor research is axed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN will announce today its withdrawal from the European Fast Reactor
nuclear research programme, with the loss of up to 400 skilled jobs. The
staff cuts will mainly be at Atomic Energy Authority plants at Risley,
Cheshire, and Dounreay, Caithness.
Withdrawal from the co-operative project with France and Germany spells the
end of UK development of fast reactors - also known as fast breeders
because, unlike conventional nuclear reactors, they 'breed' their own
plutonium fuel. Since the mid 1950s, the UK government has spent almost
Pounds 2bn on fast reactor research and development.
Mr Brian Eyre, chief executive of AEA Technology, told unions yesterday that
the government would stop paying Pounds 13m a year to fund the UK share of
the research after the project's first design phase ends in March.
The nuclear industry is not prepared to commit its own funds to continue the
programme, which is intended to design a demonstration fast reactor to be
built in the late 1990s, probably in France. The government decided last
summer to close Britain's prototype fast reactor at Dounreay in 1994.
Mr Eyre said he was 'bitterly disappointed' about the government decision
because he believes fast reactors will be essential to achieve the full
potential of nuclear power in the 21st century.
The unions reacted angrily. Mr John Billard, national officer of the
Institution of Professionals, Managers and Specialists, said: 'As we are
pleading with Germany to stay with the European Fighter Aircraft, here we go
pulling out of the EFR. Once again the government is causing huge damage to
Britain's technological capability and international standing by reneging on
its commitments.'
The IPMS said Britain's withdrawal from fast reactor research would leave
the field open not only to France and Germany but also to Russia and Japan,
which were investing heavily in the technology.
But some experts believe that, with uranium and plutonium supplies likely to
remain plentiful, fast reactors are an unnecessary and unwelcome step in the
development of nuclear power. They say research should instead concentate on
fusion reactors.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Motorists face urban road pricing, warns MacGregor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday signalled that motorists
would have to start paying for the use of the roads in London and other
cities in the next few years.
Tolls would be collected electronically, with meters in cars activated by
roadside transmitters clocking up charges according to distance travelled,
vehicle type and time of day.
Mr MacGregor appears to have accepted that charging people on a
pay-as-you-go basis is likely to provide the only feasible long-term
solution to worsening urban traffic congestion. He also has the support of
environment ministers who favour such charges as a means of curbing the rise
in carbon dioxide emissions accompanying rapid traffic growth.
Speaking at a London traffic conference yesterday, Mr MacGregor in effect
launched a campaign to soften up public opinion in readiness for the likely
introduction of road pricing in the late 1990s.
He said no firm decisions would be taken before the completion of a
three-year feasibility study at the end of 1994, but his intention was to
get a debate going.
Mr MacGregor acknowledged that road pricing was likely to prove unpopular,
but said the alternative could be even worse. 'Is increasing congestion, and
ultimately gridlock, a more attractive option?' he asked.
Road pricing would speed up journey times, improve bus services and cut
transport costs, he said. It would also boost trade and commerce by making
cities more attractive places in which to live, shop and work.
Yesterday's initiative marks an about-turn from the policies of Mrs
Thatcher's government, which ruled out road pricing as an infringement of
the motorist's right to drive.
It may yet face opposition from Mr MacGregor's cabinet colleagues, some of
whom will argue that road pricing could turn into a transport version of the
poll tax. Motorists already face the possibility of tolls on trunk roads and
motorways following the chancellor's announcement last week that this would
make it easier for privately-funded toll roads to compete.
The Automobile Association attacked the urban road pricing plan, saying it
would hit the least well-off. It said precedence should be given to better
enforcement of parking controls and improvements in public transport.
Car drivers are cutting back on maintenance because of the recession, the
RAC said yesterday, Bronwen Maddox writes.
In a survey conducted this month in London and Leicester, the motoring
organisation found that 12 per cent of motorists had cut back on servicing.
The survey found that more than half of CO (carbon monoxide) emissions come
from only 13 per cent of vehicles, and one of those emits as much as 40 of
the cleanest.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Insider dealing bill criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS whose companies build a stake in another company in advance of
launching a takeover bid could become guilty of a criminal offence if the
government goes ahead with proposed legislation, the Institute of Directors
and the Law Society claimed yesterday.
In the latest broadside against the proposed new insider dealing law now
passing through parliament, the two organisations added that directors could
be liable to prosecution under a wide range of circumstances, such as when
their companies bought their own shares in the stock market.
The concern focuses on the exemption in Schedule 2(3) of the Criminal
Justice Bill, which would apply to anyone who dealt with insider information
which was deemed to be 'market information'.
The exemption was added to the bill only a month ago after an outcry in the
City. However, in a letter to Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the
Treasury, the IoD warned that the exemption from prosecution would not
protect company directors.
Mr Bill Knight, chairman of the Law Society's company law committee, said
the exemption was inadequate because it applied only to dealings that were
'reasonable'. He said: 'We cannot know in advance what is reasonable.'
The exemption also fails to protect underwriters, Mr Knight added. As a
result, they could find themselves open to prosecution when they agree to
take on underwriting commitment on the basis of unpublished information.
The Treasury has tried to calm market fears by announcing that it would
issue guidance on how the law would be applied.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Nigerians ponder political uncertainty and economic crisis:
Michael Holman analyses why the country is facing the most critical period
in the 32 years since it became independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH a mixture of resignation and apprehension, Nigerians are preparing for
one of the most critical periods in their country's turbulent 32-year
post-independence history, beset by political uncertainty and gripped by a
deepening economic crisis.
No one was surprised when General Ibrahim Babangida announced on Monday that
the presidential election due be held next month would be delayed until
June. Presidential primaries last August had been marred by rigging and
other electoral malpractices by both the Social Democratic party (SDP) and
the National Republican Convention (NRC).
But doubts surrounding the country's transition to civilian rule are
unlikely to be set at rest by yesterday's decision. Both parties have to
rebuild in the wake of the president's earlier decision to sack their
executives, a task made more difficult by Monday's ban on all 23
presidential candidates from contesting the new round of primaries.
Nor is it clear how the authorities will be able to eliminate the electoral
fraud that seems endemic, judging by past polls in 1979 and 1983.
For many Nigerians, a civilian government, whatever its credentials, remains
the lesser of two evils. Hence the forthright warning from Olusegun
Obasanjo, the retired general who led Nigeria's military government from
1976 to 1979 before handing over to a civilian administration, toppled in a
1983 coup.
Stick to January, he urged Gen Babangida: 'Any prolongation of military rule
 .will amount to war against the sovereign rights of people in Nigeria to
choose their own leaders.'
Yet a weak civilian government invites military intervention, and this
remains uppermost in Gen Babangida's mind, say government officials. It may
well be that he set himself an impossible task when he set about reforming
Nigeria's political system.
'It will not be an overstatement,' an editorial in the Vanguard newspaper
declared in 1986, soon after the launch of the transition programme, 'to say
that Nigeria in all the years of her independent existence, has not even
started to approximate the prerequisites for building a modern nation
state.'
'Economically, unbearable poverty is still the highest common denominator.
Politically, disorder has become the basic mode  .. Socially, we are
bewildered by our own decay and morality  ..especially of the elite class.'
In a laudable but ultimately impractical attempt to root out corruption in
politics and override ethnic and religious allegiances, President Babangida
imposed the SDP and the NRC on Nigerians.
Their manifestos, written by civil servants, were broadly similar,
committing the parties to the economic reform programme which Gen Babangida
hoped would be the second part of his legacy to Nigeria.
The programme, launched in 1986, has effectively lapsed. A further
devaluation of the Naira last March appeared to signal a fresh start, but by
mid-year it was clear that fiscal and monetary targets were not being met. A
policy agreement with the IMF has not been renewed, and prospects of an
early agreement are remote.
The painful consequences is that one of the greatest single obstacles to
economic recovery remains unresolved: Nigeria's crippling Dollars 30bn
external debt.
Last year, notes a recent World Bank report, debt service obligations
totaled nearly Dollars 6bn, compared with export earnings of Dollars 12bn.
The servicing burden was eased at the start of this year when the government
implemented an agreement with commercial bank creditors. Some Dollars 3.3bn
was converted under a cash buyback option, while the remaining Dollars 2bn
was exchanged for collateralised bonds.
While this significantly reduced the debt, it was of little comfort to the
average Nigerian. After five years of the structural adjustment programme,
external debt had risen from Dollars 19.6bn in 1985 to around Dollars 30bn
today.
The economic balance sheet has further disturbing figures. External debt
servicing commitments on current projections will run at around Dollars 5bn
a year for the rest of the 1990s.
'This is not compatible with any recovery programme,' said a senior donor
official yesterday. 'Nigeria is a net exporter of capital - how can it
revive its industrial sector or revive social services under these
conditions?'
'Nigeria is now in a vicious cycle,' he continued. 'Mismanagement and
corruption means that there will be no debt relief. But without debt relief,
the economic crisis deepens, and the solutions become more difficult.'
Even the most sympathetic of donors concede, however, that the statistics
tell only part of the story. Much of the money borrowed during the boom
years of the 1970s was squandered on projects either misconceived or
mismanaged, invariably involving vast kickbacks. Far from obtaining a sound
return on money invested in telecommunications or steel, these sectors are a
liability - inefficient and costly drains on resources.
Critics make a second point. Had Nigeria followed through with the reforms
initiated in 1986, and kept to the terms of successive IMF agreements, the
country would today be eligible for the so-called Trinidad terms. In theory
around half of Nigeria's Dollars 17.8bn Paris Club debt could be written
off.
In practise,it would have proved less, for some of the Paris Club
governments are less supportive of the terms than others. But Britain at
least, Nigeria's largest official creditor, would have been willing to act.
At the same time, Nigeria's drastic fall in per capita income from around
Dollars 1,000 at the end of the 1970s (a figure distorted by an unrealistic
exchange rate) to under Dollars 300 could have been cushioned. The country
is eligible for concessionary borrowing from the IMF under the Fund's
extended structural adjustment facility. But the essential precondition is
IMF endorsement of economic policy.
Now in his eighth year in office, Gen Babangida is presiding over a country
in disarray. 'We want to go down in history as having staked our credibility
on a viable and democratic workable third republic,' he told Nigerians on
Monday night. History may well come to a different conclusion.

THAILAND'S six-month-old Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday
accused a leading stock market trader of manipulating share prices and
ordered the suspension of trading in Bangkok Bank of Commerce shares.
The SEC said it had filed a case with the police against Mr Song
Watcharasriroj, better known as Sia Song, and his associates for 'alleged
breach of securities law on price manipulation and the takeover code.' Mr
Song has announced a 10.66 per cent personal holding in the bank, but he and
his associates are reported to hold more than 25 per cent, which would
oblige them to make an offer for the rest of the bank, Thailand's ninth
largest. They have not done so.
The SEC's move yesterday follows a concerted effort by the central bank and
the finance ministry to restrict speculation on the stock exchange and
reduce the amount of credit extended by stockbrokers to their clients for
buying shares.
Thai share prices rose sharply after May, when troops killed about 50
pro-democracy demonstrators in Bangkok, and continued to rise following the
election of a civilian coalition government in September, but they have
started to fall back in response to the credit squeeze.
Yesterday the SET index fell 23.45 points, or 2.6 per cent, to 868.04 on
news of the proposed prosecution of Mr Song.
An SEC statement said: 'This action is carried out by the SEC board to
protect the interest and stability of the country's financial system and of
the majority of stock investors.
'The SEC board hopes that (the action) will not have a serious impact on the
stock market or the work of finance and securities firms as a whole.'
Mr Reg Clough, a spokesman for the bank, was quoted as saying that 11 arrest
warrants had been issued for Mr Song and his associates.

<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA'S presidential election took a bizarre turn yesterday after
President Roh Tae-woo allegedly ordered his MP brother-in-law to be briefly
'abducted' to prevent him from joining an opposition party.
The affair is the latest intervention by the president to keep the ruling
Democratic Liberal party (DLP) from splitting just a month before the
election.
But the episode could damage the electoral chances of Mr Kim Young-sam, the
DLP presidential nominee, as well as the reputation of Mr Roh, who earlier
promised to stay neutral in the campaign as part of the country's democratic
reforms.
Mr Kim Bok-dong, a DLP legislator and the president's in-law, was stopped
and abducted by plain-clothes policemen on Tuesday evening as he was driving
to his constituency in Taegu, where he was scheduled to announce his
defection to the opposition United People's party (UPP), according to an
aide to Mr Kim.
Mr Kim was brought back to Seoul and a breakfast meeting at the Blue House,
the executive mansion, with Mr Roh. The MP later said that he would stay
with the DLP, although he acknowledged his interest in joining the UPP.
Mr Kim's defection posed a potential threat to the DLP. UPP officials claim
Mr Kim's departure would have encouraged as many as 30 other MPs from the
ruling party to join the UPP and eliminate the government's parliamentary
majority.
The UPP was formed this year by Mr Chung Ju-yung, the founder of the Hyundai
business group.
The Blue House dismissed the incident as 'a family affair'. But the UPP and
the main opposition Democratic party (DP) said the action violated the
government's pledge of neutrality, with the UPP demanding the resignation of
the caretaker cabinet appointed to supervise the presidential election.
Members of Mr Roh's majority faction in the DLP have threatened to leave the
party because of their dislike of Mr Kim Young-sam, a former opposition
leader who became new DLP president this summer. Although the revolt is
being staged by his political allies, Mr Roh fears a party split would allow
Mr Kim Dae-jung, the DP presidential candidate, to win the election.
A small group of conservative MPs left the DLP last month to form the New
Korea party. But Mr Roh defused that threat by persuading several prominent
Koreans, including the leaders of the Daewoo business group and the Posco
steel company, not to accept the NPK's presidential nomination offer.

THE South African cabinet yesterday sought to restore the government's
reputation in the face of accusations that army intelligence had sought to
subvert the African National Congress (ANC).
Further pressure on the government came yesterday from Mr Harry Schwartz,
the South African ambassador to the US, who said he was 'furious and
outraged' at the Goldstone Commission disclosures.
'It has undermined all our effort here, all the hard work that so many
people have put into changing our situation here. There can be no room for
this sort of thing in South Africa,' said Mr Schwartz.
The scandal broke on Monday when Mr Justice Goldstone, appointed by the
government to probe the causes of political violence racking the country,
accused military intelligence of seeking to involve the ANC's armed wing in
common crime.
The revelations are a considerable embarrassment to the government as they
cast doubt on the veracity of previous pledges to stop covert campaigns
against political opponents. They also impede efforts to revive the
constitutional negotiation process, stalled since May.
The ANC has called for an expanded judicial inquiry into the military,
echoing Judge Goldstone's own request for wider powers, more resources and
greater co-operation in carrying out his investigations.
Meanwhile, Mr Gene Louw, minister of defence, said he 'seriously disputed'
several of Judge Goldstone's statements about the affair.

NORTH KOREA yesterday threatened to suspend all negotiations with South
Korea in the latest sign of increased tension between the two sides, writes
John Burton in Seoul.
Progress in inter-Korean relations has been blocked by Pyongyang's refusal
to accept challenge inspections by Seoul of suspected nuclear weapon
facilities.
However, other issues have contributed to the stalemate in recent weeks.
South Korea last month announced the discovery of a North Korean spy ring
and demanded an apology from Pyongyang, which has dismissed the incident as
a 'fabrication'.
Seoul and Washington also recently said that they would resume the joint
'Team Spirit' military exercise next year after suspending it this year due
to North Korea's acceptence of scheduled nuclear inspections by the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
Seoul is following a carrot-and-stick policy in persuading Pyongyang to
accept challenge nuclear inspections. While offers of economic aid to
Pyongyang are the carrot, Team Spirit represents the stick. Pyongyang said
at yesterday's session of the bilateral Joint Nuclear Control Commission
that it would cancel meetings with the South, including the prime ministers'
talks in December, unless Team Spirit is cancelled.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Approval sought for HK airport funding

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE future of Hong Kong's new airport will move back onto the agenda today
when the Hong Kong government approaches the local legislature for approval
of a big works contract, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong.
The government is expected to present financial plans to an ad hoc committee
of the Legislative Council (LegCo) for the funding of a contract to build
the site for the colony's Chek Lap Kok airport, north of Lantau island.
The HKDollars 9bn (Pounds 760m) contract was let provisionally in the summer
to a multinational consortium, which later agreed to extend the validity of
its bid to the end of this month. The government is hopeful that LegCo will
approve the funding when the finance committee debates the issue tomorrow
week.
If the funding is not approved soon then it is unlikely the 'airport
platform' - as it is known - could be completed in time to allow the airport
proper to open before mid-1997, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese
sovereignty.
The government told China of its plans to press ahead with the building of
the platform last Friday. It was warned, however, of pursuing a 'go it
alone' policy and told that Beijing's consent to franchises to operate
airport services would be held up if it did so.
Hong Kong government officials have denied that they will build the airport
without China's approval. They say the Anglo-Chinese memorandum of
understanding relates to works and business franchises which straddle 1997.
Share prices fell sharply for the second day in succession yesterday as
international investors sold amid continuing concerns about the rift between
the UK and China over democracy in Hong Kong.
The Hang Seng Index closed 240.19 lower at 5,848.33, nearly 4 per cent down
on Tuesday.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO of Japan's most powerful economic policymakers yesterday warned
political leaders that they risked seriously damaging already fragile
business confidence by the prolonged delay in enacting a special budget to
boost the economy.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, and Mr Takeshi Noda,
the head of the Economic Planning Agency, both warned that the delay to the
Japanese parliament's debate on the budget risked deepening the economic
downturn.
The budget, which is needed to enact the Y10,700bn (Pounds 56.8bn) emergency
spending package announced in August, is being held up by a dispute between
the ruling Liberal Democratic party and the opposition over which LDP
leaders will testify over their involvement in the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin
scandal.
Further talks yesterday between the LDP and the opposition failed to break
the deadlock. Opposition parties insist they will not convene the
parliamentary budget committee until the LDP agrees to at least five leaders
giving sworn testimony to the legislature.
Mr Noda, presenting a gloomy agency report on the economic outlook, said:
'Public distrust in politics is a big factor in undermining business
sentiment. From the people's point of view the government and the ruling
party - not just the opposition - are responsible for the impasse.'
Mr Mieno warned that a delay would greatly affect business and stock market
sentiment. In a rare comment upon the politics of economic policy, he
remarked: 'We really hope the Diet discussion on the budget will start as
soon as possible.' He said many hard-pressed companies were anxiously
waiting for benefits of the emergency package to flow through.
However, he said he was not considering a cut in the official discount rate,
although he acknowledged the economy was still in the midst of a painful
adjustment. He also said the Bank of Japan had no plans to offer financial
support to a banking industry body set up recently designed to reduce the
banks' bad loans.
A senior Economic Planning Agency official warned that the economy was so
fragile it was only being supported by public works spending and housing
investment.
Meanwhile, even though the special supplementary budget has not been passed
through parliament, pressure is mounting on the Ministry of Finance to
deliver a further fiscal stimulus through the 1993 budget. Concern that
small companies may face a credit crunch from banks' increasingly cautious
approach to lending is an important factor behind the ministry of finance's
decision to sanction a 10 per cent rise next year in the fiscal investment
and loan programme, the so-called second budget.
The ministry has agreed appropriations from the budget should rise to
Y45,000bn next year.

FT  19 NOV 92 / France and Taiwan cement Dollars 2.6bn jet fighter contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN has obtained a long-awaited agreement from France to buy 60 Mirage
2000-5 multi-role jet fighter aircraft for Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.7bn),
according to newspaper and radio reports from Taipei.
Neither the Paris government nor Dassault, the French aerospace group which
makes the Mirage fighter, would comment on the deal, the latest stage in the
island's attempts to boost its defences against a military build-up in China
and as such likely to spark a diplomatic row between Beijing and Paris.
But they did not deny the report. It comes two months after a US decision to
sell up to 150 F-16 jet fighters to Taiwan for Dollars 5.8bn, seen as a
factor in resolving French hesitation.
If confirmed, this will be the second big recent French defence sale to
Taiwan, after last year's Dollars 4.8bn sale of 16 frigates, never
officially announced. The Mirage sale would also include 1,500 missiles,
bringing the total contract value to Dollars 3.8bn, said Taiwanese press
reports.
China has objected strongly, causing Paris to pause before jeopardising
already strained relations with a powerful ally. The Beijing Foreign
Ministry yesterday warned that China was 'firmly against' such a project.
However, China took no significant steps against France over the frigate
sale, beyond voicing loud objections, and has countenanced recent defence
equipment sales to Taiwan from Germany, Belgium and Italy.
France is China's second largest aid donor after Japan, with FFr30bn (Pounds
3.7bn) of credits and cheap loans outstanding and an important investor
there.
The deal would be a godsend to Dassault, which has not had a single military
export order for four years and badly needs new business to give a lift to
its dwindling profits.
Dassault, 46 per cent state-owned, makes nearly three-quarters of its sales
to the French military.
Like many of its counterparts, the French Defence Ministry has been forced
to curb spending, even to the extent of trimming orders for the Rafale,
Dassault's future jet fighter due for delivery from 1997.
The Taiwan deal would be a boon to the French defence industry generally, at
a time when export sales, at FFr34.2bn last year, are stagnating. Other
potential beneficiaries are Thomson-CSF, the defence electronics group which
supplies radar for the Mirage 2000-5, and Matra, supplier of air-to-air
missiles.

FT  19 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Last-minute push to win US-EC pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US AND EC trade negotiators last night were set for a determined attempt in
Washington to settle a long-standing row over European oilseeds subsidies.
Twelve trade and farm negotiators from both sides planned to meet for two
hours immediately after EC officials flew in to Washington. Talks are to
resume this morning with EC negotiators planning to return to Brussels
tonight to report back tomorrow to member states.
EC trade commissioner Frans Andriessen said last night he believed the
parties could quickly resolve the dispute. He told reporters on arrival: 'We
do believe we can make it.'
But Paris yesterday denounced the Gatt deal Brussels is likely to conclude
on agriculture with the US, but did not spell out exactly how it will react.
After an inner cabinet meeting, the French government said the conditions
for a global and balanced Gatt accord did not exist, recalling France's
opposition to any curbs on farm output going beyond last May's EC reforms.
An official said the French parliament would probably debate the issue next
week. Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy urged French politicians to unite to
defend French farmers' interests. At the same time, France yesterday claimed
backing from EC member states in its effort to limit farm trade concessions
in the Community's negotiations with the US today in Washington.
A majority of the 12 insist on a 'balanced' agreement with the US, so that
any farm trade deal must be compatible with the EC's reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP), French officials in the Council of Ministers say.
More significant, they add, is that Denmark, the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium
and Ireland support France's demand that any agreement to cut subsidised
food exports should be less onerous to EC farmers than the deal thought
likely to emerge in Washington tonight.
The Washington talks, between Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner,
and Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, are aimed at settling the EC-US
row over oilseeds and clearing the way for world trade liberalisation
through the Uruguay Round. They follow the breakdown of negotiations in
Chicago on November 3, after which the US imposed Dollars 300m (Pounds 198m)
punitive tariffs on EC food exports, effective December 5, threatening the
prospect of a full-blown trade war.
The French account of Monday night's meeting of EC farm ministers in
Brussels is at odds with the conclusions drawn by the current UK presidency
of the EC, and the European Commission. Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, France's
agriculture minister, accused the Commission and Mr John Gummer, his UK
counterpart, of 'political manipulation'.
Monday's Council meeting was for ministers only, magnifying the opportunity
to present one-sided accounts of what transpired. The propaganda war inside
the EC has heated up as conviction has grown on all sides that a deal is
close.
Mr Soisson produced a paper containing almost the same statistics as at
Monday's Council, but all accounts agree he failed to impress his
colleagues.
France seems to be trying to make it hard for Mr MacSharry to get EC
endorsement of any deal, but almost certainly with a view to extracting more
concessions for French and EC farmers. A Commission meeting has been set for
Friday night, to examine any Washington package. But the 12 have still to
decide if some combination of foreign, trade and farm ministers will have
final approval.
If a breakthrough occurs on oilseeds, negotiators hope to agree a framework
for wider reform of Europe's farm subsidies regime. Talks would then shift
immediately to Geneva, where all the 108 countries involved in the Uruguay
Round could 'multilateralise' the US-EC pact and negotiate long-delayed
international trade reforms embracing services, investment, tariff cuts,
textiles and improved protection for intellectual property.
Failure to reach agreement today would pave the way for US imposition on
December 5 of 200 percent tariffs on Dollars 300m worth of EC white wines,
rapeseed oil and wheat gluten. An additional Dollars 700m in punitive
tariffs could be levied on EC farm and industrial products if no settlement
is reached.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S generic drugs industry has warned that the sale of cheap medicines
to developing countries will be imperilled if a proposed law to tighten
patent protection for brand-name pharmaceuticals is passed. The warning is
part of action by the industry against a bill, C-91, introduced in
parliament in Ottawa this week. It will extend the same 20-year patent
protection to medicines as applies to other products, fulfilling Canada's
pledges under the Uruguay Round trade talks.
It means the end of a 23-year 'compulsory licensing' system which has
allowed cheap, generic medicines to be distributed within a few years of the
brand-name products. Compulsory licensing has made Canada's generic industry
one of the world's biggest. The industry is angry that Bill C-91, soon
likely to become law, will be retroactive to last December. This provision
would nullify pending compulsory licensing applications on about 35
products.
An official at Apotex, the largest generic producer, said the new licensing
curbs would hamper exports, a quarter of the company's total output. Apotex
sells to 80 countries. It says many developing nations follow Ottawa's lead
in approving medicines for sale. 'If we're not licensed to sell it in
Canada, we can't export it.'
The industry contends that by delaying introduction of their products, the
new law will raise drug costs. Ontario's Drug Benefit Plan, giving free
medicines to aged and welfare recipients, estimates generic products save it
CDollars 80m-CDollars 100m (Pounds 42m-Pounds 52m) a year.

FT  19 NOV 92 / World Trade News: An airline decision born of embarrassment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE decision by Japan's airlines to remove the ceiling on compensation to
victims of accidents on international flights was born of embarrassment
shared by most world airlines and their insurers that limits on compensation
set by international conventions are too low.
Dissatisfaction with liability limits set by international agreements
stretches back to 1955, when the US refused to be party to the Hague
Protocol doubling the original compensation limits of Dollars 10,000 (now
Pounds 6,622) set by the Warsaw Convention in 1929. When the Convention was
adopted, a cap on liability was seen as necessary to protect the infant
aviation industry from catastrophic loss for which adequate insurance cover
might not be available.
But by 1955 the industry was well established and the US refusal to ratify
the Hague Protocol (because Congress felt Dollars 20,000 was inadequate
compensation for the loss of an American life) marked the beginning of the
end of uniformity on the issue of liability. The US remained a party to the
1929 convention but by 1966 had persuaded air carriers serving the US to
adopt the Montreal Agreement limiting liability to Dollars 75,000 regardless
of fault for all flights starting or ending in the US.
In 1971 a further attempt to raise the limit to Dollars 100,000 and restore
uniformity was made in Guatemala. Among other features, the Guatemala
Protocol allowed parties to it to adopt a domestic system to supplement the
legal liability limits for passengers.
The US had been a prime mover in trying to lift the compensation limits, but
did not sign the protocol, which could not come into force without US
participation. Instead, it tried in 1975 to amend the Montreal Agreement by
adding protocols, the third of which, Montreal Agreement Protocol 3 (MAP3),
dealt with liability, raising maximum limits to Dollars 130,000.
MAP3 picked up many features of the Guatemala Protocol, allowing states
which are parties to it to set up supplemental compensation plans (SCPs), so
that a two-tier system would arise under which airlines could be liable for
the first Dollars 130,000 per passenger and the SCP, for which passengers
would pay an enforced levy, would be expected to provide compensation above
that amount.
The UK and a number of other Warsaw countries have ratified MAP3, but by the
time of this year's US election, the US had not done so, and had not
introduced an SCP. MAP3 cannot come into force until 30 states have ratified
it; that is unlikely to happen until the US signs.
International air carriers thus face an impasse on liability.
The Japanese move to adopt a special liability contract within the Warsaw
Convention is an attempt to break the logjam and is likely to be followed by
other carriers unless the industry, through the International Air Transport
Association (Iata), takes steps to restore the uniformity missing since
1955.

FT  19 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Statistics and contraries muddy Gatt farm
deal - Unknown variables make search for agreement almost an impossible
quest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF MR Ray MacSharry can bring back a package resolving EC-US food export
disputes and opening the way for a Uruguay Round trade reform deal from
Washington, he will have to show it is compatible with the EC's reform of
its Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).
Mr MacSharry, EC farm commissioner, who knows the figures of Europe's top
farm bureaucracy, the European Commission's directorate-general VI,
thoroughly, is sure he can. France, which opposes a deal, says it will be
lopsided against EC and French farmers, and has sent officials to Brussels
with satchels of figures to say he cannot. The US, from which Mr MacSharry
and the EC have to extract a deal to avert trade hostilities next month,
wants proof he can deliver: a tough proposition when the sceptical French
are the EC's main food exporters.
The swirl of Commission figures, and contrary French statistics on the
impact of CAP reform and the farm trade obligations of a Gatt deal, will not
easily settle into a stable pattern accepted by all. If economic forecasting
and industrial trends are acknowledged to be sub-scientific, predicting the
course of agriculture, vulnerable to vagaries such as the weather, is near
impossible.
For the purposes of a Gatt deal, the reformed CAP looks like a gamble. But
it is one agreed by all 12 member states in May, and passed into law in
July. The bet is on future prices and production levels for food. Yet it is
a bet in a new framework, containing four main elements: two linked
variables, and two constraints.
Brussels claims CAP will cut the exportable surplus of cereals - linchpin of
the reform and the most inflammatory part of the Uruguay Round farm chapter
 -to 19m tonnes in three years. It says Gatt would still allow subsidised
exports of 23.5m tonnes after six years, assuming a worst-case outcome to
the Washington talks of a 24 per cent cut in subsidised sales abroad (21.5
per cent is more likely).
France says CAP production cuts will be exceeded if export volume restraint
exceeds 18 per cent. Beyond this figure, land taken out of production, or
'set aside' under CAP, would have to exceed the 15 per cent currently
agreed. France may be right, up to a point. For the set-aside regime, which
they also agreed to, is variable, up or down depending on whether output is
over or within EC projections.
Which brings in the second variable: price. The CAP aims to set EC prices at
or near world market levels after three years, mainly by dropping cereal
prices by a third. This is for premium grade grains; at least a third of
output will be below this price. In such circumstances, the Commission
argues, there will be little Gatt restraint on exports, and EC produce will
compete favourably with imports.
'The whole philosophy of the CAP reform is to become more competitive
externally and internally,' Mr MacSharry insists. 'There's no limit on
unsubsidised exports.' France perceived this in its initial enthusiasm for
the new CAP when it was agreed in May; the disquieting prospect of a highly
competitive EC farm sector is the unstated element in Washington's
insistence on the firmest curbs on EC exports. French concern in May was
that prices would not be cut enough, thereby imposing an informal quota
through set-aside. If world market prices are reached by 1996, set-aside can
be reduced; if not, France may be in the lead of a drive for lower prices if
output exceeds expectations.
Added to these two variables, the CAP has two constraints, a rigid budget
and the new regime's freezing of crop yields eligible for subsidy. The 12,
including France, agreed to budget 'guidelines' based on Brussels' output
projections. These ceilings are contained in the 'Delors II' future
financing package, yet to be agreed, but reaffirmed by the 12 heads of
government in June. Thus, if output exceeds projections, there will be no
money to subsidise exporting the excess.
France is moving its argument from querying the compatibility of Gatt with
the CAP, to seeking extra compensation for farmers for any deal on the
Uruguay Round and the oilseeds dispute with the US. But even if the budget
goes up, Brussels insists the extra money will not go towards exports. Since
the budgetary system was reformed by Commission president Jacques Delors in
1988, the Commission has resisted breaching the farm spending ceiling.
The second constraint is that compensation for price cuts, and subsidy, is
linked to past crop yields which are frozen. This is a disincentive to
farmers spending on fertiliser and pesticide to extract higher tonnage for
which they will not see a return. Yields are already falling. French figures
claiming 38 per cent set-aside would follow a 'split-the-difference' deal on
oilseeds with the US (fixing output at a de facto 9.5m tonnes a year) are
based on 1991 yields of 2.48 tonnes a hectare, whereas oilseed yields are
down to 2.08 tonnes.
The argument is likely to develop into an examination of whether the new CAP
mechanisms are compatible with any Gatt deal with the US.

FT  19 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Canada warning on drug exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S generic drugs industry has warned that the sale of cheap medicines
to many developing countries will be jeopardised if proposed legislation to
tighten patent protection for brand-name pharmaceuticals is passed.
The warning is part of a rearguard action by the industry against a bill,
C-91, introduced in parliament in Ottawa this week. It will extend the same
20-year patent protection to medicines as applies to other products. This
fulfils Canada's pledges under the Uruguay Round trade talks.
It means the end of a 23-year 'compulsory licensing' system which has
allowed cheap, generic medicines to be distributed within a few years of the
brand-name products. Compulsory licensing has made Canada's generic industry
one of the world's biggest. The industry is angry that Bill C-91, likely to
become law in the next few months, will be retroactive to last December.
This provision would nullify pending compulsory licensing applications on
about 35 products.
An official at Apotex, the largest generic producer, said the new licensing
curbs would hamper exports, which make up a quarter of the company's total
output. Apotex sells to 80 countries, from Vietnam to Morocco and Iran.
Apotex says many developing nations follow Ottawa's lead in approving
medicines for sale. 'If we're not licensed to sell it in Canada, we can't
export it,' the official added.
The industry contends that by delaying introduction of their products, the
new law will raise drug costs. Ontario's Drug Benefit Plan, providing free
medicines to the elderly and welfare recipients, estimates generic products
save it CDollars 80m-CDollars 100m (Pounds 42-Pounds 52m) a year.
The argument is complicated by drug companies' commitment to new research
spending in Canada. Glaxo and Merck are among those recently opening new
facilities. Health-care administrators acknowledge that costs can be
contained by encouraging brand-name companies to develop new drugs to keep
patients out of hospital.
The predicament of the provinces, which administer health-care services in
Canada, is shown by a dispute over AZT, the Burroughs-Wellcome Aids drug.
Apotex has challenged Burroughs' AZT patent and is trying to persuade the
provinces to buy its cheaper, generic version. Ontario has deferred a
decision until the court case is resolved. Meanwhile, it is sticking with
AZT.

<TEXT>
US officials say talks with the EC about farm output statistics have been
'very confusing', David Dodwell, World Trade Editor, reports from
Washington. 'We have often not been sure the Europeans are talking about the
same thing, particularly at the top,' one official said. The numbers are
confusing because 'they all have little tails on them, like 'swing',
'aggregation' and flexibility'.'
As a result, US farm trade negotiators have been careful to provide tables
supporting every set of proposals 'so no doubt exists about what we
proposed. The EC hasn't exactly accepted or rejected these concepts, so we
don't know that when they tell us a percentage has swing or aggregation
whether they're talking about the same swing or aggregation. These things
make a difference to what happens each year, and cumulatively over six
years.'

FT  19 NOV 92 / Clinton gets passport search apology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS by senior Bush administration officials to search the passport files
of Governor Bill Clinton were 'an attempt to use the records and employees
of a government agency to influence the outcome of a presidential election',
a State Department investigation has found.
'We found no major fraud, no massive corruption, no rogue operations
subverting American foreign policy. In a broader sense, however, what we did
find was far more disturbing than any of these,' Mr Sherman Funk, the State
Department inspector general, concluded in a report on the passport search.
Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the acting Secretary of State, said he resented and
regretted the department's involvement in politics, and had offered to
resign immediately. President George Bush had refused his resignation.
'I apologise for the department being in this mess,' he said, looking angry
and hurt at a televised news conference yesterday afternoon.
Mr Funk said his investigation began with rumours that Mr Clinton, who had
just been nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate, sought during
the Vietnam war to give up his US citizenship.
'It is not too much to think that if this information had emerged and been
confirmed, it could have had a decisive impact on the outcome of the
election,' he said.
He said the attempt to use Mr Clinton's passport records for political ends
was 'a very heinous activity, and shame on the Department of State that it
happened'.
Mr Funk said a search of Mr Clinton's passport files after a request under
the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) would have been legal but it had been
conducted with excessive zeal for political reasons.
'Never in our opinion in the annals of the FOIA Act has there ever been a
FOIA search conducted with such urgency, scope and grade level of
participant,' he said.
Mrs Elizabeth Tamposi, assistant secretary for consular affairs, was
dismissed by Mr Bush last week for leading the search, but Mr Eagleburger
said yesterday she was not the only person responsible.
Mr Funk said disciplinary action had been recommended for four people and
censure for several more. He found, however, no evidence that the passport
search was orchestrated or directed by the White House, nor that anyone
above the rank of assistant secretary was involved or had given direction to
the search.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Bush advises successor on trouble spots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bill Clinton yesterday held 90 minutes of talks with President George
Bush on the world's main trouble spots as he paid his first post-election
victory to the White House.
The president-elect, who was at the start of a two-day visit to Washington,
said afterwards
the president had been very helpful. It was a 'terrific' meeting, he said.
'We talked about a dozen potential trouble spots in the world. . . mostly
about the kinds of problems I might face in the rest of the world.' The
discussion ranged over Russia, Bosnia and the Middle East and touched on
rising US medical costs.
Mr Bush has promised full co-operation.
Republican congressional leaders have served notice on Governor Bill Clinton
that they intend to act as his chaperons on his presidential honeymoon.
But although Mr Clinton says he prefers to 'dance with the one that brung
you', he may be tempted from time to time to flirt with his escorts.
Party divisions are rarely clear in the US, and many presidents have
governed with shifting congressional coalitions. Many Republicans are now
hinting that they could be receptive to President-elect Clinton on some
issues, especially if he sticks to the centrist views that he has espoused
as governor.
That is particularly so of some of his fellow-governors, many of whom have
worked with him during his years running Arkansas.
'We will be as supportive as we can with the new president. He can be
assured this group will not take any cheap shots,' said Gov George
Voinovich, president of the Republican Governors' Association.
Mr Voinovich says the number one problem most governors face is the federal
government's habit of issuing new mandates to the states without giving
additional money.
'We take consolation from the fact that he is a governor. He certainly
understands our concern about mandates without money.'
Governor Carroll Campbell of South Carolina, who co-chaired a governors'
taskforce on education with Mr Clinton but who has fought him tooth and nail
over the last six months as head of Mr Bush's re-election campaign in the
South, also takes a conciliatory line.
'Everybody likes Bill. . . There are areas where we can get out there and
support him, and we should,' Mr Campbell said.
But Senator Robert Dole, Republican leader in the US Senate, warns that he
has no plans to give Mr Clinton an easy ride. 'The American people want him
to succeed, but I have never thought as a Republican that it was our
obligation just to give up. Don't expect Bob Dole to hand over the keys of
the place without a fight,' he said this week.

FT  19 NOV 92 / US trade deficit narrows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US trade deficit was Dollars 8.3bn (Pounds 5.5bn) in September, Dollars
300m lower than in August but still one of the biggest in two years,
according to the Commerce Department.
The slight narrowing reflected unexpected strength in exports, which rose
6.8 per cent from August to Dollars 38.2bn, a record in cash terms. The
improvement was broadly based. Imports rose 4 per cent to Dollars 46.5bn,
also a cash record. The increase was concentrated in consumer goods.
Longer-term trends point to a deterioration. Adjusting for the volatility of
monthly figures, exports have barely risen since the spring, while imports
have increased sharply. The deficit for the first nine months was Dollars
60.1bn, compared with Dollars 49.2bn in the same period last year.
Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, yesterday said the
US credit crunch had shown no evidence of worsening in recent months and may
be abating, Reuter reports from Washington. He said banks were more able to
speed up lending to spur growth.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Brazil's new economic double-act: Two unknowns take centre
stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A resounding Who? greeted last month's appointments of Mr Paulo Haddad and
Mr Gustavo Krause, the new double-act controlling Brazil's battered economy.
Unknown to much of Brazil, never mind the rest of the world, the two men are
now preparing to present themselves on the international stage.
Early next month, they will resume negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) in talks long put on hold while the country was absorbed
by the corruption scandal that brought down President Fernando Collor.
Although Mr Krause holds the normally more important portfolio of finance,
it is Mr Haddad, the new planning minister, who has clearly emerged as the
one in charge of economic policy. He seems untroubled by the inevitable
comparison of his provincial experience, as an economist and state planning
secretary in Minas Gerais, with that of his internationally respected
predecessor, Mr Marclio Marques Moreira.
Nevertheless, Mr Haddad - the third economy minister in two years to begin
battle with Brazilian inflation (now running at an annual 1,500 per cent) -
admits his problems are daunting.
Yesterday he was putting the final touches to the short-term economic
programme which the new team will present to the IMF and which he believes
will reassure doubtors of the government's commitment to modernisation.
He feels people are being a little hard on the new team: 'We are up to date
with payments to the World Bank and Interamerican Development Bank. Tomorrow
we will pay almost Dollars 1bn in past-due interest to creditor banks. We
have maintained the opening of the economy. Before the end of year we will
carry out a big privatisation with the sale of National Steel. The facts
speak for themselves.'
He plans to avoid unorthodox measures such as freezing wages and prices or
dollarisation. He says the much-mooted social pact is impossible because
'the co-operative spirit is very small as too many people are benefiting
from the current situation.'
Mr Haddad is betting everything on his fiscal reform package, through which
he hopes to raise at least Dollars 8bn to begin amortising federal debt. He
refuses to be worried by the lack of congressional enthusiasm for the
package, but, he warns: 'If we don't pass it this year, the situation will
be very dramatic, with sweeping cuts even in areas of social policy.'
The privatisation programme will be maintained, but the rules will be
altered for sectors yet to be touched - telecommunications, oil, electrical
and nuclear energy. He says 'the aim is less to sell off assets and more to
incorporate the private sector so the state still co-ordinates these
strategic sectors.'
He admits the government is struggling to formulate a policy on public
sector tariffs. 'When we took office, state companies were all adjusting
their prices in different ways.
The electricity company, for example, was taking monthly monetary correction
and adding 3 per cent. Nobody was looking at cost, efficiency or
productivity but simply passing on waste to consumers.' He points out as an
example that a hydroelectric project in Brazil costs more than twice as much
as it does elsewhere.
Mr Haddad hopes a new tariff policy and consolidation of the privatisation
programme will encourage the return of foreign investors. These changes will
also have to be incorporated into the IMF accord, which requires a 15-17 per
cent real increase in tariffs by the end of 1993.
Technical level talks with the IMF begin next week, to be followed by the
mission led by Mr Haddad. He hopes that before his visit the Senate will
have approved the termsheet for the restructuring of Brazil's Dollars 44bn
commercial debt.
The IMF is likely to ask some tough questions, given Brazil's poor record of
the last decade of never progressing beyond the first instalment in an IMF
loan agreement. But Mr Haddad says he expects a sympathetic reception: 'Such
international institutions come under a lot of pressure from public opinion,
and the fact that they had been negotiating with a corrupt government which
had been wasting a lot of money will mean they will be eager to help the new
administration.'

   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UKRAINIAN prime minister yesterday told parliament the country's
economic crisis was so acute that there was no alternative but to adopt an
ambitious reform programme.
In what amounts to a U-turn in Ukraine's economic policy, Mr Leonid Kuchma
called for the curbing of Ukraine's runaway budget deficit - 44 per cent of
GDP, he said - along with 'forced' privatisation of both large and small
enterprises, an overhaul of the burdensome tax system and a focus on
agriculture as an engine for overall reform.
Together with the stimulation of the private sector, Mr Kuchma plans to
introduce stricter government regulation in some areas. He called for tight
exchange control over all foreign currencies, including the rouble, and
warned that the chaotic and often corrupt state sector would be subject to
closer government control. After reciting a list of bleak economic
indicators, Mr Kuchma told the legislature: 'We have no choice but to build
everything from scratch as we did after the second world war.'
Over the objections of ex-communist hardliners, Mr Kuchma was granted
extraordinary powers until May 1, when parliament can decide whether to
extend them further.
Under the existing system the prime minister, president and parliament share
power, forming an awkward and weak troika. In an effort to break through
this deadlock Mr Kuchma won the right to take extensive economic decisions
unilaterally, and persuaded reluctant MPs to restrict their own authority to
passing economic legislation.
As the director of the world's largest missile factory, Mr Kuchma had been
expected to continue his predecessor's policy of subsidising the massive
state sector. But, since becoming prime minister less than a month ago, he
has concluded that Ukraine can no longer afford to prop up the old regime.
He conceded that the economic situation was worse in Ukraine than in any
other former Soviet republic, citing an 18 per cent decline in GNP and a
22-fold increase in the prices of wholesale goods since the beginning of the
year.
Under the stewardship of Mr Kuchma's predecessor, Mr Vitold Fokin, Ukraine
staved off total collapse by issuing more than Rb400bn of unbacked credit to
bale out faltering state enterprises. That option was closed last week when
Ukraine, to Russia's relief, left the rouble zone.
Mr Kuchma warned Ukrainians that his programme of swifter privatisation and
tighter control over credit would result in bankruptcies and unemployment.
To mitigate these effects he suggested the creation of a work-fare system
whereby the unemployed would be paid a minimum wage to work on government
construction projects.

FT  19 NOV 92 / France seeks new Bosnia conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE said yesterday it was seeking another international conference at
foreign minister level to give fresh impetus to moves to solve the crisis in
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The meeting would involve all the parties to last August's international
peace conference on Yugoslavia in London, notably the 12 European Community
countries, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security
Council, the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations, as well as all
the former Yugoslav republics and neighbouring countries.
The initiative, which is being worked out in co-operation with Italy, is
intended to complement, not to compete with the work of Mr Cyrus Vance and
Lord Owen, co-chairmen of the Geneva peace talks on Yugoslavia, a French
foreign ministry spokesman said yesterday.
The spokesman listed the issues which the French government wanted the
conference to address as minority rights, the division of Bosnia into
regions, the containment of military clashes, the eventual demilitarisation
of the republic, and the possibility of a widening of the UN's role beyond
peacekeeping.
A group of six prominent former world leaders, including two US
ex-presidents and a former British prime minister, yesterday called for
urgent international action to find a solution to the Bosnian problem and to
provide assistance to Bosnian refugees.
In a joint statement, the leaders said the world was witnessing in Bosnia 'a
replay of one of the darkest eras of modern history: the invasion of one
sovereign nation by another. It is the attempted genocide of people who have
lived in peace and tolerance with their neighbours for centuries.'
The declaration was signed by former US Presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald
Ford, Baroness Margaret Thatcher, Mrs Jeane Kirkpatrick, former US
ambassador to the UN, General Alexander Haig, former Supreme Allied
Commander in Europe and US Secretary of State, and Prince Sadruddin Aga
Khan, former UN High Commissioner for Refugees.

SENIOR officials of Russia's central bank yesterday made clear their
intention to strengthen policies designed to prop up ailing state
industries.
They said they were considering lowering the 80 per cent interest rate
charged by commercial banks.
They also said they could reintroduce subsidies paid by the state on imports
of key products.
Mr Valerian Kulikov, the central bank's first deputy chairman, said the move
would reflect the willingness of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president,
and Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, to accommodate the pressures
for support from the state industry bosses. This was made clear at the
weekend in talks between the two men and leaders of the powerful Union of
Industrialists, he adds.
The interest rate, at 80 per cent, is thought punishingly high by
industrialists - though it still represents a strongly negative rate, given
inflation estimated at around 2,000 per cent per annum.
Earlier this week, Mr Yeltsin made Mr Victor Gerahchenko, the central bank
chairman, a member of his government. The move aims to bring the central
bank, which is legally responsible to the parliament, under greater
governmental control.
However, Mr Alexander Khandruyev, a central bank deputy chairman, said
yesterday that while the move would allow for greater co-ordination between
the government and the central bank, the latter would remain answerable to
parliament first.
At the same time, deputies warned yesterday they might move to suspend all
licences allowing foreign banks to hold accounts for Russian citizens. Mr
Alexander Pochinok, chairman of the budget committee, said that the law
would 'stop the capital flight from Russia'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR AGO, corpses littered the streets of Vukovar and not a single
building had escaped damage from the bloody three-month battle for control
of the Croatian town.
Today, the Serbian tricolour flag hangs from burnt-out windows in the
once-picturesque town on the banks of the River Danube.
Serb leaders yesterday held a celebration to mark the 'liberation' of
Vukovar, in which their fighters had routed Croat forces. It was a solemn
occasion. Some 3,000 people died in the battle for Vukovar.
Weeping women laid wreaths at the graves of loved ones as Serb fighters
looked on. But few admitted remorse for the devastation of the town and
defiance was in the air. 'No one will ever again step on the Serbs now,'
said Mr Zoran Milivojevic, an irregular from central Serbia who had fought
in Vukovar.
The cemetery, where Serbian and Croats graves lie next to one another, now
offers the only testimony of the community's once harmonious mixed
population of 50,000 Catholic Croats and Orthodox Serbs.
Only a handful of Croats remain in the town, mainly wives of Serbs.
Serb leaders yesterday vowed they would never cave in to international
pressure against the rump Yugoslavia - which consists of Serbia and
Montenegro. Major Veselin Sljivancin, an army commander of operations in
Vukovar warned that 'Europe and the rest of the world must realise we would
be traitors to those who died, to give in.' At a ceremony in the bombed-out
town centre, families of those fighters killed in battle received medals for
bravery. A cold rain fell on the crowd which listened to a defiant Mr
Vojislav Seselj, an ultra-nationalist and paramilitary leader linked to the
Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic. 'Serbia will never be brought to
its knees. The international community is trying to weaken Serbia . . . but
it will not succeed in breaking up Yugoslavia,' he vowed.
Above the crowd, Mrs Milka Kovacevic, 61, and a Serb, sat in a flat she now
calls home after hers was destroyed by shelling. She was not attending
yesterday's ceremony and was thankful to be alive with power and running
water once again. Mrs Kovacevic was one of some 8,000 Vukovar inhabitants to
hide in a cellar while above her head Serb fighters backed by the Yugoslav
Army fought against Croat forces. Plastic covered the windows and the
ceiling appeared to be falling down. 'I don't care who is in power as long
as there is peace,' she said.

<TEXT>
Imperial Chemical Industries is being investigated by Spanish anti-trust
authorities for sharply, and, allegedly, unfairly, increasing prices at
which it transfers agrochemical products to its largest Spanish joint
venture, ICI Zeltia, writes Peter Bruce.
The owners of Zeltia, a Galician-based chemicals group, have accused ICI of
deliberately depressing profits at their 50/50 joint venture, whose share of
the Spanish agrochemicals market has slipped from second to fourth since the
price increases began in the spring of 1989. ICI said yesterday it believed
the complaint was without foundation.

BRITAIN and the European Commission have 'not yet found common ground' on
the vexed political issue of lifting the UK's border controls on people,
according to Mr Martin Bangemann, EC internal market commissioner, writes
Andrew Hill in Strasbourg.
He said yesterday the nine continental European members of the Schengen free
travel zone were unhappy with a compromise which would allow EC visitors to
Britain simply to wave their passports at immigration control after January
1 1993.
After meeting Mr Kenneth Clarke, British home secretary, in September, Mr
Bangemann was widely understood to have agreed British compromise proposals.
But in an interview with the Financial Times yesterday, he said he had been
misinterpreted and discussions were continuing.
Britain has always argued that controls are essential if non-EC travellers
are to be properly monitored.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Schlesinger gives warning on rules for moving to single
currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE conditions governing the European Community's planned shift to a common
currency are already weak and unclear and there is a danger they could be
further diluted, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the German Bundesbank,
warned yesterday.
Spelling out the central bank's reservations to members of the European
parliament in Strasbourg, Mr Schlesinger virtually denounced as inadequate
the criteria laid down in the Maastricht treaty.
While striving to avoid attracting charges of political interference,
couching his comments in the context of statements from Chancellor Helmut
Kohl and other politicians, he noted: 'The German population and parliament
should agree to give up the D-Mark only if there is to be no lazy compromise
in the selection of countries for monetary union.'
'The convergence criteria are not very clear and also not especially
strict,' he said. Permissible limits for national deficits were 'as a rule
too high'.
Mr Schlesinger said conditions governing price rises had to be rigorously
interpreted and stood as a 'true test' of member states' commitment to
stability: if monetary union were to go ahead now, countries with inflation
rates of 4.5 per cent could be accepted.
The Frankfurt central bank, which regards a 2 per cent annual rate as merely
tolerable for Germany, has in the past said it would prefer a fixed
inflation rate to the Maastricht formulation. This defines countries with
inflation rates up to 1.5 percentage points above the average of the three
lowest rates in the Community as acceptable participants in monetary union.
The treaty conditions on budgetary discipline appeared to be exacting, but
the permitted upper limit for government deficits - 3 per cent of gross
domestic product - was 'as a rule too high', Mr Schlesinger claimed.
This criterion was also 'particularly open to interpretation'. Even if
member states succeeded in consolidating their budgets in the coming years,
there were likely to be some which would be unable to meet the deficit
criteria.
Mr Schlesinger said later he did not consider there was any need for reform
of the ERM to allow greater central bank intervention.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Sapin wants to broaden EMS links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community should increase its monetary co-operation with
neighbouring countries which have applied to join it in order to promote
stability and growth, Mr Michel Sapin, France's finance minister, said
yesterday.
Mr Sapin, who remarked that President Francois Mitterrand had shifted in
favour of EC enlargement in reaction to Denmark's vote last June against
Maastricht, gave no details of what kind of monetary co-operation he
envisaged with the possible new Community members - Austria, Sweden,
Finland,Switzerland and Norway.
But he said: 'There is a whole range of possibilities between being totally
out (of the EMS) and totally in.'
Some countries such as Sweden have wanted to go beyond pegging their
currencies to the Ecu and negotiating bilateral credit swaps with individual
EC central banks, and have asked for formal associate status in the European
Monetary System. But they were told this was not possible for non-EC
members.
Mr Sapin said creating closer monetary co-operation with EC applicant
countries would 'just involve doing now what we would have to do later
anyway'.
In contrast to the opening of formal enlargement negotiations, such monetary
co-operation would not depend on ratification of the Maastricht treaty,
because the EMS is 'only an arrangement between central banks'.
The minister also said that while he saw no need for any fundamental reform
of the EMS, the fact that foreign exchange markets lacked the sort of rules
which existed in bond, equity and futures trading should be examined at a
wider, international level. France has asked the Group of 10 countries to
study the issue.
Mr Sapin also rejected suggestions that France had stifled discussion of
possible realignments of EMS parities, and in particular that Mr Jean-Claude
Trichet, the French Tresor director who is chairman of the EC Monetary
Committee, had failed to pass on to the British a German suggestion that the
pound might be devalued. He said Mr Trichet had loyally served both French
and EC institutions, adding: 'The British and Germans should not try to
settle their differences on the back of a third party.'
'In fact,' Mr Sapin claimed, 'I had warned my (EC) colleagues in the weeks
preceding the French referendum on Maastricht that the result would be very
tight, and that they should take care their monetary policies were correct,
because we don't want a big spectacular bust-up.'
In general, he said he continued to regard the EMS as a system of fixed but
adjustable rates. The lesson of the September crisis was that monetary
authorities should take stock, more regularly and more candidly, of possible
divergences between their currencies.
Mr Sapin now considered the French franc to be in 'a fixed system',
particularly with regard to the D-Mark, given that France had a lower
deficit and inflation than Germany. This had helped France win the 'battle
of the franc' in September, as had also the 'very good co-operation' of the
Bundesbank.
The EMS would withstand the unlikely event of the Maastricht treaty not
being fully ratified, Mr Sapin said.
But he stressed that he did not want to go ahead with a smaller monetary
union with Germany and the Benelux countries. 'It is in all our interests
that the zone of monetary stability is as wide as possible.'

FT  19 NOV 92 / EC plans big public works programme: Commission initiative
aims to halt Europe's slide into slump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and DAVID BUCHAN AND WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission wants closer monetary co-operation and a
multi-billion-pound public works programme to break Europe's deflationary
cycle.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, is pushing the plan in order to
revive confidence and avoid Europe's economic slowdown turning into a slump.
The Commission's plan is backed by France. In an interview with the
Financial Times yesterday, Mr Michel Sapin, French finance minister, called
for a growth initiative to be adopted at next month's EC summit in
Edinburgh. Mr Sapin, who starts two days of talks in London today, will
outline his ideas when he sees Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the
exchequer, tomorrow.
An EC-led stimulus package requiring pledges of new funds is likely to meet
resistance from Germany, which is saddled with huge budget deficits because
of the cost of unification. Bonn is expected to voice scepticism that a
centralised Brussels-led infrastructure programme could conflict with the
EC's idea of enhancing subsidiarity.
Bonn officials suspect that the proposals could represent an effort to
persuade countries such as Spain that the EC's difficulties will not hold up
infrastructure programmes.
Hopes of winning special conditions for Denmark to allow it to approve the
Maastricht treaty are threatened with a Spanish veto unless generous
'cohesion' funds for poorer countries are also approved. The UK, currently
the EC president, also has reservations about the Delors plan, which was
informally discussed before the special EC summit in Birmingham last month.
A spokesman for Mr John Major, the prime minister, said yesterday that 'no
new work was going on' at intergovernmental level on a growth initiative. He
said the EC should concentrate its efforts on securing a Gatt deal.
In Brussels, EC officials said the public investment programme could involve
new European Investment Bank loans of around Ecu5bn (Pounds 4.06bn), backed
by government guarantees and aimed at stimulating further private
investment.
Another idea is to create an institution called the European Investment Fund
to boost spending on roads, rail and communications. All EC governments
would be asked to shift priorities from current to capital spending.
A senior EC official said the public works programme was only 'one element'
of a wider strategy aimed at persuading member states and the US to promote
world growth.
For Mr Delors, the growth initiative is partly aimed as a springboard to a
political comeback after recent setbacks. Mr Delors also wants the Community
to show it can respond collectively to economic crisis, and not let member
states such as the UK pursue solo plans for growth.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Community's social action plans succumb to sabotage and
recession: How some high hopes have been brought down to earth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'social dimension' of the European Community relaunched by Mr Jacques
Delors in 1989 is proving a disappointment to many of its supporters,
especially Europe's trade unions.
Slower growth in Europe and successful sabotage by Britain has ensured that
only a small number of the key measures contained in the 1989 social action
programme have been adopted.
If the Maastricht treaty is passed, its 'social chapter', which excludes
Britain, should make it easier to push through more social and employment
legislation by majority vote.
But even that looks unlikely as some of the leading strategists inside the
European Commission's Directorate-General 5 - the social affairs directorate
 -privately speculate about a less ambitious approach to legislation.
Social affairs officials appear to have taken some of the British criticisms
about over-centralised, over-prescriptive, legislation to heart. They are
thus concentrating their attention on the idea - included in the social
chapter - that the European Trades Union Congress (ETUC) and Unice, the
European employers' body, should agree the details of European social and
employment law between themselves.
This idea, with the Commission itself merely laying down general objectives,
is likely to appeal to whoever takes over from Ms Vasso Papandreou, the
current social affairs commissioner from Greece.
The idea does not, however, appeal to the ETUC. At a recent conference in
Greece, Mr Jean Lapeyre, its deputy general secretary, said: 'The trouble is
European employers are only willing to negotiate with us if there is a
threat of legislation.'
There is, nevertheless, some evidence that the idea is sticking. The
Commission recently withdrew a health and safety directive on transport
because it was not flexible enough. Even more shocking to Europe's unions
were recent comments made by Mr Hermanus van Zonneveld, a senior Commission
official, who appeared to suggest at a conference in the UK that the EC was
losing interest in legislating on European works councils - consultation
committees in European multinationals.
The Commission insists that it has not dropped its commitment to legislation
and was merely encouraging unions to use the potential leverage in the
social chapter.
But IG Metall, the main German union, is said to be ready to 'drive tanks
into Brussels' to make sure that the commitment to works councils is
maintained. And Mr Marcello Malentacchi, general secretary of the
International Metalworkers' Federation, has written to the Commission saying
that works councils are the most important part of the social dimension.
The reason why unions are so obsessed by works council, which are merely
consultative bodies, is that they see them as the first step towards the
long-held goal of cross-border collective bargaining. It was the Maastricht
treaty's ability to deliver on works councils, plus the fact that the social
partners, unions and employers, were given formal recognition in a major
international treaty, that persuaded union leaders around Europe to give
their qualified backing to Maastricht.
On the face of it that support is rather surprising. The anti-inflation,
anti-devaluation, principles built into economic convergence mean that wages
and employment will have to take the strain of adjustment in Europe's less
successful economies. Even the pre-Maastricht moves towards convergence are
causing a wave of strikes in Spain and Italy led by the very unions that are
supporting the even more stringent convergence conditions of the treaty
itself.
If the social dimension sweetener is now being taken away as well, it is no
wonder that Europe's unions are feeling a bit exposed on their Europhile
flank.
But arguably the unions are interpreting the social dimension too narrowly.
Since 1989 about 60 per cent of the social action programme has been passed.
Admittedly much of the legislation, for example on maternity pay or working
time, has been watered down, but there is still much of value from a union
point of view.
There has been a consistent trickle of health and safety legislation, with
another batch due for implementation at the beginning of next year. The
written proof of employment directive, passed last year, could also
significantly improve the rights of the most vulnerable workers.
Even the working time directive, which is unlikely to be passed this year
under the British presidency but will probably be passed early next year,
has some useful protection for workers forced to work dangerously long
hours, and might encourage more job creation and less overtime when the
upturn comes.
Further, in Britain, the government's current drive to contract out central
government services has been thrown into confusion by one of the oldest
pieces of EC employment legislation known as the acquired rights directive.
Like so much else in the EC, enthusiasm for the social dimension waxes and
wanes. After the spurt of the late 1980s the outlook for the social
dimension is currently bleak, but it would be foolish to write its obituary.

IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK's largest manufacturer, is being
investigated by Spanish anti-trust authorities for sharply, and, allegedly,
unfairly, increasing the prices at which it transfers agrochemical products
to its largest Spanish joint venture, ICI Zeltia.
The owners of Zeltia, a Galician-based chemicals group, have accused ICI of
deliberately depressing profits at their 50/50 joint venture, whose share of
the Spanish agrochemicals market has slipped from second to fourth since the
price increases began in the spring of 1989.
ICI Zeltia's net profits fell from Pta542m (Pounds 3.13m) in 1988 to Pta186m
the following year, and to Pta96m in 1990. Spain's once-moribund Court for
the Protection of Competition, recently given a new lease of life by the
government, has agreed to investigate Zeltia's complaints.
ICI said yesterday it believed the complaint was without foundation.
ICI Zeltia has been distributing ICI products in Spain since 1964 under an
agreement Zeltia's lawyers now say conflicts with a 1989 law guaranteeing
free competition as it prevents the joint venture from exporting any of its
product out of Spain.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN and the European Commission have 'not yet found common ground' on
the vexed political issue of lifting the UK's border controls on people,
according to Mr Martin Bangemann, EC internal market commissioner.
Mr Bangemann said yesterday the nine continental European members of the
Schengen free travel zone were unhappy with a compromise which would allow
EC visitors to Britain simply to wave their passports at immigration control
after January 1 1993.
After meeting Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British home secretary, in September,
Mr Bangemann was widely understood to have agreed British compromise
proposals.
But in an interview with the Financial Times yesterday, the commissioner
said he had been misinterpreted and discussions were continuing. 'What I'm
interested in is having a practical situation at the borders which shows
(member states) are taking on board what we believe is essential, and that
is: no regular controls at internal borders.'
He believes the Commission position has a strong foundation in EC law,
although he said yesterday he did not want a legal dispute with member
states on the issue.
Britain disagrees with the Commission's legal interpretation and has always
argued that controls are essential if non-EC travellers are to be properly
monitored.
British officials yesterday agreed that the question of how to resolve the
dispute was still open. Mr Bangemann hopes to continue discussions with Mr
Clarke when EC immigration ministers meet in London at the end of this
month. 'What I need is a declaration that these regular controls will not be
exercised (after January 1 1993) and a practical situation demonstrating
willingness not to exercise them,' he said yesterday.
Britain is not alone in its reluctance to lift border controls on people.
Denmark and Ireland also have specific problems, and even the nine Schengen
countries are worried that controls on external EC frontiers may not be
strong enough to justify lifting border checks so soon.

<TEXT>
THE British government yesterday defended its decision to delay a final
Westminster vote on the Maastricht treaty in front of angry members of the
European Parliament.
The decision to postpone the vote until May - after Denmark's second
referendum on the treaty - was criticised by some MEPs during a debate on
the Danish problem in Strasbourg.
But Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, UK Foreign Office minister, said the MEPs were
ignoring the political risks run by Mr John Major, the British prime
minister.
Stressing that he was speaking as a British minister, and not as
representative of the EC presidency, Mr Garel-Jones said: 'My government,
and my prime minister, staked a very great deal indeed on the recent vote in
our parliament.'
Mr Major is understood to have promised the postponement to recalcitrant
backbenchers as the price for their support. Privately, UK officials believe
that without that promise, the treaty might have been blocked and the outcry
from Britain's European partners would have been even greater.
'If you want leadership from John Major, you should calculate the risks that
he took for the Maastricht treaty a week or two ago,' Mr Garel-Jones told
MEPs.
Referring to opposition MPs who voted against the treaty, Mr Garel-Jones
said the Labour party had been 'playing Russian roulette' with it. 'The
British government is not prepared to do that and we will proceed with
caution and with certainty,' he said.
Separately, he dismissed as 'dangerous talk' suggestions that Denmark might
have to leave the EC. 'Small nations must be comfortable in the Community,'
he said.

FT  19 NOV 92 / October retail sales show small increase in volumes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SMALL rise in UK consumers' spending in shops triggered some optimism
yesterday that Britain may be moving slowly out of its two-year recession.
Expectations about the faltering recovery were helped by small cuts in
interest rates in Belgium and the Netherlands, which suggested that Europe
as a whole may be able to move towards easier borrowing conditions over the
next few months as a result of signs of economic slowdown in Germany.
News that retail sales volumes rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent in
October compared with September surprised the City, which had been prepared
for a small downturn.
In the three months to October 30, retail volumes increased by 0.9 per cent
compared with the previous three months.
The figures from the Central Statistical Office suggest that consumers took
a relatively sanguine view of the run of bleak economic news since the
summer, including Britain's forced exit from the European exchange rate
mechanism.
On the London stock market, investor sentiment was also buoyed by hopes of a
further cut in UK base rates, now at 7 per cent. Buying by institutional
investors boosted the FT-SE 100 index of leading stocks by 24.8, to a close
of 2,704.0. Buying pressure was supported by a strong tone to dealing on
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 14.05 to 3,207.37.
Sterling was affected little by the day's events, closing in London in quiet
trading unchanged against the D-Mark at DM2.43, and a tenth of a cent up
against the dollar at Dollars 1.5210. In New York it closed at DM2.4257 and
Dollars 1.526.
The central banks of the Netherlands and Belgium moved to take advantage of
the recent signs of weakness in the D-Mark, making limited cuts in their
dealing rates.
While the Dutch central bank cut its special advances rate to 8.70 per cent
from 8.80 per cent, Belgium reduced its overnight rate to 9.20 per cent from
9.25 per cent.
The figures for UK retailing, which accounts for about a quarter of the
economy, showed sales volumes in the latest three-month period were up 1.6
per cent on the equivalent period last year. Sales of household goods were 6
per cent up on a three-monthly basis measured over the past year, while food
retailers saw an 0.7 per cent increase in volumes over this period.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, seized on the rise in retail sales as
among several 'hopeful indicators' pointing to economic revival. The British
Retail Consortium, a trade body, was less impressed. It said that consumer
confidence remained fragile in spite of the rise in sales volumes, and more
government action was needed to boost the economy.
Manufacturers' stocks of semi-finished products fell in the three months to
the end of September by a provisional Pounds 154m at 1985 prices, after
falls of Pounds 1m in the second quarter and Pounds 550m in the first
quarter, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday.
Stocks of finished products in factories increased by Pounds 306m.
Wholesalers' stocks were down by Pounds 207m, compared with a fall of Pounds
237m in the previous quarter.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Japanese airlines to scrap limit on liability for victims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S airlines are set to become the first in the world to remove the
ceiling on compensation paid to victims of international air disasters.
In a move which could transform international agreements on airline
liability for the death and injury of passengers, 10 Japanese airlines - led
by Japan Air Lines - will tomorrow abandon the ceiling of about Dollars
140,000 (Pounds 90,000) adopted under the 1929 Warsaw Convention.
The scheme should reduce the delay in obtaining compensation for victims of
air disasters by cutting out the need to litigate in most cases. Victims and
their families will be able to negotiate settlements directly with airlines
which will take responsibility for recovering money from aircraft and engine
manufacturers where appropriate.
The initiative follows 21 years of failed industry attempts to raise
compensation limits under the convention and the 1966 Montreal Agreement,
which sets a limit of Dollars 75,000 per passenger for flights to and from
the US. Warsaw Convention limits which range from Dollars 10,000 to nearly
Dollars 140,000 are widely regarded as too low and an embarrassment to most
airlines and their insurers in the event of a crash.
JAL was also under pressure to break the international compensation ceilings
following average settlements believed to be in the region of Dollars
850,000 per passenger paid to victims of the 1985 JAL Boeing 747 crash.
Jap-an lifted the compensation ceiling on domestic flights in 1982.
Mr Peter Martin, an aviation lawyer with London solicitors Frere Cholmeley,
which pioneered the special revised conditions of carriage for JAL,
predicted yesterday that all major airlines would be forced to follow suit.
Once the JAL scheme became widely known, resentment among travellers not
receiving the same compensation terms as passengers on Japanese airlines
could build up, he said. British Airways is believed to be working on a
similar scheme under which the airline would waive limits on liability if
the passenger or his family could prove airline negligence by the airline in
the English courts which would entitle him to English levels of damages.
Aviation experts say the BA scheme is flawed and unattractive to US
passengers, the biggest sector of the market. In situations such as the Pan
Am Lock-erbie crash, they would rather sue aircraft manufacturers and engine
makers in the US where damages awards are higher.
Mr Mervyn Walker, BA's general counsel, denied yesterday that the airline
had firm plans to follow JAL's lead. 'I'm sure others will follow suit, but
we were reviewing our position before JAL announced its move and we will
continue to do so. It may result in a change in our position and it may
not,' he said.
The biggest question surrounding the Japanese move, however, is the effect
on insurance premiums. JAL approached the world insurance market with its
proposal and was well received.
Japanese airlines concede that they were able to bring in unlimited
liability at an acceptable cost because most of their carriage is domestic.
The cost of additional cover for international flights was not significant.

<TEXT>
The World Bank has asked the Philippines to look at the feasibility of
setting up a new bank that would cater to the needs of local exporters
suffering the effects of a strong peso, Reuter reports from Manila.
'I think they are biased towards a separate institution like a Philippine
Eximbank (export-import bank),' trade and industry secretary Rizalino
Navarro said.
He said the proposed bank could tap a Dollars 150m export development fund
from the World Bank.
Mr Navarro said one alternative open to the government was to convert an
existing export-oriented institution.
An Eximbank is seen as an ideal solution to local exporters' financial woes
since it could provide long-term concessional loans and be used as a conduit
for development funds, officials said.
The government could convert the Philippine Export and Guarantee Loan Corp
(Philguarantee) into an eximbank, Mr Navarro said. But the cash-strapped
company would have to be nursed back to health, he said.

President George Bush yesterday said in a letter to Vietnamese President Le

Reuter reports from Hanoi. US Senator John Kerry said the promise was in
response to a big increase in Vietnamese co-operation in recent months to
help resolve the fate of US servicemen missing from the Vietnam war.
Mr Kerry was speaking at the end of a three-day visit.
He did not say whether Washington might ease or lift the trade embargo it
imposed in 1964 or move towards opening diplomatic relations with Vietnam.
The letter was the first direct communication by a US president to a
Vietnamese leader since 1973, when then President Richard Nixon ended the US
combat role in Vietnam.

Speaking on his return from a 10-day mission to Iraq, Mr Dimitri Perricos
said Baghdad had still not complied with UN Gulf war ceasefire requirements
to name suppliers of materials for its nuclear programme.
'So long as they are not replying to this, it is considered a violation,' Mr
Perricos said. He said that disclosure of the supply network was 'an
absolutely essential part of breaking the backbone of the programme.'
Mr Perricos, a scientist from the UN International Atomic Energy Agency in
Vienna, told reporters before leaving Baghdad that the UN was still not
ready to give the Iraqis 'a clean nuclear health bill.'

GERMANY, France and Portugal have sent delegations to Japanese companies to
promote their regions as attractive investment areas. At a time Japanese
manufacturers face sharp profit falls due to the economic slowdown, the
missions want to make their mark ahead of a business recovery.
Their efforts may undermine the UK as a first choice for Japanese
investment, since the Japanese have begun to look at continental Europe for
further investments, due to the large German and east European markets.
"We do not expect Japanese companies to rush into invest just after one
trip,' said Mr Christian Cambon, president of the business promotion agency
from Ile de France, the region which includes Paris.
Mr Cambon and said he and other 25 members were in Tokyo to remove the
negative image many Japanese hold of France. Comments last year by Mrs Edith
Cresson, then prime minister, that Japanese companies want 'to conquer the
world' and that Japan 'doesn't play fair' shocked many Japanese business
leaders. Some 195 Japanese manufacturers have set up operations in the UK,
with only 128 in France and 111 in Germany.
Mr Shigeyuki Onishi, deputy general manager of the Bank of Tokyo's corporate
advisory division, said many Japanese companies were looking to move the
centre of their European operations to continental Europe from the UK. 'More
Japanese companies are focusing on the huge potential of former east
European markets,' he said.

FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y asks to postpone meetings
over debt
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York has asked to postpone a series of meetings scheduled to begin
next week at which the ailing property developer's creditors were due to
vote on its debt-restructuring proposals.
Representatives of two of the 34 creditor groups, who asked not to be
identified, said the company made the request after running into stiff
opposition to the 250-page plan it distributed last month.
O&amp;Y is now expected to propose to its most secured creditors that they can
seize the properties against which their debt is secured. It is also
expected to propose giving unsecured creditors an immediate 90% equity stake
in O&amp;Y.
Opposition to last month's plan has come mainly from Canadian banks and from
bondholders whose claims are secured by specific buildings, including First
Canadian Place, O&amp;Y's 72-storey flagship in Toronto.
Some of these groups are confident that they would be better off seizing
their collateral than agreeing to the concessions proposed by O&amp;Y.
The creditors have demanded a number of concessions in return for agreeing
to delay the votes. The two sides were meeting yesterday afternoon to hammer
out details.
Mr Gerald Greenwald, O&amp;Y president, indicated earlier that the plan might be
modified prior to the votes. An O&amp;Y spokesman said yesterday that
discussions with the creditors were continuing but that 'there has been no
resolution on any amendments to the plan'.
The Ontario court, under whose protection O&amp;Y has been operating since last
May, ordered the meetings to take place between November 25 and 30 in
response to unease among creditors over the mounting costs of the
restructuring effort.
O&amp;Y and the creditors are expected to ask the court within the next few days
to postpone the meetings by about a month.
The restructuring plan covers CDollars 8.6bn (USDollars 6.7bn) of O&amp;Y's
CDollars 13.5bn debt. It excludes Canary Wharf, the London project which is
now under the control of administrators, and negotiations with lenders to
specific O&amp;Y buildings in the US.
The plan proposed the creation of a number of new companies in which
unsecured and under-secured creditors would ultimately be substantial
shareholders.

FT  19 NOV 92 / UK pulls out of fast reactor research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN will announce today its withdrawal from the European Fast Reactor
nuclear research programme, with the loss of up to 400 skilled jobs.
The staff cuts will mainly be at Atomic Energy Authority plants at Risley,
Cheshire, and Dounreay, Caithness.
Withdrawal from the co-operative project with France and Germany spells the
end of UK development of fast reactors - also known as fast breeders.
Unlike conventional nuclear reactors, fast reactors 'breed' their own
plutonium fuel. Since the mid 1950s, the UK government has spent almost
Pounds 2bn on fast reactor research and development.
Mr Brian Eyre, chief executive of AEA Technology, told unions yesterday that
the government would stop paying Pounds 13m a year to fund the UK share of
the research after the project's first design phase ends in March.
The nuclear industry is not prepared to commit its own funds to continue the
programme, which is intended to design a demonstration fast reactor to be
built in the late 1990s, probably in France. The government decided last
summer to close Britain's prototype fast reactor at Dounreay in 1994.
Mr Eyre said he was 'bitterly disappointed' about the government decision
because he believes fast reactors will be essential to achieve the full
potential of nuclear power in the 21st century.
The unions reacted angrily. Mr John Billard, national officer of the
Institution of Professionals, Managers and Specialists, said: 'As we are
pleading with Germany to stay with the European Fighter Aircraft, here we go
pulling out of the EFR. Once again the government is causing huge damage to
Britain's technological capability and international standing by reneging on
its commitments.'
The IPMS said Britain's withdrawal from fast reactor research would leave
the field open not only to France and Germany but also to Russia and Japan,
which were investing heavily in the technology.
But some experts believe that, with uranium and plutonium supplies likely to
remain plentiful for the foreseeable future, fast reactors are an
unnecessary and unwelcome step in the development of nuclear power.
They maintain that it would be better to concentrate on research into fusion
reactors, which are not expected to become available commercially for
another 40 years.

The company, through a wholly-owned local subsidiary, is making an initial

Consortium which is made up of Trintoc, Trintopec and the National Gas
Company.
Enron's investment represents 95 per cent of the financing. It will develop

1993 at 50m cubic feet a day. Output will reach 150m cu ft a day when the
three wells are on stream by 1997.

Ssangyong Motor
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ, the German carmaker which is part of the Daimler-Benz group,
yesterday acquired a 5 per cent shareholding in Ssangyong Motor, South
Korea's fifth biggest vehicle producer, with the formal signing of a
contract in Seoul.
Mercedes is the first European company to hold equity in a Korean automotive
company. It has an option to increase its shareholding to 10 per cent by the
end of 1996.
Mercedes wants to strengthen its presence in Asia to counter regional market
competition from Japan.
Korea's other main vehicle companies already have foreign equity partners,
including Hyundai Motor with Mitsubishi, and Kia Motors with Ford and Mazda.
Daewoo Motor is co-operating with Honda after ending its joint venture with
General Motors last month.
Mercedes and Ssangyong have been co-operating since early last year when the
German company agreed to provide technology for diesel engines and light
commercial vehicles.
Mercedes' proposed acquisition of Ssangyong equity, through the issue of new
shares, was announced in September as part of a deal in which the German
concern would provide technology for the manufacture of gasoline engines.
Ssangyong now produces commercial vehicles and jeeps, but hopes to enter the
passenger car sector as a result of its partnership with Mercedes.
Ssangyong will begin producing trucks, using Mercedes technology, at its
Songtan plant near Seoul in 1994 after completing a new engine plant at
Changwon in southern Korea. It plans to expand the annual production
capacity of the Songtan facility from 30,000 to 160,000 by 1996. It will
export 15,000 of its trucks and vans to Europe, where they will be sold by
Mercedes.
Ssangyong, which had sales of Won401.7bn (Dollars 504.9bn) in 1991, wants to
increase sales to Won1,700bn by 1996.

FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Hollinger revenues rise strongly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLLINGER, the publishing company controlled by Mr Conrad Black, has
reported a substantial rise in revenues and a modest third quarter profit.
The Toronto-based company, whose flagship is the 68 per cent owned UK
Telegraph group, posted net earnings of CDollars 9.1m (USDollars 7.1m), or
13 cents a share, compared with a CDollars 7.8m loss, or 21 cents, a year
earlier.
Revenues jumped by 25 per cent to CDollars 218m.
Mr Jack Boultbee, vice-president for finance, said that a third quarter
profit was something of an achievement considering the normal slow pace of
advertising sales in July and August.
He said the results reflected an upturn in business in almost every part of
the group, as well as the effects of cost-cutting programmes.
Nine-month earnings were CDollars 63.2m, or CDollars 1 a share, up from
CDollars 21.9m, or 18 cents.
The latest figure includes a CDollars 34.2m net gain from the sale of a 9
per cent stake in United Newspapers, a recent Telegraph share issue and
refinancing costs, all of which were reported in the first six months of the
year.
Besides its stake in the Telegraph, Hollinger publishes over 200 - mostly
small - newspapers in North America and owns the Jerusalem Post. The
Telegraph also has a 15 per cent stake in Australia's John Fairfax group.
Earlier this month, Mr Black broadened his base in North American publishing
by becoming the largest single shareholder, with a 23 per cent interest, in
Southam, Canada's biggest newspaper chain.
Hollinger is prevented by a Southam 'poison pill' from immediately buying
more of Southam's stock. But the deal fits the strategy which Mr Black has
favoured in the past - of gaining control of troubled companies by starting
off with a minority stake.

FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: GM to reduce its holding in
National Car Rental Systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors, which is looking to sell off non-core assets, wants to rid
itself of a 'significant part' of its majority per cent stake in National
Car Rental Systems, the large US car rental company.
It also revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
that it might take a fourth quarter charge of some Dollars 300m over
National, though it did not spell out why
But GM added that the charge would be offset by gains from the sales of its
Allison Transmission division and of a 50 per cent holding in Korea's Daewoo
Motor. Both deals were announced earlier. Allison is being sold to ZF
Friedrichshafen of Germany.
GM, which wants both to conserve cash and concentrate on restoring the
profitability of its core North American vehicle operations, is mulling over
the sale of both non-automotive business and some parts operations.
The disposal of National Car Rental Systems represents a significant change
of course since, in the late 1980s, the Big Three Detroit manufacturers
bought up significant stakes in car rental companies in an attempt to
bolster market share.
However, the policy of cut-price deals with both captive and independent
rental companies meant that the Big Three tended to lose money on these
sales, and also saw sales of new cars suffer as the second-hand market was
flooded with lightly-used rental vehicles.
GM bought 45 per cent of National in 1988 and lifted the stake by another 36
per cent at the start of this year.

SAO PAULO Alpargatas, the largest Brazilian footwear and clothing
manufacturer, suffered a loss of Dollars 64m for the first nine months this
year.
The company blamed the deficit mainly on lower sales volume and tight profit
margins, both a result of the country's continued recession. Gross sales
figures for the period were Dollars 361m, compared with Dollars 425m for the
first nine months of last year.
In 1991, the publicly traded company landed in the red for the first time in
56 years, showing a loss of Dollars 38m.
The downturn has forced the company to retrench in a programme which has
included corporate restructuring, the closure of eight of 28 factories, and
layoff of about one third of a workforce that totalled 31,000 in 1990.
Despite the gloomy numbers, Alpargatas is cautiously optimistic about a
recent seasonal increase in demand and a recuperation of margins.
It has also moved to reduce the its debt burden. In December 1991, 51 per
cent of a Dollars 50m debt was in short-term obligations.
By September 1992, with the help of a Euronote issue earlier this year, only
14 per cent of a slightly higher Dollars 52m total was short-term debt.

FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: GAN acquires 10% of Imperio

<TEXT>
GAN, one of France's largest insurance groups, is accelerating its
international expansion by acquiring a 10 per cent stake in Imperio, the
biggest insurer in Portugal.
The investment comes at a time when a number of French insurers are
expanding into other countries. Assurances Generales de France (AGF)
recently strengthened its involvement with AMB of Germany and Union des
Assurances de Paris (UAP) is still locked in negotiations to try to expand
into the German market by taking a stake in Colonia.
France's insurance companies have been hit by the economic slowdown and by
the fall in the value of their property holdings.
However, they have not suffered to the same extent as their counterparts in
the US and UK.
GAN, the smallest of France's big three state-controlled insurers, recently
reported a fall in net profits to FFr487.1m (Dollars 90.37m) in the first
half of this year from FFr961.9m in the same period in 1991.
Imperio controls 12.5 per cent of the Portuguese insurance market with
premiums worth FFr2bn.
The GAN deal is a by-product of a change in control at Imperio which puts
entrepreneur Mr Jose Manuel de Melo back at the helm of Imperio, 17 years
after the company was nationalised.
He is paying the state Es18.4bn (Dollars 130m) for 70 per cent of Imperio.
In a subscription operation for the remaining 30 per cent of capital, GAN
was the leader among 11 foreign investors, acquiring 10 per cent.
Company employees acquired 10.5 per cent and small savers 4.5 per cent, both
at discounted prices.
Mr de Mello, who is rebuilding a financial and industrial empire largely
destroyed by Portugal's post-revolutionary nationalisations of 1975,
indicated he did not plan large management changes.

FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: YJ Lovell gets extension of loan agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YJ Lovell, the UK housebuilder and property developer, has negotiated a
three year loan agreement with its bankers, writes Andrew Taylor.
Mr Robert Sellier, chief executive, said: 'The banks have shown their
confidence in the long term future of the group. I am very grateful for the
support and advice they have given during this prolonged period of difficult
trading.'
In February Lovell announced it had renegotiated a 12 month loan arrangement
after it breached loan covenants linked to its net worth and interest cover.
The deal extends the loan agreement until December 31 1995. Mr Sellier said
that the banks, led by Barclays, had treated the group very fairly.
Lovell reported net debt of Pounds 111m at September 30 1991, including
Pounds 40m off-balance sheet finance. That compared with shareholders' funds
of about Pounds 70m.
Borrowings are understood to have reduced during the past year following
costs cut and restructured finances.

FT  19 NOV 92 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Chelverton poised to take stake
in LBC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 23rd November 1992) appended to this article.
Chelverton, a property and venture capital company chaired by Sir Leslie
Porter, the president of Tesco, is in detailed negotiations to invest some
Pounds 2m in LBC, the London commercial radio station.
In return for the money, as an element of the capital restructuring of the
Crown Communications subsidiary, Chelverton would get a substantial slice of
the equity. Its directors include Mr John Porter, son of Sir Leslie and Dame
Shirley Porter,
The aim would be to stabilise LBC's financial position to allow it to apply
next year for a renewal of its franchise.
Under the restructuring debt would be replaced by equity and Crown's banks -
Bank of Scotland and ANZ - would become sizeable shareholders.
Loss-making Crown would cease to exist as a separate entity after the
disposal of its non-LBC assets and Crown would then be a minority
shareholder in LBC.
As part of the deal Mr David Haynes, the present chief executive, would stay
on as chief executive of the reformed LBC. It is envisaged that Lady Porter,
a former non-executive director of Capital Radio, would become a director.
The Porter money would not be available in one tranche but would be tied to
performance targets.
The restructuring is clearly a risk based on the premise that LBC can retain
its franchise.
CORRECTION
Sir Leslie Porter has retired from Tesco. In yesterday's story on LBC we
referred to him as president of Tesco.

FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Interest charges behind 20% fall at Young &amp;
Co's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits before tax at Young &amp; Co's Brewery showed a 20 per cent decline,
from Pounds 3.07m to Pounds 2.45m, for the six months to September 26.
However, Mr John Young, chairman of the south London-based brewer, was quick
to point out that the fall was partly attributable to high interest rates
during the period - interest charges jumped Pounds 685,000 to Pounds 1.7m;
profits at the trading level improved 8.3 per cent to Pounds 4.15m.
The previous period included a profit of Pounds 247,780 from the disposal of
Young's stake in Taunton Cider.
Mr Young said the poor summer had 'badly affected' riverside and garden pubs
while recession hit houses in the City.
Nevertheless, turnover, taking in a full contribution from HH Finch, rose
some 16 per cent to Pounds 37.4m (Pounds 32.1m). Barrelage was 6.2 per cent
higher, Mr Young added.
He was 'reasonably optimistic' about the outlook: 'We estimate that the new,
lower interest rates will lead to a saving of Pounds 400,000 in the second
half.'
The interim dividend is maintained at 7p, payable from earnings of 12.27p
(15.45p).

FT  19 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Companies challenge allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE reaction of British companies named in Labour's list as alleged to have
traded in arms and related equipment with Iraq was mostly low-key. It was
claimed that the information was either not new or did not relate to
defence.
British Aerospace reacted dismissively to its inclusion in the list, along
with the Royal Ordnance arms manufacturer which it took over in 1987. The
company said it always scrupulously adheres to government approvals in all
its activities. 'This is a party political activity and we have no comment
on it.'
ICL, the UK-based computing services company now controlled by Fujitsu of
Japan, agreed it had supplied computer peripherals to Iraq during the period
in question but categorically denied that any trade regulations had been
breached.
The company said: 'ICL traded in Iraq until August 1990 and the Iraqi
Ministry of Defence was one of our customers. We provided mainframe computer
equipment to the Iraqi Ministry of Defence between 1988 and 1990.'
Racal is identified as having supplied battlefield radios. The electronics
company said: 'This all came up last year. Racal has historically supplied
tactical radios to Iraq, with the full knowledge of the government and the
relevant export licences. The last orders were taken in the mid-1980s and
the last deliveries were in 1989.'
Thorn EMI said it exported a 'small quantity' of Cymbeline battlefield
radars to Iraq in 1974. Over the following years the electronics group
'received a number of logistics orders' from Iraq. These were for spares,
maintenance and training required for Cymbeline, but it had supplied no new
radars after 1974.
Bimec Industries is also named on the list as having supplied a metal
treatment plant, but yesterday the company said it was no secret that it had
supplied a plant for phosphating and zinc-plating small metallic objects,
along with another plant for spray-painting office furniture, in 1988 and
1989 respectively.
Gatewood Engineering and the former Blackwood Hodge, owned since November
1990 by the BM Group, are named for supplying earth-moving equipment.
Although the financial relationship between the two companies is not clear,
it is understood that Gatewood supplied equipment in Middle East markets
where Blackwood Hodge could not do business because of its trading links
with Israel.
Mr Dick Cameron, a former joint managing director of Blackwood Hodge, said:
'Someone has dreamed up the idea that these 40-tonne off-highway dumptrucks
could be used for carrying bombs.'
Marconi, GEC's defence subsidiary, said it had sold the A-METS artillery
meteorological system to Iraq in 1970 and have since supplied spares, all
under Department of Trade and Industry export licences.
Rolls-Royce said it had supplied refurbished engines for Jet Provost
training aircraft under DTI licence.
The list includes three companies - Astra Holdings, Walter Somers and
Sheffield Forgemasters - involved directly or indirectly in supplying
components for the Iraqi supergun project.
A legal case in connection with the supergun affair against Walter Somers
was dropped on the grounds of insufficient evidence in November 1990. The
company was not available for comment last night, but in evidence submitted
to the Commons trade and industry committee Walter Somers said that it had
been told by the DTI an export licence for steel - supposedly for a
petrochemical project - was not required.
Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick and Partners, a Glasgow-based consultancy, was one
of 36 British companies named earlier this year in a US Senate report, which
suggested it had been involved in the design of air bases and bunkers with
hardened shelters for aircraft in about 1985 or 1986. The company could not
be contacted yesterday. However, in March a senior partner said he did not
know whether the shelters were ever built.

THE OFFICIALS
Exporters contact government (DTI) if licences required.
Tony Steadman was head of the export licensing unit when
many UK exports to Iraq were approved.  A grade seven
civil servant, he would advise the trade minister how
export guidelines should be interpreted.  He also
briefed Alan Clark before the crucial meeting with
machine tool company executives in January 1988 on how
they should fill in their export applications.
THE COMMITTEE
If licences were required, applications would go to the
inter-departmental committee. This consisted of officials
from the DTI, the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign
Office.  In 1988 the committee met 12 times, in 1989
nine times and in 1990 11 times.  The IDC was set up
in early 1980s to deal specifically with licences
for Iran and Iraq.  In 1989 the value of export licence
applications approved totalled Pounds 50m for Iran and
Pounds 130m for Iraq.  Those refused amounted to Pounds
70m for Iran and Pounds 20m for Iraq.  In the period
up to the following June - just before Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait - approvals were Pounds 120m for Iran and
Pounds 75m for Iraq.  Those refused were Pounds 5m for
Iran and Pounds 1m for Iraq.
THE MINISTERS
In difficult cases, applications were referred to ministers
This would normally be at minister of state level -
William Waldegrave, Alan Clark and Lor Trefgame - for most
of the period involved.  But evidence given to the
supergun inquiry by a Foreign Office official confirmed
that it could be any minister from secretary of state down.
THE CLIENTS*
Hutteen State Establishment:  Subordinate to Iraq's State
Organisation of Technical Industries (SOTI) which is
responsible fo the conventional defence industries.  SOTI
is in turn responsible to both the Ministry of Defence
and the Ministry of Industry and Minerals.  Hutteen is
the main ammunition manufacturing plant in Iraq.
Naser Establishment for Mechanical Industries: A plant
involved in armaments manufacture.  Among other things
it sought to buy moulding machinery to produce
polyurethane internal filler parts for missiles.
* For machine tools, weapons and defence-related equipment

THAMES Television has been given two weeks to come up with evidence of firm
funding for its attempt to launch a fifth television channel in the UK.
The Independent Television Commission was expected to make a decision on
Channel 5, which should reach 70 per cent of the UK population, at its

Instead a decision was deferred until its next meeting on December 17. It is
believed that the postponement was at the request of Thames - which is the
main driving force behind Channel Five Holdings, the only company to bid for
the franchise. The company is in negotiations with a number of potential

FT  19 NOV 92 / GEC to restore pay-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION negotiators yesterday claimed victory when GEC Avery, the
Birmingham-based weighing equipment subsidiary of the UK electronics and
electrical engineering group, agreed to restore an enhanced redundancy pay
agreement for more than 2,000 workers.
The agreement, due to be signed today, wins back the right to redundancy pay
for workers employed before April 6. It had been cut about two years ago as
part of an economy drive. The move follows a damages award by the High Court
to a former employee made redundant on inferior terms. The company has
agreed to pay unions' court costs of Pounds 130,000.
The company does not accept the unions' argument that redundancy pay had
formed part of workers' contracts. The new agreement sets redundancy pay on
a contractual footing for the first time.
'At the end of this process we have achieved an agreement with which we are
satisfied,' the company said. It refused to comment on the detail of the
agreement.
The company has agreed to pay 60 former employees who had been made
redundant on inferior pay compensation equivalent to the enhanced pay, as
well as 15 per cent interest.
The MSF technical and professional union said the company's concession added
weight to growing evidence that almost all GEC companies, employing 80,000
workers in the UK, would have to reassess their policy of squeezing
redundancy pay.

funding for its attempt to launch a fifth television channel in the UK.
The Independent Television Commission was expected to make a decision on
Channel 5, which should reach 70 per cent of the UK population, at its

Instead a decision was deferred until its next meeting on December 17. It is

main driving force behind Channel Five Holdings, the only company to bid for
the franchise.
The company is in advanced negotiations with a number of potential
investors. They are understood to include Time Warner, the US media group,
Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail, and two unidentified
British media companies.
The ITC said yesterday that Channel Five Holdings had been invited 'to
provide further information on its funding arrangements no later than 4
December in order that the commission can conclude its overall
arrangements'.
A court hearing set for November 30, at which Thames will claim that it
should retain the rights to several hundred feature films for showing on
Channel 5, could also have a bearing.
The chances are that Thames will be able to satisfy the ITC that a big
problem facing Channel 5 - retuning video recorders, which otherwise would
suffer from interference - can be solved if enough money is raised.

FT  19 NOV 92 / France and Taiwan cement Dollars 2.6bn jet fighter deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN has obtained a long-awaited agreement from France to buy 60 Mirage
2000-5 multi-role jet fighter aircraft for Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.7bn),
according to newspaper and radio reports from Taipei.
Neither the Paris government nor Dassault, the French aerospace group which
makes the Mirage fighter, would comment on the deal, the latest stage in the
island's attempts to boost defences against a military build-up in China and
as such likely to spark a diplomatic row between Beijing and Paris.
But they did not deny the report. It comes two months after a US decision to
sell up to 150 F-16 jet fighters to Taiwan for Dollars 5.8bn, seen as a
factor in resolving French hesitation.
If confirmed, this will be the second big recent French defence sale to
Taiwan, after last year's Dollars 4.8bn sale of 16 frigates, never
officially announced. The Mirage sale would also include 1,500 missiles,
bringing the total contract value to Dollars 3.8bn, said Taiwanese press
reports.
China has objected strongly, causing Paris to pause before jeopardising
already strained relations with a powerful ally. The Beijing Foreign
Ministry yesterday warned that China was 'firmly against' such a project.
However, China took no significant steps against France over the frigate
sale, beyond voicing loud objections, and has countenanced recent defence
equipment sales to Taiwan from Germany, Belgium and Italy. France is China's
second largest aid donor after Japan, with FFr30bn (Pounds 3.7bn) of credits
and cheap loans outstanding.

FT  19 NOV 92 / BT shares sale to help fund public sector spending: Sell-off
forms part of aim to raise Pounds 5.5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, ROLAND RUDD and HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW sale of BT shares was announced yesterday by Chancellor Norman Lamont
who gave notice of a 'major sale' of shares in the 1993-94 financial year to
help fund government spending plans.
The government also signalled its intention to push ahead with plans to
introduce tolls on trunk roads and motorways in an attempt to attract
private sector investment.
Both announcements were aimed at explaining how the government would keep
spending within its limit of Pounds 244.5bn. They follow Mr Lamont's
implicit warning to the Commons Treasury committee on Monday that tax rises,
or further spending cuts, could not be ruled out if the Public Sector
Borrowing Requirement failed to move towards balance over the economic
cycle.
The new BT share sale is part of the government's plans, announced last
week, to raise Pounds 5.5bn from privatisation over the coming year and a
similar sum in 1994-95.
Speaking at the start of a two-day Commons debate on the Autumn Statement,
Mr Lamont said business now had the best chance in years to exploit low
interest rates, low taxes and low inflation and a 15 per cent devaluation
'to invest, to export and to build for the future'.
But his upbeat presentation received short shrift from Mr Gordon Brown, the
shadow chancellor. He described the Autumn Statement as 'complacent' in
failing to address unemployment and business bankruptcies or to offer a
coherent long-term strategy for reviving industrial investment.
The government's remaining 22 per cent BT shareholding is worth Pounds 5.4bn
at last night's closing price of 396p. The government has already sold two
tranches of shares in the company. The first was in 1984, with the second
coming last December.
Ministers have yet to decide how many BT shares to sell or when they will be
marketed. They hope to appoint a financial adviser, global co-ordinator and
lead stockbroker early next month.
About 10 investment banks and brokers were yesterday sent letters from the
Treasury inviting them to tender for the roles. SG Warburg undertook all
three roles during the last issue.
BT last night welcomed the announcement: 'It removes the fear, however
unfounded, that a government might be tempted to interfere with BT's
management processes at some stage in the future.'
The sale will be offered to both retail and institutional investors. Retail
investors will be offered an inducement to buy shares. Last time they
received a 45p discount on the 350p price paid by institutions.
The Treasury plans to develop last year's use of 'share shops' to promote
its goal of wider share ownership, although investment bankers are sceptical
of the value of this approach.
The Treasury is confident that there will still be an appetite for BT shares
because its current share price is 13 per cent higher that the 350p at which
they were sold on December 9. Over the same period the FT-SE 100 share index
has also risen by 13 per cent.

parent
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIANI and Nielsen (Thai), the Thai construction company, is planning to
take control of its Danish parent Christiani and Nielsen and move the
group's headquarters to Bangkok in what is thought to be the first such
'reverse takeover' of its kind in Thailand.
The move, confirmed by the Thai company yesterday, reflects the increasing
strength of the subsidiary compared with its ailing Danish par-ent.
One stockbroker in Thailand said yesterday: 'Official concerns are that
given the weakness of the parent company it might be open to some kind of
hostile takeover.'
Christiani and Nielsen (Thai), which is 42.17 per cent owned by the Danish
parent, declined to give financial details of the proposed deal yesterday.
Company executives in Bangkok said an announcement was expected in the next
few days, following delays caused by the unfamiliarity of Thai accountants
and advisers with such a transaction and by the slowness of the Stock
Exchange of Thailand in granting its approval.
Christiani and Nielsen (Thai) shares have been suspended at Bt129 - which
values the Thai company at about Dollars 230m - since it announced an
unidentified takeover plan in September.
Mr Peter Kirketerp, financial controller of the Thai unit, said yesterday
there were no plans to cease operations in Europe. 'Certainly not, if it's
up to us,' he said.
'We want to put some gas into it.'
He added: 'It does make commercial sense. It does give access to resources
which this company does not have at the moment . . . I think it's a bit
unusual - the first time that a Thai company is taking over its parent.'

<TEXT>
OPPORTUNITY 2000, the business-led campaign to improve the position of women
at work, has gained the backing of chief executives but is often failing to
get through to lower levels of the workforce, it was disclosed yesterday
The initiative, launched a year ago by Mr John Major, the prime minister,
covers nearly a quarter of the workforce and involves 141 companies, most of
them household names. Members set their own goals for the recruitment and
advancement of women but have to agree to them being independently
monitored.
Research into progress by the companies over the first 12 months was
unveiled yesterday. The research was carried out by Ashridge Management
College and Business in the Community, the business-led umbrella
organisation responsible for Opportunity 2000.
It found that nearly 80 per cent of chief executives of participating
companies had taken an active and public role in sponsoring the initiative
within their organisations. Line managers were often ill-informed, however,
and fewer than half had specific targets for their sections of the business.
Lady Howe, who chairs Opportunity 2000, said there was evidence that 'the
messages are not getting down the line'. She said renewed efforts should be
made to involve divisions, departments and line managers in setting goals.
Lady Howe said about a third of campaign members had included numerical
goals for the employment and promotion of women in their action plans.
Companies reporting back on the previous 12 months included London Weekend
Television, which said it had increased the proportion of women it employed
from 36 per cent to 39 per cent and those in management jobs from 40 per

Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, said Opportunity 2000 had caught
'the tide of public opinion' but that celebrations should be tempered with
realism. 'Women are faced not just with glass ceilings but glass walls,
too,' she said.
She announced a series of 'opportunity shops', starting with a pilot scheme
in Manchester, which would tour the country next year. They would provide a
showcase of 'opportunities available to women, spanning the whole range from
career options to . . . voluntary work'.

FT  18 NOV 92 / State cover sought against terrorism
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government was urged yesterday to intervene to end the 'state of
turmoil' in the British insurance industry which has followed the wave of
IRA terrorist activity on the UK mainland.
Mr John Greenway, Conservative MP for Ryedale and chairman of the all-party
Insurance and Financial Services Group, said insurers faced potential losses
far beyond any normally acceptable risk.
He has written to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary,
asking the government to act as a reinsurer to resolve the problem.
He said: 'The insurance industry is in a state of turmoil over the problems
of providing insurance cover in respect of terrorist activity on the UK
mainland.'
A preferred option would be to invite the government to act as a reinsurer
for the balance of any potential losses which the insurance market is unable
to underwrite in the usual way.
'It is the withdrawal of such reinsurance, brought about by the fear of
possible losses similar to those experienced following the bomb in the City
a few months ago, which is the cause of the current difficulty,' he said.
'It hardly bears thinking about what might have happened had the attempt to
bomb Canary Wharf not been thwarted.'
Mr Greenway added that 'nervousness within the reinsurance market in the
face of such potentially huge losses' was entirely understandable.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD SPENS, a former finance director at the Henry Ansbacher merchant bank,
was deprived of any prospect of clearing his name by the premature ending of
the second Guinness trial, two High Court judges were told yesterday.
The judges are reviewing the refusal of Mr Justice Henry, the trial judge,
to acquit Lord Spens after the trial collapsed because of the deterioration
in the mental health of Mr Roger Seelig, his co-defendant,
Mr Justice Henry ordered the charges against Lord Spens of conspiracy and
false accounting to lie on the file. He also refused to order legal costs,
for which Lord Spens is claiming Pounds 365,000, to be paid from public
funds.
Mr Andrew Collins QC, for Lord Spens, said the trial had been aborted
through no fault of the banker. 'In these circumstances he has now been
deprived of any prospect of establishing his innocence.'
Mr Justice Henry had been wrong not to order his formal acquittal because
the Serious Fraud Office, which brought the prosecution, had said it would
offer no further evidence, he said.
Lord Spens had been left with a cloud hanging over him and in a position
where people could think there was no smoke without fire.
The hearing continues today.

FT  18 NOV 92 / Arts: Travels With My Aunt - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wit is not the quality primarily associated with Graham Greene, though
perhaps he became more light-hearted as he grew older. Certainly Travels
With My Aunt, published in 1969, is a very witty novel. It is even better as
a play or, more accurately, as a stage performance.
The first stroke of brilliance on the part of Giles Havergal was to see that
it could be acted at all. The second was to adapt it almost as a cabaret.
There is a cast of only four: all men. Between them they switch parts and go
through the whole delightful story from a funeral in a London suburb to a
palace in Paraguay. Practically every line of dialogue is taken directly
from the novel.
In the book the tale seems slightly bizarre: an ageing Aunt Augusta, who has
lost neither her money nor her sexual urge, picks up her nephew, a retired
and reclusive bank manager, and takes him on her travels. The adventures
include a brush with the CIA and the aunt's eventual marriage to an Italian
Nazi collaborator, with whom she has been involved for most her life.
Havergal's technique is simply to take sections of the dialogue and let the
men speak it. Directing his own adaptation, he has chosen an impeccable
cast. Of the four actors, Christopher Gee has only a few small parts, but
his presence is necessary for the symmetry. All four are dressed in grey
suits with waistcoats, white shirts, red tie and white pocket handkerchiefs.
If there is any discrimination between the main three, it is that only Simon
Cadell is allowed to play the aunt. He does it to perfection: voice slightly
high-pitched, sometimes faltering, neck arched, stooping shoulders and some
marvellously restrained movements with his arms and hands.
Yet even Cadell plays more than one role. All the actors switch in and out
of the part of Henry Pulling, the nephew, which is a wonderfully clever way
of giving life to one of the least exotic characters. The most outstanding
is John Wells who has a stage presence that will be forever associated with
his impersonation of Denis Thatcher.
It is in the smaller parts, male and female, that Wells and the other main
actor, Richard Kane, excel. Kane plays Wordsworth, Augusta's black factotum
and lover from Sierra Leone. Then he becomes Miss Paterson, the frail little
spinster standing over the grave of Henry's father on a rainy day in
Boulogne. There is a splendid vignette of all four of them in their grey
suits and umbrellas as the Paterson story unfolds.
Wells is both Tooley, the drug-taking, possibly pregnant daughter of the CIA
man whom he meets on the Orient Express, then the girl's father whom he
comes across on the way to Asuncion. By this time Pulling has passed back to
Cadell.
We should not forget that Greene was a narrative master, full of local
detail like guarani. Even in this stage form, the story is never lost sight
of. It is an evening to treasure and the novelist who never did quite so
well as a playwright would surely have approved.

FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: PWA files CDollars 1bn suit
against Air Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PWA Corporation, the holding company of Canadian Airlines International, has
filed a CDollars 1bn (USDollars 784m) lawsuit against Air Canada for alleged
predatory pricing practices, Reuter reports.
Mr Rhys Eyton, PWA chairman, and Mr Kevin Jenkins, president of Canadian
Airlines, claimed that Air Canada had 'dumped' extra airline seats on the
market this year in an effort to use its deeper financial resources to drive
Canadian out of the market.
'PWA Corp and Canadian Airlines have been aware of Air Canada's actions for
some time, but have now gathered key evidence to support this filing of
charges,' PWA said in a statement. PWA said the suit was filed yesterday in
an Alberta court.
Air Canada officials have previously denied such allegations, but yesterday
declined to comment on the suit.
Mr Eyton said the PWA charge was not related to the recent lawsuit by the
Gemini Group systems venture against PWA.
Gemini, which is jointly owned by PWA, Air Canada and a United Airlines
affiliate, recently sued PWA for CDollars 1.5bn.
Mr Eyton added PWA had few options if its proposed deal with AMR and
employees of its Canadian Airlines unit fell through.
He appeared to rule out renewed merger talks with Air Canada.
'We've wasted probably six months discussing merger possibilities with Air
Canada during the past year,' he said.
'We will not waste time and be taken down futile paths.'

FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: Chrysler to sell most of
financial business to Nationsbank for Dollars 2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRYSLER, the US vehicle manufacturer, is to sell nearly all the consumer
and inventory financing businesses and assets of its Chrysler First
subsidiary to Nationsbank, the fourth largest banking company in the US.
Chrysler said the net proceeds from the sale were expected to be more than
Dollars 2bn and would approximate to carrying value. Nationsbank said the
purchase price represented a premium of about Dollars 100m.
Chrysler indicated some time ago that it wanted to sell these businesses as
part of a plan to reduce the indebtedness of its financial services business
and to ensure that this had enough funds to support its core operation -
financing the sale of vehicles.
Nationsbank said the proposed deal would increase its consumer finance
business eight-fold and make it the second largest US consumer finance
company owned by a bank holding company.
It will form a new consumer finance business as a result of the deal, to be
called Nationscredit.
Chrysler First, which is based in Allentown, Pennsylvania, services
receivables of about Dollars 4bn and operates in 175 locations in 32 states.
Nationsbank's financial services unit has some Dollars 500m in consumer
finance receivables and 105 offices in 10 states.
Chrysler First's consumer finance operations range from home mortgages to
private label credit cards, while the inventory finance division provides
financial services for private label manufacturers and distributors and high
technology equipment dealers.
The deal does not include Chrysler First's business credit operation, which
deals in commercial property loans.
Nationsbank, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, is one of the most
aggressively acquisitive super-regional banks in the US.
Mr Hugh McColl, its chief executive, said the company was committed to
expanding significantly its consumer loan portfolio. 'We have an ambitious
growth goal that requires external in addition to internal expansion,' he
added.

POLAROID, the US photography company, plans to create three business units

The company said the three operations would be 'highly autonomous with
specific profitability goals', with each relying primarily on its own sales
and marketing, business sector management, and manufacturing and development
groups.
Polaroid said it would group its operations in core photography, high
resolution imaging, and imaging media and peripherals.
It also intends to offer early retirement for selected employees. Details
would be available next month.
A spokeswoman declined to comment on the number of employees who will be
offered the early retirement option, or on the financial impact of the
programme. Polaroid has about 11,000 employees.

FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Maxwell raider in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPRESENTATIVES of Mr Robert Bass, the corporate raider, turned up in London
yesterday for talks with banks who are creditors of the late Mr Robert
Maxwell.
They are trying to persuade individual banks to consider an offer for the
main Maxwell US interests - Official Airline Guides and Macmillan, the
American publishing group.
Some banks, apparently acting on the advice of administrators Arthur
Andersen and their advisers JP Morgan, have refused to see them. But enough
said yes to make the trip worthwhile.
The group led by Keystone, formerly the Robert M Bass Group and Acadia
Partners, another Bass vehicle and including Bain Capital, Bear, Streans and
DLJ Merchant Banking has bid Dollars 725m (Pounds 480m) cash for the US
businesses.
When liabilities are included Keystone says the total value of their offer
is Dollars 1.2bn.
The administrators say they are looking for Dollars 700m-Dollars 1.1bn net
of liabilities and that the Keystone approach is too far to the bottom range
of their expectations. Because of this the administrators and their advisers
say they are sticking to their stated policy of selling off OAG and floating
Macmillan sometime next year.
The Bass Group is now approaching individual banks to try to get what they
regard as a proper hearing for their case - that their offer, which is close
to being fully financed, represents value for assets they believe have
deteriorated by as much as 20 per cent since the original targets were set.
Above all the Keystone team want access to up to date information on the
businesses so that they can carry out due diligence to see whether their
valuation of OAG and Macmillan is realistic or whether there is room for
further negotiation on price.
Keystone is understood to be angry that it has been asked to bid more for
the businesses while being denied information

<TEXT>
ICI AUSTRALIA, which is 63 per cent-owned by the UK chemicals group,
announced a 33 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 91m (Pounds
41.5m) for the year to end-September. Revenue dipped 2.4 per cent to
ADollars 2.7bn.
The group said the improvement reflected cost cutting and efficiency
improvements following completion of a series of plant level agreements with
trade unions.
The result also benefited from a 38 per cent reduction in interest costs to
ADollars 26m following falling interest rates and lower debt. Directors said
the result was achieved in spite of 'a difficult recession year'.
Profit fell by 32 per cent to ADollars 85m after abnormal items, mainly
because the 1990-91 result included an abnormal profit of ADollars 58m
resulting from the disposal of ICI's interest in Catoleum, an Australian
petroleum company.
The board said the continuing impact of increased operating efficiency
should lead to a further increase in profits in the current year.
However underlying trading conditions in main overseas markets showed few
signs of increased activity and a recovery in petrochemical prices was
unlikely because of continuing overcapacity.
The final dividend is 13 cents, making a total of 18 cents (15 cents).

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bill Clinton, the president-elect, will fly today from Little Rock in
Arkansas to Washington for his first meeting since the election with
President George Bush and for talks with congressmen of both parties.
Mr Clinton yesterday was poring over briefing papers, according to Mr Warren
Christopher, director of Mr Clinton's transition team. The meeting would not
be 'just a social call but, as has always been true historically, it's a
time when the outgoing president communicates important thoughts to the
incoming president'.
Mr Clinton said he hoped to receive Mr Bush's 'candid assessment' on many
world issues and that he had 'one or two things I want to raise'.
He will also take a good look around his new home town. In fact, his
itinerary allots less time at the White House with President Bush - 55
minutes - than for a 'street walk' visiting businesses near Washington's
mostly black Howard University.
This could be a sign that the Arkansas governor's schedulers have learned
'to build' extreme flexibility into his calendar. During the campaign, Mr
Clinton got a well-deserved reputation for tardiness caused by shaking every
hand proffered and engaging in long off-the-cuff conversations.
The governor will use the second day of his two-day visit to begin wooing
Republicans and to cement relationships with Democrats in Congress. After
two years of stalemate in Washington between a Republican president and a
Democratic Congress, there is a palpable yearning for the thaw in the
domestic cold war which began when Mr Clinton met Democratic leaders on
Sunday and Monday.
Governor Clinton and his wife, Hillary, are also creating a stir on the
Washington social scene, where they are determined to prove they are not
like the more stand-offish Carters, the last Democrats in the White House.
They are to attend two private dinners - to which invitations are much
prized and supposed to be kept secret - and a reception.
Tonight's dinner is being given by Mr Vernon Jordan, chairman of the
governor's transition team, and tomorrow night's hostess is Mrs Pamela
Harriman, a Democratic party activist.
The Clintons rejected an invitation by President Bush to stay overnight at
Blair House, the official guest residence, on the grounds that it would be
too expensive to open for the occasion. Instead, they are staying at the
Hay-Adams Hotel, where suites run at a more frugal Dollars 1,200 (Pounds
795) a night.

THE Australian Labor Party's formerly strong grip on state governments was
further weakened yesterday by a damning royal commission report on losses of
ADollars 3.1bn (Pounds 1.4bn) incurred by the State Bank of South Australia,
writes Kevin Brown in Sydney.
The report found no evidence of corruption or illegal activity by the South
Australian Labor government. However, it said the state government should
have known about the bank's serious financial problems.
The report was severely critical of Mr John Bannon, the state premier and
treasurer (finance minister), who quit in September to take the political
blame for the bank's losses.
Mr Samuel Jacobs, the royal commissioner, said Mr Bannon interfered in the
bank's commercial activities, and failed to monitor its rapid asset growth
or take action to deal with its growing problems.
Mr Bannon, a former Labor Party federal president, said he had been kept in
the dark about many of the bank's activities. He rejected the commission's
findings as 'extremely hurtful and unfair.' Mr Lynn Arnold, the premier,
distanced the government from the report, which he said failed to establish
how the bank's problems could have been avoided.

PAKISTANI troops and police moved last night to seal off the capital,
Islamabad, to try to stop anti-government protesters from defying a ban on a
protest march to parliament today.
Barbed wire barricades were erected on main roads into the capital. Cars and
buses were stopped and their occupants quizzed. Security was also tightened
around foreign diplomatic missions.
Ms Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister, said police had arrested
thousands of members of her opposition Pakistan People's party throughout
the country. 'The entire country has been converted into a jail,' she said.
Ms Bhutto has vowed to lead thousands of supporters on a 18km 'long march'
to parliament today to force the government out of office.
Mr Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister, described this as 'a call for open
rebellion'. His government has clamped a two-month ban on public assembly in
the capital and Rawalpindi.
Ms Bhutto claims Mr Sharif's conservative Islamic government is corrupt and
repressive and that it came to power through rigged elections in 1990.

rationalisation

   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WATERFORD CRYSTAL, the Irish crystal division of Waterford Wedgwood,
suffered a new setback with the rejection by staff of its latest
make-or-break rationalisation plan.
The workforce at two of the company's three plants voted down the plan,
which calls for 500 redundancies among 1,900 employees, across-the-board
wage cuts, and an industrial peace agreement for five years. A secret ballot
is scheduled for tomorrow at the third plant.
The Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union, called the cuts
'unbearable, inequitable and unacceptable'.
The ATGWU has costed the cuts at IPounds 5.61m (Pounds 6.12m).
When Mr Paddy Galvin, the division's chairman and chief executive, announced
the rationalisation plan last August he warned that union rejection could
mean the end of the company's Irish operations.
In the past six years the crystal division has lost IPounds 66m, due to
rising costs and declining markets exacerbated by recession in its principle
markets - the US and UK.
Rationalisation has resulted in 1,400 redundancies since 1987, while
short-time working over the past 18 months has allowed further loss
trimming.
Results for the first half of 1992 showed an increase in losses to IPounds
3.2m despite a 16 per cent increase in sales. The company blamed 'unabsorbed
overheads' from increased short-time working.
The company said the dispute was likely to go back to the Labour Court if
all three plants rejected the plan but it hoped talks would go on.

FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Lord Williams resigns MGN directorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Williams of Elvel, the Labour peer, has become the latest Mirror Group
Newspapers figure to resign 'to devote his time to other interests.'
He was one of two directors to vote against the appointment of Mr David
Montgomery as chief executive. The other was Mr Vic Horwood who was first
replaced as chief executive by the former Today editor and then later
removed as chief executive of the Scottish Daily Record.
Lord Williams' resignation follows the dismissal of Mr Richard Stott, editor
of the Daily Mirror, and Mr Bill Hagerty, editor of The People.
Meanwhile, unions at MGN have decided to go ahead with organising a ballot
in favour of industrial action in support of 100 casual freelances, many of
whom have worked on the various titles for years.

<TEXT>
ICI AUSTRALIA, which is 63 per cent-owned by the UK chemicals group,
announced a 33 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 91m (Pounds
41.5m) for the year to end-September. Revenue dipped 2.4 per cent to
ADollars 2.7bn.
The group said the improvement reflected cost cutting and efficiency
improvements following completion of a series of plant level agreements with
trade unions.
The result also benefited from a 38 per cent reduction in interest costs to
ADollars 26m. Directors said the result was achieved in spite of 'a
difficult recession year'.
Profit fell by 32 per cent to ADollars 85m after abnormal items, mainly
because the 1990-91 result included an abnormal profit of ADollars 58m
resulting from the disposal of ICI's interest in Catoleum, an Australian
petroleum company.
The board said the continuing impact of increased operating efficiency
should lead to a further increase in profits in the current year.
A final dividend of 13 cents makes an 18 (15) cents total.

<TEXT>
PROFITS OF Cosalt, the Grimsby-based diversified industrial group, fell 24
per cent to Pounds 1.88m pre-tax for the year to August 30.
However, the total dividend is maintained at 10.75p, via a final of 6.5p.
Earnings per share worked through at 11.1p (15.05p).
The shares rose 7p to 143p yesterday.
Mr Bill Wood, finance director, said the group was now in a healthy position
'having cut out the loss-making and risky parts of our business'.
Nonetheless, a markedly improved performance this year was dependent on
economic recovery in the UK.
The recession, particularly in the fishing industry, dented profits at the
group's fibres and safety equipment divisions.
Mr Wood said the group had continued to reduce its exposure to the fishing
industry, which now accounted for some 10 per cent of its business compared
with more than half five years ago.
Loss-making Cosalt Caravans was sold in September, and the group made an
extraordinary Pounds 2.06m provision for the disposal of the business.

FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Convenience and ready meals lift Hazlewood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG GROWTH from Hazlewood Foods' convenience and ready meals offset
falling tomato prices to push interim profits up by nearly 7 per cent, from
Pounds 23.1m to Pounds 24.7m.
Full impact of shares issued for the Sutherland acquisition in September
last year held earnings per share growth to 0.8 per cent at 7.62p (7.56p).
Mr Peter Barr, executive chairman, said 'further progress in the second half
is expected'. The interim dividend goes up from 2.2p to 2.3p 'as an
indication of confidence about the second half'.
Sales in the six months to end-September rose 24 per cent to Pounds 364.8m
(Pounds 294m). Mr John Simons, finance director, said stripping out
acquisitions, mainly Sutherland, and exchange effects, underlying growth was
3 per cent. However, lower prices in many areas meant underlying volumes
were 7 per cent higher.
Operating profits rose 12 per cent to Pounds 30.4m. Underlying growth was 4
per cent, Mr Simons said. The benefit of sterling's devaluation would be
more important in the second half, he added.
Although operating profit margins appeared to slip, Mr Simons said this was
because of the inclusion of Sutherland's lower margin distribution activity,
and comparable margins were maintained.
Interest charges rose from Pounds 3.93m to Pounds 5.71m as debt increased
Pounds 29.9m to Pounds 139.6m, lifting gearing to 87 per cent. This came
mainly from high capital expenditure of Pounds 21.7m.
Mr Simons said interest cover of 5.3 times (6.9 times) was comfortable. Also
the group had arranged a Dollars 80m (Pounds 52.5m) placement of seven year
debt in the US which had been swapped into guilders, to match the group's
assets in the Netherlands. This would enable Hazlewood to repay all its
short term debt.
Within the divisions, operating profits from ready meals rose from Pounds
3.6m to Pounds 5m and from convenience foods from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 6m.
The glut of fresh produce, such as tomatoes, in Europe cut profits in that
division from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 1.6m.
In shellfish, a recovery was made from the problems of the Dutch cockle
industry and profits rose from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 4.5m. Meat profits fell
from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 3.5m, with Pounds 250,000 of the drop caused by a
recall of pork products in September, although these turned out not to be
contaminated. Profits in other divisions were flat.
COMMENT
Given the traumas much of the food industry has been through this summer,
Hazlewood has done well even to edge earnings up. And for once the company
does not have to apologise for any nasty surprises. It appears capable of
making much more out of the ready meal and convenience foods areas, though
the continental operations may find life tougher as recession reaches its
customers. The main concern is the level of debt. But this is in a good
cause as Hazlewood wants to seize as many opportunities as it can. And the
US debt placement should have prevented any short term crunch. With
forecasts still about Pounds 55m (Pounds 51.3m) pre-tax for the year the
prospective p/e of 8.2 leaves something to go for.

FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Plan extends life of Yeoman Inv Trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YEOMAN Investment Trust has produced new restructuring proposals following
an earlier plan which was abandoned in August.
The split capital trust is due to be wound up next month but the new plan,
devised by brokers Greig Middleton, will extend its life for a further six
years. The previous proposals had involved a seven year extension.
Yeoman's original plan was blocked by the reluctance of Orion Insurance, a
principal income shareholder, to support the proposals. Orion's stake - 24
per cent of the income shares - was bought by Abbey Life.
Abbey Life will also be the new manager of the trust when the present
manager, Mr Rodney Pellatt, retires next year. Mr George Yoxall, managing
director of Abbey Life Investment Services, said there were no discussions
of the management contract before Abbey bought the stake, which was
originally acquired for its attractive redemption yield.
Abbey's management fee will be 0.3 per cent of total assets per annum, no
higher than the previous charge.
The new plan is designed to meet some of the objections to the previous
scheme. In particular, income shareholders will be offered a cash exit at
100p, an option unavailable in the earlier plan. If shareholders opt to hold
on to their income shares the new redemption value - in December 1998 - will
be 50p.
Three institutions, holding some 71 per cent of the income shares, have
approved the scheme in principle.
Capital shareholders are being offered zero dividend preference shares on a
1-for-1 basis.
Conversion will be based on mid-market asset value. Greig Middleton has
undertaken to find standby purchasers of the zeros, effectively giving
capital shareholders a cash exit. In addition, Greig Middleton is seeking
sub-underwriters to buy capital shares from those holders who are unwilling
to convert into zeros.
The zeros will offer an annualised redemption yield of 9.3 per cent between
issue and maturity in 1998.
An extraordinary meeting will be held on December 21 to approve the
proposals.

FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Hicking Pentecost boosted by sharp cut in
interest charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HICKING Pentecost, the industrial products and textiles company, reported a
44 per cent increase to Pounds 1.65m in pre-tax profits for the six months
to September 30 on the back of substantially reduced interest charges.
Mr David Lister, chairman, said he was confident the strong performance
would continue in the second half.
The interim dividend is raised 12.5 per cent to 1.35p, while earnings per
share rose to 7.73p (7.19p).
Mr Tudor Davies, managing director, said knitwear exports increased by 30
per cent in the first half. The group was likely to benefit further from the
fall in sterling.
Knitwear represents some 75 per cent of group sales, though it has been
gradually diversifying away from textiles since 1989 when Messrs Lister and
Davies were appointed.
Acquisitions, such as Nicholson Plastics, the water tank maker included for
a full six months this time, helped sales rise from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds
13.6m. Operating profits advanced from Pounds 1.36m to Pounds 1.67m.
Mr Davies said the underlying performance of the industrial products
division remained roughly level with last year.
Interest payments were cut from from Pounds 220,000 to Pounds 24,000. This
was partly due to strong cash generation and also to the Pounds 4.5m rights
issue in June 1991, launched to pay for Nicholson. Debt, however, was
slightly higher at the interim stage at Pounds 1m, against Pounds 700,000.

FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Staff cuts behind National Power rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER THAN expected job cuts helped National Power, the electricity
generator, to increase pre-tax profits from a restated Pounds 182m to Pounds
201m in the six months to September 27.
The improvement was achieved in a total market that was down by half of a
percentage point, the company said. Demand from the industrial and domestic
sectors fell by 2 per cent and 1 per cent respectively, whereas the
commercial side rose by 2 per cent.
Turnover fell 8 per cent to Pounds 1.97bn, partly because of lower sales
volumes but principally through a reduction of Pounds 97m in contributions
recovered from consumers and passed on in the form of support payments to
British Coal.
The number of people employed has fallen by 17 per cent to 9,500 since the
end of March and 28 per cent since September. Productivity, as measured by
output per employee, was 24 per cent up year on year.
Mr John Baker, chief executive, said the employed number was likely to be
about 8,000 by the end of March. He also disclosed that a tentative
agreement had been reached with unions for a 15-month pay deal with
employees which will provide a lump sum of up to Pounds 2,000 together with
wage rises of 3.95 per cent.
The deal is conditional on employees of acceptance of performance-related
pay and flexible working.
In the half year fuel costs of Pounds 975m were down 1 per cent, mainly as a
result of lower sales volumes. Fuel costs per unit rose 4 per cent.
Net borrowings at Pounds 283m compared with Pounds 226m at the year end.
The debt equity ratio was 13.3 per cent.
The interim dividend is increased from 3p to 3.3p. Earnings per share were
11.53p (10.12p).
Mr Baker said trading in the opening weeks of the second half of the year
was broadly in line with expectations.

FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Instrumenting a policy of growth - The
strategy that put Bowthorpe back on a rising profits trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Bowthorpe announced a 5 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits
last month the Sussex-based group, with products ranging from cable ties and
heat sinks to black box flight recorders, signalled it was back on the
growth track.
Last year profits fell by 11 per cent to Pounds 40.3m on turnover of Pounds
220.5m, ending a 15-year unbroken growth record and proving that even with
81 per cent of its business outside the UK, the group was not recession
proof.
After more cost cutting and restructuring, Mr John Wes- thead, the group's
notoriously cautious 64-year-old chief executive, felt confident enough last
month to forecast a 'modest improvement' in full year profits.
Bowthorpe is one of the relatively few successful, medium sized,
international electrical and electronics companies in the UK. But in terms
of operating assets its manufacturing base is split between the UK (Pounds
23.1m), continental Europe (Pounds 38.9m), the US (Pounds 22.6m), and the
rest of the world (Pounds 13.9m).
The company, which was founded in 1936 with Pounds 2,000 of borrowed capital
by Jack Bowthorpe, a GEC ledger clerk, has had overseas operations since
1957. It now comprises some 70 operating units in more than 20 countries.
Bowthorpe has been guided for the last decade by a down-to-earth business
strategy set out by Mr Westhead after he became managing director in 1980,
having joined the group the previous year.
The linchpin of this strategy has been to acquire and build specialised
international niche businesses. These small-to-medium sized operations are
run globally by managers who have substantial autonomy, understand their
businesses, and are subject to the minimum head office interference.
'With small companies you have to be careful you don't strangle them with
financial controls - but you also have to keep an eye on them,' says Mr
Westhead. He has no time for fancy management theories and fairly bristles
at the mention of concepts like 'matrix management.'
The group also uses a refreshingly simple check-list approach towards
selecting its acquisitions. Among the criteria targets must have significant
barriers to entry, like patents or process know-how, be capable of
generating significant economies of scale, but must also be in markets where
volumes are unlikely to attract the big multinationals.
The group also seeks out businesses which have fairly diverse applications.
Even its biggest market, construction, accounts for only 13 per cent of
turnover and, perhaps surprisingly, the defence sector represents just 7 per
cent
One consequence of this strategy is that Bowthorpe faces a different set of
competitors in each of its specialised international businesses. These
include cable care products such as the ties which hold bundles of wires
together, electrical terminals and connectors, thermal electronic
components, electronic power supplies and a growing portfolio of electronic
instrumentation equipment. In most of these Bowthorpe is either the world
leader, or among the top three manufacturers.
Latest niche market to be targeted by Bowthorpe is the instrumentation
business. The group has been steadily building up a portfolio of companies
on both sides of the Atlantic manufacturing products for measuring humidity,
microwave and radio frequency radiation, equipment for high-speed data
acquisition and appliance testers.
As part of this push the group has acquired three companies in the fast
growing data acquisition field in the past year, Penny &amp; Giles, the UK-based
manufacturer of aircraft flight recorders, and B&amp;D Instruments and Odessa,
both based in the US.
Applications for data acquisition and measurement products include the
growing market for environmental monitoring equipment - Odessa makes the
equipment which measures and records pollution emissions from industrial
chimney stacks.
'The group has identified the data acquisition market as an area where these
companies have leading technology,' says Mr James Heal, an analyst with
Hoare Govett in London. He believes that profits from instrumentation
companies could bolster the group's compound growth rate by 3 per cent over
the next 18 months, and that sales in this area could account for almost 20
per cent of turnover within the five years.
However, like other analysts, he also believes that if Bowthorpe's strategy
has a weakness, it is that one of its niche operations will grow big enough
to attract multinational competitors. Environmental monitoring equipment
could be just such a business.
The market in the US is being driven by Federal legislation which allows
companies to discharge a limited amount of toxins into the atmosphere - or
trade their quotas with other companies. The US market for environmental
monitoring equipment is expected to grow at a compound rate of 35 per cent
between now and the mid 1990s.
If Europe was to adopt similar legislation some analysts believe the market
could become large enough to attract big multinationals and that might force
Bowthorpe to reasses its strategy.
More immediately Bowthorpe will benefit from the relative strength of the
dollar against sterling. With almost 30 per cent of its Pounds 38.5m
operating profits last year coming from the US, Mr Heal estimates that the
dollar's strength could add Pounds 3m to 1993 pre-tax profits.
On this basis he is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 48m next year,
producing earnings per share of 16.3p. This prospect, and a strong balance
sheet, has helped lift the share price, which has gained more than 50 per
cent in the past three years, to about 275p, close to its peak of 283p
recorded earlier this year.

PROFITS OF Cosalt, the Grimsby-based diversified industrial group, fell 24

development was not going as well as expected, although lower costs and good

FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Currency gains and cost cutting helps
Readicut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
READICUT International, the household textile, carpeting and yarn company,
yesterday reported a small increase in profits helped by currency gains and
cost cutting.
Pre-tax profits increased 6 per cent from Pounds 5.67m to Pounds 6.01m in
the six months to September 30.
The previous year's figure was boosted by undisclosed insurance gains of a
'few hundred thousand'. The shares gained 3p to 72p.
Mr Clive Shaw, managing director, said most markets remained difficult.
'There are signs the US is coming back, but Europe is going down.'
Turnover increased 3.6 per cent to Pounds 106.7m (Pounds 103m). Of the
increase, Pounds 2.3m came from currency gains and Pounds 1.4m from
like-for-like increases. Exports from the UK increased strongly before
sterling's fall, Mr Shaw said.
In the UK, carpet sales fell despite further switching from high street to
contract sales, but Firth Furnishings, a supplier of carpets and trim to the
car industry, performed well. Russells Rubber, which makes moulded rubber
for car doors, was helped by a large contract from Iran.
Despite the fall in interest rates, interest costs were little changed at
Pounds 1.35m (Pounds 1.36m). Capital expenditure increased from Pounds 4m to
Pounds 7.3m. For the full year expenditure is expected to increase to Pounds
12.5m, compared to depreciation of Pounds 8.7m.
Readicut continued to reduce its workforce and UK staff fell by 77 to 3,100.
Redundancy costs were Pounds 358,000 (Pounds 175,000).
Year end gearing is expected to be 'in the low 20s', according to Mr Shaw.
This compared to net borrowings of Pounds 11.5m and gearing of 19 per cent
at March 31.
Earnings increased from 2.01p to 2.12p. The interim dividend is held at
0.63p, covered 3.4 (3.2) times.

FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Turkish Finance, Investment and Industry (17): EC
partners and US apply pressure / Patent - the pharmaceuticals industry is
impeding progress towards a new law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 40 years after the first draft was prepared, Turkey is still
struggling to put a modern patent law on to the statute books. Today the
issue is back on the agenda, with legislators under growing pressure from
both the US and the European Community, and from a government publicly
committed to meet the standards set by the country's trading partners.
The sticking point, as ever, is the question of pharmaceuticals, an industry
which depends vitally on patent. Battle lines are now drawn between the
foreign multinationals keen to protect their inventions, local drug
companies fearful of losing market share, and a health ministry concerned to
contain drug costs.
Drug patent remains a sensitive issue, even in developed countries. In
Turkey, the commercial interests of the foreign drug companies seem
increasingly at odds with the health needs of the broad mass of the
population, at a time when the state-run health insurance Scheme is all but
bankrupt.
The debate might seem somewhat academic when you consider the number of
products which will be directly affected by the legislation. In a Turkish
market worth around Dollars 1bn in 1991, patentable drugs account for only
around 20 per cent of sales; and besides, the law would not affect products
already on sale. According to one calculation, the introduction of a patent
law would result in price increases of around Dollars 25m. The foreign drug
companies insist that this is not a financial question.
They point out that, of the 72 patentable products, 24 are currently being
imitated by 200 locally produced generics, the cheap copies of off-patent
brand name products. This pirated trade represents less than 7 per cent of
total sales.
The drug companies' case is that patent is necessary to encourage invention.
The protection provides a brief and well-earned monopoly for the inventor.
Without it, the research base on which the industry's future depends is
endangered. Patent could also stimulate an indigenous research effort. 'They
all have research and development units, yet all all they do at the moment
is reformulate someone else's products,' says one somewhat aggrieved drug
executive.
'The law was prepared for Turkey and not to please anyone else,' says a
leading member of the government commission set up to prepare what will be
the first revision of a 1879 patent law. Nonetheless, the international
pressure to address the issue is growing. The US has not ruled out resorting
to powers provided under the 301 clause of the 1989 Trade Bill, which could
affect Turkey's preferential trade tariffs on textiles and other key
exports.
Mrs Tansu Ciller the economic minister, discussed the issue with Ms Carla
Hills, the US Trade Representative during a visit to Washington earlier this
year. EC officials are insisting that patent legislation is part of Turkey's
commitment to provide free movement of goods and services under Ankara's
1963 association agreement with the Community.
With the draft now going the rounds of ministers and committees, the
lobbying has become frenetic. At a conference in June, Dr Alberto Aleotti,
chairman of the International Pharmaceutical Producers Union, was invited to
present the case for patent. Turkey, he said, 'has great market potential in
Asia and the Middle East, but cannot penetrate these markets with copied
products.'
In Ankara, in October, the presidents of the Austrian and Bulgarian patent
offices, among others, spoke on the issue at a seminar organised by the
Trade and Industry Ministry - an exercise to steel the nerves of Turkish
lawmakers before the draft goes to parliament.
Mr Tahir Kose, the trade minister, promised the package would be passed by
the end of the year. The draft, however, appears to be stuck in the State
Planning Organisation. Moreover, much to the annoyance of the foreign
concerns, the SPO, in alliance with the health ministry and the powerful
local drug concerns, has introduced the new concept of a transition period
for the application of the law.
'In effect, the Turkish industry has already had a transition period of 32
years. If that is not enough, they will never catch up,' says one aggrieved
foreign producer.
'If you're planning to be present in the international market, you have to
have a patent law,' says Mr Ayhan Suskun, head of the pharmaceutical
division at Eczacibasi. 'But the important point is, how soon.' Eczacibasi
is said to be one of the main companies lobbying for a transition period,
which might seem somewhat curious given that 70 per cent of the company's
turnover is made up of drugs produced under license with foreign partners.
Patent lawyers are even arguing about different transition periods for
process and product patent, but foreign companies say this misses the point.
The issue, they say, is to provide pipeline protection, a concept adopted in
bilateral patent accords between the US and some of its trading partners.
The idea is to protect a product from the time the molecule is invented
through the clinical trials to the moment the drug is finally approved by
the public health authorities. At present, there is no such provision in the
law.
'When we submit molecules for registration, it may take another 10 years
before we develop the product. What this new law implies is that no new
molecules will be protected in Turkey for the next 22 years,' says a US drug
executive.
The other complaint is that Turkish legislation still makes no provision for
clinical testing, which drug companies say is an essential step to encourage
a domestic research industry.
The picture is fairly dismal. Patent lawyers, such as Kaan Dericioglu, now
believe the law may get derailed even before it reaches parliament. Mr
Dericioglu argues that it may be better to exclude pharmaceuticals
altogether, to allow at least some form of patent legislation to go on the
books. But as one foreign executive put it, more optimistically: 'The
government at least is now in a position to make the political choice.'

<TEXT>
IN THE past three months, Ahmet Ozal, the 36-year-old son of Turkey's
president, has spent between Dollars 20m and Dollars 30m on launching a new
television channel.
Every now and then, questions are asked about how he put together this
money. His answer - by successful use of bank credits and oil trading - is
as striking as the phenomenon he has come to symbolise, the explosion taking
place in Turkey's air waves.
The young Ozal's new venture, Channel 6, is his second foray into
television. In 1990, he was one of the founders of Star, the first private
channel in Turkey; and, although he and his partners later split up, his
initiative carved a route which others have since followed.
In 1989, there were a mere three channels, all run by the Turkish Radio and
Television Corporation (TRT). Today there are 11, with new channels being
launched at a current rate of one a month. This 'media shock', as it is
dubbed by Jeffi Medina, president of the prominent advertising agency,
Manajans/Thompson, means that the number of private channels has already
reached six, while the five state channels include one broadcasting to the
Turkic Republics of Central Asia.
This rapid growth is not the result of deregulation. Instead, technology has
made the laws of the past irrelevant. The 1982 Constitution gives the TRT a
monopoly on establishing television and radio stations; but, under a 1924
law, all telecommunications services in Turkey are the exclusive preserve of
the Turkish PTT.
As now interpreted, this means that the PTT alone has the right to operate
landlines and telecommunications satellites serving Turkey, and it is the
PTT which leases channels and transponders from Intelsat and Eutelsat and
which controls licenses for TVROs. The TRT's eight transmitter directorates
are connected to the PTT which established a Radio and Television Department
in January 1989.
However, neither the PTT nor the TRT can stop broadcasts from satellites
with a footprint covering Turkey - and this is the loophole exploited by
Turkey's new channels. The present government has promised to amend the
constitution and law to allow private-sector broadcasting.
In common with many promised areas of reform, progress has been slow. But,
as one television executive says: 'The present situation suits all the
present players. The government has more potential control over us than it
would if clear regulation existed. The broadcasters are able to proceed
without interference, with several potential new entrants discouraged.'
Most prominent among those waiting for a clearer legal structure is the
planned joint venture of Turkey's Koc Group and Time Warner. Apart from Show
TV (a joint venture of the banker Erol Aksoy and Hurriyet and Sabah
newspapers), those already in the field are: the Uzan family's Interstar and
Teleon; HBO, in joint venture with the Has Group; Ahmet Ozal's Channel 6;
and Istanbul Municipality's BRT. In radio, a similar mushrooming has
occurred. In the provincial city of Denizli alone, four small radio stations
have been set up.
All this means that Turkey's viewers no longer have to rely on the sedate
diet fed to them by the TRT. Instead, the new channels offer a glitzy
reflection of the consumer society which has burgeoned in Turkey's major
cities.
They are pushy, slick and dominated by dubbed US programmes and quiz and
talk shows. Local programming is limited. This is particularly so in news
and current affairs, where Show TV's fortnightly 32nd Day, produced by
Mehmet Ali Birand, stands head and shoulders above the dull rest.
Educational programmes and documentaries are conspicuous by their absence.
However, doubts exist about the financial viability of many of the stations.
Few controlled their set-up costs, and now there are too many stations
fighting for the advertiser's dollar. Even if it is rising fast, per capita
advertising expenditure is a mere Dollars 10-12 a year, compared with
Dollars 150-200 in western Europe.
In this situation, advertisers are beginning to become selective. Rating
agencies, though inadequate, confirm that Show leads the field with over 25
per cent of the audience, followed by Interstar, with Channel 6 attracting
less than 10 per cent.
Stations like Interstar seem to depend largely on in-group advertising, and
zapping has become the bogey of the moment. The advertising world has
suddenly woken up to the way that viewers are no longer sitting passively
when the commercial break comes, but switching from channel to channel.
The dynamism in this area is not yet matched where cable television is
concerned. A cable television infrastructure was to be completed by July
1992, connecting 2m subscribers in 10 cities. Today, less than 30,000 homes
are connected.
The surge in television advertising has hit the newspaper industry. In the
first nine months of 1992, this received 52 per cent of the advertising
expenditure, compared with 57 per cent in 1990. Overall circulation and
readership remain among the lowest in western Europe. However, the division
between television and newspaper companies is becoming progressively
blurred.
Sabah, a founding partner in Show, is now establishing its own channel,
Satel. Hurriyet, also a founding partner in Show, has established its own
production company. Of the major newspapers, only Milliyet has yet to
declare its interest or show its hand. For the smaller newspapers, the
outlook is bleak. Advertisers are being increasingly offered cross-media
packages. As a result, small may be beautiful, but it is also progressively
lonely. Meanwhile, a telemarketing channel is about to be launched - by
Ahmet Ozal.
The author of this article, formerly managing director of Cumhuriyet
newspaper, is now managing director of IF film production and distribution
agency.

Printing money to meet the loss - The problem of state-owned enterprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE APPETITE of Turkey's state-owned enterprises for funds is widely
acknowledged as a threat to the stability of the economy, yet the
politicians have been unable to come up with a solution.
The state has a stake in 235 enterprises, ranging from public utilities,
basic metals and mining, to trading houses and department stores. Total
losses of all the state-owned corporations come to around Dollars 3bn, or 2
per cent of gross national product.
The financing of these losses, generally through printing new money, has
added to the burden on the budget, and is estimated at around 4 per cent of
GNP. In addition to the financial losses, their share of gross fixed
investment, while declining, is still about 16 per cent of the total,
concentrated in the sectors of energy, transportation and
telecommunications. Their demand for funds crowds out other borrowers, and,
in cases where they receive support direct from the treasury, adds to the
fiscal imbalance. Employment is close to 600,000 and has risen in recent
years, despite declining financial performance.
The initial task for any government is how to convert these concerns into
joint stock companies under Turkey's commercial code. Regulatory reform,
particularly in the utilities and other sectors enjoying natural monopolies,
needs to be enhanced. Without such measures, any future reorganisation will
only become much more costly.
Economists say a political, as well as a business, decision has then to be
made as to which are to be privatised and which closed down. The government
is said to be considering contracting out the management of privatisation;
however, this does not address the need for a political commitment to decide
the fate of these state-sector companies.
Efficiency, manning levels, quality of management: in all these areas the
state businesses have fallen woefully behind the private sector. A World
Bank report on the sector suggested the main problem was that the companies
are 'not run as commercial enterprises but as government departments'.
Under their articles of association, many have inherited conflicting tasks.
Take Tekel, the state tobacco monopoly, which is directly controlled by the
finance and customs ministry - indeed, its chairman, Mr Mehmet Akbay, is a
former tax expert at the ministry. Tekel not only has 80 per cent of the
cigarette market, it also has a statutory obligation to buy tobacco from the
farmers at a subsidised price set by government.
In the late 1980s, in the face of market liberalisation and the arrival of
foreign imports, the company invested heavily in new product lines. Its 2000
brand of blended cigarette is still more successful than the imported
Marlboro product. Indeed, imports have fallen recently. However, Philip
Morris is now investing in a plant in Turkey, and, under new investment
rules, once production reaches 2,000 tonnes, will be able to market and
distribute its own product, and eat into Tekel's market share.
Perhaps even more than the liberalisation of the sector, Tekel is suffering
from the burden of its price support activities. Like many state companies,
it has built up stocks, incurring warehousing fees and tying up badly needed
working capital.
Large inventory accumulation is a feature of many of the agriculture-based
state economic enterprises, partly as a result of the abundant harvest in
1990, but to a larger extent because of the generous levels of support
prices, which are typically well above world levels. Clearly, any reform of
the farm-based state enterprises will have to go hand in hand with changes
in the subsidy policy, which for so long has been seen as a universal cure
for an ailing agricultural sector.
Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister, has proved equivocal on the
state-sector issue. He publicly acknowledges the need for reform. Yet his
only contribution so far has been to bail out Metas a private-sector iron
and steel company. In effect, Metas's debts to state-owned banks were
converted to equity. The state has thus taken a new stake in a troubled
private concern, a policy favoured in the import substitution years before
1980, but which led to the plethora of minority stakes in so many private
companies today.
On the fate of Zonguldak, the loss-making hard coal company on the Black
Sea, Mr Demirel says it will be impossible to close it down. The mine
employs 50,000 people, and there is little alternative work in the area. Mr
Demirel's Social Democrat coalition partners might be even less inclined to
consider closure of state companies like Zonguldak, which have traditionally
provided the party a steady supply of votes.
The issues are gargantuan. First, the companies need to adopt the
disciplines of the market-place. At present, not being subject to the
commercial code, their performance is not subject to the provision on
bankruptcy. Managers are civil servants, and earn civil servants' salaries,
which has proved a disincentive in attracting quality personnel.
Economists say pricing is too often related to political decisions. For
example, in the run up to the election in 1991, the Motherland party
government restrained prices in a bid to hold back inflation in the weeks
ahead of polling day. The dramatic 11 per cent increase in January was
largely a measure of the price increases which state enterprises had to make
to cover their deficits.
Their accounting methods also leave a lot to be desired. Moreover they have
tended to disguise their dismal financial performance by making deferred
payments, arrears and, in the case of the grain procurement board TMO,
looking to the central bank to fund their activities. In many cases the
problems of the state sector banks relate to the non-performing loans
extending to the state sector enterprises.
Mrs Tansu Ciller, the economics minister, is pushing, so far with little
success, to set up a new agency to handle the restructuring of these
companies. Critics of her proposal say it would merely create another layer
of bureaucracy, and would still not address the fundamental issue of whether
there is the political commitment to shake up the state sector. However, the
OECD, in its latest report on the Turkish economy, welcomed the move.
Some companies are making efforts to ready themselves for privatisation.
Turk Hava Yollar, the national airline, for example, is now looking at its
fleet sizes and yields, and is planning strategic alliances. But in general
the public sector appears to be drifting further into trouble.

Discord over use of revenues / Privatisation - the government has set an
ambitious target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MCDERMOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATISATION of Turkey's state-run economic enterprises (SEEs) and of the
government's participation in local companies is causing much debate and
uncertainty.
The state has an interest in 235 enterprises, either as a majority
shareholder, an affiliate or a minority partner in a privately-managed
concern. There has long been agreement in principle that the SEEs are in
need of reform, not least because of the heavy demands they make on the
public spending borrowing requirement (PSBR).
Reform has also been seen to be in the interests of greater economic and
financial efficiency and the promotion of wider share ownership.
But under the coalition government of Mr Suleyman Demirel, residual
opposition to foreign ownership within the economy has been resurfacing.
Where the debate has become complicated is over the use of the money earned.
The government wants earnings to help offset the budget deficit. Foreign
bankers fear that money generated by the sales of government holdings is
going into a 'big black hole' and not being used for investment in
productive assets. They express doubts about the long-term planning of the
authorities handling privatisation.
By contrast, the Public Participation High Council (PPHC), the
decision-making and executive body of the privatisation programme, and the
Public Participation Administration (PPA), the agency responsible for the
planning and execution of the programme and entrusted with selling the
state's shares in companies, feel that the earnings should not be used for
offsetting the budget deficit.
Mr Ustun Sanver, the PPA's president, argues that the funds brought in could
be put to more productive use - not least to convince the Turkish public and
potential foreign investors that there are benefits in the privatisation of
enterprises that have been, since the end of the 1920s, central to the
economic philosophy of Turkey - state capitalism.
Confusion over the running of the privatisation policy was also reflected by
the establishment this year by the new government of Toyok, an independent
professional agency to restructure the 120 companies in which the state has
a majority, in preparation for sale by private block sale or public offer.
The intention was to depoliticise the privatisation issue. However, Toyok
has not yet received the legislation to operate.
The first steps towards disposal of SEEs came early in 1984. By the
different methods of sales, the PPA records that, between July 1986 and July
1992, 26 companies were privatised by block sale, amounting to Dollars
144.1m. The majority were in the animal-feed, food-processing and beverages
sectors.
Twenty-three companies privatised by public offering over the same period
brought in Dollars 401.6m. They were mainly concerned with heavier
industries, including electricity production, cement, and motor
manufacturing.
This year, the PPA is embarking on new tactics to speed up privatisation.
According to Mr Sanver, negotiations should have been complete for the
transfer of the most successful sector privatised - 11 cement companies -
after a series of bid negotiations resulting in more than Dollars 400m of
sales. Along with completed selling of the state's stake in
telecommunications companies such as Netas (49 per cent) and Teletas (18 per
cent), and also in Sekerbank, Konya Seker, a food-processing company, the
vehicle manufacturers TOE, and a mining company IDC, this could all bring in
Dollars 758m this year. While this falls short of the projections, it does
illustrate the fact that privatisation revenues for 1992 are not that far
short of total revenues accrued during the previous six years.
Whereas, previously, there was a protracted series of bidding rounds, in
future a minimum acceptable appraised value is to be announced. Block sale
would then be awarded to bids above or close to that value.
In the first three months of next year, under this new pattern it was hoped
to complete the sell off of three companies in the agro-industry sector: SEK
(dairy products), EBK (fish and meat processing) and 26 country-wide animal
feed plants. But Mr Sanver said last month that, 'as a technician', he did
not think their privatisation would be possible 'in today's conditions'.
Plans for 1993 include 17 companies, mainly in the food-processing and
beverages sectors, but also in the automotive industries. The intention,
under preliminary PPA studies for the 1994-98 period, is to target much
larger undertakings. Under consideration are the state-operated iron and
steel sector, the state-owned petrochemical, petroleum, refining and
distribution sector, electricity production and distribution, and the
state-owned banking sector. Over the next five years, the PPA said in a
position paper last month, its target was to privatise at least 30 per cent
of state shares and to generate approximately Dollars 10bn.
The PPA is aware that there are battles to be fought on two fronts, at
least. The concept of the benefits of privatisation have to be sold to the
public, and it has embarked on a series of country-wide seminars and
conferences.
But beyond the exercise of persuading the Turkish public and foreigners that
privatisation is worthwhile, there are local difficulties to be worked out.
The PPA disapproves of the Treasury's plan to take 50 per cent from the sale
of state holdings for current expenses (ie, the budget deficit). It points
out that it funds a considerable number of infrastructure projects.
The PPA is also aware that the search for greater efficiency through
privatisation will lead to job losses. The PPA, the SSK (the state workers'
social insurance agency) and the Treasury are conducting separate studies of
how to provide retraining and relocation for displaced workers.
There remain some acute and perennial problems. The costs of the existing
SEEs to the PSBR, as a proportion of the GNP, remains high and is a drain on
the budget. This is where the argument comes in that income from
privatisation should help offset this deficit.
The whole programme, especially as it moves into the bigger privatisation
proposals for heavier industry, is also limited by the ability of the
Istanbul stock exchange to sustain large-scale flotation of state-owned
assets. The PPA is proposing the establishment of a savings fund, based on
the wages and salaries of workers, which could be invested in debt
securities. In return, these could be invested in the most successful
privatised shares. This would, in theory, help to make people aware of the
benefits of privatisation and sound shareholding.
But the privatisation programme remains under intense discussion. Indeed, as
its status and evolution is debated by different branches of the government,
doubt becomes apparent about commitment to pursuing the policy fully.
Mr Demirel, at a conference last month, caused some confusion by
acknowledging that it had to be carried through, with the priority given to
the most saleable sectors. It was a statement which muddied the
privatisation policies' priorities and which tended to underline his lack of
conviction on the issue.

Review follows as US cancels grants - The defence industry / Congress's
decision is a major setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE ARE trying times for Turkey's defence industry. After all the
encouraging words for the country's robust role in the war against Saddam
Hussein, Turkey can be forgiven for feeling a little let down by its allies.
As if an embarrassing tussle with German parliamentarians over the rules for
the use of military aid equipment was not bad enough, worse was to come with
the decision by the US Congress on October 6 to end the programme of grants
for the Turkish defence effort.
Although Turkey was only a spectator - if a rather close one - the Gulf war
did much to underline the shortcomings in mobility and firepower of its own
armed forces.
Turkey has a number of joint defence collaborations with foreign companies.
The priorities are well known - electronic warfare, real-time communication
and mobility and agility. The broad challenge, as identified by Gen Dogan
Gures, the chief of general staff, is not just to modernise the armed
forces, but how to standardise the military's diverse supplies, which was
one of the original arguments for pushing ahead with a homegrown defence
industry.
The army, however, has had its differences with the civilian-run defence
procurement agency (SSM). The question, as ever, is whether SSM, in its
efforts to maximise the amount of local production, is able to deliver what
the generals really want.
Having once been the favoured industrial child of the former Motherland
party administration, the Demirel coalition, too, seems to be less
enthusiastic about SSM's procurement strategy.
Indeed, when the prime minister came to review progress on the various SSM
projects at the start of the year, he was said to have been shocked by the
size of the financing involved. He immediately called for the re-tender of a
large military helicopter contract, to see whether it made sense to have an
off-the-shelf purchase of a smaller number, rather than committing millions
of dollars to a long-term industrial collaboration.
It was not just the financial imperatives that determined the need for a
policy review of the defence programme. Mr Suleyman Demirel is under growing
pressure to provide enhanced firepower for the military in its increasingly
bloody fight with Kurdish separatists in the south-east of the country. In
the event, Turkey awarded the contract to United Technologies, the
long-running favourite with its Sikorsky Black Hawk multi-purpose
helicopter. However, the contract called for an immediate delivery of 25,
with the remaining 50 being built under a joint production arrangement.
In other areas, too, the procurement agency has had its wings clipped. The
armoured personnel carrier built in co-operation with FMC of the US is still
having problems. The agency cancelled a contract awarded to Texas
Instruments of the US for night-sighting equipment for the vehicles, after
disappointing trials in the US. There were also earlier problems with the
engine capability, and the gun.
Giat of France recently was awarded the contract to supply the 25mm gun and
turret, after another wrangle with the Swiss over the supply of its Oerlikon
gun, widely seen as the best product on offer. Berne earlier suspended all
arm sales to Turkey over its Kurdish policy, a point which was not lost on
the generals when it came to retendering for the gun.
Ironically, the latest move by the US Congress could provide ammunition for
those in SSM, championing the cause of an indigenous manufacturing
capability. Turks need little reminding of the time, after Turkey's invasion
of Cyprus in 1974, when the US placed an arms embargo.
According to the foreign aid bill, Turkey, like other Nato southern-flank
countries, will now receive low interest credits. In 1992, the US pledged
Dollars 475m in grant form, the lion' share to be targeted at the F-16 jet
fighter project. Earlier this year, Turkey signed a supply contract with
Egypt, and is hoping to tap into the Dollars 4bn Gulf Defence Fund, set up
by the US and its Arab allies in the wake of the war against Iraq.
But the Congress decision clearly represents a major setback, and for many
officials is seen as a harbinger of things to come in military relations
with the US. 'Disappointing,' was the conclusion of the Turkish foreign
ministry. The decision 'does not give the impression of a coherent policy,'
a ministry statement complained.
'We have to have a credible military force. In that sense, the congressional
decision had a very negative impact on our ability to assume our new
responsibilities,' said a senior Turkish diplomat.
The immediate casualty will be the F-16 jet fighter programme, which was
heavily dependent on US funds under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS)
programme.
In both 1988 and 1989, the Turkish treasury sought a refinancing of some of
its outstanding credits under the FMS programme. A similar move is not ruled
out today.
The continuing crisis with the Germans will further underline how Turkey is
subject to the political whims of its first-world arms supplier. This
dispute followed television pictures of the BTR-60 armoured personnel
carriers being used to put down Kurdish demonstrations in March.
The BTR-60, a former East German weapon, was given to Turkey as part of the
Conventional Arms in Europe disarmament agreement, whereby arms from the
richer Nato partners would replace the older equipment of the poorer members
 -the so-called cascade effect. The German arms were to be used expressly
for Nato defence purposes. The TV pictures therefore brought howls of
protest, and led indirectly to the resignation of a German minister and the
imposition of a ban on arms shipments to Turkey.
The issue came up again in last month, when Turkish newspapers carried
pictures of a body being dragged on the ground by one of the BTR-60s. The
crisis has now taken another twist, with the plans of the Turkish interior
ministry to buy the same vehicle from the Russians. Mr Ismet Sezgin, the
interior minister, was in Moscow in October finalising a deal which should
allow the Turkish security forces to use the mixed stock of BTR-60s with
impunity against the Kurds.

the Hebrew Chorus performed by the Turkish state opera company, before an
audience of the best and brightest of Istanbul Jewry.
Verdi's Nabucco was just one event in 1992, in a spate of celebrations to
mark the 500 years since the Sephardic Jews were expelled from Spain by
Ferdinand and Isabella, to find a new life in the Islamic world of Sultan
Beyazit II.
'In impoverishing Spain,' the Sultan is said to have remarked, 'the
expulsion will enrich Turkey.'
Nowhere is this more true than in the business community, where Jews play a
leading role in Turkish corporate life. From sectors like textiles, where
they have traditionally been strong, to heavy industry, the 20,000-strong
Jewish community has made a big contribution to Turkish business life.
Equally successful, if less conspicuous, are those Jews who control much of
the activity on Istanbul's Tahtakale money market. 'Even today the rate for
the dollar is still set by the Tahtakale. The Jewish wholesalers are the
bankers of this country,' says a producer of women's lingerie.
Just as the first arrivals in 1492 brought the art of printing, and even
cannon construction, to the Sublime Porte, the Jews today, with their
language skills and their contacts in the markets of Europe and the US, have
played an often pivotal role in the development of some of the Turks' own
groups.
In his memoirs, Mr Vehbi Koc paterfamilias of Turkey's biggest trading
house, openly acknowledges the contribution to the company's success of two
prominent members of the Jewish community - Bernar Nahum and Isak de
Eskinazis.
Mr Nahum, who started his career with Ford Motor, was an invaluable partner
when the young Mr Koc started his auto business, initially making the
Anadol, before forming a joint venture with Fiat of Italy, an operation
which dominates the Turkish car market today.
Others have emerged on their own. Mr Isak Alaton's Alarko Holdings is one of
Turkey's most successful construction companies, building everything from
sewage plants for the Istanbul municipality to hotels in Moscow and other
cities in the former Soviet Union. Another well-known name, Vitali Hakko,
started his career making felt hats. Today he owns and runs Vakko, Turkey's
leading fashion house.
It would be difficult to put a figure on their contribution to Turkey's
economy. Certainly, personal fortunes have been made. The display of
cosmopolitan elegance at the Ataturk Cultural Centre, in Istanbul, might
have graced any opera house in London or Paris.
'It's very strange, but when the Ottomans were in Palestine, none of the
Turkish Jews chose to leave,' says Mr Silvyo Ovadya, editor of Salom, the
official newspaper of the Jewish community. Salom today publishes seven of
its eight pages in Turkish. Before 1983, the paper was produced in Ladino, a
medieval Spanish comprehensible to Cervantes but increasingly unknown to
Turkey's younger generation of Jews.
'I think some of the businessmen are reluctant to drop the cult of the
wandering Jew,' says Jak Deleon, restaurant critic and professor of English
at Istanbul's Bosporus University.
Some habits are certainly difficult to break, like the weekly visit to
Istanbul's only remaining Kosher restaurant, now run by a Moslem Turk. In
her documentary film, Si je t'oublie Istanbul, Nora Seni describes how
Istanbul's Jewish families still retreat to their large wooden houses on
Buyukada island, during the hot summer months. Many of the rich Jews prefer
to fly to a south coast resort and sit in more stately splendour on their
yachts.
'We're not a typical Jewish community,' says Mr Jefi Camhi, of Profilo, a
leading consumer electronics group. 'We're from both worlds, Sephardic and
Ashkenazic. In Britain there was a time when Jews were restricted from
certain trades. In Turkey there has never been any restrictions.'
There was, of course, the Varlik Vergisi - the infamous wealth tax imposed
on the Jews and the other official minorities, the Greeks and the Armenians,
during the second world war, when an estimated 5,000 people were sent to
labour camps for failing to pay the tax.
Eli Aciman was one Jewish businessman who suffered as a result of the Varlik
Vergisi, eventually leaving for the US. He later returned, and today runs
Turkey's largest advertising agency, in partnership with J. Walter Thompson.
But the community remains particularly vulnerable to another shift in
Turkish attitudes - this time perhaps a shift in Turkey's western
orientation to play a more Islamic role.
Significantly, it is Mr Jak Camhi, Jefi's father, who is now a leading voice
in the campaign to have Turkey accepted as a full member of the European
Community, heading a business association which directly lobbies Brussels -
so far without success.

FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Turkish Finance, Investment and Industry (10):
Investment is needed to match rivals - Textiles

THE TEXTILE and clothing industry, which is important to Turkey's economy,
is entering unpredictable times. It needs investment on a large scale, and
the ability to cope with competition at a time when the evolution of the
Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) may be in question.
The MFA, in turn, depends on what happens next in the global trade
liberalisation talks in the Uruguay Round under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). In the event of their failing, existing quotas
under the MFA, designed to protect the industries of the richer countries,
would remain. Whatever the outcome, Turkey must seek new export markets.
Within the manufacturing sector, textiles and clothing contribute 20 per
cent to output, and employ around one third of all workers. According to the
State Institute of Statistics, the value of the industry's exports has risen
steadily, from Dollars 838m in 1980 (28.8 per cent of all commodity exports)
to Dollars 4.3bn (31.8 per cent) in 1991.
But in order to compete with its main rivals - including China, Hong Kong,
South Korea, Pakistan and Bangladesh - something like Dollars 6bn will have
to be invested in modernisation over the next five years. This will involve
updating weaving and spinning plant. Ninety per cent of spinning machines,
for example, are more than 15 years old.
Modernisation is needed to offset the gradual rise in Turkish labour costs.
At the heart of the problem is the fact that the government has, for
political reasons, preferred to invest in (or to subsidise) farmers
producing cotton, especially in the main growing regions around Izmir and
Adana, rather than in textiles - paying as much as twice world cotton
prices.
In terms of current political issues, the apparent stalling of the Gatt
talks is, in one sense, bringing only partial grief to the Turkish textile
industry. On the one hand, there was not enormous satisfaction with the
planned 10-year phasing-out agreement of the MFA - theoretically agreed on
within the context of a successful Uruguay Round. On the other, the absence
of an operative MFA makes Turkey vulnerable to a growth of bilateral
agreements and quotas.
The Istanbul Textile and Apparel Exporters Association (IKTIB), with its
10,000 members producing something like 80 per cent of exports in the
sector, realises this.
The sector is not without problems. There is competition from producers in
the Asian and far-eastern countries. These low-wage producers and their
influence on the world market had the effect of causing lay-offs among the
full employment total of about 2m.
IKTIB maintains that the competition from these developing countries is
unfair, because of government subsidies. Indeed, in a rare case for a
developing country towards another, in October 1991, Turkey imposed a 20 per
cent anti-dumping tax, due to expire on December 10, on cotton yarn imports
from Pakistan.
The principal market is the European Community. But here Turkey has run into
difficulties, because of accusations of dumping which date back to 1981.
Brussels relented to some extent, by announcing in October 1991 that it was
dropping countervailing duties on imports of Turkish polyester fibres and
yarns, following Ankara's agreement to phase out its subsidy on these
textile exports. But in March the EC Council of Ministers imposed definitive
anti-dumping duties on cotton yarn of 12.1 per cent, with exceptional duties
of between 4.9 and 12.1 per cent for certain companies.
The EC, in particular, accused Turkey of dumping cotton yarn on the European
market in 1981, and imposed then a 12 per cent tariff. Broadly, IKTIB does
not regard EC textile trading policies as fair. Since then, tariff disputes
have surfaced periodically. However, in November 1990, as part of Turkey's
compensation for applying economic sanctions against Iraq, the US
administration agreed to increase the quota for textile imports in 1991 by
50 per cent.
The evolution of Turkey's textile and garment industry as one of the major
suppliers to the EC has taken place over the last five years. Overall,
exports of clothing dominate. From Dollars 314m in 1981, they rose to
Dollars 3.2bn last year, representing 69.6 per cent of the Dollars 4.6bn
textile and clothing exports. Over the past decade, clothing exports, apart
from dips in 1985 and 1986, have experienced substantial growth rates - 13
per cent in 1991.
The relationship with the EC, where Germany currently takes 65 per cent of
Turkey's textile and clothing exports, is dominant. Three-quarters of
textile and clothing exports go to the EC. In 1991, after Germany, Britain,
Italy and France took altogether about 10 per cent. The role of Germany in
this export pattern reflects the close economic and social relationship
between the two countries.
According to IKTIB figures, Turkey is the world's seventh largest cotton
producer, with the 1991-92 crop, estimated at 2.8m 480 lb bales, accounting
for 3 per cent of the world cotton crop. Cotton yarn production has grown
steadily since 1967, and subsequently, as a result of government incentives
in the early 1970s, at a swifter rate. Yarn production reached 500,000
tonnes in 1987 and has remained at about that level since, amounting to
530,000 tonnes in 1990. Within the total woven textiles industry, cotton
woven fabrics have the highest share of production, amounting to 314,000
tonnes in 1990.
Turkey also produces all the major commercial synthetic yarns and fibres,
with acrylic fibres in the lead, ahead of polyester yarns and fibres and
polyamide yarn. Production of these, 215,000 tonnes in 1985 has risen.
The US market for textile and clothing exports, which amounted to Dollars
304.4m, or 6.6 per cent, in 1991, is expected to be increasingly difficult
if protectionism strengthens. IKTIB takes some satisfaction from its high
quality and supply-time response of five weeks for the EC, which it claims
the Far East cannot match. But the formation of the North American Free
Trade Agreement, linking the US, Mexico and Canada, could make the US market
more difficult.
Some compensation could come from exports to the neighbouring countries of
the former Soviet Union, and to South Africa. Closer production co-operation
with Japan could also result in an increase in exports. But growth potential
lies more in ready-made garments than with textiles. However, much will
depend on government investment policies.
