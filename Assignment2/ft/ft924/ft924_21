FT  17 NOV 92 / Virgin in stores deal with US video chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent

<TEXT>
MR RICHARD Branson's Virgin Group yesterday announced a joint venture with
Blockbuster Entertainment, the Florida-based video rental company, with the
aim of building music mega-stores in every large US city and throughout much
of Europe.
The joint venture will own Virgin's retail outlets in the US, continental
Europe and Australia. It will not affect Virgin's retail outlets in the UK,
where it has a joint venture with retailer WH Smith, or in Japan, where it
is linked with the Marui retail chain.
Virgin and Blockbuster will have equal shares in Virgin's 14 stores in
continental Europe and Australia. They will also equally own Virgin's store
in Los Angeles, which is due to open next month.
Virgin said it hoped to double its European presence, with the two joint
venture partners funding expansion equally.
Blockbuster's acquisition of the European and Australian stakes will result
in a large payment to Virgin, although no amount was disclosed yesterday.
With the exception of the Los Angeles store, Blockbuster will own 75 per
cent of the US venture, with Virgin retaining the remaining 25 per cent.
The joint venture hopes to open stores throughout the US, with Blockbuster
providing most of the funding. The stores will be managed by Virgin.
Blockbuster and Virgin will have equal representation on the board of the US
joint venture. Virgin will have the option to increase its stake to 35 per
cent over the next three years.
Blockbuster last month announced an agreement to buy 236 Music Plus and
Sound Warehouse music stores in the US from companies controlled by Shamrock
Holdings of California, an investment group controlled by Mr Roy Disney,
Walt Disney's nephew.
Virgin said the link with Blockbuster would enable it to offer video rentals
in its new US music stores. Competing US music outlets already offered such
a service.
Blockbuster last January bought Cityvision of the UK, owner of the Ritz
chain, making it the biggest video rental operation in the US and Britain.
Virgin is also looking at opportunities for expansion in south-east Asia.

FT  17 NOV 92 / German motor's rough ride: Christopher Parkes on why
Daimler-Benz has stalled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ, the motor at the heart of Daimler-Benz, the German vehicles,
aerospace and electricals group, is running rough.
Bankers' and brokers' analysts ran for cover yesterday, slashing forecasts
as they went, following a radical revision by Mr Gerhard Liener, finance
director, of the group's own expectations for 1992.
Group net profit, he confirmed, far from meeting the board's target and
matching last year's DM1.94bn (Pounds 800m), will fall to around DM1.5bn. A
large chunk of that, possibly as much as DM400m, will come from the
newly-consolidated Deutsche Airbus business. Mr Liener said Mercedes-Benz
would sell some 30,000 cars fewer than expected this year, and inventories
had increased accordingly to 40 per cent above normal levels. The results
would also be hit by the cost of special sales incentives.
By way of compensation, he suggested that the dividend would be held at last
year's DM13. And as he made clear in a radio interview yesterday, payroll
cuts totalling 40,000 jobs by the end of 1994 - including 7,500 on top of
the 20,000 already announced at Mercedes - would yield annual savings of
around DM1bn as early as next year.
Deutsche Bank promptly cut its forecast for the group's earnings this year
from DM57 to DM50 a share, and from DM47 to DM40 for 1993. Daimler shares
shed DM14.60 in Frankfurt and closed at DM539.40 in a static market
apparently paralysed by word from the government's panel of five independent
advisers that the west German economy will not grow at all next year.
Just as in the economy at large, nothing much is going right at present for
Daimler-Benz. Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), its aircraft arm, squeezed a DM50m
profit out of DM12bn sales last year.
It said last week that new orders this year would be at least 25 per cent
lower than expected.
Mr Bernd Gottschalk, head of the Mercedes trucks division, recently marked
his first six months in the job with the announcement that plans for a new
DM1bn lorry plant near Berlin had been shelved.
He later explained that Mercedes' worldwide truck output would fall 5 per
cent and domestic production would be down 11 per cent this year.
September's intake of orders from German customers for vehicles over 6
tonnes was 29 per cent lower than in August, he added.
It is now clear that trucks and cars, which bring in about 70 per cent of
both group sales and profits, and which are the cornerstone of Daimler's
grand design to transform itself into an international high-technology power
centre, have suffered a sudden and dramatic downturn in their fortunes since
the half-way mark this year.
At the end of June, Mr Edzard Reuter, group chairman, was still confident of
beating 1991's net result. By August, when the half-year figures appeared
and showed a 16 per cent profits advance, he spoke of a 'subsiding boom' in
the domestic market where the group does around 46 per cent of its business.
Even then it seemed that cost-cutting measures already under way, including
cutting 20,000 jobs at Mercedes and 7,500 at Dasa, would cushion the group
against the effects of subsidence.
As late as last month, senior executives insisted that the group would sell
550,000 cars this year.
But as Mr Liener's informal weekend briefing to Stuttgart journalists
betrayed, the Mercedes car business had already stalled.
Deliveries in July and August were between 30 per cent and 50 per cent lower
than in the previous months, the company said yesterday. There had been some
recovery since then in middle and top-range sales, but not in the popular
190 series.
This unexpected downturn (which had not dented rival BMW so badly because it
had the 'luck' to have new models on hand to tempt buyers) was the main
cause of the group's troubles, the the company added.
The failure of Japanese and US markets to recover according to economic
forecasters' prescriptions was the second main factor, while the September
money markets 'disaster' which led to the revaluation of the D-Mark had
played a lesser role, the company said.
Corporate short-sightedness was another factor, according to local analysts,
who have persistently charged that German business has for too long failed
either to acknowledge or address the possibility that Germany might not,
after all, be immune to infection from international recession.
Yesterday's black prognosis from Bonn's 'five wise men' confronts German
industry and its bell-wether Daimler with the prospect of another round of
reassessment of how it can best cope with the downturn, restore fading
competitiveness in its traditional businesses and at the same time continue
the advance into new technologies.
The group hopes that the launch of the new 190 car series, to coincide with
the modest upturn expected by economists in the middle of next year,
followed by the appearance of revamped mid-range models, will mark a turn in
Mercedes' short-term fortunes.
Longer-term, its brand-new car plant at Rastatt near Baden Baden is
perfecting manufacturing techniques which, it is hoped, will bring the group
within striking distance of the productivity levels common among Japanese
competitors.
In the meantime the group has learnt hard lessons which should stand it in
good stead if forecasts of international recovery next autumn turn out yet
again to be too optimistic.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Top Lautro official may resign over investor protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR OFFICIAL at the self-regulatory body for the life insurance
industry has said she would resign rather than work for the Personal
Investment Authority which is to replace it because she said the new body
will not take sufficient account of consumer interests.
Ms Julia Leisching, chief policy and administration officer at Lautro, said
in a letter yesterday to Mr Kit Jebbens, Lautro's chief executive: 'I can
have no belief in or commitment to the goals of the PIA.' In her letter, Ms
Leisching, who joined Lautro at its inception in 1988 from the Department of
Trade and Industry's Insolvency Service, offered to resign.
Ms Leisching said: 'I feel in the context of PIA that there is a grave risk
that what should be the main agenda item, investor protection, is being
marginalised by the interests of the various industry groups.'
The PIA has been proposed as a self-regulatory body which would incorporate
members of Lautro as well as two other self-regulatory bodies - Fimbra,
which groups independent financial advisers, and some members of Imro, the
fund managers' body.
Debate has so far centred on how the PIA should be structured to ensure that
all those it is designed to regulate join.
Life insurance industry members of Lautro insist the PIA should also
regulate the financial services arms of banks and building societies, which
are now directly regulated by the Securities and Investments Board.
Ms Leisching believes the creation of the PIA was forced by the inability of
Fimbra members to pay for the cost of policing themselves adequately or
their share of claims against the Investors Compensation Scheme. She said
she could see little point in reordering the self-regulatory system to
preserve a section of the industry that too often served consumers badly.
'Everyone knows that there is an oversupply of people in the industry and
that too many poor quality tied agents were signed up,' she said.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Clinton to make growth and jobs package first priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BILL CLINTON said yes-terday that measures to create jobs and stimulate
growth would be his first priority after taking office next year, in spite
of tentative signs that the US recovery is gathering momentum on its own.
The president-elect said he was committed to reducing the budget deficit but
warned that a fairer tax system, involving larger burdens on the wealthy,
would be an essential part of a multi-year deficit reduction programme.
Mr Clinton was speaking at a joint press conference with Democratic
congressional leaders in Little Rock shortly after the Federal Reserve
reported a 0.3 per cent increase in industrial production last month
compared with September, larger than expected in financial markets. The
production increase was the latest in a series of more encouraging economic
figures including reports on Friday of an unexpected surge in retail sales
in October and a rebound in consumer confidence early this month.
Mr Clinton said he saw no evidence yet of a 'long-term strengthening in
manufacturing'. He saw nothing in the latest numbers to suggest he should do
less to stimulate the economy than he promised in the campaign. Mr Clinton's
economic package is expected to include a temporary investment tax credit to
stimulate business capital spending and an acceleration of public
infrastructure projects. A cut in capital gains tax rates on some forms of
investment is also possible.
Economists who advised Mr Clinton during the campaign said the fiscal
stimulus was likely to be worth Dollars 30bn (Pounds 19.4bn) to Dollars 40bn
or roughly 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product.
Asked if the stimulus would take precedence over efforts to reduce the
budget deficit, Mr Clinton said: 'I do not believe that you can reduce the
deficit without restoring economic growth.'
He indicated that measures to reduce the rate of growth of healthcare costs
and to shift the burden of taxes on to the wealthy would be essential
components of his deficit reduction plan. People would accept the 'pain' of
deficit reduction more readily if it was seen to be based on 'tax fairness',
he said. During the campaign, Mr Clinton said he would raise taxes on the
top 2 per cent by about Dollars 80bn over four years.

FT  17 NOV 92 / France loses ground in battle with EC partners on farm trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE last night lost a last-minute struggle to gather sufficient support
to prevent a farm trade accord between the European Community and the US in
talks starting tomorrow in Washington.
Amid a welter of contradictory statistics about what agreement would mean
for EC food exports, France's partners gave 'a clear benediction' to Mr Ray
MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner and chief farm trade negotiator, said
Mr David Curry, UK junior agriculture minister. 'His hand is greatly
strengthened,' an aide to Mr MacSharry said.
The Washington talks are aimed at settling an EC-US row over oilseeds and
clearing the way for agreement on the Uruguay Round trade reforms being
negotiated under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, the French farm minister, told his colleagues in a
closed meeting that the cuts in subsidised exports and EC output which would
result from a Uruguay Round deal, and agreement with the US on the oilseeds
dispute, would go beyond the price and production cuts agreed in the
reformed Common Agricultural Policy. France produced a paper to substantiate
its position, which drew from the same material in an alleged European
Commission document leaked to French papers over the weekend.
A senior Commission official described the French figures as 'a doomsday
scenario with a political spin'. Inside the Council of Ministers, Mr
MacSharry dismissed the French analysis as 'rubbish and nonsense, with
capital letters'. According to Mr Curry, 'nobody endorsed the French
figures'.
Ireland and Spain also expressed concern over whether a Gatt deal on farm
trade - needed for an overall Uruguay Round agreement - would be compatible
with the new CAP. But France's support was less than at last week's foreign
ministers' meeting in Brussels.
France argued that the Commission negotiators were working on the false
assumptions that average farm yield would stay flat, and that EC farmers
would recapture swathes of their own market in spite of commitments to open
up to imports. Furthermore, they insisted, a Gatt deal would require the EC
to take significantly more land out of production than the 15 per cent
'set-aside' agreed under CAP.
Mr MacSharry argued against the French claims. He pointed out that oilseeds
output was sharply down this year and would decrease further next year -
including under French projections. He argued that Gatt would reduce only
subsidised food exports, but that with the price cuts to world market level
agreed under the new CAP, there would be no restraint on unsubsidised
exports.
Mr John Gummer, the UK agriculture minister, who chaired the meeting, said
of the French claims that 'it is fantastic to assume that the commissioner
would be negotiating away large areas of Europe to be set aside'.
Mr Laurits Toernaes, the Danish farm minister, said of the Washington
meeting that a Gatt agreement was 'very close'.

FT  17 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Kingfisher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Innovation has not been Kingfisher's middle name, so the company is perhaps
sensible to try out someone else's format for retailing office supplies. And
in typically cautious style, Kingfisher's chairman, Mr Geoffrey Mulcahy, is
opting for slow development and limited investment. Whether Staples' idea of
businesses coming to out-of-town sheds to buy office supplies and equipment
will catch on in the UK is an open question. Cosy buyers may prefer to sit
in warm offices and deal with existing suppliers, so success will depend on
persuading managements the savings are worth the extra effort.
That said, other retailers, such as WH Smith, see opportunity in this
fragmented market. The main promise seems to lie with small to medium-sized
corporate customers which cannot reap economies of scale. The gamble is that
by late 1993, when Kingfisher's experiment is under way, small businesses
may actually be able to afford new equipment.

FT  17 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank shares have usefully outperformed the stock market since UK monetary
policy was liberated from the ERM. Accordingly it is clearly of concern to
investors if the current campaign against wider lending margins - a
traditional accompaniment to falling interest rates - is sustained. Bank and
building society balance sheets may be in desperate need of repair at the
moment, but both types of institution are unusually sensitive to public
criticism. Plenty of criticisms can be levelled at the banks at the moment
but making excessive profits is surely not one of them. A strong banking
system, after all, is a prerequisite for a strong recovery. The idea that
lenders should reduce their rates exactly in line with base rates is in any
case somewhat simplistic. Admittedly the endowment effect may not be what it
was, given the fewer number of interest-free current accounts; the banks
will presumably also have anticipated the impact of falling rates on their
free capital by offsetting measures such as buying gilts. Nevertheless, as
businesses themselves they are entitled to be mindful of their overall
return on equity.
It could be that pressure to lower some lending rates - such as those on
credit cards and unsecured borrowing - is successful. But on one front -
competition from building societies - there may be some relief. Mortgage
lenders such as the Halifax and Abbey National may appear to have been
largely unscathed by recession in the housing market. However with the
volume of bad debts expected to jump from Pounds 1.2bn in 1991 to perhaps
Pounds 2bn this year, and with the cushion of mortgage guarantee insurance
virtually used up, societies are vulnerable to another downward lurch in
house prices. They too are anxious to widen margins, just in case.

FT  17 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: BOC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is rough justice that BOC's effort to blaze a trail in financial
reporting highlights what a hash it made of US home healthcare. Under old
accounting rules a small book profit on the sale of Glasrock would have
flattered yesterday's full year results. In fact the figures are
overshadowed by an ugly Pounds 117m write-off of goodwill against earnings.
Taken with historic profit figures for discontinued business - another
innovation - and last year's reorganisation provision, Glasrock looks to
have been a mistake on the scale of BOC's involvement with carbon graphite
in the 1980s.
The broader question is whether BOC can make a better fist of its remaining
healthcare activity. The market might be forgiven for wondering whether the
latest venture in biotechnology will be equally botched. With research
expenditure on the project running at only Pounds 8m a year, though, this is
hardly the biggest threat. More immediately, competition from generic drugs
in the US means that BOC's new anaesthetic, Suprane, will have to perform
well just to maintain healthcare profits this year.
Conditions in industrial gases are no better than at the nine-month stage.
The UK market took another lurch down in the fourth quarter. Japan is
slowing and US demand is flat. All the more impressive, then, that operating
profits from gases were 12 per cent higher once changes in exchange rates
are stripped out. While earnings are clouded by the write-off and changes in
presentation, BOC's promise to increase the dividend is backed by a
formidable ability to generate cash. The company paid back debt last year
despite an ambitious capital expenditure programme. The new-style cash flow
statement should be one change in accounting standards which works in BOC's
favour.

FT  17 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: A taste of cold steel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Metal fatigue was evident at British Steel yesterday. The strain showed not
so much in the interim figures, which were badly affected by reorganisation
and redundancy costs, but in the management's repeated complaint about the
state of the European steel market. Cut-price supplies from eastern Europe
and over-capacity in the EC have further weakened prices in the last few
months. These supply problems are now being exacerbated by the downturn in
Germany, notably in car manufacturing, and another round of destocking.
British Steel and private sector steelmakers in Germany may be looking to
the EC to stop subsidies to inefficient state-owned EC manufacturers.
However, ministers are likely to prefer to act against the soft target of
eastern European imports than to address the politically sensitive problem
of rationalising the EC's steel industry. Such import restrictions will at
best buy companies a little time. British Steel, which was expected to be
one of the big beneficiaries of devaluation, has already seen much of that
gain eroded by weak markets.
Given such a tough outlook, the company is fortunate to have a strong
balance sheet. Cash will continue to flow out of the company in the second
half of the year as redundancy costs continue, but net borrowings should
stabilise at a manageable Pounds 300m next year. While it is in better shape
than many continental competitors, political uncertainty makes the shares
hard to value. In the unlikely event that the EC acts to cut capacity,
British Steel could find itself well placed. But if the haemorrhaging
continues, the company has no nanny state to protect it.

The morning session will explore such delicate questions as Why Export

Sounds like an ideal refresher course for a few of Her Majesty's ministers.

Is Sir Christopher Harding, the ex-boss of British Nuclear Fuels, being
lined up for the chairmanship of Newarthill, the loss-making family
construction business of Lady Thatcher's great buddy, Lord McAlpine?
It would make sense. Sir Hedley Greenborough, the current chairman, is over
70, the rest of the McAlpine family is getting on a bit, and Sir Christopher
knows more than most about how to preserve family businesses. For nearly 20
years he has kept an eye on Lord Hanson's family transport business.
If he can satisfy Lord Hanson he should be able to satisfy 50-year-old Lord
McAlpine who, despite the retirement of his heroine, still seems more
interested in politics than running the family business.
He has just published The Servant, which has been described as a bible for
Machiavellian right hand men, and is dedicated to 'the most magnificent
Baroness Thatcher . . .from one of her many servants, who believes she could
have been better served'.
Sir Christopher, who has just joined the Newarthill board, refuses to
discuss his future role but his experience will come in handy. No one is
suggesting that Newarthill is in dire financial straits. But in the three
years since the McAlpine family bought out the minority, at a multiple of 38
times earnings, the company has lost over Pounds 50m.
Unlike its quoted brother, Alfred McAlpine, private companies like
Newarthill cannot rely on using other people's money, via public rights
issues, when they run short of cash.

Russia launched an unprecedented assault on the United States yesterday by
putting into orbit a satellite bearing promotional material for its emerging
private sector.
The sputnik, carrying a message from President Boris Yeltsin, was launched
from the once top-secret military site of Plesetsk.
Its estimated arrival time in the Pacific Ocean, near Seattle, is November
22 - just in time for the US Thanksgiving holiday on November 26. If the
plan works, (a big if), the sputnik will be brought ashore by the Russian
Pacific fleet.
But rather than a turkey, it will be carrying 19 containers of adverts for
Russian goods and a cut-glass replica of the Statue of Liberty. The exercise
is said to cost Dollars 200m - funded entirely by Russia's new businessmen.
If true, it seems a strange investment for a country which is strapped for
cash.

Cambridge University's recently-launched glossy 'Cam' magazine is no doubt
an attempt to stoke up US-style loyalty to the alma mater so that it can
milk its richer alumni for contributions.
The question is whether some of the more distinguished potential recipients

that same audience: 'How to survive an Inland Revenue investigation'.

Place your bets, please, for the new name for ICI's soon-to-be-spun-off
bioscience operation. Since the demerger was first mooted back in July
various nicknames have been tried out, ranging from Baby-Bio to Good-Bio.
How about calling it Mond? The name has an international feel to it and Sir
Alfred Moritz Mond, first Baron Melchett, was one of ICI's founders in 1926.
Problem is that Brunner Mond, ICI's soda ash business, was sold to a
management buy-out team last year, so there might not be enough Monds to go
round.
Some variation on Nobel Industries, another of the founding companies, would
also have a nice ring to it but might be confused with the eponymous Swedish
chemicals and explosives group. United Alkali Company and British Dyestuffs
Corporation, the two other founding companies, hardly fit the bill for a
high-tech bioscience company.
Sir Denys Henderson breaks the news tomorrow. Bet it has Bio in the name
even if it won't have ICI.

Small explosion on the international conference circuit. Euromoney has been
forced to cancel a high-profile shindig in Athens today.
The conference, 'Greece - an emerging market', was sponsored by Midland
Bank, together with the Union of Greek Banks, Salomon Brothers and Lockheed
Aircraft Service Corp. More than 500 had planned to attend. However, some of
the participants suddenly got the jitters after a Greek daily, Imerisia,
claimed that Euromoney had invited international businessmen to invest in
the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.
Despite frantic last-minute lobbying, the keynote speaker, Economy Minister
Stefanos Manos, pulled out and so did Stelios Argyros, president of the
Greek Industrialists' Federation, who was to chair the meeting.
Euromoney has denied Imerisia's allegation, but stressed that it was its
'inalienable right and duty' to write about areas all round the world; it
had planned to write about Macedonia in a forthcoming issue.
Euromoney's timing was a trifle tactless, considering that the Greeks are
fighting a diplomatic battle to prevent international recognition of
Macedonia under that name. Feeling runs high in Athens; anyone who forgets
to preface Macedonia with the words 'former Yugoslav republic of' is in for
a long lecture, covering almost 2,000 years of Balkan history from Alexander
the Great to Yugoslav communism under Tito.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Letter: Convincing argument
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr THOMAS WELSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader 'Independence for the Bank' (November 12) makes a very
convincing case. To a growing body of people in the UK it is becoming
unacceptable for monetary policy to remain a political tool in the hands of
politicians.
Our record since the second world war, characterised as it has been by
violent fluctuations in the economy, should convince the most sceptical that
the time has come for institutional change. Without an independent central
bank there is little hope of our achieving the stability essential to the
prosperity of industry; and without a sound industrial base we are all dead,
economically speaking.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Letter: Banks are frustrating UK strategy for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL HUDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Despite welcome reductions in bank rates, the banks are still charging
17.5 to 21 per cent for overdrafts. They are frustrating the government's
strategy for growth by refusing to pass on the benefits of reduced rates to
customers. In Saturday's papers First Direct announced that with base rate
reduced to 7 per cent, its overdraft rate is unchanged at 17.5 per cent.
What is the point of increasing its margin at a time when the country
desperately needs low real rates of interest? It is now charging overdraft
customers 250 per cent of base rate.
When are the banks going to realise that reductions in base rates are meant
to benefit the customer, not the banks?

FT  17 NOV 92 / Letter: Blame is irrelevant - pragmatism is the answer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN STERN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Jimmy Airlie's letter (November 11) seems to address only part of
the problems which his union's members face (I quite agree that productivity
gains should be rewarded, though not to the extent that the reward reduces
future productivity). As Mr Airlie points out, car workers have been
affected by declining new car sales; however, Mr Airlie should realise that
this is not the fault of Ford, or other manufacturers, let alone his
members, and that not only Ford's workers but also their shareholders will
have to share the pain of reduced sales, through (respectively) less jobs
and less pay, and less share value and lower dividends.
As for blaming the government for 'economic mismanagement', surely Mr Airlie
can see that laying blame is irrelevant - we all end up paying - and that
there can be no part of the population which can say 'It's not my fault' and
carry on as before. If he, and others of like mind, adopted a more pragmatic
approach the economy will stand more chance of recovering. Ian Stern,

FT  17 NOV 92 / Troubled transmission for the big picture show: British
doubts and budget pressures threaten Europe's strategy for HDTV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just under a year ago, 12 European Community telecommunications ministers
spent 15 hours laboriously mapping out a course towards high-definition,
cinema-quality television.
In a joint press conference, the principal advocates of an EC
high-definition television (HDTV) strategy hailed the directive they had
agreed as a breakthrough: the European Commission, Dutch, French and German
ministers said it was a vital weapon in the continuing fight against US and
Japanese competitors in the consumer electronics industry.
On Thursday, those same 12 ministers meet to discuss their strategy for
high-definition television (HDTV) amid fears that British intransigence and
general EC budget pressures may simply undo what they achieved last year.
Under discussion will be the European Commission's proposed five-year
'action plan' for HDTV, which supports last year's technical directive.
The plan consists of an Ecu850m (Pounds 697m) package of incentives to
encourage the introduction of wide-screen television services. The eventual
aim is a move to full high-definition television on the basis of the
so-called 'Mac' family of transmission standards. These were the norms
chosen as the best route to high-quality television pictures when the EC
first legislated on the subject in 1986.
That first directive, which expired at the end of last year, was widely
discredited as an unsuccessful attempt to impose an industrial strategy on
an unwilling market. Satellite broadcasters skirted the requirements of the
legislation and began transmitting in non-HDTV standards.
This time, Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the EC telecommunications
commissioner, has tried to persuade politicians to co-operate with the
industry. To get funding under the action plan, consortia of satellite
broadcasters and programme-makers would have to demonstrate to the EC that
they could deliver a wide-screen service. It could be the EC's last chance
to relaunch an HDTV strategy.
The main obstacle to agreement is money. Britain, which will chair
Thursday's meeting, believes the Commission has not made a sound business
case for spending Ecu850m. 'We still haven't seen much justification for
this,' said one British official last week.
The British stance reflects continuing scepticism among broadcasters that
the Commission and interested member states want to cosset European
television manufacturers - such as Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson of
France - which have invested heavily in Mac technology. The vote has to be
unanimous, so Britain could veto the idea.
Advocates of the plan, however, point out that it does not include provision
for direct funding of manufacturers. Instead, they say the proposals will
assist a wide range of economic interests from independent television
producers to retailers.
A report prepared by KPMG Management Consulting for the Commission suggests
that without the funding the wide-screen market will develop slowly.
Under those circumstances, equipment manufacturers, broadcasters and
programme-makers are unanimous that there will be little or no incentive to
continue with joint development of specifically European HDTV technology.
Philips, for example, has stated that if there is no subsidy, 'it could well
be the case that you will never see HD-Mac (the final HDTV standard) in
Europe - at least not supported by Philips'.
With funding, however, KPMG estimates that the value of the market for
wide-screen sets and video recorders will reach Ecu27.2bn in current prices
by 2002, against Ecu2.5bn if there is no subsidy.
Apart from the central issue of cash - which will have to be thrashed out at
ministerial level - discussions between national officials in Brussels over
the past few weeks have focused on several persistent concerns.
For example, the involvement of Thomson and Philips in developing rival
digital technology has fed fears that the analogue Mac transmission
standards may be superseded.
Digital signals are electrical (analogue) signals which have been converted
into binary codes. The use of digital signals makes it possible to process
and distribute a greater volume of information more rapidly than using an
analogue system.
Digital television is not excluded from the EC strategy, although the
Commission insists it is still a long way from commercial production. Along
with Mac standards, it would improve the picture quality, but it would also
enable more channels to be broadcast than now possible.
The debate about standards has been raging since an HDTV strategy was first
proposed in the early 1980s. But are EC consumers and the consumer
electronics industry really interested in a new standard, or do they simply
need a new product - in this case wide-screen television - to kick-start an
ailing market?
The latest draft of the action plan reflects this question. It gives the
plan's objective as the development of 'advanced satellite and cable
television services in Europe in the (wide-screen) format'. The Mac
standards which have been at the centre of the debate over the past decade
are hardly mentioned directly.
Even in the telecommunications directorate, stronghold of the Mac strategy,
officials now admit that wide-screen television sets and services will
initially be more important than the standard in which programmes are
broadcast or received. 'Nobody buys a standard,' says one senior Commission
telecoms official. 'What people are going to buy in the first phase is
wide-screen.'
Recent discussions between national officials in Brussels have also shifted
the emphasis of the action plan in the direction of the broadcasters. The
original proposal was to devote some 25 per cent of funding to so-called
'software' - in other words, programmes. In the current draft, between 30
and 40 per cent of funds will be devoted to programme production and
conversion.
Two questions remain. Commercially, can the industry deliver what is
required? Politically, will member states unite to support the strategy?
HDTV still faces a number of significant hurdles. First, television sets
will have to incorporate high-quality picture tubes which cost several tens
of thousands of dollars.
Second, the improvement in HDTV picture quality over conventional sets is
apparent only in bulky and heavy sets that are at least 33in wide.
For practical purposes, HDTV needs an entirely new display system - such as
flat panel displays that could be hung on the wall. Such displays are under
development but are probably at least 10 years away from the market.
The political problem is more pressing. Telecommunications ministers who aim
to support the wide-screen strategy on Thursday know that the final decision
on funding is not theirs to take.
Even if Britain can be persuaded to agree, the money must come from existing
and future EC budgets. Those budgets are increasingly under pressure as
governments feel the economic pinch at home. Judging from the tone of debate
among finance ministers, cuts may be made in exactly those areas - research
and technology - where an HDTV strategy might find a home.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Letter: Multilateral trade proposal must not be forgotten in
Gatt talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN GRIFFITHS and Others
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The struggle over the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade between the European Community and the US continues. Yet while the
detail of agricultural subsidies receives extensive coverage, an
accompanying proposal to create the new Multilateral Trade Organisation
(MTO) has been given scant attention. As representatives of leading
environment and development organisations in the UK, we urge immediate
action to rectify this.
We are extremely concerned that the proposal for an MTO which would govern
some Dollars 6,000bn of world trade - or over a quarter of the world's GNP -
has been published in an ambiguous and flimsy annex to the Gatt draft final
act, and without the benefit of full public debate. As it stands, the MTO
will simply come into being on completion of the Uruguay Round.
We recognise the need for new institutional arrangements governing world
trade. The Gatt is not equipped to deal with the increasing complexity of
trade. However, the current MTO proposal just institutionalises many of the
faults inherent in the current system of trade. A new trade institution must
be equipped to ensure that trade contributes to the protection of the
environment and human health and the eradication of poverty.
The MTO should incorporate a legal commitment to sustainable development and
mechanisms to integrate trade with environment and development policies.
Without these, the social and environmental costs of any boost in trade will
be intolerable.
We believe that such critical issues merit wide public debate. We therefore
ask for the government to give full publicity to the text of the proposed
MTO, and urge parliament to undertake a full debate on the setting up of the
MTO before the completion of the Gatt negotiations.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Letter: Moving a challenge from cities into the regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID GRAYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A number of our member companies regard City Challenge as one of the
recent successes of the government. This has involved allocating some of the
urban programme budget on a competitive basis. To succeed, local authorities
had to present comprehensive, five-year regeneration strategies for (say) a
housing estate. Only those bids which are jointly developed and owned by
local business and community organisations succeeded.
While it is too early to judge the long-term impact, City Challenge has
already encouraged better dialogue and co-operation between government,
local authorities, business and the community.
In the current, difficult economic situation, many businesses and local
authorities want to work together to improve local economic conditions.
Why not adapt the City Challenge precedent and pilot a 'Regional Challenge'?
This would involve concentrating planned expenditure, for example, of the
new Urban Regeneration Agency and Michael Heseltine's One Stop Shops for
business support, on those areas which have 'got their act together'.
'Regional Challenge' would reward those areas where business-led
organisations such as the Training and Enterprise Councils, Chambers of
Commerce and local enterprise agencies, together with local authorities,
have developed a common strategy and plan for economic regeneration.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Letter: US needs no prod in pursuit of 'worthy' farm subsidy
goals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DEAN KLECKNER

<TEXT>
Sir, It has been dismaying to read reports from Europe that blame the US
farm lobby, and my organisation, for sabotaging an agreement on oilseeds
during talks in Chicago on November 2 and 3. Those observers who misread the
US government's resolve on this dispute would do well to consider the FT's
proposed solution ('How to escape the trade war', November 10), which
outlines how the EC stumbled to the brink of a trade war. Our government is
simply upholding the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade and of the Uruguay Round, in which both the EC and US committed
themselves to substantial and progressive reductions in farm subsidies. Our
officials need no prodding from farm organisations to pursue such worthy
goals.
In Chicago, there were no hordes of American farmers marching, shooting
fire-crackers and building bonfires, as European farmers did in December
1990, when the Uruguay Round first unravelled. Our government and farmers
have shown much patience with the EC, but it is spent. It does not take any
nefarious lobbying to do what is right.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Wise words on Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S FIVE wise men make a good case for independent economic advice
with their latest economic report. They also demonstrate why governments
that are not required to commission independent advice are loath to do so.
For the economic advisers have no need to pull their punches. The west
German economy faces the prospect of a recession next year, they say, unless
the federal and Lander governments act to control public-sector wages and
subsidies. If the German government fails to act, the populations and
governments of both Germany and Europe will know whom to blame.
German monetary policy will determine the prospects for economic growth in
west Germany and western Europe next year. The wise men's forecast of zero
growth in west Germany in 1993 assumes that west German economic growth will
be half a per cent by the second half of the year. But the recovery is
dependent on lower German interest rates well before then.
Yet the wise men neither blame the Bundesbank for Germany's current problems
nor urge rate cuts now. The Bundesbank is rapped on the knuckles for the
manner in which it raised interest rates in July only to drop them again in
September. But it is the federal and Lander governments that are lashed by
the wise men's collective tongue. It is their failure to outline a credible
strategy for bringing the budget deficit under control and the lack of
leadership on wages which are responsible for keeping interest rates high.
Inflation concern
Unfortunately for the central bank, high interest rates and a strong
exchange rate have limited direct effects on Germany's current inflationary
pressures. These policies are certainly squeezing inflation in the
internationally exposed sectors of the economy: industrial output fell in
September by 2 per cent, while wholesale prices actually fell in October.
Yet domestic wage pressures and the cumulative effects of loose fiscal
policy mean that service sector inflation is still running at above 5 1/2
per cent a year.
It is the Bundesbank's job to worry first and foremost about inflation, not
growth and employment. It can only ease policy when there are clear signs
that these service sector inflationary pressures are abating. But white
collar civil servants have already made a wage claim for an increase of 5
1/2 per cent next year, while their blue collar colleagues are unlikely to
make a lower wage bid. Yet a German inflation rate below 2 per cent requires
wage settlements of no more than 4 per cent.
Nor have the federal and Lander governments come up with credible and
substantial proposals to tighten fiscal policy and so take some of the
strain off monetary policy. Indeed, the wise men point out that the
projected path for general government borrowing over the next few years is
based on wholly unrealistic assumptions about the rate of growth of nominal
gross domestic product. The federal government expects government borrowing
to halve from DM120bn last year to DM66bn in 1996. But the wise men expect
borrowing to rise to DM136bn.
Industrial recession
For now, there can be little doubt a medium-term objective of price
stability requires the Bundesbank to keep policy tight. The Bundesbank may
well wait at least until the public sector wage negotiations are under way
before deciding to cut the discount rate. Yet the longer the Bundesbank
delays before cutting interest rates, the greater the chance that the
industrial recession, of which yesterday's profit warning from Daimler-Benz
provides further evidence, will spread to the whole economy. Sadly a
recession is the only, albeit blunt, tool the Bundesbank has available to
achieve its anti-inflationary objectives.
The German government does have the power to make the Bundesbank's job
easier. A credible plan to reduce the fiscal deficit over the next four
years, detailing cuts in spending and subsidy now and tax increases when the
economy recovers, would make it much easier to ease monetary policy.
Meanwhile, Chancellor Kohl's solidarity talks must deliver a firm commitment
to wage restraint from both the public and private sector unions.
If the government fails to act, Germany will continue to suffer from
deepening stagflation. Mr Kohl's European partners desperately need him to
show leadership. Without it, Europe's economic prospects are going to look
increasingly bleak.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Leading Article: A rail link for Heathrow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT cannot afford to give Britons all the transport they want.
Last week, ministers announced their intention to enlist private sector
support for the task. Days later, an ugly row over the funding of an express
rail link between central London and Heathrow airport risks mocking the
notion that public and private sectors are capable of working together
successfully.
At Pounds 300m, the Heathrow Express project is relatively cheap for what it
does. Fast, non-stop trains would travel along a new 4-mile spur linking the
airport with British Rail's main line, then along existing tracks for the
remaining 12-mile stretch into London Paddington. Journey times of an hour
by road or London Underground would be cut to just 16 minutes.
BAA, Heathrow's private sector owner, says state-owned British Rail is
undermining the viability of the project by asking too high a price for the
use of its tracks. British Rail counters that Heathrow Express would take up
43 per cent of its main line capacity, and BAA can hardly expect to get that
for nothing. BAA retorts that it is surely worth keeping the track charge
low if that means giving the country a significant piece of privately funded
infrastructure that it would not otherwise have. Nonsense, says BR: if BAA
wants the line subsidised, let it subsidise itself. For whom, after all, is
it being built?
Tough negotiating
It would be wrong to make too much of this row. There may yet be a solution:
tough negotiating positions are an everyday feature of commercial life and
it is, perhaps, reassuring to see BR adopting one in defence of taxpayers'
funds. But in the wake of two other unsuccessful attempts by private
companies to embark on the operation of rail services - Virgin on the
passenger side and Charterail on the freight - an eventual collapse of the
Heathrow Express project would augur badly for rail privatisation.
At the heart of the issue is whether private train operators can hope to
make a commercial return if they are paying a full commercial price for the
use of the tracks. The evidence so far suggests the answer is no. In the
case of Heathrow Express, a full track charge would require fare levels so
high that few would consider them worth paying so long as other modes of
transport offered a cheaper alternative.
Little optimism
Under the railway privatisation plans proposed by the government, all
private train operators will pay track charges to the public authority which
will own the track. The government is currently awaiting the results of a
study which will say what those charges will be. But there is little sense
of optimism in the private sector that the study will pave the way for a new
golden age of rail: the charges, it is feared, will simply be too steep.
And yet, by accident or design, the government seems to be fumbling its way
towards a solution. Last week Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary,
promised to produce a green paper early in the new year which will dare to
ask whether car and lorry owners pay enough for their use of the roads;
whether the right balance has been struck between the charges imposed on
rail users and road users; and whether road users should be charged in the
same way as rail users - in other words, at the point of use.
Clearly, charging for roads at the point of use would increase rail's
competitiveness. Higher charges for road use would increase it more. The
green paper on these issues will therefore bear just as directly upon the
prospects for the privatisation of British Rail as the study being conducted
into track charges. Indeed, it is hard to see how the two can be rationally
be conducted in isolation from one another.
So far the government has made no attempt to make this connection.
Yesterday's news that the timetable for the privatisation of British Rail is
slipping gives it the opportunity to do so. Meanwhile it should resist the
temptation to press British Rail into a one-off deal which would give BAA
cheap access to the railways on terms unavailable to other would-be train
operators.

FT  17 NOV 92 / The price of darkness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The machinery of British government runs efficiently when it is working in
the dark with the blinds drawn and the lights switched off. Decisions made
by torchlight under the blanket are either executed in secret or, this being
a democracy, put to parliament for its formal approval.
This system runs smoothly when none of its parts is dented or, worse,
exposed. It goes awry when the House is not properly disciplined, or when a
corner of the blacked-out cave that is Whitehall is illuminated, or when the
cabinet - which theoretically controls it all - is brought into disrepute.
It is for these three reasons that we are enduring a period of dismayingly
weak, not to say impotent, government. The House of Commons is
unpredictable, a little light has found its way into some of the
departments, and the prime minister and his colleagues have lost their
authority.
Take the Commons first. Last Thursday's statement of economic policy was
well received by the Conservatives, or all but a handful of them. The
irreconcilable Thatcherites were for once subdued. There seemed reason to
hope that the normal course of British parliamentary business might be
resumed - that from now on ministers would propose and all Tory MPs would
vote in the Conservative lobby. This is still possible, but the greater
likelihood is that there will be further nerve-wracking rebellions, perhaps
during the prolonged passage of the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty, or
possibly when the time comes to vote on the financing of the new council
tax.
Consider next the fresh insight we now have into the way civil servants and
ministers behave. This is derived from the documents in the Matrix Churchill
case. The papers are being deployed with his customary skill by Labour's Mr
Robin Cook, who is 'releasing' them in batches aimed, as smart bombs are to
their targets, at the TV news headlines. He let off a few more last night.
This has unnerved the administration and the prime minister. It has
deflected attention from the Autumn Statement, which was supposed to be the
foundation of the government's recovery. Mr John Major's latest speech on
the economy, delivered last night, will have to share the available headline
space with Mr Cook's missives.
That, however, is not the principal reason why the Matrix Churchill case is
so damaging. Four ministers plus the attorney-general stand accused of
trying to keep information from a court, when the probability was that the
result would be the imprisonment of three innocent men. The ministers' reply
is that all they were asked to do was confirm that the relevant papers fell
within the categories of secrecy deemed by long-standing rules to warrant a
public interest immunity from disclosure. None of them was individually
aware of the full case for the prosecution or any of the case for the
defence. So it was up to the judge to override their findings, which, as we
know, he did.
Let us assume that the official inquiry, the terms of reference of which
were sensibly broadened by Mr Major yesterday, vindicates this argument. The
villain is then seen to be the system of secrecy. Public interest immunity
is not essentially a matter of law. It is an administrative convenience.
Ministers and officials determine what is and is not a secret. We can easily
imagine the detachment, the objectivity, the balanced judgment with which
they exercise their prerogative of 'sticking to the rules'. There is
therefore no need to impart malign motives to the ministers concerned. The
apparatus is itself malign.
This is of greater significance than the matter of whether or not it was
right to arm Iraq when the government was saying that its policy was not to
send lethal weaponry to either Iraq or Iran. I suspect that the average
voter (although strangely not the House of Commons) is fairly cynical about
political lies. Taking a risk that innocent parties might be jailed is more
directly offensive to public sensibilities. That risk is inherent in the
secretive method of government.
We are left with the question of Mr Major's authority, which he began to
lose on September 16 when Britain left the exchange rate mechanism and the
magic attached to his name vanished. A prime minister who had enjoyed
unprecedented popularity for nearly two years suddenly became the butt of
the nation's jokes. The pent-up frustration over the recession came to a
head. The weakness inherent in an overall majority of 21 was revealed, the
more cruelly so since the disaffected Tory faction is large enough to topple
the government by voting with the opposition.
No one expects a quick end to this long-running farce. To say that 'it all
depends on the economy' is a convenient cover for the more desperate phrase,
'it is going to take a helluva long time'. There lies the nub. The turnround
will come in the end. It always does. But it would be imprudent to expect it
before the government's reputation is irretrievably damaged.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Weakened by an enemy within: Japan's divided government is
finding it hard to respond to unfamiliar economic problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the next few months, Mr Takufumi Sato's office at the Japanese Ministry
of Finance will be the engine room of the flagging Japanese economy.
Mr Sato, director of research in the ministry's budget bureau, devised the
Y10,700bn (Pounds 54bn) emergency spending package announced in August. His
office is now drawing up next year's budget, which will be crucial to
Japan's attempts to avoid recession.
With investment falling and consumption stagnant, public spending is the
only domestic source of growth. So the responses of Japanese politicians who
control public spending will be more important in the next few months than
those of its industrialists. But with the economy poised on the edge of a
recession, the country's political leadership is consumed by a destabilising
power struggle in the wake of the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal in which
senior politicians were accused of taking bribes from a trucking company.
Mr Sato's August package of measures to support the stock market and
increase investment in public works was greeted with euphoria. The
decisiveness of the government's kick-start, equivalent to about 2.3 per
cent of gross national product, seemed to set Japan apart from the US and UK
where policymakers have floundered in their attempts to stimulate the
economy.
But recently high spirits have begun to wear off. Over the next six months,
it will be touch and go whether Japan falls into recession. The core of the
current downturn is not a sharp blow to the international competitiveness of
Japanese manufacturing, but a deep-rooted malaise within its financial
system. As a result, the responses which have guided Japan through previous
downturns - principally Japanese industry's ability to improve its export
competitiveness - will not be enough this time.
Nevertheless, most Tokyo economists, financiers and politicians believe that
the economy will recover to grow by 3.5 per cent next year. They point to a
pick-up in housing starts as evidence that the property market is
recovering. They believe industry will soon be able to reduce its
inventories of unsold cars, air conditioners and video equipment to
acceptable levels. Production should recover soon, they predict, with
investment following in its wake.
They also argue that the August spending package had an important
psychological impact: it was a sign that the government was committed to do
whatever was necessary to prevent recession, including delivering further
boosts from public spending if necessary.
The Japanese economy's capacity to recover, even after sustaining great
damage, should not be underestimated. It emerged strongly from the recession
caused by the international oil price rises of the 1970s and the surge in
the value of the yen in the mid-1980s, which threatened to undermine the
export competitiveness of much of Japanese industry.
But this time the threat is different in several crucial respects. As a
result, the confident Tokyo consensus is likely to prove ill-founded.
The cause of the current contraction is the sharp rise and, since 1989, the
steep fall of asset prices. The effect has been to undermine the financial
system and the resources available to industry. As Mr Ogata puts it: 'In the
past the threats were like a broken leg - sharp, painful but specific - and
it was clear what was needed to mend them. This downturn is more like a
virus affecting the blood system - much more complex and pervasive.'
The distinctive nature of the downturn means that different people and
institutions are in the front line. Japan's response in the past was based
on close co-operation between the powerful Ministry of International Trade
and Industry and large manufacturers. This time the government response will
be led by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan working with the
financial sector.
Japan's banks have been weakened by non-performing loans which, for the top
21 banks, rose by 54 per cent to Y12,300bn in the six months to September.
The most pessimistic forecasts circulating in the banking industry suggest
perhaps as much as Y60,000bn of the industry's Y430,000bn of outstanding
loans may turn out to be non-performing.
The central problem is that the fall in asset prices has eroded the banks'
capital base and reduced the collateral for outstanding loans. The stagnant
property market makes it difficult to establish the real price of property
and thus the true extent of the losses the banks face.
So much of the banks' resources will be devoted to clearing up this mess
that bank lending could be kept at a very low level for the next few years.
Bank lending grew by only 0.7 per cent in the six months to September,
depriving business of the funds needed for recovery.
Demand for funds is also weak, and industrial investment is unlikely to fuel
renewed growth. In the late 1980s Japanese manufacturers expanded capacity,
encouraged by the low cost of capital and strong domestic economic growth.
Japan's regions have several gleaming new car and semiconductor plants which
are lying virtually idle.
Inventories of unsold products are rising at an annual rate of 20 per cent
despite cuts in industrial production, which fell by 7.6 per cent in August
on the year before. According to Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, Miti vice-minister,
it will take another two years for these inventories to reach sustainable
levels.
This excess capacity means there will be little need for renewed investment.
A recent survey by the Industrial Bank of Japan of more than 3,500 of its
corporate customers predicted that an 11.8 per cent cut in manufacturing
investment this year will be followed by a 13 per cent drop next year.
Consumption, which represents 56 per cent of gross national product, will
not deliver the solution. Despite low unemployment, real incomes are likely
to grow negligibly over the next year as employees find their overtime,
bonus payments and wage increases cut sharply as employers trim costs.
Consumption is likely to remain flat for perhaps another year.
The weakness of the private sector means the public sector must take the
strain if the economy is to recover. On the face of it, the government is
well placed to respond.
Public finances - the central, local and social security budgets combined -
have been in surplus since 1987. According to figures from the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development, outstanding government debt, less
government assets, has fallen from 26 per cent of GNP in 1985 to 7.5 per
cent in 1991. On paper there seems plenty of scope for tax cuts or higher
spending in next year's budget. In addition the government can use the funds
of the Y138,000bn postal savings system, which is run by the Ministry of
Post and Telecommunications, for investment.
However, a fiscal remedy is not that simple. Japanese fiscal policy is
becoming an intense civil war between bureaucrats and politicians. It is not
just the fate of the August spending package that is in the balance. The
question now is whether there will be an additional boost in 1993 and
possibly 1994 and, if so, how large it should be and how it should be
financed.
As next year's budget is debated, Japan's bureaucracy, renowned for its
long-term strategy, will soon display its even greater capacity for
infighting.
Ministry of Finance officials talk as if public finances are under assault
from politicians, industrialists and bankers seeking hand-outs. They insist
the budget surplus is to fund pensions for Japan's ageing population. They
believe government borrowing rose to unsustainable levels in the 1970s,
pushing up interest payments on government debt as the country was
recovering from the oil shocks. They are determined not to let borrowing get
out of control again. The Finance Ministry insists that any income tax cut
would have to be financed by an offsetting increase in consumption taxes,
which would be politically unpopular.
The Finance Ministry's opposition to tax cuts could complicate monetary
policy. This is because the Bank of Japan has made it clear that, after six
reductions in interest rates in the past 16 months, it believes a further
relaxation in monetary policy should only follow a decision to loosen fiscal
policy.
The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications is fighting plans to use its
funds to prop up the stock market. Meanwhile, manufacturing industry,
working through Miti, is opposed to the banks being given public funds to
clear their bad debts without industry being helped too.
The intensity of bureaucratic infighting is usually overcome by
policymakers' capacity for striking pragmatic compromises. But that may not
be enough to break this log-jam. Two ingredients are lacking.
The first is the threat of a serious financial crisis at a large bank, which
might swing public opinion behind government support for the banks. The
second is the political leadership to wield authority over the fractious
bureaucrats and interest groups.
Recent decisive shifts in economic policy, such as the introduction of a 3
per cent consumption tax in 1989, were only possible because the Takeshita
faction, the dominant group in the ruling Liberal Democratic party, was
united behind the move.
The finance ministry had wanted to delay the emergency spending package
until later this autumn. But it was given a political instruction from the
top of the LDP to bring it forward. That order almost certainly came from Mr
Shin Kanemaru, the former head of the Takeshita faction, who resigned last
month over his involvement in the bribery scandal.
With Mr Kanemaru's departure, the administration lacks a member with enough
authority to forge a consensus. Indeed, agreement may now be even harder to
achieve because the power struggle to succeed Mr Kanemaru has pitted Mr
Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, against Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, his
ambitious predecessor who remains a senior figure within the ruling party.
Many western analysts believe Japan's economic success rests upon the
strength of the triangular relationship between business, bureaucrats and
politicians working in concert. The current downturn is so threatening
because it is prompting new tensions in these relationships at a time when
the political authority to maintain order has been undermined. Unless
Japan's political leadership can reassert its authority quickly, there will
be an increasing risk that the Japanese economy will fall into a prolonged
decline.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Arts: Margaret Price - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the champagne glasses from the gala re-opening night cleared away, the
Wigmore Hall is settling back to work. One of the facilities improved during
the refurbishment is the radio room and it was good to see the BBC taking
Friday's recital for future relay.
This first full recital was awarded to Margaret Price, a gesture well
deserved. The Welsh soprano is the leading British exponent of song on the
international platform. At her finest, she is a recitalist of exemplary
virtues, like an author who writes immaculate prose or an actress who
declaims Shakespeare with perfect eloquence. Music and poetry flow together
on a silver stream of tone: pure singing of the highest standard.
Unfortunately, this was not one of those best evenings. As can happen to
anybody, the singer found herself in less than her easiest voice. The
programme opened with Mendelssohn, in which the hoped-for purity of sound
refused to appear. To compensate, she gave voice and temperament freer rein,
resulting in bigger, breathy and rather hearty singing, when these
light-footed songs about elves and nightingales really ask to dance on a
pin-head.
Only when the focus of the voice came true did the nightingale in Price sing
out. Two Schumann songs, 'Der Sandmann' and 'Des Sennen Abschied", were
especially beautiful, because the voice slimmed down to its expressive core.
There were good things, too, in her Frank Bridge group, such as the distant
calling across the fields in 'Mantle of blue', but the main pleasure here
came in discovering what lovely songs these are. Why do we not hear them
more often?
In her recent recital appearances Margaret Price has tended to favour German
Lieder in her programmes, so the inclusion of the Bridge was a welcome
change, as was her rare performance of Britten's song-cycle The Poet's Echo.
This was properly impassioned singing. With Graham Johnson providing keenly
dramatised accompaniments on the Wigmore's new Bosendorfer piano, she found
both the music's cold Russian landscape and its burning inner heart.
For encores, Britten folksong arrangements (a haunting 'Ca' the yowes') and
Finzi. Then, to finish, 'Oliver Cromwell', a favourite Price encore, in
which she promptly got lost and stopped the show, to audience delirium, with
a spontaneous expletive. The chances are this was the first time a
four-letter word has ever been uttered in the Wigmore Hall: it has duly been
christened]

FT  17 NOV 92 / Arts: Edvard Munch, a soul exposed - William Packer reviews
the exhibition at the National Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I have always worked best with my paintings around me. I placed them
together and felt that some of the pictures related to each other through
the subject matter. When they were placed together, a sound went through
them right away, and they became quite different from when they were
separate - they became a symphony'. So wrote Norway's greatest painter
Edvard Munch, in explaining how he came to see his work as a unified and
cumulative expression of his ideas.
There is of itself nothing unusual in this, save only that Munch's approach
to his work was peculiarly and insistently subjective in the meanings and
interpretations he loaded onto it. For so directly visual a medium of
communication, and so essentially painterly the manner of its employment, so
literary a reading of the imagery is remarkable.
Munch came to his conclusion in a general way early in his career, in
relation to his work around 1890 that centred upon an unhappy love-affair,
and maintained it throughout his life - he died in 1944 at the age of 80.
Again, there is nothing unusual in the picture of the artist surrounded by
his work, but, with Munch, the work he seems constantly to have kept by him,
even in his old age, was that of this, his early maturity, extending through
the 1890s. The concept of 'The Frieze of Life' as a more comprehensive cycle
of paintings, taking the theme beyond Love and its defeats to Melancholy,
Anxiety and finally to Death, seems to have crystalised in his mind somewhat
later in the 1890s, and it was under that title that he showed a large
retrospective group of these paintings at the Berlin Secession of 1902.
Munch clearly attached the greatest significance to 'The Frieze' cycle.
Here, if anywhere, he felt, was concentrated the very essence of his art.
And it is this essence that has been brought to the National Gallery, in as
close as possible a reassembly of that first 'Frieze' show of 1902. A
hundred years ago almost to the day an earlier show in Berlin was closed
down in a storm of controversy and complaint, and Munch has remained, if not
quite so controversial, at least a difficult artist ever since. If this
comparatively small but spectacular exhibition, beautifully installed, does
not persuade you that he was indeed a great artist, nothing will.
The difficulty, if difficulty it is, lies in part with subject-matter that
is obviously and intensely personal, but rather more with the manner of its
realisation. Munch was a sophisticated and thoroughly professional painter,
and here we are given repeated demonstrations of his mastery. The
self-portrait of 1895 with which the show begins, the artist's disembodied
head and hand, brightly lit from below, emerging from the shadows and
wreathed in cigarette-smoke, is one of the great self-portraits of any age.
The woman standing before her house, ghost-like in the moonlight, is again
one of the great images of its period and worked with manifest sensitivity.
The woodcuts throughout are wonders of virtuoso simplicity.
And yet rather more often we confront an image stark in its presentation,
raw in its colour, the paint thin, the drawing perfunctory, the figures
grotesque. It is not that Munch cannot paint but rather, so intense is his
involvement with his image and idea, and so impatient is he to resolve them,
that he can hardly be bothered to do so. The mark, the gesture, driven by an
intuitive desperation and without further refinement, must stand as they
are, the very soul and truth of his creative expression.
'I do not paint what I see', he said, 'but what I saw.' 'Nature . . . is the
inner reflection of the soul.' 'I felt as if a scream was going through
nature . . . I painted . . . the clouds like real blood. The colours were
screaming.' 'And I painted what I remembered without adding anything -
without the details I could no longer see . . . I painted pictures from my
childhood . . .'
Here we confront a great paradox of art, for the artist has only his
experience of life and the world from which to work, yet to be so
self-centred is to risk limitation and irrelevance. The danger with Munch is
always the too-literal biographical and psychological reading of his work,
his difficulties in love, the deaths in the family, the nervous debility.
His vindication and triumph as an artist is that in pursuing so relentlessly
his personal obsessions, he yet allows them a universal relevance, that we
may come to in our own way.
The melancholy of rejection and the pain of jealous love were very much his
own, in the lonely figure sitting on the rocks at twilight, with the new
lovers together at a distance, but the pain is there for us to share, and
the truth universal. The kiss of passion is transformed into the bite of the
Vampire: the Sphinx shown in the three characters of Woman - virgin,
temptress and mother - and no wonder a dejected and puzzled man hides in the
shadows.
'The Sick Child', of 1896, was the occasion of yet more scandal when it was
first shown. Now, with its companion version, made some ten years later, it
hangs at the centre of the show, just as Munch himself acknowledged it to be
at the very heart of his work. The death in adolescence of his sister,
Sophie, had deeply affected him. Here, long afterwards, he works through his
still-active grief, as it were objectively, to produce a work of magisterial
authority and radical simplicity, the surface reworked, as though to conjure
the integral image out of the memory. 'No painting', he tells us, 'has ever
caused such disapproval in Norway. On the opening day . . . people were
crowding in front of (it) - there was laughter and shouting . . . ' Together
with the exquisite lithograph of the child's head, of which there are about
a hundred variations, it is gentle and affecting, and as beautiful a
painting as any he ever made.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Arts: The Labeque sisters - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The duo-pianist sisters Labeque, Katia and Marielle, are irrepressible
musicians, and for some time now they have shown signs of frustration with
the two-piano repertoire. There is plenty of good music for two pianos
alone, but precious little with orchestra - of the first quality, only
Mozart's concerto and the Poulenc one which it partly inspired, and then a
long drop down to minor stuff. (Bartok's superb Sonata for Two Pianos and
Percussion has never made much headway in its orchestral version.)
With the Philharmonia on Saturday, the Labeques took a brave step into more
'advanced' territory than they usually explore: Luciano Berio's Concerto,
first heard in the Festival Hall almost 20 years ago. It is only officially
a 'two-piano' concerto, for behind the soloists in the orchestra there is a
third piano - here, Michael Round - with a prominent supporting role, often
recycling the soloists' music in counterpoint with them.
That extends the role-ambiguities which are built quite deliberately into
the score. The soloists are only sometimes principal voices, collaborate
directly with each other only part of the time, often accompany other
instruments or melt into the orchestral texture - which is mostly
moire-silken, in the composer's best and most inimitable style. At the right
moments the Labeque personalities surfaced brightly, making Berio's
efflorescent figurations tingle, but they were scrupulous team-members too.
For all its oddities, this fascinating piece begins to look like keeping a
firm place in the repertoire which so badly needs it. Under the conductor
Semyon Bychkov, the score sounded expertly prepared. One had doubts only
about the two big, power-driven climaxes, where forceful accelerandi and
fierce dynamics made conventional peaks; Berio's way of piling up the
disparate voices is subtler, and does not need such underlining.
Before the concerto, Bychkov took the Philharmonia through Stravinsky's
comic little Suite no. 2 with much verve, and some dicey ensemble. Later,
Tchaikovsky's 6th Symphony got unremarkable treatment - too sectional to
support the would-be symphonic structure, too consistently loud and too
barren of thoughtful shading. Our withers were not wrung. Only Michael
Collins' clarinet solos glowed tenderly, like good deeds in a rough world.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Arts: The Duchess of Malfi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Webster (c1580-c1630) collaborated with many of his Jacobean
contemporaries, but wrote best alone, producing tense, atmospheric dramas.
The Court Theatre Company's ambitious The Duchess of Malfi at the New End
Theatre, Hampstead suits this small space. The production is thorough and
intimate, but has yet to find the energy and the atmosphere essential for
good Webster.
The Duchess (1614) rivals The White Devil as Webster's most powerful play, a
tragedy of steady desire ending in an orgy of carnage. The widowed Duchess
seduces and secretly marries her court steward, Antonio. Her brothers, a
cardinal and a duke, have forbidden her to marry; but after her first child
is born, they send a spy, Bosola, to report on her. She and her husband
flee; she is captured, mentally tortured and - with two of her children -
strangled by Bosola. He in turn is killed by the duke, but not before
stabbing Antonio and the Cardinal.
TS Eliot was being flatly obvious when he found Webster much possessed by
death. Webster throws long, deep shadows across the action. The sinuous
verse closes scenes down: 'Cover her face. Mine eyes dazzle. She died
young.' But Webster can be witty; a servant says to the Duchess' husband,
'Wherefore still when you lie with my lady do you rise so early?'
The acting, fresh and honest, needs to be less timid and more forceful.
Louise Salter as the Duchess is languidly sexy, seducing her steward with
'What think you of marriage?' in a voice like ground nutmeg. Opposite her,
Nigel Daly as Bosola catches the expeditious quality of the Machiavel,
always alert, sharp and sensitive: it is a fine piece of acting. Elsewhere,
the married pair from the subplot, Castruchio (David Focques) and Julia
(Lorna Phillips) wedded to infidelity, add lustre and life.
The candlelit set is appropriately plain, a gallery and curtains; and the
dress is quiet, modern and unfussy. Anthony Cornish's direction could be
much tighter, bringing each scene to a point; he has yet to account for each
line of Webster's admittedly difficult text.
This company is the professional wing of the Court Theatre Training Company,
and offers the chance to see new acting talent and work in progress. This
production represents its strengths and weaknesses. Despite a fresh, buoyant
approach, the play is delivered as a collection of encounters rather than a
dramatic whole. The characters leave no more behind them, as Webster says,
'than one that falls in the frost: the sun melts both form and matter.'

FT  17 NOV 92 / Arts: Angels in America - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The final image of Millennium Approaches, the first half of Tony Kushner's
epic American play, Angels in America, sears itself on the memory and piques
the imagination: an angel hovers over the sick bed of an AIDS patient, about
to speak.
In the 18 months since Millennium Approaches was first staged in San
Francisco and at London's Royal National Theatre, an enormous amount of
attention has been focussed on just what that angel is going to say. Even
before Kushner had completed the play's second half, Perestroika, Angels in
America was being hailed as the great hope of the American theatre; the
pressure on him must have been enormous, and it shows in the work.
Perestroika had its premiere in Los Angeles last week as part of the Mark
Taper Forum's seven hour long production of Angels in America. The angel
finally spoke, and her news for mankind is grim. So is the news on
Perestroika; it is over long, preachy, and - what is more disturbing - so
ponderous that it blunts the brilliance of Millennium Approaches.
Millennium Approaches strains the seams of its form; Kushner had so much to
say and such a need to say it that words, character and plot seemed barely
able to contain him. Only through a play this vast could he communicate the
depths of his alarm about the AIDS crisis and of his indignation about the
heartlessness of Reagan era America.
Scenes bump into and overlap with other scenes. Imagination and fantasy
mingle with harsh fact: a desperate, lonely housewife's valium trip
intersects with the feverish hallucinations of a gay man with AIDS.
Fictional characters, at once emblematic and individual - a closeted gay,
politically conservative Mormon; a self-indulgent gay Jewish leftie - share
the stage with historical characters so extreme they seem imagined: Roy
Cohn, the homophobic, homosexual ultra-right-wing politician who died of
AIDS; and Ethel Rosenberg, whom Cohn helped condemn to death for treason.
Millennium Approaches is almost too long, its language almost too
heightened, the politics too front-and-centre, but we excuse the fact that
it teeters on the edge of excess because Kushner's subject matter is extreme
and his immersion in it total.
If Millennium Approaches is Kushner's diagnosis of what is ailing America,
then Perestroika is his fruitless search for a solution. In it he tries to
wrap up all the plots that he set in motion and to find a unifying meaning
behind his subject matter. He seems to be shouldering all the world's
burdens, trying to find answers to problems it is going to take years to
remedy.
The two works together push Millennium's near excesses over the edge. Plots
that had emblematic significance become convoluted story telling and what
was brilliant writing starts to seem like so much showing off: snappy
repartee between gay men becomes reductive queeniness and rousing political
debate becomes heavy-handed polemicising. Flaws in the way characters are
drawn start to show - is nurse Belize really anything more than a comic
foil? and does Hannah Pitt, Joe's mother, have a purpose other than to add
another female presence and to give companionship to Prior, the man who is
dying of AIDS?
Kushner is clearly struggling for control of the play, and with his ending
concedes defeat. By having Prior address the audience directly about facing
the AIDS crisis with bravery, Kushner throws away all pretence of
dramatisation and hits the audience in the face with his message.
Directors Oskar Eustis, who has been closely involved with Angels in America
since he commissioned it for San Francisco's Eureka Theatre over five years
ago, and Tony Taccone have put together a serviceable but unextraordinary
production in which everything seems to be happening at 75 per cent of its
possible intensity. The music could be more exciting; characters on stage
are under-used when they are not the focus of the action; John Conklin's set
could be more visually interesting; and the technical tricks could be faster
and louder.
The performances are, with one exception, spot on. Ron Leibman's Roy Cohn is
scarily good - all spluttering, bellowing gusto. Others stand out include K.
Todd Freeman, whose Belize raises the withering glare to high art; Joe
Mantello, finding what is loveable and loathsome about Louis and Stephen
Spinella, who make's Prior's struggle with AIDS moving but never maudlin.
Cynthia Mace as the valium-addicted Mormon housewife, Harper, is the only
weak link; her laboured, mannered speech pattern makes her monologues seem
over-written.
The best news about the Los Angeles Angels in America is that it is not
finished yet. Kushner is reportedly not happy with the production and there
will be major changes before it transfers to the New York Shakespeare
Festival's off-Broadway Public Theatre in February.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Technology: A tighter lid on the pillbox - Drug companies
are toughening their approach to research and development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE drugs industry is adopting an increasingly ruthless attitude to research
and development spending, which grew fourfold over the past decade to reach
an estimated Dollars 25bn (Pounds 16.50bn) worldwide this year. Companies
are working to reduce the interval between drug discovery and marketing -
averaging about 10 years - and at the same time to control the soaring costs
of R&amp;D.
A striking example of the hard decisions being made was this autumn's
announcement by SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-US group, of 150 redundancies
among its UK R&amp;D staff. Equally shocking to people inside and outside the
company was its withdrawal from long-term research into gastro-intestinal
drugs - the field that led to its best-selling product, the ulcer medicine
Tagamet.
But George Poste, SB's new chairman of pharmaceutical R&amp;D, said that in
today's climate 'resources must be focused on drug discovery with the
highest potential for return'. It was not worth continuing to search for new
gastro-intestinal drugs, because there were better targets in other fields.
Poste also stated SB's intention to hold R&amp;D budgets to about 15 per cent of
pharmaceutical sales. That is similar to the R&amp;D commitment of most
international drug companies based in Europe and the US.
Roche of Switzerland stands out for its large R&amp;D spending, equivalent to 26
per cent of prescription drug sales. As the table shows, Roche more or less
matches the two giants of the industry, Glaxo of the UK and Merck of the US,
in its total spending on R&amp;D - about Dollars 1bn in 1991. But research
expenses are exceptionally high in Switzerland, so Roche does not employ
such a large R&amp;D workforce. At the other extreme, companies based in the UK,
where scientific salaries are notoriously low, can afford to employ more
people for each Dollars 1m spent on R&amp;D.
To force the pace of development, companies are setting an increasingly
tight timetable for each stage of R&amp;D, accompanied by tough criteria which
every project must satisfy if it is to move on to the next stage.
For example, ICI Pharmaceuticals in the UK now consistently achieves its
target of administering candidate drugs to human volunteers within 14 months
of their first synthesis, says Tom McKillop, technical director. This stage
used to take an average of 30 months.
At the same time ICI has become more determined to abandon drugs that do not
live up to their initial promise. The new approach is quite different to the
company's traditional attitude which 'assumed that every drug was going to
succeed,' McKillop says.
Strong management is required to kill a promising research project in the
face of lobbying from scientists who have devoted years of work to it - and
who still believe it would lead to a blockbuster drug if only the company
would let them continue a little longer.
As Max Gurtner, head of corporate communications at Roche puts it, 'managing
the development pipeline is really tough because you're dealing with people
who feel they live or die with their project.'
A comprehensive survey of R&amp;D management in the international pharmaceutical
industry, published this year by the UK-based Centre for Medicines Research,
shows that about half the companies have a target maximum time to take a new
drug from discovery to first market. This averages eight to nine years for
US and European companies and 12 years for Japanese companies.
Detailed analysis of 114 research projects by PA Consulting of the UK
suggests that the two largest pharmaceutical companies succeed in getting
their drugs to market faster than their competitors. Glaxo and Merck
averaged 7.2 years and 7.8 years respectively; the average time to market
for eight other international companies was 10.2 years.
Their speed is partly the result of clear-sighted management. 'You have to
pick the winners, set your priorities and prevent anything else distracting
you or cluttering up the system,' said Richard Sykes, Glaxo research
director.
But size may be an advantage in itself, because the giants have more drugs
in development at any one time and therefore more flexibility to concentrate
on the most promising candidates. An example is the way Glaxo switched
chemical research resources this year into developing a promising Aids drug,
3TC; 'nothing is being allowed to stand in its way,' said Grahaem Brown, who
is in charge of the development programme.
The giants can also afford to take more risks than smaller companies through
'parallel development' - moving on to the next phase of a project before
completing the current one.
Pharmaceutical companies in Japan tend to proceed more cautiously,
preferring to carry out R&amp;D step by step rather than in parallel, as Stuart
Walker, director of the Centre for Medicines Research, points out. As a
result Japanese drugs take even longer to reach the market than western
ones, but fewer of them are dropped during the development process.
Japanese drug companies do not yet spend as much on R&amp;D as their European
and US counterparts, with R&amp;D budgets typically amounting to only 10 to 12
per cent of sales. 'They are going to have to increase that spend to come
into line with the rest of the world if they want to become major global
players,' Walker says.
Once drug companies have put the right management in place, researchers can
call on an enormous range of new technologies to help them. Computers are
now used in every aspect of pharmaceutical R&amp;D, from graphics systems for
designing new molecules to information systems for keeping track of the
immense volumes of patient data amassed during clinical trials.
An example from the start of the drug discovery process is Glaxo's
Core-2000, a collection of 2,000 compounds chosen by computer and chemical
analysis to give a representative sample of the 10m molecules known to
science. The idea was to come up with the most diverse possible selection of
molecular structures.
Glaxo researchers who want to develop a medicine against a particular target
can start by screening the Core-2000 chemicals to discover which has the
biological activity they want. This should give a 'lead compound' which can
be improved, with the help of molecular graphics computers, to produce one
or more candidate drugs.
There may be even more opportunity to use information technology later in
the R&amp;D process, to accelerate the clinical trials which usually take up
more than half of the total time taken to get a drug to market. Merck's
Clin*Net project shows how a company can benefit from a computer network
linking its headquarters to clinical centres around the world.
Clin*Net - installed over the last four years - allows managers to follow
the progress of thousands of patients far more effectively than the unwieldy
mixture of mail, telephone calls and faxes used previously.
For example, the network enabled Merck to analyse early clinical results
from Proscar, its new prostate drug, as they came in and to make a quick
judgment that it was worth waiting for 12-month data before submitting a
licensing application, because these would provide more persuasive evidence
of the medicine's efficacy than the six-month data.
The progress of science, particularly in genetics and molecular biology, has
given the pharmaceutical industry more possible avenues of research than
ever before. In one sense this is a golden age of drug development.
But pharmaceutical manufacturers already devote a higher proportion of their
revenues to R&amp;D than other high-technology industries such as electronics
and aerospace. They face a likely squeeze on profits over the next few years
as governments tighten price controls. So rising R&amp;D spending - for long a
source of pride for drug companies - could soon become an embarrassment.

Speaking

<TEXT>
PRODUCERS of personal computer presentation software have a lot to answer
for. Increasing numbers of salespeople and corporate executives are using
their programs to create business presentations that insult the
sensibilities of viewers with odd combinations of garish colours, loud
backgrounds and strange mixtures of type.
You know the sort of thing. A sales representative from a company with a
name like Fuzzy-Tech Office Equipment comes by your office to give a sales
presentation on his company's latest goodies. He fires up an overhead
projector or a colour computer display and proceeds to overwhelm you with
dozens of slides that feature red text on a purple background. You quietly
cringe at the unreadable mess, serve him a cup of undrinkable coffee and
send him on his way.
Time was when such a salesperson would carry only a series of brochures and
perhaps some corporate slides created by professional graphic designers and
artists. However boring the content of the slides, you could at least be
assured that the look of them would not resemble a trip through San
Francisco's Haight Ashbury district in the 1960s.
The problem lies with PC-based business presentation software. It is now so
cheap and easy to use that anyone with a keyboard, mouse and a good printer
can create their own business presentations.
In theory, this is good news. It gives marketing people better control over
their presentations - and ensures that they much more accurately reflect the
sales message they are trying to get across. Corporate training and
educational presentations also benefit from this technology - users can
create timely presentations tailored to their target audiences.
When putting this theory into practice, however, far too many corporations
eliminate an important step - they fail to offer users any kind of training
and guidance in the graphic arts. Managers assume that if they give their
marketing staff the right software, they will automatically be able to
produce professional quality presentations.
This is simplistic and wrong-headed.
Sales and marketing executives are no more qualified to be designers and
typographers than house painters are to be architects. There are specific
skills required to produce professional-looking presentations and they
cannot be acquired overnight.
The software companies who produce these presentation applications - such as
Aldus Corporation, Microsoft and Lotus Development - must take some of the
blame for propagating the notion that anyone can be a designer.
They have, however, generally recognised this problem by including dozens of
presentation 'templates' that come prepackaged with the software. These
templates use professionally-matched colours, backgrounds, typefaces and
graphics - and look respectable. But the enterprising young salesperson from
Fuzzy-Tech isn't going to be caught using the same template as his
competitor - and therefore goes off to create something for himself.
One solution is to limit the choices available to individuals who create
their own presentation graphics to a number of corporate-approved colours,
typefaces, backgrounds and 'transition effects'. Most popular presentation
applications already allow corporate software or MIS managers to set up such
a system by 'locking out' certain functions and customising the presentation
application.
It is up to corporate purchasers of presentation software to make use of
these features. For those who do, may I suggest - as a frequent viewer -
that everyone remove the overworked magenta from the colour palette and do
away with those clever 'exploding' transition effects, which are no longer
novel. I would also like to see a limit on the number of slides per minute.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Business and the Law: Greek state aid law condemned by Court
 -European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the third case to raise the compatibility of Greece's general state aid
law with the second European Community company law directive, the European
Court has again condemned the Greek law.
Law 1386/1983 gives the Greek government power to grant aid to Greek
industry. In permitting a capital increase of a company by decision of the
minister for the economy, without holding a general meeting, it does not
satisfy the second directive's requirements for safeguards for minority
share-holders.
The law was also the subject of European Commission Decision 88/167/EEC.
Brussels declared that it had no objections to the implementation of the law
provided certain conditions were satisfied. One condition was that Greece
should comply with the second company law directive by December 31 1987 at
the latest.
In response to a third question referred in the present case, the ECJ ruled
that the condition imposed did not authorise Greece by way of derogation to
maintain in force provisions infringing the second company law directive
until the end of 1987.
The Court confirmed that the treaty rules on state aid do not permit the
Commission to authorise member states to derogate from treaty rules other
than those on state aid.
Case C-134 and C-135/91, Kerafina and others v Greece, ECJ 6CH, November 12
1992.
Motor insurance liability clarified
The ECJ has clarified the rules in the European Community motor insurance
directives determining the country in which a vehicle is normally kept.
The Court held that the rule concerning the territory of the member state of
which a vehicle bears a registration plate referred to a registration plate
properly issued by a member state.
The Court said that was the only interpretation consistent with the
objectives of the motor insurance directives to remove border checks on
motor cars by limiting such checks to the registration plate.
If a registration plate appears to be properly issued there should be no
further checks. Proof of registration may only be required when the plate is
visibly false.
Case C-73/89, Fournier v van Werven, ECJ 6CH, November 12 1992.
No judgment enforcement without proper service or initiating
proceedings
On a reference from the German Bundesgerichtshof, the ECJ has interpreted
the Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments as
meaning that an English High Court default judgment may not be recognised
for enforcement purposes in Germany, when the writ initiating the
proceedings had not been properly served on the defendant in accordance with
German law on civil procedure.
This interpretation applied regardless of whether or not the defendant had
knowledge of the judgment and had not used the procedures available to him
in his home state.
Case C-123/91, Minalmet GmbH v Brandeis Limited, ECJ 4CH, November 12 1992.
Convention on origin designations between France and Spain upheld
The ECJ interpreted the Rome Treaty's rules on free movement of goods as
permitting geographic descriptions of confectionery and designations of
origin to be protected by a 1973 bilateral convention between France and
Spain, provided the protected descriptions and designations did not have a
generic character in the country of origin at the time the convention came
into force, or since.
Case C-3/91, Exportatur SA v LOR SA and Confisserie du Tech, ECJ FC,
November 10 1992.
Other cases
In the context of a dispute over German meat health inspection charges, the
ECJ held that a Council Decision had direct effect and could be relied on in
national proceedings against national authorities responsible for its
implementation, once the deadline for implementation had expired.
Case C-156/91, Hans Fleich v Landrat des Kreises Schleswig-Flensburg, ECJ
2CH, November 10 1992.
BRICK COURT CHAMBERS, BRUSSELS
Judge Edward
Judge David Edward, the British judge at the European Court, has asked us to
make clear that certain statements about cases currently before the Court
made in last week's column were comment and not made by him in a speech to
the UK Association for European Law in London.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Business and the Law: Defending London as a financial centre
 -Robert Peston and Robert Rice examine the proposed creation of a panel on
questions of legal uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Financial Law Panel sounds the sort of solution only a lawyer would
dream up. The Bank of England's Legal Risk Review Committee has recommended
the panel be established to help solve problems of legal uncertainty which
are said to be threatening London's standing as an international financial
centre.
'It is easy for lawyers to persuade themselves they need another legal
body,' concedes Lord Alexander, the former Bar chairman and chairman of
NatWest who headed the committee.
But he adds: 'I was persuaded of the need for it because of the demand from
market practitioners.'
The Bank of England, which will co-sponsor the panel with the Corporation of
London, confirms there has been an encouraging response from the City. More
than 100 financial firms have indicated they would be prepared to stump up
Pounds 4,000 each towards the panel's estimated annual costs of Pounds
500,000.
The panel will have a board of between 10 and 12 individuals, chaired by
Lord Donaldson, the former Master of the Rolls, and a full-time chief
executive. The other board members will consist mainly of market
practitioners and a few lawyers. There will also be a secretariat of four
lawyers seconded from City law firms. It is expected to start work in the
spring.
Lord Alexander drew an analogy between Lord Donaldson's appointment and the
appointment of Lord Shawcross to head the Takeover Panel when it was set up
in 1968.
The Takeover Panel became a success largely because of the zeal and
commitment of Lord Shawcross, he said. 'I would expect Lord Donaldson to
play a similar role.'
The panel's initial role will be to provide an authoritative view on legal
uncertainties. Its judgments will not have the force of law, but Lord
Alexander is hopeful that they will carry weight if the issues in question
ever come to court.
If, for example, a financial firm follows the panel's advice but is
subsequently sued, Lord Alexander hopes that the courts will at least decide
that the firm was acting in good faith and therefore should not be accused
of fraud.
'Lenny (Lord Justice) Hoffmann (a member of the review committee) said he
thought the courts would give weight to the panel's decisions,' Lord
Alexander said.
Lord Alexander hopes eventually the panel will evolve into a body more like
the Takeover Panel, giving informal advice to firms about the legality of
financial transactions they may be contemplating.
NatWest's merchant banking subsidiary, County NatWest, might, for example,
have acted differently when advising Blue Arrow on its 1987 rights issue if
it had had access to impartial external advice.
Certainly Lord Donaldson envisages the panel developing along those lines.
'I've insisted on professional indemnity cover against the risk of being
sued for negligent advice,' he says.
But he is less convinced that the courts will accept the panel's advice as
City custom and practice. The courts will require greater certainty than
that, he says, before they will accept something as binding practice.
The incident which led to the creation of the review committee was the 1990
House of Lords swaps ruling. The Law Lords ruled that swaps contracts
between banks and local authorities were invalid because local authorities
had never been empowered by government to carry out swaps. The contracts
were ultra vires - outside their powers. Banks, many of them foreign, were
outraged when they were unable to enforce the contracts.
Lord Alexander believes that had the Financial Law Panel been in existence
five years ago, the extent of the ensuing financial turmoil could have been
reduced.
The panel might have been able to point out the loophole in the law in time
for the government to act. Even if it had refused to give local authorities
the power to enter into swaps contracts, the panel might have advised banks
to include clauses in their swaps contracts setting out the basis for making
restitution in the event of the deals being ruled unenforceable.
'I think those restitution clauses might have stood up,' he says.
The swaps case illustrates the two main reasons why a panel may be useful.
First, the City has been adept in financial innovation, creating products
which the existing legal framework may not recognise; and second, the law
itself can be ambiguous.
But is there really a wider legal uncertainty problem? Mr Philip Wood,
senior banking partner at City solicitors Allen &amp; Overy, believes the City
has 'vastly over-emphasised the problem'.
He points out that in the area of judge-made law, for example, apart from
the swaps case the review committee was only able to identify one other
recent decision which was causing problems.
That was the 1986 charge card services case where the High Court ruled it
was conceptually impossible for a creditor to charge back his debt to the
debtor. In spite of considerable debate over whether the decision was
correct, it still stands, putting many apparently simple financing
arrangements, such as the pledge of a certificate of deposit in favour of
the issuing bank, at risk.
Nevertheless the panel is 'not just window dressing', he says. The City is
suffering from 'terrific regulation fatigue' and the panel has an important
role to play in explaining to parliament how the markets work and why the
law needs changing. It can also act as a 'loudhailer' for the City, adding
weight to its proposals, he adds.
Lord Donaldson was also unsure initially whether a legal uncertainty problem
really existed. But a closer examination of the committee's report revealed
more than 100 issues raised by City practitioners.
One of the panel's first tasks, he says, will be to sort the problems into
categories: those which can safely be ignored either because they are
'silly' or 'too narrow in ambit'; those requiring changes in legislation;
those where test cases may have to be developed, such as the charge card
case; and, those where a definitive answer may be impossible but the panel
may be able to advise practitioners that if they follow one route it will
involve less risk than another.
He is now convinced of the need for the panel and that it can work. 'I'm
sure there is a job to be done. I'm just not sure quite what it is yet, or
how to do it.'

FT  17 NOV 92 / Business and the Law: Solvency mix-up - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London solicitors Brecher &amp; Co are calling for clarification of a Companies
Act requirement for directors of a holding company to make statutory
declarations as to the company's solvency where one of its subsidiaries is
proposing to give financial assistance for the acquisition of the holding
company's shares.
Brecher says ambiguity in the legislation has resulted in a misdirection on
one of the declaration forms. The form directs holding companies to give
declarations about the solvency of the subsidiary instead of the holding
company.
This could leave directors and auditors open to claims for breach of
statutory duty, fines and even criminal sanctions.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Business and the Law: Fraud detection guidelines revive
fears - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
US guidelines for rewarding companies that report internal white-collar
crime are causing renewed concern among lawyers.
Lawyers say that, as feared, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for
Organisations are being used as a mechanism for controlling and shaping
corporate conduct rather than as a mere sentencing device.
Under the guidelines, one year old this month, fines are reduced if a
company detects a crime before any government organisation does, brings it
to the authorities' attention and accepts responsibility.
This summer the guidelines were used in settling government claims of fraud
against Salomon Inc.
Salomon agreed to pay Dollars 290m, and avoided criminal charges, by
replacing its top management, sacking the principal culprits, co-operating
fully with the government investigation and taking steps to ensure there
would be no recurrence.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Setting the standard for
small companies - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stung by criticisms that its quality assurance standard BS5750 is too
complex for very small businesses to adopt, the British Standards
Institution (BSI) is to set up a working group to listen to the complaints
of small firms.
BSI is drawing up the terms of reference for the group and plans to involve
between 10 and 15 organisations representing small businesses.
It will look at the impact of BS5750 on smaller firms and try to make the
standard more accessible. Lancaster University, with the backing of the
Federation of Small Businesses, has offered to draw up a simplified users'
manual.
At the same time BSI has begun a longer-term study of how it might better
integrate the proliferating number of quality standards which it has
launched.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Contractors protest over bridge bids: Heseltine is urged to
intervene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH steelwork contractors have asked Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary, to intervene after two Italian companies submitted the
lowest bids for bridge contracts worth Pounds 30m.
The steel contractors, which claim unfair competition, say the contracts
include steelwork for the Pounds 300m privately financed second Severn
bridge.
The British Constructional Steelwork Association said Cimolai, an Italian
contractor which has worked in Britain since the early 1980s, had submitted
the lowest tender for the Severn bridge.
It also said that Beghini Steel UK, a subsidiary of a Verona-based company,
had submitted the lowest bids for the steelwork for the Thelwell viaduct
across the M6 in Cheshire and for bridges across the extension of the M3
near Winchester.
The association says the three contracts could provide 3,000 jobs for UK
contractors.
Mr Allan Collins, the association's president, says in a letter to Mr
Heseltine: 'This is a very serious undermining of the policy to stimulate UK
construction activity.'
The letter asks the secretary of state to call an immediate meeting with
main contractors involved in the bridge building programme to discuss the
problem of cut-price tenders from overseas suppliers.
It adds: 'This is not a case of just bleating because we are about to lose.
'We, as an industry, are being battered to death, yet we are without doubt
the most efficient producer of fabricated steelwork in Europe.
'This begs the question of how the Italians are getting in with prices up to
20 per cent below our own suppliers'.'
Dr Derek Tordoff, the association's director, said yesterday: 'We believe
that many Italian fabricators receive hidden subsidies and that they have
been targeting Britain and other international markets in order to make up
for a decline in Italian construction activity.'
According to Dr Tordoff more than 100 UK steel contractors have ceased
trading or gone into receivership since 1989. Numbers employed have fallen
by 40,000 to 60,000.
Four of the largest publicly quoted companies in the sector - Graham Wood,
Ward Group, Conder and Henry Barratt - have seen all or part of their
businesses go into receivership since the spring.
Dr Tordoff warned that further job losses were inevitable, with the industry
still suffering from over-capacity in spite of the recent closures.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Demand for offices in London increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AVAILABILITY of office space in central London has fallen significantly
for the first time in five years, Debenham Tewson Research, chartered
surveyors, said yesterday.
It attributed the change largely to increased demand for new, centrally
located offices by the financial sector. Supply and demand for office space
are closer to balance than at any time since autumn 1987, when the impact of
the construction boom had still to be felt.
The amount of office space in central London that can be occupied
immediately or within six months fell from 34.3m sq ft to 33.5m sq ft in the
third quarter. That was because of a 27 per cent rise in the take-up of
space from 2.6m sq ft to 3.3m sq ft, and a 6 per cent fall in the space
coming on to the market from 4.5m sq ft to 4.2m sq ft.
Availability in central locations fell 4 per cent to 24.3m sq ft while
take-up rose nearly 40 per cent. On the fringes of London availability rose
marginally, take-up fell by more than a fifth and the space coming on the
market almost doubled.
Although more than half the take-up was of newly built space, almost
four-fifths of the space coming on the market was second-hand.

SIR JAMES McKINNON, the gas industry regulator, said yesterday he had told
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission he rejected British Gas's demands on
the rate of return it should earn from its pipeline and storage network.
He also questioned the extent of the company's future investment in the
network.
Sir James gave a clear indication at a conference in London that he was
taking a tough line in the MMC's wide-ranging investigation into the UK gas
market.
He said two 'highly experienced' companies had attempted to enter the
pipeline market but their efforts had 'come to nought in the face of the
overwhelming market power of British Gas'.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Brick industry expects 1,000 jobs to be lost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION in construction is expected to cost more than 1,000 jobs this
year in the brick industry alone.
The Brick Development Association estimates that the industry's workforce
will have fallen by 37 per cent to 8,800 by the end of the year from a peak
of 14,000 in December 1988.
Manufacturers forecast further job losses and plant closures, with capacity
continuing to outstrip demand in spite of previous closures and
redundancies.
The association expects sales of bricks to fall by a further 3.5 per cent
this year to 3bn. That compares with an annual manufacturing capacity likely
to remain at 3.7bn, which is a 24 per cent reduction from the peak of 4.85bn
at the end of 1988.
Stocks of bricks have soared as sales have slumped in the worst recession to
hit housebuilding and commercial property development for more than half a
century. The association says manufacturers are likely to be left with a
stockpile of 1.52bn unsold bricks, equivalent to 30 weeks' supply, by the
end of the year. About 60 per cent of brick sales are for housebuilding.
Stocks held by manufacturers are estimated to be enough to build 150,000
homes. The industry is hoping that interest rate cuts and measures to reduce
the stock of empty homes, announced in last week's Autumn Statement, will
lead to a recovery in sales and prices later next year.
Closures and redundancies by brick manufacturers since early summer have
been announced by:
Ibstock Johnsen, which intends to reduce its output from 280m bricks this
year to 230m by the end of the 1994. This is likely to involve the closure
of several smaller plants.
Tarmac, which is closing four plants at Motherwell, Chesterfield,
Kibblesworth in Tyne and Wear, and Avonmouth, near Bristol, reducing its
capacity from 270m to 170m a year.
Redland, which has closed six plants with a combined annual capacity of 170m
following its merger with Steetley, a rival UK building materials company.

FT  17 NOV 92 / High earners shun holidays in Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITONS WITH higher incomes are cutting back on holidays in the UK so that
they can continue going abroad, the English Tourist Board said yesterday.
Mr Mike Richardson, marketing director of the tourist board, said yesterday
that weekend breaks in the UK were down between 5 per cent and 10 per cent
in the first eight months of this year.
Many higher earners appeared to have rejected the idea of taking a cheaper
overseas trip so that they could continue to take holidays in the UK, he
said.
'The higher-income groups tend to take more than one holiday a year and the
greater proportion take their main holiday overseas. English holidays
account for the greater proportion of second holidays. Now that the
recession has hit, people are holding on to their overseas holiday,' he
said.
The fall in the pound would help to make holidays in the UK cheaper and
trips abroad more expensive, he added. But the board would find it difficult
to market UK holidays following the government's decision, announced last
week, to cut its grant from Pounds 15.6m this year to Pounds 9.1m in 1995.
Mr Richardson said: 'It's all very well having a competitively priced
product, but it doesn't help if you can't tell people about it. Devaluation
has created a better climate for promotion of UK holidays but it is not a
panacea.'
Other countries would be able to spend more on their marketing effort in the
UK as a result of devaluation, he explained.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Bar backs late sittings for small-claims courts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BAR called on the government yesterday to set up a limited pilot scheme
to extend the opening hours of magistrates' courts and small-claims courts
from 5.30pm until 8.30pm.
A working party set up last year to look at the need for extended court
hours said in its report that people running small businesses might not be
able to afford to take time off work to pursue claims.
The frequency of night sittings would depend on demand but at the outset
would be three times a week every second week.
Ms Anesta Weekes, head of working party, said the court system had to be run
more with the interests of the consumer in mind.
Extended hours would also encourage defendants involved in minor cases to
attend court rather than plead guilty by post, she said.
Defendants arrested late in the day could be bailed by magistrates instead
of being remanded in custody overnight. In magistrates' courts evening
sessions would be limited to certain types of case, including bail
applications; minor motoring offences; non-payment of fines; and guilty
pleas where there was no risk of a custodial penalty.
Using court buildings for longer periods would reduce delays and cut the
backlog of cases, Ms Weekes said.
The working party studied the experience of courts in New York, which have
been opening in the evenings and throughout the night for more than 20
years, and an experiment of evening sessions at Uxbridge magistrates' court,
west London, last year.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont threatens tax rise if PSBR
overshoots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, yesterday gave a clear indication that the
government will raise taxes or cut spending if the public sector borrowing
requirement does not start to decline as the economy recovers.
Answering questions on the government's Autumn Statement, he told the
Commons Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee that the government
wanted to move towards a balanced budget over the economic cycle.
Although it was appropriate to allow the PSBR to rise in a recession, Mr
Lamont admitted there were difficulties with public finances the longer the
recession lasted. 'If as the economy recovers it emerges that we have an
underlying deficit, that is something that we will have to address.'
Last week's Autumn Statement revised upwards the expected PSBR for 1992-93
to Pounds 37bn from Pounds 28bn envisaged at the time of the March budget,
and indicated that the borrowing requirement in 1993-94 could reach Pounds
44bn.
Mr Lamont said yesterday that some aspects of the borrowing requirement,
such as rising social security costs, would be self-correcting. But he made
clear that the government could take action over spending or taxation to
meet its objective of moving towards balance over the cycle.
Mr Lamont denied that the government had changed the fundamental objective
of its economic policy which was to achieve sustained non-inflationary
growth.
The measures introduced last week to aid industry were not a U-turn or a
kick-start, he said. The government had not embarked on a programme of
fiscal stimulus because it would be risky to add to borrowing through a
large public spending project or lowering taxes.
The chancellor said the 3 percentage point cut in interest rates and
sterling's substantial devaluation amounted to an 'enormous relaxation' of
monetary policy since Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism. He
said he would not hesitate, however, to raise interest rates if sterling
fell too far and endangered the inflation objective.
Mr Lamont ruled out any return for sterling to the ERM until the UK is
firmly out of recession and there is greater convergence between German and
British monetary policies. He denied the UK would be forced to join in the
second phase of European Monetary union if it ratified Maastricht.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNCIL TENANTS should be allocated some of the 20,000 unsold owner-occupied
properties which are to be acquired by the Housing Corporation in the period
to the end of March, Sir George Young, housing minister, suggested in the
Commons last night.
He said council tenants dissatisified with their existing homes and unable
to transfer to other council accommodation should have the chance to move
into premises secured from the private sector.
Sir George called on local authorities and housing associations to
co-operate in using the additions being made to the public housing stock to
promote 'mobility' for existing council tenants.
He acknowledged that council tenants who chose to move would lose the right
to buy their homes, but envisaged that many would be prepared to do so in
order to live in a more attractive property.
Sir George stressed that the council properties released in the process
could be used to house homeless families.
He said Pounds 630m would be spent in England in the next four months, and
estimated that private-sector money would result in Pounds 1bn being
available to aid the recovery of the housing market.
Mr John Battle, a Labour housing spokesman, attacked the government's
refusal to allow local authorities to use the capital receipts already
accumulated from council house sales to provide new homes and renovate and
repair existing properties.
Mr Simon Hughes (Lib Dem Southwark and Bermondsey) condemned the
government's failure to permit councils to use accrued receipts of Pounds
5.5bn.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Cook adds to Major's 'charge-list'
 -'Inconceivable' that PM did not know of exports; Inquiry terms widen
search for who knew what
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBIN COOK, shadow trade and industry secretary, sought yesterday to keep
up maximum pressure on Mr John Major over the arms-to-Iraq affair with a
fresh compilation of documents that he said showed the prime minister had
repeatedly misled MPs.
Continuing Labour's tactic of seeking the best impact by selectively
releasing documents, Mr Cook said his 'charge-sheet' proved 'beyond
reasonable doubt' that Mr Major must have known he was misleading MPs.
He admitted he did not have proof that Mr Major had read papers sent to him
when he was foreign secretary, chancellor or prime minister. But Mr Cook
said it was 'inconceivable' the prime minister would not have had his
attention drawn by civil servants to relevant information.
One cabinet minister admitted that the handling of Labour's campaign to
harry the government was 'impeccable'.
Mr George Foulkes, a Labour defence spokesman, plans to publish tomorrow a
list of companies which, he says, breached export guidelines  - sometimes
with the tacit approval of the government.
Asked how many more documents he could release, Mr Cook replied: 'I have 464
documents. As to when we release them is a different matter.'
Mr Cook's case against the prime minister is based on assurances from Mr
Major in the Commons and in a letter to Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat
leader, that the arms embargo against Iraq had been kept. Mr Cook said that
'ministers first relaxed and then ignored those guidelines'.
Mr Cook cited a telex sent to the British embassy in Japan by Sir Geoffrey
Howe, then foreign secretary, in June 1989 - a month before Mr Major became
foreign secretary. It asked for information on why the Japanese had
prevented the export of machine tools to Iraq and whether they were aware
the export of similar items was being considered by the Department of Trade
and Industry.
Mr Cook said: 'We therefore know that the office of his (Mr Major's)
predecessor knew about the sensitive nature of this export order and were
concerned enough to consult the government of Japan. Did the private office
of the foreign secretary really forget all knowledge of the issue when John
Major took over a month later?'
A second document was a briefing note for Mr Major, when foreign secretary,
describing media interest in Matrix Churchill before a meeting he had with
Mr Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi foreign minister.
A further document is a letter sent in June 1990 - when Mr Major was
chancellor - to the private secretary to the chairman of Customs and Excise
from the private secretary to Mr Nicholas (now Lord) Ridley. It referred to
a forthcoming visit to Matrix Churchill and said that copies were being sent
to the chancellor.
Two other documents dating from 1990 were a letter from the DTI to Sir
Charles Powell, former private secretary to Mrs Margaret (now Lady)
Thatcher, the former prime minister. It offered a draft reply to pressure
for approval of exports of machine tools to Iraq. The second was a DTI
memorandum recommending that future export licences for Iraq should be
cleared through the Cabinet Office 'who are acting as the co-ordinator in
the Iraqi gun context'.
Mr Cook said: 'Did Downing Street forget all it had learnt about the exports
to Iraq when he (Mr Major) came in the door?. . . The authority of
government in Britain cannot be restored so long as its prime minister
wriggles rather than face the facts.'

FT  17 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tougher charters pledged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRENGTHENING existing charters for public services rather than publishing a
stream of new ones will soon become the theme of the Citizen's Charter
programme, Mr William Waldegrave, minister for public service, said last
night.
Mr Waldegrave emphasised in a speech in London that the tight public
spending settlement in the Autumn Statement made it even more important to
improve efficiency through initiatives such as the planned increase in
market-testing in central government services.
The speech was the first in a series in which over the next few weeks Mr
Waldegrave will seek to highlight the possibility of improvements in the
delivery of public services in spite of the tough controls on spending in
last week's Autumn Statement.
His speeches will be focussed around publication next week of a white paper
which will include a report on the first year of operation of the Citizen's
Charter. Signalling a move to the second stage of the charter programme, Mr
Waldegrave said that the emphasis would shift to reviewing the 26 charters
already prepared, especially once charters had been published for the courts
and for further and higher education.
'Setting, reviewing and strengthening charters would be of little use if we
did not have the means to ensure that those standards were met,' he said.

FT  17 NOV 92 / People: Nuclear link for McAlpine family company
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Christopher Harding (right), chairman of BET, has joined the board of
Newarthill, which controls the privately-owned construction business of Sir
Robert McAlpine and Sons, re-establishing a connection which goes back to
the days when he was chairman of British Nuclear Fuels.
Sir Christopher, 53, says he had known the late Lord McAlpine of Moffat, a
grandson of the founder and a leading figure in Britain's post-war nuclear
power industry, for many years. He says his professional colleagues at BNFL
had always had the highest regard for the quality of the company's nuclear
power construction work.
Newarthill, named after the Scottish birthplace of founder Sir Robert
McAlpine, is the bigger, but more private, of the two construction companies
connected with the McAlpine family. The family ownership of the
Cheshire-based Alfred McAlpine is now down to 20 per cent and with last
year's retirement of Bobby McAlpine from its chairmanship, the management of
Alfred McAlpine has been largely transferred into the hands of outside
professionals.
However, Newarthill, which took itself private in 1989, is still controlled
by the Southern end of the McAlpine family whose best-known member is Lord
McAlpine of West Green, one of Lady Thatcher's closest advisers and an
important Tory party fund-raiser. Sir John Hedley Greenborough, 70, a former
senior Shell executive, has been chairman since 1980, but with the death of
Sir Robert Fairbairn, a former chairman of Clydesdale Bank, and Sir Norman
Elliott, a former chairman of the Electricity Council, the rest of the board
is made up of increasingly elderly family members.
In addition to Sir Chris-topher, George Grover, 65, a former senior partner
of Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, has also joined the board. Newarthill, which
has lost considerably more money than its quoted sister company since it
went private, says there is no special significance in their appointment. It
simply restores the position to having three non-family members on the
board.
However, one of the reasons why Sir Christopher may have been picked is that
he is well versed in the ways of family companies, having been a director of
Lord Hanson's family-owned transport business since 1974.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Supergun sparks more questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, JIMMY BURNS and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE widening of the terms of reference for the arms-to-Iraq inquiry to
include the supergun project and other dual-use machinery sales provokes the
question of who knew what and when.
The supergun or Project Babylon involved an attempt by Saddam Hussein in the
late 1980s to produce several giant guns, theoretically capable of
delivering short-range nuclear or chemical warheads.
In the summer of 1988 two British companies - Sheffield Forgemasters and
Walter Somers - applied for export licences to supply steel tubes supposedly
for an Iraqi petrochemical project.
Without consulting the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and
Industry decided that Sheffield Forgemasters did not require an export
licence. The Walter Somers contract was referred by the DTI to a specialist
in the MoD who subsequently reported that he could establish no definite
military purpose for the tubes.
In the autumn of 1989, the MoD and UK intelligence services received
separate tip-offs about the Iraqi project from the then directors of Astra
Holdings, the British defence group. Astra had recently acquired PRB, a
Belgium munitions company, and discovered it was supplying propellants to
Iraq for a very large gun.
A report was then circulated within the DTI and the MoD, but it was not
until April 1990 that British intelligence tipped off Customs officials who
in turn ordered the seizure at Teesport of tubes made by Sheffield
Forgemasters.
The only two legal cases in connection with the supergun - against Dr
Christopher Cowley, the project manager, and Mr Peter Mitchell, managing
director Walter Somers - were dropped on the grounds of insufficient
evidence.
Involvement of DTI officials provides a central thread to the cases. In June
1988 Dr Rex Bayliss, managing director of Walter Somers, contacted Sir Hal
Miller, then Conservative MP for Bromsgrove, and told him of his concerns
about a prospective order from Space Research Corporation, a company owned
by Dr Gerald Bull, the Canadian ballistics scientist.
Dr Bayliss had noticed that the specification from a steel tubes order,
later discovered to be part of the supergun project, was constantly
increasing, approaching the pressures associated with gun steels.
DTI evidence to the Commons trade and industry committee revealed that Sir
Hal contacted the DTI's export licensing unit. The same day Mr Tony
Steadman, director of the export licencing unit, contacted Dr Bayliss and
the MoD.
A Mr Bill Weir, described to the committee only as a metallurgist, handled
the MoD enquiries, and though he decided the tubes were some kind of
pressure vessels he could not form an opinion about what their use might be.
A key area of the Scott enquiry covering the supergun case will be the depth
of liaison between the DTI and the MoD given the growing knowledge about
Iraqi procurement.
Mr Steadman's own prominent role in the interpretation of export policy on
the Matrix Churchill case is highlighted in government documents released to
the defence during the trial.
An important question in any examination of the extent of government
knowledge about secret projects in Iraq is when exactly the intelligence
services discovered about the Iraqi supergun programme.
The intelligence services were certainly aware of a project Babylon in mid
1989 when Mr Paul Henderson, the former managing director of Matrix
Churchill, recalls being asked by an intelligence officer if he knew about
the project.

<TEXT>
LONDON UNIVERSITY is to commission an urgent independent financial study
into the costs of proposals to rationalise the capital's hospitals.
The university, responsible for the training of many of Britain's medical
students, says it takes a positive view of aspects of Sir Bernard
Tomlinson's report on London healthcare but is 'deeply concerned' at the
lack of adequate financial analysis.
The university's joint planning committee says its report will be completed
before ministers reach conclusions on Tomlinson.
The study will include an assessment of the extent to which the exercise
could be financed by proceeds from the sale of hospital sites.

<TEXT>
THE BRITISH and Irish governments have agreed to try to restart political
talks in Northern Ireland in the new year.
The talks, involving both governments and the four main political parties in
the province, broke up last week without agreement and no clear commitment
to renew dialogue.
The discussions had sought an agreement on a new devolved administration in
Northern Ireland, and a replacement of the 1985 agreement.
Both governments agreed in Dublin yesterday 'that the objectives of the
talks process are both valid and achievable'.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr David Andrews,
the Irish foreign minister, agreed that the most fruitful stage of the talks
had occurred in the past four weeks, when the round-table plenary and
committee stages were abandoned in favour of bilateral meet-ings.
Sir Patrick said: 'People got on better on a party-to-party and a one-to-one
basis.'
Mr Andrews admitted that there had been no bilateral meeting between the
Irish government and the Democratic Unionist party led by the Rev Ian
Paisley. 'We would like to meet the DUP in bilateral talks,' he said. The
value of any future talks would be greatly diminished without such a
meeting.'
He criticised the a la carte approach of the DUP to the past series of
meetings, but praised the 'moderate and very conciliatory' approach of Mr
James Molyneaux, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party.
Yesterday's meeting dealt at length with the upsurge in paramilitary
violence in the North. Mr Padraig Flynn, the Irish justice minister, said
there now existed a threat of the violence extending into the Irish
Republic.
The meeting, on the seventh anniversary of the signing of the 1985
Hillsborough agreement, was the first bilateral discussion under the
agreement since April, when regular meetings were adjourned to allow the
inter-party talks to take place. The unionist parties oppose the 1985
agreement because of the role it gives to the Republic in Northern Ireland's
affairs, and refuse to participate in talks while the intergovernmental
meetings continue.
The governments have agreed to meet 'as soon as is practicable' before
Christmas with a further intergovernmental conference in the new year. That
would establish a new pause in the process so that the multilateral talks
could begin again.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Warning on bogus safety advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOGUS health and safety consultants are exploiting ignorance among employers
about European Community legislation due to be implemented on January 1, the
Health and Safety Executive said yesterday, David Goodhart writes.
The need for training courses and consultancies is being oversold, the
executive said. 'Many of the claims being made about what the legislation
says and what firms must do are bogus, aimed at getting businessmen to buy
advice and then undertake unnecessary measures, usually involving further
services or products.'
One company claims its training courses have the approval of a 'European
Health and Safety Commission'. There is no such body.
Other companies are basing their advertising loosely on real changes but
then exaggerating them.
One company points out that after January 1 companies will be required to
make assessments of possible risks to employees. But it implies incorrectly
that all employees will have to be tested for exposure to radon, the
radioactive gas, which is not the case.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Building societies and banks become whipping boys again:
John Gapper examines the background to accusations that lenders are failing
to pass on interest rate cuts to customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY was a typical enough day for the heads of banks and building
societies under Mr John Major's government. They were given a public
scolding about their alleged failure to pass on cuts in base rates to
mortgages and small business loans. As the recession has lingered, such
tickings-off have become frequent.
The admonition was not as severe as in the past. The chancellor's statement
after his chat with building societies and the Housing Corporation, the
quango which finances housing association homes, yesterday focused mainly on
his plan to inject Pounds 750m into the housing market. But he warned them
that he wanted to see cheaper loans.
The banks and building societies offer similar defences to the charge of
profiteering. Two high-street banks say they have widened margins to reflect
the higher risk of bad loans in a recession. Building societies say wider
margins are needed to pay for higher mortgage default. The banks are most
sensitive to charges about their loan policies towards small businesses.
There are two accusations against them: that their minimum lending rates
keep loan interest payments artificially high; and that they are covertly
keeping back part of base rate cuts.
Barclays and National Westminster set minimum lending rates to ensure
profitability at low levels of base rates. Until Wednesday, National
Westminster's minimum rate on small business loans was 11 per cent. The
average such loan cost 11.5 per cent, or 3.5 percentage points above the
base rate.
There was a danger that a base rate cut to 7 per cent - which happened on
Thursday - would have resulted in the bank responding with only 1/2
percentage point cut in the small business rate. Having been bitten several
times before, both banks cut their minimum rate to prevent this.
The second issue for banks is the overall movement in what they charge small
businesses for loans. Margins vary according to each individual risk - for
example, Lloyds does not follow base rates precisely, but adjusts what it
calls 'managed business rates'. It has three bands - equivalent to spreads
of 3, 4 and 5 percentage points above the base rate - which it adjusts
roughly as base rates change. Mr Phil Nunnerley, assistant general manager
for retail banking, argues that the bank has 'fully mirrored' cuts in base
rates since last year.
Midland also says its small business loans have fallen in line with base
rates. It says the average gap has been 3.5 per cent for the past two years.
The recession has led to more customers being classified as high-risk, but
this has been balanced by more risky loans being written off.
However, both Barclays and National Westminster admit that their spreads on
business loans have risen - from around 3.1 points 18 months ago to some 3.5
per cent today. Ms Jane Bradford, National Westminster's head of small
business services, says that reflects higher risk.
Building society mortgage rates have gradually diverged from base rates in
the past two years. The difference between them is historically high, after
being squeezed in the late 1980s when societies competed to offer mortgages.
Societies are trying to regain profitability by widening the margin.
The mortgage rate in 1980 was 1.4 percentage points below the base rate on
average, according to the securities firm UBS Philip &amp; Drew. For most of the
1980s, mortgage rates were above base rates while societies rebuilt
profitability.
However, in 1989, mortgage rates were again lower. There has since been a
return to mortgage rates exceeding base rates, the difference last year
being 1.2 points on average.
The societies stand accused of two sins: widening their margins, and
delaying cuts in rates for borrowers so that new ones are at an advantage.
Mr John Wriglesworth, an analyst at UBS Phillips and Drew, argues that
criticisms are unfair because the industry needs to raise profit-ability.
Mr Wriglesworth says lower rates hurt societies' balance sheets because they
are earning less interest on their own reserves. They also need to raise
their margins because they are hurt by rising repossessions. Bad debts have
risen from Pounds 20m five years ago to an estimated Pounds 2bn this year.
He says that if societies had not delayed cuts in mortgage rates for
existing borrowers, they would have been unable to cut mortgage rates as
much as they have done.
Mr Terry Payton, head of group finance at Alliance and Leicester, argues
that building societies both need to take account of the increased risk in
the housing market and to try to attract more savings. 'We are trying to
balance both sides of the equation, and help the saver as well,' he says.
The upshot is that banks and building societies are risking the public
opprobrium of widening margins because commercial pressures are proving too
heavy to resist.

FT  17 NOV 92 / IRA renews threat to London 'prestige' targets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRA yesterday admitted it had planned to detonate more than two tonnes
of explosives in London at the weekend. A statement issued in Dublin said
that the bombings had been prevented by 'sheer ill-luck'.
The claim followed an attempted attack on the Canary Wharf development in
London's Docklands - the second time in two days a bombing attack on London
had been thwarted. Two days earlier police found a truck loaded with a tonne
of fertiliser-based explosive in Stoke Newington, north London.
The IRA statement said: 'Over the weekend our volunteers planned to detonate
in excess of two tonnes of explosives at prestige targets in central London.
Sheer ill-luck prevented the successful execution of these operations.'
It added: 'Rather than propagandise about 'foiled' IRA attacks the British
establishment and media would do well to reflect on what will continue to be
the inescapable consequences of their government's denial of the Irish
people's sovereign right to national self-determination.'
In the attempted attack on Canary Wharf two terrorists parked a Ford Transit
van packed with explosives 20 yards from the base of the 800ft Canada Square
tower. When challenged by security guards the terrorists threatened them
with a gun and drove away in an Escort van. Police later found the van
abandoned about two miles away in Bethnal Green.
Commander David Tucker, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad,
praised the vigilance of the two guards. 'The alertness of the security
guards at Canary Wharf deserves special credit and praise,' he said, urging
the public to act as the 'eyes and ears' of the police.
In the Stoke Newington incident one man was arrest-ed and another escaped. A
five-tonne Volvo truck was seized.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Extra Pounds 58m agreed for Iveco factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD OF the US and Fiat of Italy are to inject a further Pounds 58m into
Iveco Ford Truck, their UK joint commercial vehicle subsidiary, to help
cover losses and maintain investment by the company.
The additional funding, agreed at an extraordinary general meeting a few
days ago, will bring to Pounds 95m the total of extra cash injected in the
past 12 months into Iveco Ford Truck, which is based in Langley, Berkshire.
The company made a net loss of Pounds 38.6m last year following one of
Pounds 22m in 1990, and has indicated that there will be a further loss for
the current year. It last made a profit, of Pounds 9.6m, in 1989.
The extra cash will take the form of increased share capital. Ford of the US
and Iveco, Fiat's commercial vehicles subsidiary, each have a 48 per cent
stake, with the remaining 4 per cent held by Credit Suisse First Boston.
The injection comes as the Langley plant prepares to halt production for
more than five weeks over the Christmas period, starting on December 4. The
workforce, which totalled 730 at the end of last year, is expected to number
only 510 at the end of this year.
The long Christmas break has been prompted in part by the severely depressed
state of the UK truck market, in which sales of heavy trucks have halved
since 1989.
The extended break will be used to remove the plant and equipment needed to
produce the Cargo truck range and gear up the plant to switch output
entirely to a range of Eurocargo models. The range was announced last year
and is being built in the UK and at Iveco's plant at Brescia, Italy. The
Langley plant is making between 22 and 25 Eurocargos and 15 to 17 Cargos a
day.
Iveco Ford Truck said yesterday it was still looking for a further 40 to 50
people to leave the company under a long-standing voluntary redundancy
scheme.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Modest rise in high-street sales peters out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MODEST improvement in high-street sales petered out last month as
uncertainty about the economy continued to undermine consumer confidence.
A Confederation of British Industry survey shows that high-street sales
slipped back last month after September's modest rise in spite of a
reduction in base rates to 8 per cent shortly before last month's survey was
conducted.
Furthermore, the results did not reflect the latest cut in base rates to 7
per cent. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades
panel, said that cut should encourage more consumers.
The survey, which covered 15,000 retailers between October 19 and November
4, showed that off-licences, shoe shops, book shops and stationers were
among the worst hit sectors in October.
Mr Whittaker said: 'The economic climate remains uncertain though retailers
expect that sales in November will be broadly unchanged on a year ago.'
Newsagents and hardware shops moved against the trend, reporting moderately
improved sales.
Since June official figures have shown a gradual improvement in the annual
growth rate of retail sales. Economists believe, however, that rising
unemployment will continue to hinder consumer demand as people remain
worried about losing their jobs.
Official retail sales figures for last month, due out tomorrow, are forecast
to show a small fall compared with September and a small increase on October
last year.
The CBI survey showed a fall in sales for wholesalers and motor traders.
Wholesalers reported that sales volumes were sharply down on a year ago
following a year-on-year increase in September.
Motor traders said business last month had fallen significantly below last
year's levels. 'Sales of parts and accessories declined moderately while
vehicle sales fell sharply,' Mr Whittaker said. 'This bleak picture is
expected to continue in November with volumes falling well below last year's
levels.'
Details of the survey of the retail sector include:
Food and drink. Sales by grocers grew sharply in the year to October
following three months of flat sales. Food retailers expect sales to improve
on an annual basis this month, but the outlook for off-licences remains
bleak.
Clothing and footwear. Sales for clothes and shoe shops fell compared with a
year ago after sharp sales growth in September. Shoe sales were at their
worst levels since April. Footwear and clothing retailers report that stocks
remain too high relative to expected sales and both are forecasting further
year-on-year falls.
Chemists. Sales continued to rise against the trend of the recession. After
a setback in September sales volumes increased sharply last month compared
with a year ago. But sales remain poor for the time of year.
Furniture and carpets. Sales fell in October compared with a year before
after strong improvements in August and September. The decline probably
reflects the fall in house moves following the return in August of stamp
duty on house purchases. Sales are expected to fall again this month.
Durable household goods. Retailers reported sales unchanged on a year ago
and expect a small increase this month.

THE BBC's overspend on television services in the present financial year is
likely to be considerably higher than the Pounds 20m admitted to in
September, an audit committee chaired by Lord Barnett, vice-chairman of the
BBC governors, has discovered, Raymond Snoddy writes.
Suggestions in September that the potential deficit could go as high as
Pounds 60m were denounced as 'nonsense'. The BBC ordered a cut in television
spending to make sure that accounts balanced before the end of the financial
year.
No final figure is yet available and the audit committee is unlikely to
finish its work before the middle of next month.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Keeping a lid on Cumbria's nuclear dustbin: David Lascelles
on the debate over authorisation of the reprocessing facility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of British Nuclear Fuel's new reprocessing plant at Sellafield
should, technically, be decided by the authorisation process which was set
in motion yesterday by the Pollution Inspectorate.
The real question, however, is whether political feelings over this
controversial project now run so high that ministers from several government
departments will feel obliged to intervene.
The inspectorate's proposals are unlikely to allay widespread public concern
about the health risks posed by the plant, and its role as what
environmental lobbyists describe as a 'nuclear dustbin'. Mr Michael Howard,
the environment secretary, has powers to call for a public hearing, and he
will be watching the coming debate closely.
Not that the pollution inspectorate intends to give Sellafield's Thorp plant
an easy ride. The 2in-thick draft authorisation issued for public discussion
yesterday sets much tougher limits for radioactive emissions than British
Nuclear Fuels asked for. The inspectorate will continue to tighten these up
to reduce Sellafield's radiological impact still further, and officials
stress that their policy is to 'screw down' standards.
But the inspectorate's brief is narrow. Its main task is to ensure that
British Nuclear Fuels, like other polluting industries, uses the best
available technology to clean up its act within the bounds of reasonable
cost. Although this addresses the environmental issue, the 'green' lobby has
already taken the argument over Sellafield far beyond that issue and is now
questioning its very existence.
The coming debate will raise many issues. One is whether Thorp is even
commercially viable, as British Nuclear Fuels claims it is. Built at a cost
of Pounds 1.85bn over eight years, it is designed to handle spent fuel from
the new generation of pressurised-water reactors. One of only two in the
world - the other is near Cherbourg in France - its order books are full for
the first 10 years, and 40 per cent full for the following decade. British
Nuclear Fuels claims that this Pounds 9bn of business will generate Pounds
500m of profits in the first 10 years.
But critics claim that its assumptions are too optimistic. What is clear is
that the high costs of reprocessing are already driving potential customers
away, and the cheaper alternative of storing spent fuel is becoming more
attractive. Although existing customers will have to compensate British
Nuclear Fuels if they break their contracts, there is a danger that the
plant could become redundant.
This is a matter for the Department of Trade and Industry, which is keen to
see British Nuclear Fuels succeed because of its advanced technology and
contribution to exports. But it will also be a matter for the Treasury,
which will have to balance Sellafield's earning power against its wider
financial and other costs.
Another issue has already been sparked by the row over the recent shipment
of a tonne of processed plutonium by the French plant back to Japan. British
Nuclear Fuel's contracts oblige its customers to take back their processed
waste, but the possibility of some kind of ban on international shipments of
dangerous materials could lead to it having to nurse other countries'
nuclear rubbish. As it is, the company will be left with the residue and its
own irradiated equipment.
There is also a conflict between the UK's desire to restrict the spread of
nuclear weapons and its encouragement of an industry that ships around the
world large amounts of material that could have military applications.
Although it may be a year or two before Sellafield has to start shipping
processed plutonium of its own, there are clearly issues here for the
Foreign Office. A factor might be the change of administration in the US
where Mr Bill Clinton, the president-elect, is expected to take a much
tougher line against nuclear waste.
Although this period of consultation was always foreseen and does not, as
many of the company's critics claim, mark a last-minute effort by ministers
to halt Thorp, it comes at a sensitive time. What should have been a routine
final step in Thorp's authorisation threatens to become an important
investigation into its future.
Mr Howard will have to weigh a complex set of considerations as he decides
whether to step in. The picture could be further complicated by judicial
challenges to the inspectorate and the Department of the Environment by
activist lobby groups. One observer remarked: 'It's one of those cases where
you're damned if you do and damned if you don't'

FT  17 NOV 92 / Sellafield plant faces tough safety standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLLUTION authorities proposed tough new standards yesterday for British
Nuclear Fuels' new waste processing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria.
But while they claimed these would result in significantly lower discharges
of harmful materials, the proposals did not include a requirement to install
control equipment on a controversial radioactive gas.
The new standards could leave room for an increase in discharges from
current levels. The Pollution Inspectorate's proposals are contained in a
draft authorisation for the Sellafield site, including the Thermal Oxide
Reprocessing Plant (Thorp), a new Pounds 1.85bn facility designed to process
fuel from pressurised-water reactors.
There will be an eight-week consultation period, after which a final
authorisation will be drawn up.
Dr David Slater, the inspectorate's director, said yesterday: 'I emphasise
that no decisions will be taken until we have considered all the
representations made to us.' Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary,
has the power to call for a full hearing if he wishes.
The proposed emission levels are tougher than BNF requested. But the company
welcomed them last night.
Mr John Guinness, the chairman, said he was convinced that the inspectorate
would be 'scrupulous and fair' and would not be swayed by 'the tactics of
the anti-nuclear lobby which has been orchestrating a letters campaign in
order to distort the right and proper process of public consultation'.
Dr Patrick Green of the environmental pressure group Friends of the Earth
said: 'Far from preventing further contamination of the coast and
atmosphere, the Pollution Inspectorate is planning to let BNF increase
massively its discharges to the environment.'
The proposed maximum limit on gases would reduce the annual radiation dose
to the most exposed members of the public from 451 microsieverts to 214ms.
However, Sellafield's emissions are currently only 170ms.
The maximum for liquid wastes at present allows a dose of 219ms, against
actual emissions amounting to 135ms to 153ms. The new limit would be 165ms,
again leaving room for an increase.
The inspectorate stressed yesterday, however, that British Nuclear Fuels
would have to stay within 75 per cent of the limit.
The inspectorate is not requiring British Nuclear Fuels to install equipment
to remove krypton-85, a radioactive gas that will be discharged into the
atmosphere by Thorp.
The inspectorate said there was no proven and safe means. But BNF would have
to install the equipment as soon as 'reasonably practicable'.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Sell-off possible for Scots water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will today set out its options for bringing private-sector
capital into the Scottish water and sewerage industry. Although these are
likely to include privatisation by means of a stock market flotation, other
possibilities are to be advanced.
Water and sewerage services in Scotland, which were not privatised when the
English water companies were sold in 1989, are run by the nine regional and
three island councils.
Strong opposition to privatisation has arisen following the disclosure in
July by Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, that he was looking at ways 'in
which the private sector might contribute enterprise and investment' to
Scottish water.
An opinion poll showed only 4 per cent of Scots in favour of privatisation.
Only 9 per cent of the Conservatives who were asked supported it.
Mr Lang, who will be addressing the House of Commons today, will present a
consultation paper that follows a study by the merchant bankers Quayle
Munro.
He is expected to challenge the opposition parties to say how they would
meet the need to restructure Scottish water and sewerage, and find the
finance to improve it.
The government says a review is needed because most regional councils will
disappear when local government is reorganised in 1996, while compliance
with EC water and sewerage directives could cost Pounds 2.5bn in the next 10
to 15 years.
Improving existing installations would cost a further Pounds 2.5bn. The
Treasury is reluctant either to pay for this or to sanction new borrowing.
Apart from creating water companies and then floating them off, private
capital could be brought in by granting concessions to run and invest in
water services.

A BURST of gloomy reports on Canada's economic prospects has sent the
Canadian dollar reeling, forced interest rates higher and raised fresh
concern about the sputtering business recovery.
The Canadian dollar sank by almost half a US cent yesterday, falling below
79 US cents for the first time in almost five years and closing at 78.60.
The Bank of Canada responded by pushing up short-term interest rates.
Commercial banks followed suit, lifting prime rates by three-quarters of a
percentage point to 8.25 per cent.
Economists are concerned that the jump in interest rates will rub out signs
of an end to the unexpectedly long and deep recession. With inflation
running at an annual rate of little more than 1 per cent, real long-term
interest rates are now at an unusually high level of about 8 per cent.
Mr Warren Jestin, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, said yesterday
that Canada was teetering 'on the lip of deflation'. Financial markets'
nervousness is ascribed to worries about deteriorating federal and
provincial finances.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Attempted coup leaves Peruvians perplexed: Sally Bowen on
questions raised by the move against Fujimori
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DETAILS of last Friday's coup attempt in Peru, allegedly intended to
assassinate President Alberto Fujimori and kidnap the head of his joint
chiefs of staff, emerged over the weekend. But they leave key questions
unanswered.
With Peru's return to 'democratic institutionality' (via elections for a
constituent congress) less than a week away, opposition politicians are
demanding that Mr Fujimori clarify his claim that 'the black hand of
political interests' was behind the superficially tame attempt.
Some 25 retired and serving army officers and a handful of civilians are
under arrest. Trial will be by closed military court and proceedings have
already been opened against the ringleaders - who have had no access to
legal advice as yet.
But there are still no details of involvement of politicians. As Mr Fujimori
gave weekend interviews, journalists demanded evidence while retired
generals termed the plot 'absurd and unreal'. Even Mr Fujimori called it
'crazy'.
On the face of it, the conspiracy seems to have had faint chance of success.
It was hatched, says the official version, by three retired and two serving
army generals and led by General Jaime Salinas. He and the other two retired
generals, Palomino and Pastor, had all served as heads of the military
household in the government palace during the previous regime of President
Alan Garcia. According to Mr Fujimori, Gen Salinas attempted an unpublicised
coup in July 1990 to prevent him taking office.
The intention this time, Mr Fujimori claims, was to impede next Sunday's
elections. The plotters were to put themselves in key military and
ministerial positions and reinstate the Congress which Mr Fujimori dissolved
on April 5.
Mr Fujimori insisted the conspirators were bent on assassinating him. He
displayed on television a rifle fitted with telescopic sights captured
during the arrests 'similar to the one used to kill President Kennedy'.
His claim of attempted assassination was denied yesterday by Gen Salinas in
a jail interview published by a Peruvian magazine. Gen Salinas was reported
as saying that the intention had been only to remove Mr Fujimori and to
install vice-president Maximo San Roman as president. Mr San Roman broke
with Mr Fujimori after Congress was dissolved.
In the early hours of Friday, the president and his family were whisked from
government palace under heavy guard to a secret location. Tanks and troops
blockaded Lima's main square. But the only hostile movement seems to have
involved alleged assassin Captain Hugo Ormeno, who was arrested with five
other men several hundred yards from his objective.
The three generals accused of playing the leading role in the conspiracy
were all forced into early retirement when Mr Fujimori assumed the
presidency in July, 1990. In what he called an essential 'moralisation'
process, he sacked many high-ranking officers from the armed forces and
police.
Some middle and higher-ranking officers complain that all key promotions are
managed by retired captain Vladimiro Montesinos, Mr Fujimori's personal
adviser.
Lima is calm and and Mr Fujimori uncharacteristically jovial, apparently
enjoying his new role as defender of democracy. The coup attempt has moved
pre-election political debate still further to the sidelines and everything
looks set for a comfortable government victory in Sunday's elections.

roots

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE existence of powerful farm lobbies in France does not fully explain why
the government is so sensitive to farmers' demands. All mainstream political
parties have rural roots, or are in touch with a provincial audience, since
any politician with national ambitions needs to nurture a local powerbase to
maintain prestige.
The make-up of the population explains why. Just over 6 per cent of the
French civil workforce are farmers, nearly three times that in the UK and
double that in the US, Insee, the state statistics agency, says. About a
fifth of the population makes a living, direct and indirect, from farming.
Thus, national politicians, both right and left, tend to hold local jobs as
mayors or regional councillors on top of their national mandates. Examples
include Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, also known as mayor of
Nevers, or Jean-Pierre Soisson, agriculture minister, who continues to be
mayor of Auxerre.
Among the formal lobbies, the group that counts is the Federation Nationale
des Syndicats d'Exploitants Agricoles (FNSEA), which counts 600,000 members
among France's nearly 1m farmers. Officially, the FNSEA is apolitical, but
tends to reflect conservative views, if only because of the right's
traditional strength in the French provinces, where conservative parties
control 75 out of 96 departments. One of the FNSEA's former presidents is Mr
Francois Guillaume, agriculture minister in the 1986-88 Gaullist government.
The FNSEA, also dominated by cereal farmers, grudgingly accepts Common
Agriculture Policy reforms and so has concentrated on negotiating
compensation terms. But it cannot accept production cuts beyond the EC
reforms, which explains the FNSEA's tough stance on Gatt and the oilseeds
row.
However different their interests, France farm lobbies are driven by the
same fear of the gradual death of the countryside. And the social problem of
a declining farm workforce remains.

<TEXT>
MR Bill Clinton, the president-elect, and Democratic congressional leaders
yesterday pledged 'an end to the cold war between Congress and the White
House and a new era of co-operation' on plans to tackle economic and health
care problems.
Mr Clinton and his wife, Hillary, met vice-president-elect Al Gore, Mr Tom
Foley, Speaker of the House, Mr George Mitchell, the Senate majority Leader,
and Mr Dick Gephardt, the House majority leader on Sunday night.
'We're off to a good start,' Mr Foley said in Little Rock yesterday morning.
He promised the House would move more swiftly than at any time in recent
history to organise for action on the new president's proposals.
Only a few notes of discord marred the pronouncements of harmony. Mr Clinton
called 'intriguing' a plan by Mr Foley to allow the new president to 'line
item veto' parts of bills, still giving Congress the power to override the
veto by a majority vote. This means, said Mr Clinton, 'you can't just bury
something of questionable merit in a big, omnibus bill.' However, Mr
Mitchell, withheld his support from the proposal, saying once the economy
had improved 'matters of process will be less important.'
Mr Clinton reaffirmed his intention of lifting the ban on homosexuals
serving in the US defence forces - a move opposed by Sen Sam Nunn, the
powerful chairman of the Senate armed services committee. This promise could
haunt him, particularly if military leaders resign over it, as some have
threatened to do.
On foreign policy, the president-elect refused to talk specifics, but on
Bosnia, he said there were 'many options short of sending troops in but
beyond where we are now'. On improving relations with Vietnam, he stressed
the need for a full account of those American troops missing in action.
Mr Clinton said his wife - whose role in the administration is being closely
watched - had stayed for the entire meeting with the congressmen and that
'she knew more than we did about some things'. The Clintons are due to make
their first post-election trip to Washington on Wednesday where they will
meet with the Bushes and both Democrats and Republicans in Congress.

FT  17 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Why Paris dare not annoy them down on the
farm
</HEADLINE>

   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A jacquerie is what the French government fears would be the result of a
Gatt farm trade deal on US terms.
The term has nothing to do with Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president,
so far considered in Paris to have done his best to hold the line against
any cut in farm output beyond this summer's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
reform. It refers, after the first jacquerie or revolt by 14th-century
peasants, to the tendency of French farmers to show their discontent in
public ways.
They may not burn chateaux these days, but leave their tractors across road
and rail lines, disrupting traffic, as they showed for several weeks after
EC farm ministers agreed swingeing price cuts and set-aside requirements.
After barely surviving, by three votes, a parliamentary censure motion, the
government introduced a national aid package to appease the farmers. These
provided for a cut in tax on farming land, incentives for producers of
crop-based fuels, and debt relief on investment by French farmers to
intensify production. Such investment included the giant tractors as handy
in a street protest as on the land.
If there is one element of consensus between France's fractious political
parties, it is that the country cannot go beyond the CAP reforms it has
already agreed to.
Including its poor opinion poll showing, the ruling Socialist party has
enough problems in the run-up to next March's legislative elections without
provoking another jacquerie by Gatt concessions. Its survival until March
depends, largely, on keeping in with the Communists who voted against it
over CAP reform in the summer. Most French farmers vote to the right, but a
substantial minority in the south shows allegiance to the Communist and
Radical parties.
Nor is there any reason to believe that, in the likely event they win the
March election, the centre-right parties forming France's next government
will want to be any more conciliatory on the Gatt farm trade issue. The
neo-Gaullist RPR party is especially strong in the monde rural. So
widespread is the sympathy for farmers that even industrial groups with
everything to gain from an overall Gatt deal dare not be seen to criticise
France's farmers.
The chances are that if President Mitterrand is forced into newconcessions
by a Gatt deal, he will seek to put the onus of responsibility on Brussels.

FT  17 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Dunkel's intervention is low-key affair -
Gatt chief is aware of his limited influence on the US and EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IF Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, is seen by the US as a
French farm lobby stooge, Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, is seen
in France as a US stooge. That makes Mr Dunkel's mediation in the US-EC farm
trade dispute, which took him to Brussels last week and to Washington
yesterday, an especially cautious, low-key affair.
His meetings in Washington, with Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative,
and Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, have been partly overtaken by
resumption of US-EC negotiations aimed at reform of the EC's subsidised farm
trade regime. Mr Madigan is due to meet Mr Ray MacSharry, his EC
counterpart, in Washington tomorrow evening, the first time they have met
since the Chicago talks collapsed on the eve of the US presidential election
two weeks ago.
It will be necessary to wait until after the Madigan-MacSharry meetings to
learn if the much-needed farm trade breakthrough can be won. But that does
not render Mr Dunkel's intermediation irrelevant. His presence in Washington
reminds US and EC farm negotiators that more is at stake than farm products
trade. Mr Dunkel was mandated to travel to Brussels and Washington by the
other 106 contracting parties to Gatt, all frustrated by US-EC intransigence
on farm trade reform and alarmed continued deadlock will imperil the Uruguay
Round.
Economists say these reforms could add Dollars 200bn (Pounds 132bn) to world
trade by the end of the decade. More immediately, they could provide a
fillip to Europe's recession-ridden economies, as well as boosting export
hopes for many third world exporters which continue to be barred from many
industrial markets. Most important, they would avert a threatened US-EC
trade war that would quickly embroil the rest of the world.
Mr Dunkel will try to set the stage for a rapid return by trade negotiators
to Geneva if a US-EC breakthrough is achieved later this week. The return of
negotiations into Gatt's multilateral context would first aim to win wider
international support for any US-EC farm reform package agreed bilaterally.
It would then provide urgent impetus to wider negotiations on market access,
trade in services and protection of intellectual property which have to be
completed under extreme time pressure. Hardly any progress has been made
here since Mr Dunkel's draft Uruguay round pact, the so-called 'final act',
was published last December.
Some have said Mr Dunkel received perfunctory attention in Brussels last
week. His meeting lasted one hour. Observers said EC officials are not keen
for him to be seen to have too much influence. Mrs Hills caught some of the
same mood when she said on US TV: 'He is going to implore us, having
implored the EC, to try to get the Uruguay Round talks to move forward.' Mr
Dunkel is unlikely to be perturbed by such put-downs. He is aware of his
limited influence, and has agreed to mediate only because of signs the EC
and US want to settle their differences. He emerged from Brussels convinced
the EC is 'prepared to do a deal'. Whether his confidence is justified or
not, only meetings later this week will clarify.
IN their battle to keep Common Agriculture Policy subsidies, French farmers
have had allies in farm groups around the world who believe as fervently
that protection is needed to maintain their sectors, Nancy Dunne writes from
Washington.
Farm groups in the US, Canada, Australia, Japan and Europe keep in close
touch on Uruguay Round developments. Many applaud French farmers' resistance
to farm trade liberalisation, believing each country must keep its own
agriculture sector and the emphasis on exports by lowest-cost producers
harms food supply and environment.
Much of the activity is co-ordinated by the Institute for Agriculture and
Trade Policy in Minnesota. An official said farmers worldwide had the same
interest 'in creating a sustainable method of food production allowing for
viable rural economies'.
Zenchu, the Japanese farm organisation opposing opening the rice market, has
representatives in Washington working with US and European farm groups. Most
of the liaison with foreign farm groups is performed out of Tokyo.

RESULTS of the final round of voting in municipal elections held across

country, writes Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro.
The left-wing Workers party (PT) won in the major state capitals of Belo
Horizonte, Porto Alegre and Goiania, as well as in the important industrial
town of Ribeirao Preto. Mr Luis Inacio da Silva, the PT leader who narrowly
lost the 1989 presidential elections, described the party's performance as
'extraordinary'.
However, the PT lost Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city and the party's
birthplace, to Mr Paulo Maluf from the Social Democrats (PDS), despite Mr
Maluf's association with past military regimes and successive defeats in
democratic elections.
Mr Maluf is expected to use his position to build up a base for presidential
elections.

FT  17 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Lloyd's in Russian insurance scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNDERWRITERS at Lloyd's of London are backing a new billion-dollar insurance
scheme aimed at boosting foreign investment in Russia. The Russian
Investment Insurance Programme, launched yesterday, covers investment risks
from property expropriation to blocks on dividend repatriation, and should
ease a shortage of political risk insurance for foreign investors.
The scheme was developed by the European Investment Guarantee Agency (EIGA),
a London-based political risk and trade credit insurance consultancy, with
the Russian Agency for International Co-operation and Development, a
government body for investment promotion.
The European Commission and the Russian government have been closely
involved in the scheme which should boost available international capacity
by Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) from the present Dollars 3bn-Dollars 5bn. One
recent estimate shows international investors seeking cover for projects
worth up to Dollars 40bn.
Mr Robert Lyle of EIGA expects companies investing in Russian port
renovation, hotels, the conversion of weapons and munitions factories and
mining projects to be among the first customers. Premiums would average
1.5-2.5 per cent of the value of an investment, with the sum insured related
to the amount of capital exposed.
The rate is only slightly dearer than charged by government-owned agencies,
such as the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department, and cheaper than other
private market rates, Mr Lyle says. Maximum exposure which can be insured
for any one investor is normally Dollars 75m, rising to Dollars 150m for any
one project.
Policies will be written for three years and are renewable annually. Trade
credit insurance is separately available up to Dollars 10m per risk. Lloyd's
underwriters specialising in political risk will lead policies, with 30-40
of the market's 250-plus syndicates taking part.

Canada was teetering 'on the lip of deflation'.
'Given the weakness in the economy, the betting is that the Bank of Canada
has leeway to raise interest rates, but not much leeway,' Mr Jestin said.
Financial markets' nervousness is ascribed to worries about deteriorating
federal and provincial government finances. The federal government indicated
late last week that its budget deficit for the year to March 31 1993 could
reach CDollars 35bn (Pounds 18.3bn), compared with the original estimate of
CDollars 27.5bn. Several provinces are also battling to contain deficits in
the face of slumping tax revenues and rising public spending demands,
especially on social security.
Although Mr Donald Mazankowski, the finance minister, has affirmed his
determination to rein in the deficit, calls are growing on the government to
stimulate growth.

THE US Supreme Court yesterday agreed to hear a tobacco competition case
which involves claims by the Brooke Group - formerly Liggett Group - that
Brown &amp; Williamson, a subsidiary of Britain's BAT Industries, used predatory
pricing to limit Brooke's ability to compete, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
The case could also clarify the extent to which price-cutting is legal.
Brooke/Liggett introduced low-price generic cigarettes in the early-1980s,
to which Brown &amp; Williamson responded with a brand of its own and offers of
volume-based rebates.
Brooke brought an anti-trust case against B&amp;W and in 1990 was awarded nearly
Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.1m) - increased to Dollars 148.8m because of the
anti-trust nature of the case. However, a federal appeals court subsequently
ruled in B&amp;W's favour.

CHINA yesterday launched a blistering attack against the governor of Hong
Kong, Mr Chris Patten, accusing him of challenging Chinese sovereignty and
of seeking to perpetuate the division of the Chinese people.
An editorial in the communist party newspaper, People's Daily, said Mr
Patten met a senior official of Taiwan's ruling Nationalist party, Xu
Shengfa,for a political purpose on November 3. The meeting was held in
Government House where Mr Patten 'openly offered flattery and favours'.
The governor tried to cover this up by claiming the meeting was with members
of a Taiwanese business delegation, the paper said. But on November 9 the
manager of China Travel Service, Mr Li Changyi, disclosed the governor's
guest was a member of the Taiwanese Nationalist Party's central standing
committee.
The People's Daily editorial said: 'Patten's 'break with precedence' is
obviously a challenge to Chinese sovereignty.' Mr Patten wanted to make Hong
Kong an 'independent or semi-independent or self-governing political entity'
to continue British colonial rule.'

A JUDICIAL inquiry into political violence in South Africa yesterday found
that the army had used a convicted murderer to try to discredit the African
National Congress (ANC), providing the most damaging evidence disclosed so
far of state involvement in political unrest.
Yesterday's statement from Judge Richard Goldstone, who heads a commission
of inquiry set up by Pretoria to probe political violence, goes well beyond
any previous official report on security force complicity in violence. Judge
Goldstone said the commission had seized army documents showing that top
military officers had last year sanctioned the use of criminals to discredit
the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe.
The report could do severe political damage to Mr F W de Klerk's government,
already under serious pressure after a spate of allegations of state
involvement in political assassinations.
Mr Justice Goldstone stopped short of declaring that the evidence proved the
existence of an orchestrated campaign to undermine the ANC and foment
violence, but he conceded that the documents provided 'some evidence' of
such activity.
Yesterday's revelations cast serious doubts on President de Klerk's frequent
protestations - repeated yesterday in a BBC interview - that the government
is innocent of involvement in violence.
The documents seized by the Goldstone commission, on the contrary, show that
the army's top intelligence officer, Gen Rudolf Badenhorst, had employed a
convicted double murderer, Mr Ferdi Barnard, to 'compromise' ANC guerrillas
by involving them in crime.
'For that purpose use would be made inter alia of prostitutes, homosexuals,
shebeen (illegal bar) owners and drug dealers,' the inquiry statement said.
Documents revealing the operation were seized when the commission raided a
military intelligence unit.

<TEXT>
MR ALAN BOND, the bankrupt Australian entrepreneur, yesterday pleaded not
guilty for the second time to a charge of dishonestly inducing a businessman
to take part in a ADollars 370m (Pounds 168m) corporate rescue.
Mr Bond, 54, was jailed for two-and-a-half years after being convicted on a
similar charge in May, but was released in August after the Western
Australian Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the conviction.
The appeal court ordered a second trial after hearing fresh evidence which
the defence claimed threw doubt on the credibility of prosecution witnesses.
The retrial, in the Perth district court, is expected to conclude later this
week.
The charge against Mr Bond is related to the 1987 rescue of Rothwells
merchant bank, run by Mr Laurie Connell, a fellow entrepreneur. Mr Bond,
then chairman of Bond Corporation, played a leading part in organising the
rescue.
The prosecution claims that Mr Bond concealed from Mr Brian Coppin, a
businessman who contributed to the rescue, the fact that Bond Corporation
was to receive a ADollars 16m success fee from Rothwells.
Mr Coppin told the court that Mr Bond asked him in October 1987 to raise
ADollars 20m (later reduced to ADollars 8m) to assist the rescue of
Rothwells. He said he did not learn of the success fee until November 14.
The Rothwells rescue followed the worldwide stock market collapse in October
1987.
The bank, which collapsed in November 1988, was the focus of a recent royal
commission report into relationships between politicians and businessmen in
Western Australia. More than 20 people face criminal charges relating to the
rescue, including Mr Connell.
Mr Bond quit as chairman of Bond Corp in September 1990, just two days
before the company announced a record loss of ADollars 2.2bn.

CHINA'S rush to develop a market economy is fuelling a surge in credit to
fund inefficient capital investment, the People's Daily has said, Reuter
reports from Beijing.
'The call for faster economic development does not mean that everyone must
jump to the fore,' the Communist Party's official newspaper said.
'We must not take the old road of neglecting efficiency, stressing and
competing only for production value, blindly launching new projects and
expanding production.
While proud that their economic policies are working, China's communist
leaders fear that mismanagement may bring a repeat of the economic
turbulence of the late 1980s, when spiralling inflation helped to spur the
pro-democracy protests in the spring of 1989.
China's economy grew by 10.6 per cent in the first three quarters of 1992,
down from rates of up to 12 per cent earlier this year. Inflation remains at
about 5 per cent, according to official statistics, but urban areas are
posting rates closer to 10 per cent, which diplomats say are still
underestimated.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Japanese search for clues to life with Clinton: The
generation change at the top of US politics is unsettling Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE PAST week a team of 20 top officials from Japan's Ministry of
Finance has been hard at work in Washington seeking clues about what a
Clinton presidency could mean for Japan.
Although the answer will remain unclear for months, Japanese concerns are
already crystallising.
Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, the leader of one of the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party's factions remarked: 'There must be change. This was the first post
cold war election in the US. One of the main theme's was a desire for
change.'
Professor Takashi Inoguchi, professor of politics at the University of Tokyo
identified the common Japanese concern: that change will be in the direction
of toughness.
He said: 'The Clinton team will be tough, they will be tough on themselves
demanding more from the US economy but tough on us as well.'
What is unsettling for Japan is not just that there will be a shift from
Republican to Democrat in the White House. Even more significant for many
Japanese is the change of generations at the top of US politics.
The 46-year old Mr Clinton has no memory of Japan as a vulnerable, war
ravaged, nation which became a bulwark of American anti-communist policy in
Asia. He knows Japan only as a strong economy. Since the mid-1950s the two
elements of the relationship have balanced one another. The strategic,
political relationship was designed to contain communism in Asia. The
strength of that alliance soothed the economic and commercial tensions which
have accompanied the growth of Japan's trade surplus and its economic power.
Trade disputes were never allowed to jeopardise the basic anti-communist
alliance.
Mr Clinton will find the balance between the strategic and economic aspects
of the relationship fundamentally unsettled. Japan's growing trade surplus
did not play a large role in the US presidential campaign. But trade
tensions are unlikely to subside, especially if the US economic recovery
continues to be weak.
According to a senior US diplomat in Tokyo: 'A new administration will
almost certainly have to have another go at the trade issue. We have learned
the only thing that works is long hard pressure.'
Not only do many Japanese expect Mr Clinton to press for further measures to
open the Japanese market. They also believe trade politics will become more
complicated.
An agreement between the US and Europe on farm trade would quickly swing the
spotlight on to Japan's willingness to open up its rice market. The US
commitment to the North American Free Trade Agreement has alarmed many
Japanese exporters.
China may also become a divisive issue with Japan. Mr Michael Armacost, US
Ambassador to Tokyo says 'China could be a testing ground for a US policy of
tying aid to human and civil rights.' If the US did impose restrictions on
aid and trade with China, it might not look kindly upon Japan's increasingly
close trade ties with China.
The Japanese Emperor's recent visit to China, preceded by a stream of
Japanese politicians and business leaders, was a subtle but significant
signal of a more independent Japanese policy.
Japan may be prepared to maintain this independence. Senior Tokyo trade
officials say there is little sense in talking of human rights without
fostering China's economic development.
Mr Mitsuzuka suggests human rights are more important in a multiracial
society such as the US than in ethnically homogenous societies such as China
and Japan.
Approaches to Russia may also become more divisive if the US insists that
Japan carries more of the aid burden. The US in the past three years has
committed Dollars 9.3bn (Pounds 6.2bn) to the former Soviet Union. About 65
per cent has been disbursed. Japan has committed Dollars 2.7bn most of it in
the form of trade credits to Japanese companies. Most has not been
disbursed. The funds which have been disbursed have gone to the Russian Far
East which hosts 3 per cent of the Russian population and 80 per cent of its
raw materials.
Japan insists it cannot offer more aid until the dispute with Russia over
the four Northern Territory islands is settled.
There is no prospect of a rupture. According to Mr Yukio Sato, director
general of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' North American bureau, the US
still defines Japan's foreign policy choices: 'Some people say we could go
back to Asia if relations with the US turned sour. But no Asian nation would
welcome a Japan which had a bad relationship with the US.'
But Professor Robert Scalapino, an Asian expert at the University of
California, warns that the two countries must put their relationship on a
new basis. To stick to old policies was impossible in the light of the
current changes. It was time for the US to adopt fresh Asian policies.
Even the most imaginative innovator would be hard pressed to come up with
something as potent as the cold war to bind the two together. Pragmatism and
practicality rather than strategic vision are more likely to characterise
the relationship in the Clinton years.
As Mr Mitsuzuka puts it with resigned realism: 'Even if we are divorced we
can still live under the same roof.'

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Industry ministry is becoming increasingly concerned that the
country's small and medium-sized companies may be suffering a credit crunch
as hard-pressed banks cut their lending.
Mr Kozo Watanabe, minister for International Trade and Industry ,speaking
after a meeting yesterday with the leaders of four small business
associations, said he would ask the banks 'to carefully consider that they
need not refrain from lending money.'
He was responding to growing criticism from small businesses that banks are
increasingly reluctant to lend to small companies because they are trying to
reduce their mounting bad loans.
Small companies with less than 100 employees account for about 56 per cent
of employment in Japan. They are far more dependent on bank lending than
large companies.
Figures published last week showed that small companies accounted for most
of the sharp increase in corporate bankruptcies over the past year.
Senior Bank of Japan officials said that government funds to provide small
business finance would probably be increased to prevent a private sector
credit crunch.
The small business leaders pressed Mr Watanabe for early implementation of
the supplementary budget needed to enact the Y10,700bn (Pounds 56.9bn)
emergency package announced in August.
The sluggish state of the Japanese economy was confirmed by figures from
industry and retailing. Steel production in October was 8.1 per cent below
last year, according to the Japan Iron and Steel Federation. Sales at 27
department stores in the Tokyo area fell last month, for the eighth month in
a row, by 4.9 per cent to Y233bn.
Wholesale prices fell 0.4 per cent in October from the previous month.

</HEADLINE>

   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA yesterday launched a blistering attack against the governor of Hong
Kong, Mr Chris Patten, accusing him of challenging Chinese sovereignty and
of seeking to perpetuate the division of the Chinese people.
An angry editorial in the communist party newspaper, People's Daily, said Mr
Patten met with a senior official of Taiwan's ruling Nationalist party, Mr
Xu Shengfa,for a political purpose on November 3. The meeting was held in
Government House where Mr Patten 'openly offered flattery and favours'.
The governor had tried to cover this up by claiming through an aide the
meeting was with members of a Taiwanese business delegation for commercial
reasons only, the paper said.
But on November 9 the manager of China Travel Service, Mr Li Changyi,
disclosed the governor's guest was a member of the Taiwanese Nationalist
Party's central standing committee. The editorial said the meeting was
greeted by Taiwanese newspapers as a break with precedent which opened new
top level channels of communication between Hong Kong and Taiwan.
China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province. Although much of Taiwan's
enormous trade with the mainland is routed through Hong Kong because Taiwan
bans direct trade, the colony's leaders have in the past been careful to
avoid offending the Chinese by officially receiving Taiwanese politicians.
Taiwanese officials have often been denied entry to the colony.
The People's Daily editorial said: 'Patten's 'break with precedence' is
obviously a challenge to Chinese sovereignty.'
Mr Patten wanted to make Hong Kong an 'independent or semi-independent or
self-governing political entity' to continue British colonial rule.
There was no difference between Patten's policies and the aims of some
Taiwanese who advocated independence for Taiwan.
China kept up the pressure over Hong Kong yesterday by repeating its refusal
to support any attempt by the British authorities to proceed unilaterally
with the construction of the multi-billion dollar airport.
Talks in Beijing in July failed to reach agreement on financing the new
airport, the official Xinhua news agency reported. It quoted an unnamed
Chinese spokesman for the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group who said the
British had rejected as too risky a Chinese proposal made in July for the
urgent work of site reclamation for the airport to proceed pending an
agreement on overall financial arrangements.
The spokesman said the British side was now going back on its words and
using the suggestion of the Chinese side as an excuse to proceed alone.
The circumstances were now different, the spokesman said, and China opposed
any decision of the British to go it alone on the airport.
The escalating row between Beijing and the British authorities in Hong Kong
has become dangerously heated since China's angry rejection of Mr Patten's
plan to expand Hong Kong's 1995 elections, saying they violated Hong Kong's
post-1997 constitution.
Each day produces a more furious Chinese response. On Saturday the governor
was accused of stepping up the row and told political changes not approved
by China would have no future after 1997.
The entry of Taiwan into the argument adds a further explosive element to an
already volatile situation.

<TEXT>
EGYPT has announced long-delayed plans to shake up publicly owned companies
to help inject competitiveness into the country's ailing state economy,
Reuter reports from Cairo.
However, some western economists said the moves, which should have taken
effect in May, might be further delayed by a valuation of the companies'
assets and liabilities, the first step towards privatising them.
The 27 holding companies set up last year to manage the large public sector
will be reduced to 20 or 18, with each handling a portfolio of companies in
competing industries, officials say.
Each holding company at the present time handles all the affiliates in a
particular sector.
In some cases such as cement, where the public sector is the main local
supplier, the holding com-pany has been able to set its own monopoly prices.
'The goals are to break up monopolies ..and balance them between each other,
to prevent the parent companies from intervening too much in their
affiliates and give most power to the management,' Mr Atef Sedki, prime
minister, told al-Ahram newspaper on Monday.
Western donors backing Egypt's economic reforms with Dollars 10bn of debt
forgiveness have pressed for public flotations for nearly a year.

<TEXT>
A JUDICIAL inquiry into political violence in South Africa yesterday found
that the army had used a convicted murderer to try to discredit the African
National Congress (ANC), providing the most damaging evidence disclosed so
far of state involvement in political unrest.
Yesterday's statement from Judge Richard Goldstone, who heads a commission
of inquiry set up by Pretoria to probe political violence, goes well beyond
any previous official report on security force complicity in violence. Judge
Goldstone said the commission had seized army documents showing that top
military officers had last year sanctioned the use of criminals to discredit
the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe.
The report could do severe political damage to Mr F W de Klerk's government,
already under serious pressure after a spate of allegations of state
involvement in political assassinations, as well as numerous corruption
scandals and resignations of senior officials.
Mr Justice Goldstone stopped short of declaring that the evidence proved the
existence of an orchestrated campaign to undermine the ANC and foment
violence, but he conceded that the documents provided 'some evidence' of
such activity.
Yesterday's revelations clearly suggest a deliberate strategy at senior
levels of government to destabilise opposition groups like the ANC, and cast
serious doubts on President de Klerk's frequent protestations - repeated
yesterday in a BBC interview - that the government is innocent of
involvement in violence.
The documents seized by the Goldstone commission, on the contrary, show that
the army's top intelligence officer, Gen Rudolf Badenhorst, had employed a
convicted double murderer, Mr Ferdi Barnard, to 'compromise' ANC guerrillas
by involving them in crime.
'For that purpose use would be made inter alia of prostitutes, homosexuals,
shebeen (illegal bar) owners and drug dealers,' the inquiry statement said.
Documents revealing the operation were seized when the commission, aided by
the police, raided an operations unit of military intelligence.
Mr Barnard has also been implicated by witnesses in a parallel inquest being
held into the assassination of anti-apartheid activist David Webster in
1989. He was a member of the notorious Civil Co-operation Bureau, a
government dirty-tricks agency disbanded by President de Klerk.
Yesterday's evidence will increase pressure on Mr de Klerk to clear out top
levels of the security forces before progress can be made to install an
interim government.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was little hope in Pakistan last night that the government of Prime
Minister Mr Nawaz Sharif and opposition parties led by former prime minister
Ms Benazir Bhutto could avoid their most bitter confrontation tomorrow.
Opposition activists will try to march into the capital, Islamabad despite a
ban on protesters entering the city.
Ms Bhutto has planned the march in the hope of a comeback on a populist
tide. She claims thousands of her supporters have been arrested since the
weekend .
The march could pose a serious test for the ruling alliance but political
observers do not foresee an immediate change of government.
A large turnout would intensify political pressure on Mr Sharif, who came to
power in elections two years ago after Ms Bhutto's government was dismissed
on charges of corruption.
Mr Sharif appears to have become vulnerable since a split earlier this year
within the ruling Islamic Democratic Alliance led to a break with the
Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM), the powerful regional party in Karachi,
Pakistan's largest city and heart of the country's corporate and financial
sectors.
Though he still claims to have a simple majority in Parliament, he has lost
the two-thirds majority which gave him the opportunity to bring about
constitutional changes. There are also new concerns about the economy, with
the government estimating recent flood damage at between Rs40bn and Rs50bn
(Pounds 1.05bn and Pounds 1.28bn).
Opposition activists, who have repeatedly accused the government of
corruption and failure to resolve important national issues, are demanding
an interim 'national consensus government' representing a broad spectrum of
political parties as a prelude to'free and fair elections.'
Ms Bhutto said: 'The present government neither has the legitimacy nor is
able to govern in accordance with the constitution. Law and order and the
government machinery has broken down.'
Mr Sharif said the march would be a failure which the 'masses would not be
so foolish to join'. Everybody will see that people support 'our policies
for progress and development.'
In Pakistan's troubled political history since independence 45 years ago,
there are few examples of populist pressure bearing upon the rulers, and,
today, there are few visible signs of public unrest.

CHINA'S headlong rush to develop a market economy is fuelling a surge in
credit to fund inefficient capital investment, the People's Daily has said,
Reuter reports from Beijing.
'The call for faster economic development does not mean that everyone must
jump to the fore,' the Communist Party's official newspaper said.
'We must not take the old road of neglecting efficiency, stressing and
competing only for production value, blindly launching new projects and
expanding production.
'If we do not look at the reality, and do not recognise that speed without
efficiency will not last long, then it will create economic chaos.'
While proud that their economic policies are working, China's communist
leaders fear that that mismanagement may bring a repeat of the economic
turbulence of the late 1980s, when spiralling inflation helped to spur the
pro-democracy protests in the spring of 1989.
Inflation remains at about 5 per cent, according to official statistics, but
urban areas are posting rates closer to 10 per cent, which diplomats say are
still underestimated.
Warnings of overproduction and the inflationary threat have become more
frequent following last month's Communist Party congress, which thrilled
China's budding entrepreneurs by setting its seal of approval on
market-style reforms.
Grandiose development schemes and plans for faster production are being
unveiled across the country. Industrial projects valued at Dollars 185bn
(Pounds 122.5bn) are now under construction in the state sector, a figure
equal to about one half of China's annual GNP, according to official
statistics.
The People's Daily said the main problem facing China's economic planners
was inefficiency, especially in the state sector where companies are revving
up production lines to churn out piles of shoddy, unwanted goods.
China's gross industrial output during the first nine months was slightly
over 2,000bn yuan (Pounds 245bn) an increase of 19.3 per cent over the same
period in 1991.
By the end of August the total value of finished industrial goods unbought
in warehouses hit a Dollars 25bn, an increase of Dollars 4.4bn from the
start of the year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DELEGATES to international talks on damage to the earth's ozone layer,
starting in Copenhagen today, are confident they will be able to speed the
phasing out of chemicals that damage the layer.
The fourth meeting of parties to the 1987 Montreal Protocol comes just days
after a UN report warned that thinning of the ozone layer of the atmosphere,
which threatens to increase human skin cancer and damage crop yields, had
been more severe this winter than scientists had expected.
The Montreal Protocol, which agreed to phase out man-made chemicals used in
aerosols, refrigeration and cleaning, has been one of the environmental
successes of the past decade. Its proposals have won strong international
support, partly because of scientific confidence of the link between ozone
depletion and these chemicals and partly because of the availability of
substitutes.
Representatives of 70 countries, who are beginning 10 days of talks, are
expected to back the phasing out of production of four chemicals by 1996
instead of the original deadline of 2000: chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), carbon
tetrachloride, halons and a form of trichloroethane. EC countries have
already agreed to tighter deadlines of ceasing production by 1997.
The proposals have the support of the US, whose car industry is one of the
largest single users of CFCs for air conditioning. Mr William Reilly,
administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), said the
total cost of eliminating CFCs in the US would be Dollars 36bn, and the
additional cost of moving up the phase-out date from 2000 to 1995 would be
Dollars 2bn.
However, it is unclear whether the conference will back additional
'intermediate targets' of cutting production of the chemicals by between 50
and 85 per cent, compared with their pre-protocol levels, by 1994.
The meeting will also attempt to phase out HCFCs and freeze production of
methyl bromide, two chemicals whose threat to the ozone layer has become
clearer since the 1987 agreement.

THE POLITICAL succession in Singapore was thrown into question yesterday
when the government announced that both the island's deputy prime ministers
have cancer.
The two men are Mr Lee Hsien Loong, the son of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's
elder statesman, and Mr Ong Teng Cheong. The younger Mr Lee was widely
expected to succeed Mr Goh Chok Tong as the country's next prime minister.
Mr Goh's office announced after a day of turmoil on the Singapore stock
market that both deputy premiers were suffering from forms of cancer. The
Straits Times Industrial Index fell 32.53 points or 2.25 per cent yesterday
to 1,414.27.
At the weekend Mr Goh said his most urgent task was to find talented
ministers to revitalise his ageing cabinet.
Yesterday's statement said doctors thought the two men had excellent chances
of recovery because their cancers had been diagnosed at an early stage.
There was no immediate suggestion that either of the two would step down.
Singapore has announced an easing of restrictions on a political prisoner
detained without trial for 23 years until his conditional release in 1989,
AP reports from Singapore. Mr Chia Thye Poh, who has been restricted to a
tourist resort island less than a mile away, may live on Singapore from
November 28.

since BA was not acquiring Dan Air's air charter business, it would have

Almost all the European parliament's additions to Community spending plans
for 1993 were rejected last night by EC budget ministers, citing severe
domestic budgetary constraints, writes Lionel Barber in Brussels. The move
points to a budget confrontation between the parliament and the council of
ministers next month, as many MEPs continue to argue that extra spending is
vital to break the deflationary cycle in Europe. The budget ministers
rejected the parliament's proposals that commitments next year to future
spending should rise from Ecu63.91bn (Pounds 52bn) to Ecu70.16bn. Instead,
they sent back a budget which included a meagre 0.2 per cent increase to
Ecu65.86bn.

FRANCE'S annual inflation rate eased to 2.4 per cent last month, from 2.6
per cent in September, according to provisional figures, writes William
Dawkins in Paris. The result places the French inflation rate 1.2 percentage
points below the average of its nine main trading partners. The French rate
has been running below the German rate consistently for 17 months.
A wave of strikes will disrupt France's public transport this week, halting
the Paris Metro at rush hours and disrupting trains and airlines, according
to the unions, Reuter reports. Metro drivers are protesting at changes which
they say will mean longer working hours. The Communist-led CGT union has
called a 24-hour rail strike for Thursday to demand wage rises and protest
against planned job cuts. Pilots and ground staff at Air France are also to
stop work on November 27 in protest at plans to cut 5,000 jobs.

FT  17 NOV 92 / German 'wise men' warn on solidarity pact: Independent
economic advisers say Chancellor Kohl's planned accord with unions and
employers could prove counter-productive

THE GERMAN government's independent economic advisers yesterday warned
Chancellor Helmut Kohl that his planned 'solidarity pact' between
government, trade unions and employers could prove counter-productive in
reviving economic growth.
In a comprehensive and largely gloomy assessment of the challenges facing
the country, the so-called 'five wise men' called for a coherent plan of
budget savings, and severe restraint on wages, as preconditions for economic
recovery.
They denounced the current arguments between the political parties, unions
and employers on a fair distribution of the burden of unification costs to
finance east German recovery, and called instead for total concentration on
how to promote economic growth.
'The danger is looming that the economy will fall into a recession,' they
said. 'Two years after German unification, pessimism is spreading in both
halves of the country.' The coming year would provide the German economy
with its 'first great test,' they added.
Forecasting zero growth in gross national product for 1993, but some
recovery in the second half of the year, the five leading economists also
warned that Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, was still being
over-optimistic in his budget revenue forecasts. They predicted a growing
public sector deficit for the next four years, instead of the gradual
reduction forecast by the Finance Ministry.
The proposal likely to attract the greatest attention in Germany is a plan
for a 7 per cent tax surcharge, to be levied on all income and corporate
tax-payers, to provide DM25bn in subsidies for employment measures in east
Germany.
The surcharge, to be gradually run down over five years as the eastern
economy recovers, would be a fairer way of paying for the subsidies than the
existing 2 per cent levy on unemployment insurance contributions, the wise
men argue. Only registered employers pay the latter, thus excluding all
public sector employees and the self-employed.
Their report brought immediate but predictable calls from the Social
Democrat opposition for Mr Waigel to resign. The report was widely welcomed
by German industry, but criticised by the unions for its stress on wage
restraint.
Its criticism of the planned 'solidarity pact' comes at an embarrassing
moment for Mr Kohl, who hopes to agree a deal by the end of the year, and
yesterday had important talks with civil service union leaders.
The wise men warned that such an ambition could arouse excessive
expectations from the public, and failure of the talks would have a far more
negative effect than it should.
'The danger lies in the spectacular character of a solidarity pact,' they
said. 'The more the importance of the pact is stressed in public, the
greater will be the expectations, and all the worse will be the
disappointment if it finally fails.'
It was far more important that the government should independently draw up a
coherent savings plan, and the unions recognise the need for wage restraint.
Only then would the Bundesbank be given the room for manoeuvre to lower its
interest rates, and thereby open the way for economic recovery.
'The steady reduction of net borrowing is imperative, if the danger of
destabilisation through growing public sector debt is to be avoided,' they
said. 'The task is urgent: it is to rebuild public confidence in the
solidity of the state finances through a credible savings strategy.'
While forecasting a higher Bundesbank money supply target for 1993 - with a
central goal of 6.5 per cent growth in the broad M3 measure of money supply
 -the wise men warned: 'As desirable as a clear interest rate cut might be
in the present economic situation, it can only happen if reliable indicators
show that inflation is slowing down.'
Ironically, the report - forecasting a slower inflation rate of some 3.5 per
cent next year - came out on the same day that new figures showed a fifth
successive monthly decline in wholesale prices. The federal statistics
office reported a 0.1 per cent decline in October, and a 1.6 per cent drop
year-on-year against October, 1991.
The report suggests that Mr Waigel's forecast of a reduced public sector
deficit, falling from DM120bn (Pounds 49.5bn) this year to DM66bn (Pounds
27.2bn) by 1996, is over-optimistic, based on an unlikely 6 per cent nominal
growth rate of GNP. Instead, with GNP growth rates rising gradually from 3.5
to 5 per cent by 1996, the deficit will increase from DM120bn to DM136bn in
that time, they say.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Amato gets pat on back from IMF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government's credibility will hinge on the speed and
transparency of privatisation, and its removal from political influences,
according to the preliminary conclusions of the International Monetary
Fund's annual mission.
The report, handed over yesterday, was released by Mr Giuliano Amato's
government to strengthen its hand in what promises to be a serious
confrontation in parliament over privatisation.
The government's programme, which would radically reduce the state's
two-thirds control of the banking system and eventually wind up IRI, the
largest state holding company, was sent to parliament at the weekend.
Parliament now has 15 days to pass judgment on a programme that seeks to
raise L27,000bn (Pounds 13.12bn) for the Treasury and half as much again for
recapitalising the IRI companies and lowering their debts.
The IMF report is cautiously encouraging about the government's 1992/3
fiscal packages, noting that there is 'a very different climate' compared
with 'the sense of deja vu' last year. It says the quality and credibility
of the adjustment process just initiated 'will be greatly enhanced by
privatisation'.
Success will depend 'on the speed with which privatisation is begun, the
transparency of criteria and procedures, and the effective depoliticisation
of the process.' The seriousness of the government will be judged by its
willingness to take unpopular decisons, including liquidating companies.
The IMF says pointedly: 'Italy is now paying the price not only of past
excessive borrowing but also of repeated failures to live up to its
promises. . . . this government appears to be prepared to make a break with
the past and, if action is sustained, it will be rewarded.'
Fears about company closures and job losses in the privatisation process
yesterday provoked a warning from the three main union confederations. It
said the unions accepted privatisation as inevitable but there was the risk
of creating 'disastrous' unemployment without a clear industrial strategy.
Union officials said 150,000 jobs were at risk.
In contrast, Confindustria, the industrialists' grouping, warmly endorsed
the privatisation programme while insisting the scope could still be much
broader.
The Milan stock exchange index rose more than 2 per cent, with sentiment
encouraged by privatisation prospects. Goverment officials said they were
concerned about excessive speculation in the run-up to privatisation and
this was one of the reasons why names of specific companies to be sold off
had not always been included in the programme submitted to parliament.
Both Mr Amato, prime minister, and Mr Piero Barucci, treasuary minister,
said yesterday they hoped privatisation would stimulate the bourse, allowing
wider ownership and the proper development of pensions funds.
Mr Amato said a combination of divestments by IRI and ENI, the state oil
concern, plus the shake-up in banking, should create a more modern corporate
structure in Italy. Instead of the long-standing four large private groups
and two big state holdings dominating the economy, he believed 14 or 15
largely Italian groups could evolve.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Macedonia's Albanians fear ethnic bloodbath
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ETHNIC divisions have deepened in Macedonia, threatening to shatter the
fragile coexistence between Macedonians and ethnic Albanians as the former
Yugoslav republic waits in limbo for international recognition.
Leaders of Macedonia's Albanians, who comprise about one-third of the 2m
population, fear a violent conflict in the southern republic following riots
this month.
Serious unrest in Macedonia, in the heart of the Balkans, could trigger
intervention by some or all of its neighbours, Serbia, Albania, Greece and
Bulgaria. Greece has blocked international recognition on the grounds that
the name Macedonia is Hellenic property. But Mr Sami Ibrahimi,
vice-president of the Party for Democratic Prosperity, the biggest Albanian
party, says the controversy surrounding the name Macedonia is 'a very small
problem compared to the inter-ethnic problems here'.
Mr Muhamed Halili, a deputy in the Macedonian parliament, says Albanians are
now debating whether to continue to participate in official institutions
after four people were shot to death by police in the riots on November 6.
Ethnic Albanians went on the rampage in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia,
when rumours swept the city that a 14-year-old Albanian cigarette seller had
been beaten to death by the police.
Ironically, Albanian leaders claim police incited the unrest in Bit-pazar,
Skopje's oriental market which has become a centre of the black market, in
order to hasten international recognition. 'They are trying to show Europe
and the world that there could be more trouble and problems if Macedonia is
not recognised,' says Mr Ibrahimi. The Albanians have four cabinet ministers
in the government. Although a minority, they are better integrated into
Macedonia than the majority Albanian population in neighbouring Kosovo, the
southern Serbian province.
But the events of November 6 appear to have been a watershed. 'Albanians are
now faced with a choice whether to stand behind the people or the
government,' says Mr Saso Ordanovski, an independent journalist in Skopje.
He says the police may have used excessive force in suppressing the riots,
but fears that Albanian extremists are using the incident in order to force
Albanian leaders to pull out of the ruling coalition.
Mr Ljubomir Frckovski, the interior minister who has ordered an
investigation into the riots, says: 'Albanians and Macedonians share a
collective memory of living together without ethnic conflict.' But he fears
the 'imported influence' from Serbia and Albanians abroad could destabilise
Macedonia.
'The behaviour of the police can lead to violent conflicts in Macedonia
which will be a real catastrophe even compared to the Bosnian war,' says Mr
Ibrahimi.
'I am certain that the neighbouring countries would be involved - even
Turkey and Hungary - the third world war could start right here,' he says.
For the time being Macedonian and Albanian politicians are calling for a
dialogue in order to find a solution. Mr Ibrahimi says that if this fails,
'Macedonia will disappear and become a piece of cake for the neighbouring
countries'.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Ex-communists in Lithuania win a majority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   VILNIUS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER communists yesterday swept to power in Lithuania, the largest of the
three Baltic states, with an absolute majority in the 141-member parliament.
With the last results of the second round of voting still being counted, the
most conservative estimate gave 73 seats to the Democratic Labour party
(DLP), successor to the Lithuanian branch of the Soviet Communist party.
This would allow it an overall majority without relying on any of the small
centre parties.
Mr Algirdas Brazauskas, the DLP leader and former first secretary of the
Lithuanian CP, said he would form a 'technocratic' cabinet with members
drawn from a variety of parties or from outside the political world, and he
pledged to continue pro-market reforms.
'Those who have written in the Lithuanian and foreign press that the
communists are returning here do not know what has happened in our party. We
are a social democratic party with only 5 per cent of our members from the
communist period,' he said.
However, Mr Brazauskas said he would 'seek to moderate' the programme agreed
between the International Monetary Fund and the outgoing nationalist
government of Mr Vytautas Landbergis. 'We think the IMF was not properly
informed of the economic situation here, of how bad it is. We don't want to
change the principles, but we want to try to make the transition to the
market easier.' He said he would seek better relations with Russia, but
stressed that Russian troops - estimated to number about 20,000 - must
withdraw next year as scheduled.
Mr Landsbergis grudgingly conceded defeat and said he hoped the communists
had changed. His Sajudis movement won only about 26 seats.
Election observers in Vilnius voiced concern that the parliamentary
commission investigating links between deputies and the former Soviet KGB
had announced that the new parliament could not sit until it had screened
all deputies. Mr Jens Thoft, from Denmark, leader of the EC delegation, said
that 'this possibly indefinite delay is not what we expect in a democratic
election'.
Professor Bronius Genzales, a DLP deputy and a member of the commission,
said the statement had been made only by individual members, not the
commission itself.

RUSSIA will begin auctioning off shares in state-owned enterprises not this
month but next, starting with the sale of 40 per cent of the stock of a
producer of transistor radios and television sets.
Mr Dmitry Vasiliev, deputy chairman of the Committee for Managing State
Property, said that legislation requiring notice of between two weeks and
one month for share auctions made it impossible to hold trial auctions in
November as planned. The first auction of shares will be held on December
15, using Elex, a radio producer based in Vladimir outside Moscow, as a
guinea pig. Elex, which has already sold 60 per cent of its shares to its
managers and 7,000 workers, says it is profitable and would like to attract
foreign investors.
The authorities claim only 10-20 per cent of state-owned enterprises are
potentially bankrupt, as opposed to bigger figures quoted by the opponents
of mass privatisation.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Bulgaria attempts to bridge credibility gap: The country's
new government will have to reassure the west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH and THEODOR TROEV
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE weeks after his resignation triggered the collapse of Bulgaria's first
post-communist government, Mr Philip Dimitrov, the outgoing prime minister,
has been asked by President Zhelyu Zhelev to try to form another government.
A rapid end to the government crisis now seems likely, an outcome which
would be much welcomed by the western banks and institutions for whom the
crisis meant unwanted delays for Bulgarian plans to re-negotiate its Dollars
12bn (Pounds 7.9bn) foreign debt, arrange a new loan from the International
Monetary fund and sign an association agreement with the European Community.
Mr Dimitrov, leader of the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), the country's
leading political movement, is trying to form a new coalition, including the
party representing ethnic Turks. One of its main aims will be to reassure
Bulgarians and western financial institutions that reform is still on track.
Mr Ivan Kostov, the finance minister, returned from Frankfurt earlier this
month with the news that debt rescheduling talks with the 300 commercial
banks, which hold more than 80 per cent of the country's debt, had
progressed in spite of western concern over the political situation.
For Mr Kostov's team, the political crisis came at a sensitive time. The
former socialist government which succeeded communist dictator Todor Zhivkov
had broken previous commitments by declaring a debt moratorium in March
1990. But in September, Bulgaria resumed partial repayment of interest on
its debt, hoping to re-open a dialogue with the country's creditors.
Bulgaria also hoped to sign its first three-year extended agreement with the
IMF next month, following two standby arrangements. Progress on both fronts
depends largely on the formation of a credible government in Sofia.
Hopes remain high because, with IMF and World Bank support, Bulgaria has
already implemented successful monetary reforms. Inflation has dropped from
more than 400 per cent in 1991 to 61 per cent so far this year.
Before the present crisis, the leva, the national currency, had stabilised
while the central bank's base rate has dropped from over 60 per cent to 41
per cent in the past six months. Foreign reserves have risen from virtually
zero to around Dollars 1bn.
An IMF agreement and resolution of the debt problem are crucial for further
progress. The country needs foreign financing to undertake structural
reforms and privatisation. Industry, which is still more than 90 per cent
state-owned, has registered a 60 per cent drop in output since 1989, while
the country lacks an infrastructure capable of servicing a market economy.
So far Bulgaria, a small Balkan country of 8.5m, has attracted little
foreign investment and no significant inflow of private capital is expected
until the country repairs its relationship with western financiers.
The UDF's main political rivals, the Socialist (reformed communist) party,
and the Movement for Rights and Freedom (MRF), the ethnic Turk party, do not
question the need for reform.
But they criticise the UDF, the country's first non-communist rulers in 45
years, for what they perceive as a haphazard approach to structural reform.
They believe that one year of UDF rule produced few positive results but
many social costs, notably unemployment, which affects over 12 per cent of
the workforce and is still rising.
The MRF, which represents the country's 1m ethnic Turks, the country's
poorest social group, cited social concerns for withdrawing its support from
the last government.
The MRF has only 10 per cent of the seats in parliament but holds the
balance between the UDF and the Socialist party, which are almost evenly
matched.
The two parties also criticise the UDF for its confrontational style. The
UDF's anti-communism has led it to attack the old power elite, but, in some
cases, the party has appointed supporters to key positions with scant regard
for professional ability.
In addition, the UDF has not communicated its policies clearly enough,
leading the UDF into conflict with many of its original backers within the
trade unions, the church, the fledgling private sector and even Bulgaria's
president, Mr Zhelev.
'The former government had coherent strategies but the country did not
always know about them,' says Mr John Wilton, the World Bank's resident
representative.
Mr Zhelev, a former dissident, says: 'The UDF made political mistakes which
led it into conflict with civil society. Rather than rallying the country's
resources, it repulsed them.' In spite of these shortcomings, however, the
UDF is expected to form a new government with the ethnic Turks, largely
because the Socialists are unwilling to take over. The party has purged
itself and supports market-led reform, but says it does not have enough
support in the country to govern.
At the same time, no group wants fresh elections, believing that another
political shake-up would only delay reform against the popular will.
'Dissatisfaction in the country is not caused by reform but by reform being
carried out too slowly,' says the president.
Mr Zhelev believes the way out of Bulgaria's current difficulties is for the
UDF to adopt a policy of 'national reconciliation'.
He stresses the importance of internal unity, given the war in the
neighbouring former Yugoslav republics and fears that Bulgaria will be drawn
into the conflict.
The Bulgarian business community believes that the country's proximity to
the fighting has already been enough to deter some potential investors.
There are also fears in Sofia that any prolongation of the current political
problems would be a further blow to the country's credibility.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Jobs fear as British Steel omits dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH STEEL warned yester-day that it might have to make further job cuts
unless the European Commission supported an orderly restructuring of the
European steel industry and curbed allegedly unfair imports from eastern
Europe.
The warning came as the privatised steelmaker announced a Pounds 51m pre-tax
loss for the six months to October 3, compared with a Pounds 19m profit a
year ago. British Steel's shares fell 3p to equal an all-time low of 46 1/2
p, as the company became the first privatisation stock to omit its interim
dividend.
British Steel has already reduced its UK workforce by 20 per cent to 41,800
over the past two years, and the total will fall further to just over 40,000
by the end of the current financial year.
But yesterday Mr Brian Moffat, chief executive, said that if the European
Commission failed to uphold its principles of a 'level playing field' in the
European market, efficient private sector companies such as British Steel
would have 'no other course but to further retract'.
British Steel is one of 15 big European steelmakers which last month urged
the Commission to agree a programme of political, commercial and financial
assistance for the recession-torn industry, which has seen prices fall by 30
per cent since 1989.
British Steel says the overriding requirements are to ensure that
restructuring and capacity reductions are driven by market demand and not
impeded by the introduction of state aids, and that the dumping of steel
into Europe is avoided through 'robust and effective' anti-dumping
mechanisms.
The comments from British Steel's executives come a week before a meeting of
EC industry ministers which will discuss the proposals, along with
controversial plans by the state-controlled Spanish steel industry to
replace a plant at Sestao in northern Spain with a mini-mill. Mr Moffat said
this would still be less efficient than British Steel's former Ravenscraig
plant.
British Steel has complained to the Department of Trade and Industry about
imports of Czech steel, and wants similar action to that taken by France and
Germany, which have pegged east European imports to about 20 per cent above
1991 levels.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Curb on executive pay awards urged by prime minister: Major
calls for boardroom rises to follow lead set by government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night urged business leaders to restrain boardroom pay
awards as he pledged that a commitment to build up Britain's manufacturing
base was now central to the government's revamped economic strategy.
In his annual speech to the Lord Mayor's Banquet at Guildhall, the prime
minister said that last week's Autumn Statement had demonstrated that a
'commitment to industry is right at the heart of our policies'.
But he warned also that government would not allow the gains provided by the
pound's devaluation to be frittered away in higher inflation.
The government, Mr Major said, had set an example by restricting public
sector pay awards to a maximum of 1.5 per cent.
While acknowledging that it could not dictate the level of awards in the
private sector, he said: 'It would be wrong of me not to use this gathering
tonight to say very frankly that costs must be controlled everywhere, not
just on the shop floor but in the boardroom too. We have set a lead in the
public sector. I hope we will see that mirrored in the private sector.'
His speech came as Mr Norman Lamont told MPs last week's special measures to
help the economy, combined with recent falls in interest rates and sterling,
would be 'good for jobs, employment and growth'. The chancellor, however,
also gave a clear hint to the all-party Commons Treasury and civil service
committee that the government might have to raise taxes if its borrowing
needs did not decline with economic recovery.
'If as the economy recovers, it emerges that we have an underlying deficit,
that is something that we will have to address,' he said.
Their comments coincided also with a new report from the Confederation of
British Industry suggesting that a modest improvement in retail sales
petered out last month, as uncertainty about the economy continued to hit
consumer confidence.
Mr Major used what is traditionally the occasion for a broad-ranging review
of the domestic and overseas scene to underline again his determination to
push for a speedy agreement in the Uruguay Round of trade talks at the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
In what Downing Street confirmed was an implicit sideswipe at the French
government, he warned that the deteriorating world economic outlook meant
that Europe had to resist a 'dangerously strong' instinct 'to look inwards,
put up the shutters and slam the door on the free trade that has brought
prosperity to the postwar world'.
In an assessment of the domestic economic outlook which reflected the
government's determination to 'talk up' the confidence of industry and
consumers, Mr Major said that cuts in interest rates since 1990 had saved
industry Pounds 10bn.
In parallel, sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism
had left an exchange rate which was 'fiercely competitive', providing
companies with an edge over overseas rivals in domestic and foreign markets.
The government had further bolstered those advantages by increasing tax
incentives for investment, reducing the tax burden on the motor industry and
allowing for much greater private sector participation in infrastructure
projects.
Stressing the focus on help for manufacturing, he said: 'I do not regard
manufacturing industry as a marginal add-on optional extra - it is
fundamental to our future prosperity.'
Mr Major - who said that he was 'sick and tired' of hearing people 'talk
down' Britain's achievements - added it was now up to business to capitalise
on the advantages.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Scope of probe into arms for Iraq is widened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, DAVID OWEN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government last night announced wide-ranging terms of reference for the
judicial inquiry into Britain's defence trade with Iraq. But as Mr John
Major set out to quash claims of a cover-up, it emerged that senior
ministers had been preparing to relax the arms trade restrictions just two
weeks before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
The prime minister said Lord Justice Scott's inquiry would not be restricted
to Matrix Churchill and would be free to delve into related issues such as
the Supergun affair. He emphasised it would be free to focus not just on
'arms questions', but on 'decisions taken on the prosecution of companies
and on public interest immunity'.
'All ministers who are called will give evidence,' Mr Major said. In
addition, civil servants would be instructed to co-operate and all papers
called for would be made available. Lord Justice Scott, who was appointed
last week to head the inquiry, would be free to decide on the publication of
his report and of evidence taken from witnesses.
But the government is likely to face fresh questions over Matrix Churchill
following confirmation by senior Whitehall officials last night that
ministers agreed just two weeks before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait to relax
restrictions on defence-related sales to Baghdad.
The decision, taken at a meeting on July 19 1990 chaired by Mr Douglas Hurd,
the foreign secretary, was not implemented because it was overtaken by the
outbreak of hostilities on August 2. The agreement was subject to the
approval of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the then prime minister, and would have
been announced to parliament.
The ministerial meeting was the culmination of more than two years of
Whitehall battles over guidelines set out in 1985 by the then foreign
secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, to prevent Britain from arming either side in
the Iran-Iraq war.
It was called at the request of the Department of Trade and Industry, the
government department which consistently backed the sale of Matrix Churchill
machine tools to Iraq even after it was shown they were used for military
purposes.
The officials said that the ministers at the July 19 meeting - representing
the cabinet's overseas and defence committee - agreed that the rules should
be relaxed to take account of the peace accord between Iran and Iraq.
Downing Street has refused to divulge the names of the other ministers
present at the talks, but said that Mr John Major, then chancellor, did not
attend.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, yesterday launched a
fresh series of allegations about the extent of the prime minister's
knowledge during his time as foreign secretary and chancellor.
Mr Cook supported his claims with documents from the Matrix Churchill trial,
but failed to provide more than circumstantial evidence linking Mr Major to
the events outlined in the documents. Downing Street emphasised that Mr
Major had been concerned to make the terms of reference for the inquiry as
wide as possible, but said it was still open to Lord Justice Scott to seek
to extend them further.
Opposition MPs dubbed the terms of reference 'unsatisfactory' and complained
that the powers of the judge to enforce witnesses to attend were
insufficient. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said the inquiry would not
look at whether ministers misled parliament, or require evidence to be given
on oath or in public. Nor would it have powers to force former ministers to
co-operate.
Earlier, Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney general, indicated in the Commons that
current or former ministers could expect to be prosecuted if evidence that
they had committed criminal offences came to light.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Pressure grows for lenders to pass on rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, PETER NORMAN, and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S banks and building societies were under pressure last night from
the government to help revive the economy by passing on the whole of last
week's base rate cut to mortgage holders and small businesses.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said he would ask the Bank of England to
examine allegations that banks were not fully passing on rate cuts to
customers. He was speaking after pressing building societies to cut mortgage
rates further at a meeting yesterday morning.
The chancellor told the Commons Treasury and civil service committee
yesterday he would also ask the chairmen of the clearing banks about their
policy after the number of complaints about high bank interest rates had
increased in recent weeks.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, last night joined the effort designed to
put pressure on the banks to reduce business lending rates by emphasising
the 'huge' potential boost to industry these would provide.
Speaking at the Lord Mayor's banquet, Mr Major said the base rate cut would
remove Pounds 1bn from industry's costs. But he added: 'Provided it is
passed on to borrowers, to small businesses as well as large, as I trust it
will be.'
Barclays and National Westminster, the two largest lenders to small
businesses, conceded that the margin between the base rate and the average
lending rate they charge small businesses had risen over the past 18 months.
The banks say the higher rates reflect the increased risk of lending in the
recession.
Lord Alexander, National Westminster Bank chairman, last night responded to
the criticism. He said the bank had passed on to business customers the full
benefits of the base rate cuts immediately, as it had said it would do last
week.
Mr Mark Boleat, director general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said
building societies had to widen margins to respond to growing levels of bad
debt in the housing market.
Nevertheless, Mr Lamont's intervention is likely to renew strains between
banks and the government over lending policy.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, criticised bank lending policy.
He said the government should publish a table of rates charged by banks, and
warn them that they could face an inquiry if they did not cut rates.
The Halifax Building Society yesterday announced it was cutting its basic
mortgage rate by 0.74 of a percentage point to 8.55 per cent.
The new rate will take effect for its existing 1.8m borrowers from January
1.

FT  17 NOV 92 / British Steel says more jobs may go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH STEEL warned yesterday that it might have to make further job cuts
unless the European Commission supported an orderly restructuring of the
European steel industry and curbed allegedly unfair imports from eastern
Europe.
The warning came as the privatised steelmaker announced a Pounds 51m pre-tax
loss for the six months to October 3, compared with a Pounds 19m profit a
year ago. British Steel's shares fell 3p to equal an all-time low of 46 1/2
p, as the company became the first privatisation stock to omit its interim
dividend.
British Steel has already reduced its UK workforce by 20 per cent to 41,800
over the past two years, and the total will fall further to just over 40,000
by the end of the current financial year.
But yesterday Mr Brian Moffat, chief executive, said that if the European
Commission failed to uphold its principles of a 'level playing field' in the
European market, efficient private sector companies such as British Steel
would have 'no other course but to further retract'.
British Steel is one of 15 big European steelmakers which last month urged
the Commission to agree a programme of political, commercial and financial
assistance for the recession-torn industry, which has seen prices fall by 30
per cent since 1989.
British Steel says the over-riding requirements are to ensure that
restructuring and capacity reductions are driven by market demand and not
impeded by the introduction of state aids, and that the dumping of steel
into Europe is avoided through 'robust and effective' anti-dumping
mechanisms. 'Effective early action on these two issues is critical to the
industry's future, and to that of British Steel,' said Sir Alistair Frame,
chairman.
The comments from British Steel's executives come a week before a meeting of
EC industry ministers which will discuss the proposals, along with
controversial plans by the state-controlled Spanish steel industry to
replace a plant at Sestao in northern Spain with a minimill. Mr Moffat said
this would still be less efficient than British Steel's former Ravenscraig
plant in Scotland.
British Steel has complained to the Department of Trade and Industry about

Germany, which have pegged east European imports to about 20 per cent above
1991 levels.

FT  17 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Apprehension as season starts - Michael
Smith details the dilemma facing electricity companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ANY other industry it would be a cause for celebration. Britain's
electricity companies, however, view with apprehension the start today of a
results season that will see all of them declare healthy profits - most
substantially higher than last year.
'Unless we declare no increases in profits and say we are reducing the
salaries of our chairmen, we are bound to get flack,' reflects the financial
director of one of England and Wales's 12 regional electricity companies.
In the two years since privatisation, the sector has weathered attacks over
the size of profits seen by critics as the product of feather-bedding
introduced by the government to make the companies' shares attractive.
The interim results to be declared by the two generators, the two Scottish
companies and the 12 regional electricity companies (RECs) in England and
Wales over the next month will be closely scrutinised because of the
government's energy policy review.
The RECs are vulnerable to attack because of their role in the so-called
'dash for gas'. This has seen some join ventures that will lessen the need
for coal-fired generation, contributing to British Coal's decision, now
under review, to close 31 pits and shed 30,000 jobs.
Although these results will tell us nothing about the economic viability of
gas-fired power stations, the RECs will come under strong pressure at
results meetings to justify their claims that customers will not suffer.
High profits would increase the suspicion that companies are too heavily
biased towards serving the interests of their shareholders rather than
customers.
Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, has launched a
long-term review of industry pricing, and the latest results could affect
his thinking.
The industry can at least comfort itself with the likelihood that pre-tax
profits will have risen less steeply than they did for the first
post-privatisation full-year results six months ago.
The RECs then recorded an average rise of more than 50 per cent. A figure
closer to 20 per cent is likely this time, still leaving room for critics'
attacks.
The profit out-turns, however, will have only limited value.
Electricity use is highly seasonal and some companies first-half profits
will be less than a tenth of the yearly out-turn. In addition, the
post-privatisation restructuring of the industry and the recession leave
plenty of scope for companies to make exceptional provisions and thus reduce
the headline profit total.
Political pressure may also affect some companies' dividend decisions. High
increases run the risk of antagonising politicians and the electricity
regulator at a time when critical decisions are being made about the
industry's future. Dividend cover is high and most companies are likely to
reason that abandoning the policy of strong dividend growth, albeit
temporarily, would lead to a loss of shareholder loyalty.
Most analysts expect National Power, PowerGen and the Scottish companies to
increase dividends by 10 per cent or more, and the RECs by an average of
about 12 per cent.
National Power starts off the season today with expectations of between
Pounds 209m and Pounds 236m at the pre-tax level, against Pounds 202m last
time. PowerGen will show a less impressive headline growth tomorrow -
analysts expect Pounds 100m against last year's Pounds 97m - largely because
of accounting procedures leading to a heavier proportion of profits being
reported in the second half.
With the generators' income and costs relatively easy to predict because of
long-term contracts with British Coal and the RECs, the City will focus on
what progress the companies are making with cost cutting, in particular
staffing reductions.
Profit growth is also assured for the RECs. They enjoy inflation-plus
pricing formulae, cost reductions through rationalisation and the likely
rise in distribution business which provides more than 80 per cent of
profits.
Volume growth is likely to have continued, perhaps by about 1 per cent.
Demand is high despite the recession; householders are reluctant to cut back
on heating and ventilation while the cuts in industry have been partially
offset by retailers staying open longer. The recession may have taken a
higher toll on some non-core activities, including retailing which made
profits for only two RECs last year.
In the long term, however, these are sideshows for most companies compared
with the potential profits or losses that will accrue from the combined
cycle gas turbine power stations most of the RECs are building.
Should Prof Littlechild find next month that electricity from some of the
proposed stations is likely to cost consumers more than their coal-fired
equivalents, company shares will take a far bigger hit than anything which
is likely to come out of the interim results.

FT  17 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Denmark and Italy help tip the balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN and arbitrage selling hit Japanese equities last week, as investors
who had bought stocks in the Nikkei rally last September decided to lighten
their positions.
Experience was mixed in the US, with strength in second-line stocks
outweighing a flat week for senior blue chips, and it was left to Europe, up
1.0 per cent, to tip the FT- Actuaries World Index into an even more modest
0.1 per cent gain on the week.
A strong dollar, interest rate cuts in France and Italy and what optimists
hoped was the start of a pre-Christmas rally in Germany, put Europe into the
black. The outstanding performers were Denmark and Italy, although Germany's
3.6 per cent gain was important in terms of sheer weight.
Denmark, too, was an interest rate story. Until last week, when Japan took
over again, it had had the uneasy distinction of being the worst performer
in the FT-Actuaries World Indices this year, undermined by rising interest
rates in Europe in the spring, the increasing interest-rate differential to
Germany after the June 2 Maastricht referendum and, thereafter, its own
version of the 1992 disaster in the Nordic financial sector.
Last week it galloped up 9 per cent on Tuesday's repo rate cut by the
central bank. Unibank Securities thinks that there is potential for at least
another 15 per cent increase in Danish equities over the next 12 months with
interest rates coming down further and market psychology improving.
Italy's gain was the more impressive as it came in steadily rising volume,
which registered a heavy L408bn last Friday.
Pastorino &amp; Partners says that, in the excitement surrounding the country's
privatisation programme, the announcement by Iri that it will sell its
entire stake in Credito Italiano has attracted the interest of foreign
investors, to a limited extent, and of small savers - 'both longstanding
absentees from the market'.

FT  17 NOV 92 / KGF buys Nabisco cold cereal business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KRAFT General Foods, the core US food division of Philip Morris, has stepped
in as the purchaser of RJR Nabisco's cold cereal business, which takes in
the Shredded Wheat and Shreddies brand names.
Like the previous potential acquirer of the cereal operations, General
Mills, the huge tobacco and food group has agreed to pay Dollars 450m in
cash for the business, with some international trademarks.
The manufacturing facilities to be acquired will include plants in
Naperville, Illinois, and Niagara Falls, Ontario, although Nabisco will keep
a plant in Niagara Falls, New York, to manufacture snack biscuits.
Commenting on the purchase, which is still subject to regulatory review in
the US and Canada, Philip Morris said that it intended to incorporate the
Nabisco cereal lines into its existing Post line of breakfast cereals, and
would market both through the Kraft sales and distribution networks.
Mr Richard Mayers, head of Kraft General Foods, claimed that the
'ready-to-eat' cereal category offered 'great potential for expanded growth
and operating income'.
Philip Morris's existing cereal lines include Honey Bunches, Grape-Nuts,
Pebbles and Marshmallow Alpha-Bits.
According to the tobacco and food group, its Post cereal lines have around
11.5 per cent of the US cold cereals market at present, while the Nabisco
products are estimated to have around 3 per cent - a figure which has
declined from more than 5 per cent four years ago.
Nabisco had originally planned to sell the cold cereals business to General
Mills. This deal was announced in early September. However, it was aborted
in November when it become clear that a 'lengthy and prolonged review' by
federal anti-trust authorities was likely.
Speculation that another buyer would be sought immediately surfaced - with
Philip Morris touted as one of the favourite replacement buyers. Although
yesterday's deal between Philip Morris and Nabisco is subject to regulatory
review, it seems less likely to provoke problems. The combined shares of the
US market would be under 15 per cent, on Philip Morris's figures. There are
two bigger groups in the sector - Kellogg and General Mills.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Trade imbalance strains Mercosur pact: The motives behind
Argentina's tax on Brazilian imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S economic and political problems, coupled with Argentina's trade
deficit, are straining the foundations of the Mercosur trade agreement.
Under the 1991 treaty creating Mercosur, the trade bloc linking Argentina,
Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, trade barriers must fall by the end of 1994.
But in October, alarmed by the growth of Brazilian imports, Argentina
trebled to 10 per cent a tax on nearly all imports. The tax was targeted at
imports from Brazil, which were rising by between 5 and 6 per cent a month.
Argentina forecasts a trade deficit of Dollars 1.2bn-Dollars 1.4bn this
year, its first since 1981, and blames most of the troubles on artificially
cheap Brazilian goods.
Under the Mercosur treaty, tariffs should fall by 7 percentage points every
six months until they disappear by 1995. Argentina insists its tax does not
count as a tariff and thus can be applied to imports from Mercosur
countries. Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, insists that
the tax is only a temporary measure.
However, his claim that Brazilian imports constituted an 'external shock'
sound disingenuous. Although Brazilian imports have almost doubled from
Dollars 1.52bn in 1991, Argentina's exports to Brazil remain largely
unchanged from Dollars 1.49bn last year. The resulting deficit is equivalent
to less than one percentage point of GDP.
Furthermore, half the deficit is due to car imports. Under bilateral
protocols, trade in cars should be balanced. But Argentina's three
manufacturers cannot meet strong local demand, let alone extra cars for the
Brazilian market.
It is true that recession-bound Brazilian companies are selling at almost
any price. But Argentina's overheated economy and overvalued exchange rate
are sucking in imports from all over the world. An Argentine foreign
ministry official pointed out: 'Argentina's trade deficit with the US this
year will be about Dollars 1.3bn - roughly the same as with Brazil, but
nobody is getting upset about imports from the US. In fact, imports from
Brazil began slowing in August and September.'
Privately, officials say they had to take action to avoid domestic political
fall-out over the deficit, hinting that discrimination against Brazil was an
obvious solution.
Still, Argentine companies say the Brazilians have already absorbed the
effect of the 10 per cent import tax and imports are growing unabated. Those
trying to export to Brazil complain that inflation of over 25 per cent a
month makes it difficult to price their goods.
The spirit of the Mercosur treaty encourages countries to both expand and
balance trade. Brazil's foreign minister, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, has
promised to increase purchases of oil, wheat and flour, Argentina's main
export products, to reduce the gap.
Bickering over trade is a sideshow compared to more serious objections to
Mercosur. Many Argentines say they should not have to wait, possibly for
years, for Brazil to stabilise and should seek trade alliances elsewhere.
Furthermore, opponents argue that integration between inherently unstable
developing countries is conceptually flawed, and suggest Argentina should
join the North American Free Trade Agreement as quickly as possible.
Perhaps the most convincing objection is that Brazil's crises could
destabilise Argentina's fragile economy. Mr Cavallo says he has not lost his
'political enthusiasm' for integration, but has warned that he will only
wait another year before deciding what action to take over Mercosur.
However, supporters of integration say it is wrong to sacrifice Mercosur -
which is also a political and strategic alliance between former rivals -
because of short term trade difficulties.
Mr Felix Pena, a former Argentine Mercosur negotiator, accepts that Brazil's
problems may prompt a review of the timetable. But he says Argentina cannot
ignore Brazil's market of 150m potential consumers or forgo access to a
resilient economy that has historically grown very fast.
In fact, Mr Pena, believes that once Brazil returns to growth, Argentina
will not be able to satisfy Brazilian demand for food and agricultural
products.
Furthermore, it would be difficult to undo the links between companies which
have been multiplying rapidly in sectors ranging from beer to insurance and
services. Last month, Argentina sold Somisa, a state-owned steel mill to a
consortium including two Brazilian companies. And without access to Brazil,
many multinationals would either close affiliates in Argentina or freeze
expansion. The Brazilian connection is vital for several proposed
infrastructure projects. These include a Dollars 8bn gas pipeline linking
Argentina and Brazil, which could be vital to develop Argentina's huge
natural gas reserves.
A Argentine steel executive summed up the spirit of Mercosur: 'You can count
on the fingers of one hand the days when Brazil and Argentina have
stabilised simultaneously. That's how we trade - one day we export to them
and one day they export to us."

India's Supreme Court yesterday upheld a federal order reserving government
jobs for low-caste Hindus, a decree that had prompted dozens of high-caste
students to commit suicide in protest, AP reports from new Delhi.
The court was ruling on appeals against the August 1990 decision by former
Prime Minister VP Singh to hold 27 per cent of jobs for the low-caste. The
present government of Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao, which came to power
in June 1991, endorsed Singh's policy. However, action was halted while the
Supreme Court weighed arguments that the quota was unconstitutional.
Another 22.5 per cent of government jobs previously were set aside for
untouchables.
In a separate order, the nine-judge court asked the government not to
increase the total job quotas beyond 50 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE leader of Italy's Republican Party, Mr Giorgio La Malfa, has emerged
considerably strengthened from his party's 38th congress which concluded at
the weekend.
The final vote gave near unanimous support for Mr La Malfa's attempt to make
his small party the central element in a new realigment of the country's
political groupings pressing for institutional and electoral reform.
None of those who questioned his presidential style of leadership -
including Mr Bruno Visentini, the party's elder statesman and former
minister - have been retained on the Republicans' 185-strong national
council.
Critics have been excluded and 91 new, and mostly young, people have been
brought in, among them 27 women.
The Republicans won just under 5 per cent of the vote in the general
elections last April. Although this was a modest improvement on their
performance in 1987, Mr La Malfa had hoped for broader electoral support for
a party which stood in opposition to a renewal of the four-party government
coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Liberals and Social Democrats.
The Republicans continue to suffer from their public image of a minority
party appealing to an intellectual elite. They hope to broaden their appeal
by establishing themselves as reformers.

FT  17 NOV 92 / City bomb threats prompt back-up strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RISE in bombings and bomb scares in the City of London has prompted at
least two companies to launch emergency dealing room facilities.
Banks and insurance companies can face huge losses if dealers are cut off
from their desks for any reason - a security alert, bomb, or gas leak.
Fully-equipped standby dealing rooms will allow dealers to be back in
business in minutes.
Telehouse, an Anglo-Japanese telecommunications and computer joint venture,
concluded there was a gap in the market after research showed that dealers
at 27 per cent of the financial institutions surveyed had been prevented
from dealing for an hour or more in the previous year.
Only 43 per cent of companies had a dealing room disaster recovery plan.
Back-up computer facilities are more widespread - 84 per cent had plans for
a computer disaster.
Telehouse estimates the emergency dealing room market at between Pounds 9m
and Pounds 14m a year, and says interest has doubled since the bomb at the
Baltic Exchange in the City after the election in April. It is offering up
to 30 dealing positions, as well as 50 back-office desks, at its secure
purpose-designed headquarters in London's Docklands.
The building, which has bullet-proof glass and 24-hour surveillance, is
supplied from two parts of the national grid, with generator back-up and
duplicated telephone links to protect against further disruption of
business.
DSL, the software and communications consultancy specialising in dealing
rooms, is to offer a similar service for up to 80 dealing and settlement
positions at its office in Southwark, south London.
Subscription will be on a 'club' basis - companies with similar requirements
will form a group with up to 10 members subscribing to the same set of
dealing desks.

<TEXT>
SUMIKIN Bussan Kaisha, a Japanese steel product trader due to merge with
heavily-indebted Itoman Corp, yesterday unveiled parent net losses of Y75m
(Dollars 605,000) for the six months to September 30, compared with profits
of Y425m a year earlier, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The losses were due to slow demand for steel products stemming from the
overall economic slump.
Sumikin Bussan, which is 59.5 per cent owned by Sumitomo Metal Industries,
forecasts full-year net profits of Y50m. It posted half-year parent pre-tax
profits of Y107m, down from Y852m, while sales fell to Y328.42bn from
Y358.55bn. It expects full-year taxable profits of Y600m on sales of Y690bn.
Sumitomo Metal Industries yesterday declined to comment on how the expected
falls in Sumikin Bussan's earnings would affect its profits for the year to
March.
Unlisted Sumikin Bussan will merge with listed textile trader Itoman on
April 1 next year. After the merger, the company will be not be listed on
any exchange. However, it aims to be listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange by
1996.
Itoman carries a large amount of debt because of its investment in
properties and art but this will not directly affect the planned listing.
The debt will not be passed to the merged firm but will be cleared by
Itoman.
For the six months to September 30 1992, Itoman sees parent taxable losses
of Y8bn and net losses of Y43bn. For the year to March it sees taxable
losses of Y17bn and net losses of Y90bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING companies, which experienced a run of strong profits in recent years
on the back of Spain's strong economy, are feeling the effects of lowered
business levels and a weakened peseta.
Telefonica, the state-owned telecommunications company, yesterday reported a
third-quarter net income increase of just 2.2 per cent to Pta63.5bn (Dollars
632m) against the same period last year . This was in spite of raising
operating profit by 13.7 per cent to Pta251.7bn.
Telefonica said the 5 per cent devaluation of the peseta midway through
September had caused it to increase its provisions against currency
fluctuations by 38 per cent to Pta7.9bn. At the end of September
Telefonica's non-peseta debt stood at Pta390bn.
Repsol, the state-controlled energy group, could do little more than
maintain nine-month net income at Pta55.1bn. It blamed a difficult global
scenario and the expense of both cost reductions and past investments.
Repsol's operating profit fell by 9.6 per cent to Pta88.4bn against the same
period last year.
Iberdrola, the privately owned domestic utility, posted a third-quarter
pre-tax profit of Pta64.4bn, a 9 per cent increase on the same period last
year. The company noted that energy consumption by industry had dropped by
4.7 per cent over the nine months.
Both Iberdrola and Repsol, which pays dollars for its energy imports, are
severely exposed to the decline in the value of the peseta.
Sociedad General Aguas de Barcelona, is to step up its capital by Pta774.3bn
through a rights issue of 1.54bn shares at a nominal value of Pta540, Reuter
reports from Madrid. Shareholders can subscribe to the issue on a one for 25
basis.

FT  17 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Storehouse sells US arm - Former
Bloomingdale chief buys Conran's Habitat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST A YEAR to the day after retiring as chairman of Bloomingdale's, the
up-market North American department store chain, Mr Marvin Traub is to buy
Conran's Habitat in the US, founded by one of the UK's fallen retail stars.
Storehouse, the retail group which owns Conran's Habitat through The Conran
Stores Inc, will receive a nominal price from MTLG, a vehicle owned partly
by Mr Traub.
The Traub consortium said yesterday that it would keep the Conran name, but
planned to remerchandise the stores, possibly bringing in international
designers and reinstating the catalogue operation. 'We need to improve the
productivity of the space,' said Mr Traub, pointing out that 500,000 square
feet of retail space last year generated just Dollars 51m in sales.
When in October Storehouse announced its break-up it said closure or sale of
Conran Stores would lead to a Pounds 25m extraordinary provision. Last year
Conran Stores made a Pounds 7.7m loss, although Mr Traub said they had been
profitable in the late-1980s.
The sale substantially completes the dismantling of the retailing
conglomerate built up by Sir Terence Conran in the 1980s. In October,
Storehouse sold Habitat to the holding company of Ikea, the Swedish
retailer, while Sears bought the Richards fashion chain.
Storehouse expects to have no net debt by the year-end. The Pounds 108m
proceeds of the Habitat and Richards sales will be used to develop the
remaining BhS and Mothercare chains.
The 19 Habitat stores in the US are based mainly on the East Coast with an
image which is already slightly upmarket of their namesake stores in the UK.
Mr Traub, a New Yorker and Harvard Business School graduate, started his
retail career as a Macy's trainee, and then spent a year at Alexander's, the
now-defunct New York-based retail group.
He moved to Bloomingdale's, where, after a succession of merchandising
posts, he became president in 1969. He later became a director of Federated
Department Stores, Bloomingdale's parent, which was taken over by Canada's
Campeau, via a highly-leveraged deal, in the 1980s.
Campeau put Bloomingdale's up for sale in 1989, but Mr Traub's efforts to
buy the chain were unsuccessful. Bankruptcy for Campeau and its various
retail operations followed, although a relatively speedy reorganisation
allowed Federated, still incorporating the Bloomingdale's stores, to move
out of Chapter 11 proceedings earlier this year.
Since leaving Bloomingdale's, Mr Traub has formed his own firm, Marvin Traub
Associates, a retail consultancy business. He has been joined by Mr Lester
Gribetz, as executive vice-president.

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph aims to claim a leadership role in what is
predicted to become a multi-billion dollar market for 'personal
communicators' - hand-held devices that combine the functions of a cellular
telephone, facsimile machine and pen-computer.
Yesterday NEC and Toshiba, two of Japan's leading electronics manufacturers,
announced that they will build personal communicator products based upon
AT&amp;T technology.
These agreements follow an alliance between AT&amp;T and Eo, a Silicon Valley
company that has designed what it claims is 'the world's first personal
communicator'. It is to be manufactured by Matsushita with distribution and
marketing support from Marubeni, the Japanese trading company.
AT&amp;T Consumer Products group will also sell the Eo product under its own
label through its Phone Center stores in the US.
'These personal communications devices will become as ubiquitous as the
telephone or the television,' said William Warwick, president of AT&amp;T
Microelectronics, the group's semiconductor unit. 'It is more than exciting.
It is a brand new communications world.' He predicts that there could be as
many as 1bn of the devices in use in 10 years.
Personal communicators allow users to exchange voice, facsimile and
electronic mail messages via telephone lines or cellular wireless telephone
links. They incorporate an electronic 'pen interface' so that users can
simply jot down a note on an electronic notepad and send it by facsimile or
electronic mail just by choosing a name from a phone list stored in the
device.
Mr Warwick said that later generations of personal communicators will
incorporate graphics and full-motion video capabilities. Video conferencing
and transmission of high-resolution still images will be available on the
portable gadgets 'sooner than you think', he said.
Personal communicators represent a potentially huge new source of data
communications traffic for AT&amp;T's communications networks. AT&amp;T EasyLink
Services has developed electronic mail services for the personal
communicators.

FT  17 NOV 92 / BOC profits show 30% fall under new accounting rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOC, the UK industrial gases and healthcare group, yesterday warned that the
three locomotive growth economies in the world had stalled. The US, German
and Japanese economies were all slow or slowing, it said. Sales of BOC's
gases are a sensitive barometer of industrial activity.
Mr Patrick Rich, chairman, said US demand had recovered only partially
during the last 12 months. Meanwhile, Japanese manufacturing activity was
now about 7 per cent lower than last year, the steepest decline since 1975.
In the UK there had been further weakening of gas volumes during the fourth
quarter.
The group revealed pre-tax profits down 30.6 per cent from Pounds 310m to
Pounds 215m for the year to September 30. The figures reflected the new
accounting rules FRS 3 issued by the UK accounting standards board and a
Pounds 117.1m adjustment for goodwill previously written off in businesses
sold during the year.
Earnings per share fell from 41.12p to 19.34p, although before the goodwill
write-off they rose 7 per cent to 44.15p.
Most of the adjustment related to Glasrock, a domestic medical gases
subsidiary. An additional Pounds 25.4m exceptional item was allocated for
restructuring the healthcare business.
Without the new accounting treatment and after adjusting for exceptional
items pre-tax profits would have been Pounds 341.9m, an increase of 6 per
cent.
Operating profits, as defined by FRS 3 before exceptional costs, asset
disposals and goodwill adjustment was Pounds 410.9m compared with Pounds
400.3m on a comparable basis. Turnover was Pounds 2.73bn compared with
Pounds 2.72bn, an increase of less than 1 per cent. Exchange-rate
fluctuations had a small negative effect on results.
Capital expenditure fell Pounds 32.5m to Pounds 394.3m in 1991, although
research and development spending grew Pounds 17.5m to Pounds 81.2m,
including Pounds 8m allocated to the Delta Biotechnology business.
Gearing was 29 per cent, the lowest level since 1987. Interest paid was
Pounds 69m against Pounds 79m.
The annual dividend for 1993 was increased 5.5 per cent to 23.2p. The
company is unusual in announcing its dividend in advance. Mr Rich said since
inflation had fallen, BOC wanted to offer a real rate of return on its
investment.

FT  17 NOV 92 / Kingfisher moves into UK office stationery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KINGFISHER, the retail conglomerate, is moving into the UK office stationery
and equipment market though a joint venture with Staples Inc, the fast
growing US chain. The partnership plans to open four stores in the UK next
year, with each side investing up Dollars 6m (Pounds 4m) initially to test
the market.
The stores will be based on the format Staples has developed in the US,
under the name Staples The Office Superstores.
In the US the stores are mainly sited out of town and sell everything from
drawing pins to personal computers, aiming to combine a wide range with
'everyday low prices'.
The stores also produce a catalogue and deliver orders made over the
telephone, which represent under 10 per cent of its sales. Staples says that
businesses with fewer than 100 employees find it 'cumbersome to shop our
retail stores'.
The UK office supply market is worth about Pounds 12bn but the venture is
aiming at a sector worth Pounds 1.5bn a year. The market is fragmented and
many of the wholesalers supplying the market make good margins.
WH Smith, the high street stationers and newspaper and magazine wholesaler,
has already identified the market as providing a growth opportunity. Smith
has acquired a number of stationery wholesalers and recently launched a new
brand in the market called Niceday.
Kingfisher, which runs the Woolworth, Comet, Superdrug and B&amp;Q chains, said
it had been approached by Staples, which is keen to expand outside the US.
Kingfisher decided it was better to take a successful format rather than
attempt to develop its own. Staples has joint ventures in Canada and
Germany.
Mr Thomas Stemberg, Staples chairman and chief executive, said that
Kingfisher's knowledge of the UK retail market combined with Staples'
expertise in office superstores 'create a sound opportunity for joint growth
and expansion'.
Staples opened its first superstore in 1986 and now has 168, based in the
north-east, southern California and central Florida. Sales have risen from
Dollars 39.7m in 1988 to Dollars 547.1m in the year to February 1. Net
losses of Dollars 7.7m incurred in 1988 have turned to income of Dollars
7.9m before extraordinary credits, in 1991-92.

Business is brisk for Fastframe franchisee Paul Bell; his limited edition
prints of Nigel Mansell in his Formula I racing car have proved a big seller
and he is kept busy framing customers' war medals, photographs and
embroidery.
Bell's bustling Wakefield shop, kitted out in signature red, blue and grey,
is one of 68 Fastframe franchised outlets, from Aberdeen to Yeovil and
Belfast, all offering a quick framing service from well-located main street
premises.
In the shops, it is business as usual. But behind the scenes, the Fastframe
network, one of the franchising success stories of the 1980s, is in
cataclysm. Indeed, according to founder Ian Johnson: 'This is probably every
franchisor's nightmare come true'.
Last month Johnson, a former franchisor of the year, called in receivers
Price Waterhouse to Fastframe Franchises, a north-east England-based company
whose franchise network comprises 180 outlets in the US, controlled by a
head franchisee, as well as 68 in the UK and one each in France and Japan.
Fastframe, which grew rapidly in the late 1980s, had been hit by the onset
of recession within months of its 1990 peak, when its UK franchise network
reached 90 outlets.
The end of the consumer spending boom put the brakes on the expansion which
had annually increased the franchisor's income stream and also hit some
franchisees' turnover, with knock-on effects on royalty payments. Some
franchisees failed to pay royalties at all and some went out of business,
leaving Fastframe with expensive leasehold property.
The receivers immediately closed down most of the 21 shops in Fastframe's
wholly-owned West Regent Art Frames chain. But they continued support
services to the franchisees and advertised the franchise business for sale.
Listed among its attractions were the 68 UK-franchised outlets and 'royalty
and marketing income, circa Pounds 800,000 per annum in UK alone'.
Many franchisees however, saw things rather differently.
'Slavery went out with Wilberforce,' says Grenville Salt, a former RAF air
traffic controller who is the Leeds Fastframe franchisee. 'The receiver can
sell Fastframe but they won't sell my business in it. I don't consider
myself part of this franchise any more.'
Salt and more than 40 other UK franchisees, all members of the Independent
Fastframe Franchisees Association, maintain they are no longer bound by the
10-year agreement they each signed with Fastframe because, they say, the
parent has failed for some time to deliver promised support services.
'There have been so many and such serious breaches of the agreement that in
effect the franchisor has repudiated it,' alleges solicitor John
Nelson-Jones, a partner in Field Fisher Waterhouse, who has been engaged by
the IFFA to argue its members' case with the receiver. 'We have the
situation where, so far as the franchisees whom I represent are concerned,
he has nothing to sell.'
Most franchisees paid between Pounds 26,000 and Pounds 55,000 to be set up
by Fastframe in their business.
Unlike many networks, dependent on the franchisor for the products they
sell, Fastframe shops buy picture framing materials direct from a list of
approved suppliers - a degree of autonomy which doubtless enhanced
franchisees' belief they already run truly independent businesses.
The 12.5 per cent annual royalties cover use of the name and concept, the
provision of corporate supplies like headed notepaper and wrappings, support
and marketing.
IFFA chairman Barbara Cartmel, the Eastbourne franchisee, declined to spell
out their criticisms at this stage, but IFFA member Alex Strother, the
Middlesbrough franchisee, summarised their objective in one word: 'Freedom'.
Bell, a former Fastframe franchisee of the year, and runner up in last
year's British Franchise Association franchisee of the year award, is among
those not in the IFFA.
Like many franchisees, he thinks the parent company's marketing performance
fell short but believes established franchisees should not forget the
crucial role the franchisor plays in setting them on the business ladder.
'The problem with franchising is there are a lot of people who want the
proprietors' profit with the manager's responsibility,' he says.
Johnson rejects the disillusioned franchisees' criticisms. 'It's very easy
to be disgruntled when the company goes into receivership. They know the
system now; we've taught them how to do it and operate it.'
Franchisees trying to break away are understood to range from those running
highly successful businesses to some for whom the 12.5 per cent royalty
payment means the difference between survival and collapse.
Many have paid their royalties in full; a handful, says receiver Ed James,
owe Fastframe 'an awful lot of money'.
When Fastframe went into receivership, it was already involved in a dispute
with its head franchisee in the US. The UDI declaration by the majority of
UK franchisees has, says James, inevitably frightened off prospective
purchasers.
If the franchisor ceases trading, the 68 franchisees look set to continue in
business; but under what name? James considers those arguing they are no
longer bound by their agreement should not continue using the Fastframe name
but that others could do so.
Bell, whose turnover is increasing, despite the recession, is confident
about the future of his expanding business whatever happens to the parent
company.
The ability of franchisees to continue trading well, even after a franchisor
collapses, is, says BFA director Brian Smart, one of franchising's
strengths.
Smart says Fastframe's problems underline the danger for franchisors of
franchisees withholding royalties, termed 'management services fees' by the
BFA.
The franchisor, he says, must act forcibly to prevent this but ally that
with providing services which will enable franchisees to boost trade and
meet their commitment.
The Fastframe case, he says, also demonstrates the need for the franchisor
to communicate his continuing importance within the network to established
franchisees.
Johnson, now concentrating on his own printing business and the three
Fastframe shops he owns in Newcastle, is non-committal at present about
whether he would become a franchisor again.
'It's a bit like asking a boxer who's just lost a major bout if he'd go in
and box again. You have to wait till the morning when the wounds start to
heal.'

As part of the acquisition agreement, Rosenberg was due to sign a two-year

FT  17 NOV 92 / Midlands light rail authority invites tenders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR private-sector consortia have been invited to tender for a Pounds 100m
contract to design, build and operate a light-rail transport system in
Birmingham and the Black Country.
The tender has been called by Centro, the operating arm of the West Midlands
Passenger Transport Authority. It is part of a renewed effort to persuade
the government to provide funding for a project which, it is argued, fits
into its policy of encouraging private and public sector partnerships in
infrastructure development.
Centro suspended its tendering process for the light-rail system last June,
when the government said there would be no funding available to start
construction in April 1993. Now, Centro officials believe, a new opportunity
to start the project, called Midland Metro, has come with last week's Autumn
Statement.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said then that the government would
'actively encourage joint ventures with the private sector where these
involve a sensible transfer of risk to the private sector'.
Existing plans for Midland Metro provide for only 10 per cent of the Pounds
100m cost to come from the private sector. The remainder would be provided
by central government with Pounds 40m, local authority borrowing with Pounds
40m and the European Community with Pounds 10m.
Midland Metro's first line would run from central Birmingham through West
Bromwich and Bilston to Wolverhampton. The government has provided Pounds
4.5m to help finance advance works. It is the only planned line in the UK
which has won parliamentary and Department of Transport approval.
Centro said yesterday that a government grant of Pounds 10m would enable
construction to start next year. Tendering would be completed by April. But
this assumes an extra government funding allocation to light-rail systems.
The four tendering consortia are:
Civil engineering group Balfour Beatty and German electrical group Siemens.
Centram, made up of construction company Taylor Woodrow and Ansaldo
Transporti, subsidiary of the Italian Finmeccanica group.
Construction group John Mowlem and GEC Alsthom Transportation.
Eurotransit, made up of Norwest Holst, subsidiary of French construction
group Societe Generale d'Entreprises, contractor Tilbury Douglas and AEG
Westinghouse Transport Systems.

FT  17 NOV 92 / World Trade News: London offices for Hermes and Coface
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE's two most powerful nationally owned export credit agencies, Hermes
of Germany and Coface of France, are poised to open offices in the city of
London.
The primary role of both offices is in the short term to gather market
information. The two insurers say the moves are linked with Britain's deep
recession, which has made it essential to have the most accurate information
possible on the creditworthiness of customers for German and French
exporters.
But the moves will also be seen as a warning to the UK's two leading
privately owned export credit insurers, Trade Indemnity, and the
Dutch-controlled NCM, of increasing competition to come in Europe's most
open insurance market.
Mr Richard Savage, appointed in March to head the Hermes office in London,
said: 'The main implication is of another reputable and strong credit
insurer plying its wares in the UK. We have been trying to do this from a
distance. We are saying we are in the market to stay, and our presence will
grow.'
The main initial role will be to gather information for existing (mainly
German) clients. But from its current small base of UK clients, most of them
multinationals with close links with German companies, the company aims to
grow 'selectively' as a domestic insurer. 'We have been writing business in
competition with others for several years. It is just that now we have
decided we must have a better and more important presence,' Mr Savage said.
Following the recent collapse of Svenskacredit in Sweden, Hermes has also
established an insurer in Scandinavia. Coface is more powerfully motivated
by anxiety over the plight of UK clients as they wrestle with domestic
recession: 'The aggregation of risk in UK companies is causing considerable
concern,' says Mrs Bridget Spreckley, who will head the new office, to open
near St Paul's Cathedral.
She will be working with a risk analyst, mainly to provide French exporters
with the most accurate credit information possible on UK buyers. 'We are not
desperately pessimistic about the UK, but just say we need to be well
informed. When credit insurance becomes difficult, getting closer becomes
vital,' she added.
Coface has no immediate plans to compete for UK business, Mrs Spreckley
said. 'All we are doing is studying opportunities'.
Private-sector competition to write export insurance has increased since
January last year, following the purchase by Holland's NCM of the short-term
export credit business of the government-controlled Export Credits Guarantee
Department (ECGD). It is widely believed in the industry that by the end of
the century, only four export credit insurers will exist in Europe. Coface,
Hermes and NCM are expected to be competing hard to ensure they are among
them.

FT  17 NOV 92 / SPD proposes changes in asylum law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) last night voted to make
sweeping changes in the country's liberal laws on asylum to stem the flow of
immigrants.
A special party congress agreed the major policy shift, amid growing concern
in Germany about racist attacks on foreigners and about the growth in
right-wing groups exploiting immigration as an issue.
SPD delegates backed a proposal from party leaders to reject asylum-seekers
who did not face political persecution in their home countries.
They voted in favour of amending the German constitution to let officials
process asylum applications briskly and to reject anyone refused asylum
elsewhere in Europe. Asylum-seekers who entered Germany from a 'safe' third
country, such as Austria, would be sent back.
But the SPD proposals fall short of asylum changes being sought by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU). It could
therefore be weeks before a compromise is reached and put into effect.
The collapse of communism has unleashed a wave of immigration across Europe,
much of it to Germany, which has the continent's most liberal asylum laws.
Up to half a million newcomers are expected to flood into Germany this year.
A violent backlash has spread, with radical right-wing groups attacking
foreigners and smashing buildings that house asylum-seekers.
The CDU wants to tighten the law drastically, streamline the asylum
procedure and turn away at the border anyone suspected of being an 'economic
refugee' rather than a refugee from political persecution.
Mr Kohl would need SPD support to amend the constitution, but the opposition
party has been divided, with left-wingers opposing change and moderates,
especially mayors who have to house and feed foreigners, pleading for a
solution.
Mr Bjorn Engholm, the SPD leader, urged his party to change course but
denied he was bowing to pressure from the far-right.
In an impassioned speech which invoked the Nazi period, he said: 'History
teaches us - foreigners are the target today, tomorrow it will be the
disabled, and the day after tomorrow, left-wing trade unionists and others
who think differently.' He added: 'Let's not wait until the immigration
problem creates new political majorities that we can no longer influence.'
Mr Ignatz Bubis, head of the country's Jewish community and the only invited
guest speaker at the congress, said the party should not be concerned with
changing the asylum laws. He urged all mainstream parties to stand united
against neo-Nazi violence.

One thousand black people have been killed in South Africa so far this year,
but they did not die by 'falling out of the window' or 'tripping down the
stairs' while being 'guarded' by white men in police stations. They died in
the war between the Inkatha Zulus and the supporters of Nelson Mandela's
ANC. It is difficult (not impossible, if you are good at contortions, but
still difficult) to pin the entire blame for this on white people and their
old apartheid policies. Consequently there has been a dramatic drop in the
number of 'investigative' programmes made in South Africa by white
journalists with back of hand to forehead and heart on sleeve. To its great
credit Assignment at 7.45 on BBC2 investigates what it calls 'the civil war
which now threatens to engulf the whole of South Africa'.
In Troubleshooter 2 (9.50 BBC2) Sir John Harvey-Jones looks at the Donner
family business and is astounded at the capital tied up in a warehouse
packed with cloth. This is the raw material for the Double Two shirt
business. Although Donner makes a profit the shirt company makes a loss, and
Sir John advises against plans to try to expand into Europe.

AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications company, has taken a big step in the
Polish market with the purchase of 80 per cent of the country's Telfa
telephone equipment plant in Bydgoszcz. The US group will pay Dollars
28m for its stake.
The purchase is the first by a western investor in Poland's
telecommunications sector, with AT&amp;T promising to invest Dollars 45m in the
loss-making plant as well as increase its capital by a further Dollars 7.2m.
Poland has an ambitious telecommunications development programme, funded in
part by the World Bank, which is aimed at tripling the country's 3m lines by
the end of the century.
The market is being fiercely contested by western equipment suppliers, such
as Northern Telecom of Canada, Alcatel of France, Siemens of Germany and
Ericsson of Sweden which bid unsuccessfully against AT&amp;T for the Telfa
plant.
The Poles have decreed that 50 per cent of the value of the
telecommunications equipment installed in the country should be sourced
domestically. Yesterday Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the privatisation minister,
said the home market was large enough for only three main suppliers.
AT&amp;T said yesterday it had won a legal battle in its campaign for greater
pricing transparency in the long-distance market.
It said a US court of appeal had ruled that all long-distance carriers, and
not merely AT&amp;T, must publish their prices, in accordance with the
Communications Act of 1934. This reversed a ruling by the Federal
Communications Commission, which oversees the industry, which allowed AT&amp;T's
rivals not to publicly file their rates. AT&amp;T said this put it at a
competitive disadvantage, when trying to reach contracts with business
customers.
AT&amp;T said following the ruling it might seek damages against MCI
Communications, its main rival in the long-distance market, over its pricing
policy.

BAXTER International, the US hospital equipment group, is to form a 75 per
cent-owned manufacturing venture in Russia to produce surgical instruments
at a Moscow plant that once produced defence missile guidance systems. The
move represents Baxter's first entry into manufacturing in Russia, Reuter
reports from Deerfield.
NIIAP, a Russian manufacturing enterprise, will own the remaining 25 per
cent of the venture, which was established with the assistance of the
Russian Ministry of Health and the Department of General Machine Building.
Baxter said production at the plant will begin in June 1993 with full
production expected in 1994. Its statement provided no volume expectations,
but did say 200 would be employed.
Baxter said: 'If we are successful in this venture we may explore bringing
other technologies - including blood products, intravenous solutions and
renal therapy - to Russia.'
The venture would manufacture hand-held surgical instruments such as
vascular clamps, scissors and needle holders with support from Baxter's V.
Mueller division, it added.
The company said Russian producers are able to supply only about 30 per cent
of current demand for such products.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Monday Interview: Monarch in a race with time - King Hussein
of Jordan speaks to Hugh Carnegy and Mark Nicholson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seldom in the 40 turbulent years of his rule has King Hussein of Jordan, who
turned 57 on Saturday, been more popular with his people, more confident in
his political touch or more dominant in his small kingdom's affairs.
Yet, for precisely these reasons, seldom in recent times have the Hashemite
kingdom's 4m Jordanian and Palestinian people looked with more trepidation
towards their country's future. Since it became known in August that their
monarch was suffering from cancer, Jordanians have faced with concern the
prospect of losing the man who has ruled them since ascending the throne, a
boy-king of 17, in 1953.
A measure of King Hussein's popularity, and of the fears raised by
intimations of his mortality, was his homecoming in September after cancer
surgery in the US.
Hundreds of thousands swamped Amman's streets to greet him, turning the
10-minute drive from Marqa airbase to the palace into a crawling 3 1/2 -hour
tour. Cheering crowds prompted the king to abandon the passenger seat of the
silver Mercedes chauffeured by Crown Prince Hassan, his brother and heir,
and perch on the car's bonnet, without a security guard in sight.
Few, if any, Middle Eastern leaders would dare appear so vulnerable in
public - nor indeed would King Hussein have done so until perhaps this year.
Few, certainly, could draw such crowds unbidden.
But since the Gulf war in early 1991 when he ignored international
opprobrium to voice his subjects' condemnation of the west's action against
their Arab neighbours in Iraq, King Hussein has enjoyed enormous popularity.
'I'd always prayed to God that future generations would cast a judgment in
favour of us and not against us,' he said, in his first interview since
returning from the US. 'But to live through an experience like that and see
that kind of warmth and feeling and concern in my lifetime, I never
expected, and never believed that I merited it.'
Sipping Pepsi, against medical advice - but these days not smoking - King
Hussein appeared fit and confident in his palace office. He is, nonetheless,
as he stressed with unexpected frankness in a sombre televised address
earlier this month, intent on preparing both Jordan and himself for his
eventual death. His 45-minute speech at moments sounded like a self-penned
obituary.
During the interview he expanded on a central theme of the speech - his
desire that Jordan should evolve into a model democratic state in the Middle
East, a development he clearly believes he is now sufficiently secure and
popular to encourage successfully.
'This area has suffered time and again because of individuals, because
people came to power in this region and decided to destroy everything that
anyone had done before and tried to create something in their own lifetime,'
he said.
'Whatever remains of my life has to be dedicated towards consolidating more
of the foundations, the grounds for democracy, for human rights, for sharing
responsibility and for pluralism,' he said.
'I think there is a greater need in this society and in the region for an
example to be made, and I believe that Jordan can be an example.'
This stance is viewed cynically by Jordan's neighbouring leaders: men such
as Saddam Hussein of Iraq, Hafez al-Assad of Syria and King Fahd of Saudi
Arabia. They distrust the king's trumpeted commitment to democracy - seeing
it as little more than a ploy in a greater preoccupation of entrenching
Hashemite authority over a country whose legitimacy they are loath to
acknowledge.
Jordan has never fully convinced its neighbours - Arab or Israeli - of its
viability as a coherent society. It was carved more or less at random out of
desert by the British and King Abdullah, King Hussein's grandfather. Today,
60 per cent of its people are Palestinians who, at some stage since 1948,
came across from what is now Israel and the West Bank.
It is certainly true that King Hussein's vision of democracy in Jordan rests
on the continued rule of his house, as he refers to his family. In his
television speech, he gloried in the exploits of Abdullah, a leader of the
Arab revolt against the crumbling Ottoman Empire. He recalled standing at
Abdullah's side when Jordan's founding monarch was assassinated at
Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque in 1951. He, Hussein, had inherited the Hashemite
mantle, and would hand it on to future generations, he told the nation.
During his reign, the king has fended off coup attempts, survived defeat by
Israel in 1967 when Jordan lost control of east Jerusalem and the West Bank,
defeated near-insurrection by the Palestine Liberation Organisation in 1970,
repulsed a simultaneous invasion by Syria and, recently, emerged from the
Gulf crisis more popular at home than ever.
Certainly, the king's efforts to mend relations with the US, Egypt and the
Gulf states, broken by his pro-Iraqi tilt during the Gulf war, have so far
met with limited success. But he believes it is only a matter of time and
patient diplomacy before normal ties can resume.
Perhaps more important, peace with Israel is under negotiation and some
joint constitutional arrangement with a prospective self-governing
Palestinian entity in the West Bank and Gaza Strip may be attainable.
The post-Gulf war efforts of the US, and a new Labour government in Israel,
may have brought real peace closer than ever in King Hussein's lifetime. 'I
believe it is inevitable that something must happen, and must happen soon,'
he said.
But a host of forces, encompassing right-wing Israeli politicians, Islamic
revolutionaries and radical Palestinians, see opportunities to upset the
peace process, and indeed, the status quo in Jordan, for their own ends. And
Jordanians have looked up to the king once more for leadership.
The king is aware of the dangers. 'My concern all along, I have warned time
and again, is of Jordan becoming a battleground for forces outside its
immediate area. This is where we went haywire in the 1950s and I hope this
will never be repeated,' he said, referring to the unrest during the early
years of his rule which was aided by the Arab nationalist states of Iraq,
Syria and Egypt.
King Hussein says he is leading Jordan towards a constitutional monarchy,
with greater emphasis than before on the constitution. In the past three
years he has done much to oversee this, holding elections to the lower
house, forging a new National Charter, and allowing the formation of
political parties for the first time in nearly 40 years.
But the king admits that it may take several elections before popular and
broadly based political parties emerge. Many Jordanians, indeed, are
sceptical that the monarch really envisages full democracy. The trial of two
Islamic MPs last week, charged with two accomplices of plotting to overthrow
the state, was read by many as a signal that democratisation will be tightly
controlled, especially where any threat of Islamic revolution is perceived.
Both were found guilty and sentenced to 20 years' hard labour.
However, King Hussein last week granted the two men amnesty, a gesture which
at once forestalled any Islamic backlash against the harsh sentences, while
firmly underlining his position as Jordan's final arbiter. 'I am in a
position now, especially after the 40 years that have passed of growing up
together, to ensure that the legislature, the executive and the legal system
work in this country,' he said.
But it is precisely the dominance of the king's authority which raises so
acutely the issue of his succession. Jordan's people want to extend
democracy. They, and increasingly the Palestinians who have made their home
in Jordan, recognise the Hashemite monarchy's role in binding the country.
They almost certainly accept the eventual succession of Crown Prince Hassan.
But many ask - in private - the question which also preoccupies Jordan's
friends and enemies abroad. Will he be up to the task?
Prince Hassan has proved himself a tireless regent who is intimately
involved in the affairs of state and is clearly in the confidence of his
elder brother. One senior diplomat in Amman said the issue was not whether
he could cope with the cares of office, but whether he may be tempted to
engage too deeply in the minutiae of government.
Yet, such is King Hussein's record of steering himself and his country
through crises, that many in Jordan doubt anybody could step into his shoes.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Two schools for scandal: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the eruption of the Matrix Churchill scandal over the illicit supply of
machine tools to Iraq in the late 1980s, the British government is
effortlessly breaking all records for a run of self-inflicted political
disasters. Needless to say, the opposition has seized on the opportunity to
give vent to a gale of histrionic indignation; and the government has felt
obliged to set up a judicial inquiry under Lord Justice Scott.
Such portentousness is overdone. Political hypocrisy requires an
investigation, perhaps; but the investigation is unlikely to reveal much we
do not already know. Moreover, the investigation will not be able to pin
responsibility on one or more 'guilty men'; and it will not prevent similar
incidents from recurring. Like the opposition, the government is just
playing to the gallery; but the script of the melodrama is all too
predictable.
Political scandals in France tend to be more entertaining. This may be
because they have more experience in the making of scandals; or because
their scandals are more intriguing; or because they sometimes break with
tantalising slowness; but whatever the reason, the French usually manage to
put on a better, or at least a more varied, show.
Of the numerous French political affairs in recent years, one stands out as
a rather close parallel to the Matrix Churchill story. During the Gulf war
of the 1980s, the French government had declared a ban on military sales to
Iran. But in 1987 it emerged that Luchaire, a French manufacturer of
artillery shells, had sold about 500,000 of them to Iran over a four-year
period, from 1982 to 1986; moreover, it had got around the export ban with
the connivance of key officials in the administration.
The government duly set up a judicial inquiry; but two years later the
investigating judge closed it down, without a finding or a conclusion, 'for
lack of evidence'. Since the essential evidence could only have been
withheld by the administration itself, this showed brazen chutzpah on the
part of the government.
The more spectacular Greenpeace affair was handled rather differently. In
1986 French secret agents sank the ship Rainbow Warrior in harbour in New
Zealand, to prevent it from intruding on the French nuclear test site in the
Pacific; the explosion inadvertently killed a Portuguese photographer on
board.
Two agents were offered as scapegoats to New Zealand, but no one in the
government took political responsibility. Only after a long and unseemly
struggle behind the scenes was Mr Charles Hernu, the defence minister,
compelled to resign. Mr Bernard Tricot, a grand panjandrum of the French
establishment, was wheeled out of retirement to investigate; but his report
found that no one was to blame. As Liberation said at the time: 'Tricot
washes whiter.'
The idea of ministerial irresponsibility was implicit in the government's
handling of the Luchaire scandal; but in the case of the Habash affair, it
was raised to the level of an absolute principle. In January of this year,
the radical Palestinian leader, Mr Georges Habash, was admitted to hospital
in Paris for treatment. President Francois Mitterrand ill-advisedly blew
this up into a scandalous error of policy, on account of Habash's one-time
links with terrorism. But no minister could be found to carry the can; so
five top-ranking civil servants were summarily fired, including Mr Francois
Scheer, the head of the foreign ministry.
It turned out, however, that this tactic of scapegoatism was no more than a
piece of theatre. Even as he was firing Mr Scheer, President Mitterrand
publicly praised him as a most valuable public servant; and within six
months he had been found another top job, as ambassador to the European
Community. That is the kind of denouement which calls for a spectacular
spirit of insolence towards the voters.
One reason for the French practice of ministerial irresponsibility is the
power of the presidency. If the president is the ultimate source of power
and political legitimacy, it follows that his ministers are little more than
his executants. He may fire them; they do not resign on principle.
So it is all the more striking that President Mitterrand has just restored
the principle of ministerial responsibility, in the most sensational way
possible. In 1985, the official French blood transfusion service supplied up
to 1,500 haemophiliacs with blood which it knew to be infected with Aids or
hepatitis. Ten days ago, the head of the service was sent to prison for four
years. But last week Mr Mitterrand electrified France by calling, in effect,
for parliamentary impeachment of the ministers responsible. It seems likely
the list will include Mr Laurent Fabius, who was prime minister at the time;
but since he has long been regarded as Mr Mitterrand's chosen heir, such a
reversal of policy is dramatic indeed.
The explanation for the apparent reversal is not far to seek. The Greenpeace
affair happened far away to other people; selling arms to the enemy as part
of the export drive can be kissed off as part of the world of realpolitik;
and the Habash scandal was not really a scandal at all. But the contaminated
blood has caused, or will cause, hundreds of deaths in France; that is a
real scandal, not just one of the games governments play.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Harvard hopefuls hazy on details: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's morning in Cambridge, Massachusetts. After being out of favour for 12
long years, this little town on the Charles River is once again gearing up
for a Democratic presidency. Mr Bill Clinton has already called on his old
friend, Mr Bob Reich, of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, to head his
economic transition team. Others who helped out during the campaign are
anxiously waiting for the call from Little Rock. Down Memorial Drive at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, even the scientists are getting
excited: the technological revolution promised by Mr Al Gore, Mr Clinton's
deputy, will surely require a big input from this premier engineering
school.
The influence this town will exert is already evident in macroeconomic
policy. A year ago, two old Cambridge hands, economists Robert Solow of MIT
and Francis Bator of the Kennedy school, argued cogently for a two-tier
economic package: an immediate fiscal stimulus that would address the
short-run problem of sluggish demand, coupled with tough medium-term
measures to reduce the budget deficit and hence encourage savings and
investment. The first leg - accelerated infrastructure spending and a
temporary investment tax credit - probably now sounds familiar.
Last week Mr Clinton confirmed that he would follow just such a strategy.
Nearly everybody in Cambridge seems convinced that this 'have your cake and
eat it' approach is ideal for the US. Never mind that retail sales and
consumer confidence are perking up, you have to get the economy really
moving before fiscal austerity can be contemplated.
Provided legislation is passed, mandating future spending cuts and tax
increases either at a certain date or, say, when unemployment falls below a
certain level, Mr Solow and others reckon the package will appear credible
to financial markets. More important, the Cambridge crowd seems strangely
certain that the second, unpleasant leg will be implemented.
I found only one dissenter: Mr Greg Mankiw, a young Harvard economist who
had the temerity to vote for President George Bush. Mr Mankiw does not
believe that a Democratic White House and Congress will have the discipline
to reverse a stimulus and then cut deeply into the deficit in the approach
to the 1996 election. I hope he is wrong but I share some of his doubts: no
Congress, after all, can bind its successors. In fact, some of the US's most
famous Keynesian economists have misgivings. Mr Paul Samuelson, the Nobel
laureate, told me that Mr Clinton would be good for growth over the next
four to six quarters but conceded the 'jury is still out' on medium-term
deficit reduction.
Harvard and MIT are also trying to formulate Clintonite strategies for
tackling microeconomic problems. At a meeting of the MIT World Economy
Laboratory last week, three speakers addressed flaws in US education and
training. I have to say I was disappointed. They trotted out the usual
gloomy statistics, but were clearly only groping toward solutions. Echoing
Mr Clinton, one suggested a Germanic apprenticeship programme, adapted to
reflect 'the realities of US labour markets'. But he offered no details. If
voters expect Mr Clinton to make rapid progress in complex areas such as
industrial training or healthcare, they will be sorely disappointed. Many of
the 'plans' are just headings on sheets of paper.
Industrial policy is a third area of vigorous debate. Most of the experts I
met advocated federal action to promote 'strategic' civilian technologies as
well as investment in the 'information infrastructure' that so interests Mr
Gore. But again most were surprisingly hazy about the details. Mr Charles
Sabel, an MIT political scientist, was an exception.
He regards traditional industrial policy as 'crazy' and sees the main
challenge as finding institutional structures that can support the myriad of
small and medium-sized companies that form the economy's backbone. Mr Bush
set up seven manufacturing technology centres to provide 'extension'
services to small companies, for example advice on relevant new technology.
Mr Sabel supports Mr Clinton's plan to expand the network of regional
technology centres. But he says more is involved than transferring
technology. Small companies face a host of problems - from finding
appropriate organisational structures to training and product development -
that they can no longer tackle in isolation. Yet vehicles for inter-industry
co-operation and dialogue, such as trade associations, are moribund. He
thinks the industrial future lies in promoting flexible clusters or networks
of companies that compete, yet which also benefit from many formal and
informal links. This is the kind of industrial structure that seems to
account for the continuing dynamism of Silicon Valley.
The bustle following Mr Clinton's victory reminds older Cambridge residents
of a November 32 years ago when another young president-elect, John F
Kennedy, was tapping the town for talent. But the parallels do not run very
deep. The only problem then was a mild cyclical downturn. And in those days
economists like Samuelson and Solow were innovators: in 1960 the investment
tax credit was a brand new idea. The task today is to get beyond slogans and
articulate credible programmes. The Cambridge gurus have only just begun.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Dollar rise checked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS will focus on US and German economic data this week, as they try to
work out whether short-term interest rates in both countries will converge,
writes James Blitz.
Since the US presidential election, the market has been divided over whether
the dollar can break through the DM1.60 level before the end of the year.
Those who felt that it would have started to revise their views in recent
days.
On Friday, the US currency suffered a sharp set back, falling nearly 3
pfennigs against the D-Mark in European trading, and closing at DM1.5660.
One reason for the downward move is that the market is coming to believe
that there will be no further easing in official German rates this year.
The Bundesbank is unwilling to ease policy because of inflationary
pressures. Friday's rise in October retail sales by 0.9 per cent has given
the central bank a further reason not to change view.
Both the October producer prices figure due out today and the figure for M3
money supply growth, due out on Thursday, will give clearer indications of
inflationary pressures in the economy.
The dollar could retrace its steps because of continuing sluggish growth in
the US economy.
Last Friday's indicators did show some signs of an economic recovery. But
some analysts suggested that they were 'dollar-negative,' because a recovery
would give President-elect Bill Clinton a reason to scale back the size of
his fiscal stimulus, implying no tightening of US monetary policy.
It will be interesting to see how the market responds to today's industrial
production figures for October, to the September trade balance due on
Wednesday, and to the October housing starts, which are due the following
day.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Survey of Australia (10): Confusion over identity -
Constitution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the state of Victoria's newly-elected MPs gathered for the first time
in Melbourne's historic parliament last month they swore to be 'faithful and
bear due allegiance to her majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the lawful sovereign
of the United Kingdom. . .'
If the oath angered any of the MPs present they failed to show it; perhaps
familiarity has robbed the wording of its shock value, or perhaps they were
mollified by the addition of the words '. . .and this state of Victoria.'
Nevertheless, the spectacle of a group of MPs explicitly swearing allegiance
to a foreign monarch epitomises the confusion which surrounds Australia's
attempts to develop a coherent and distinctive post-colonial identity.
Ironically, the Melbourne swearing-in ceremony was held only a few days
after the federal and state governments agreed to end the award of British
imperial honours such as knighthoods. In practice, the decision merely
formalised the position which has existed since 1988 when Queensland became
the last state to stop awarding imperial honours following the defeat of Sir
Jo Bjelke-Petersen's National Party government.
However, the two episodes taken together neatly illustrate the way in which
the gradual development of an Australian consciousness co-exists with a
continuing attachment to the symbols of colonialism.
Part of the confusion is caused by the federal constitution, signed in 1901,
which allowed the six constituent states to retain their colonial
constitutions, including independent links with the UK.
In addition, some of the constitutional reforms which have taken place seem
pointless, even in symbolic terms.
For example, Mr Gough Whitlam's Labor government of 1972-75 made Australians
subjects of the newly-created throne of Australia.
But the sovereign of Australia remains whoever happens to be the king or
queen of the UK.
This reluctance to take decisive action has marked Australia's
constitutional relationship with the UK since federation. For example, it
took the federal government 11 years to adopt the 1931 Statute of
Westminster, which conferred formal self-government on the then British
dominions. And it was not until 1986 that the federal parliament passed the
Australia Act, finally removing the residual power of the UK parliament to
legislate for Australia and the states.
Pressure for reform has gathered pace in the past year, as Mr Paul Keating,
prime minister, has given official support to both the republican movement
and those who want to remove the British Union flag from the top left
quarter of the Australian flag.
The government is officially committed to creating a republic by 2001, the
centenary of federation, and Mr Keating has given his personal word that he
will oversee the introduction of a new flag.
However, having temporarily diverted attention from the flagging economy,
the Prime Minister has now dropped both issues in the face of determined
opposition, suggesting once again that radical constitutional reform is too
difficult for Australian governments.
Meanwhile, the national schizophrenia on constitutional issues is perfectly
captured in the second verse of Advance Australia Fair, the national anthem
adopted less than 20 years ago to replace God Save the Queen:
When gallant Cook from Albion sailed
To trace wide oceans o'er,
True British courage bore him on,
Till he landed on our shore.
Then here he raised Old England's flag,
The standard of the brave,
'With all her faults we love her still,
Britannia rules the wave'.
In joyful strains then let us sing,
'Advance Australia fair.'
Not surprisingly, the second verse is rarely sung.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Survey of Australia (9): Long list of projects - Mining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A world-class performer suddenly forced to run harder just to stand still:
that's an admittedly sports-oriented, but nonetheless apt description of the
Australian mining industry as 1992 draws to a close.
With slow growth in the world's locomotive economies keeping commodity
prices under pressure, Australian miners have responded by doing what
they've always done; simply produce more.
The result: big rises in tonnage shipments of many key products including
coal, iron ore, gold and base metals - but only a modest lift from ADollars
27.9bn to ADollars 28.1bn in mineral export receipts in 1991-92.
Resource sector earnings have been a leading casualty, with less than 20 per
cent of the country's leading mining companies managing earnings increases
in the latest year, and many facing further cuts in the current year.
Analysts have slashed their resource sector earnings projections, with BT
Securities Australia typifying the share market mood. BT has cut a net
ADollars 100m from its forecast earnings for a handful of the country's top
miners over the next two years.
Despite a belief that selected minerals - notably gold, zinc, copper and
perhaps aluminium - have a slightly improved price outlook, most other
analysts are similarly pessimistic on earnings.
Yet Australian miners remain among the world's supreme optimists; committed
to continued big capacity expansion even though the industry's increased
output is already a leading contributor to world over-supply and price
weakness in commodities.
Leading stock broker Barclays de Zoette Wedd has identified more than 80
large Australian resource projects planned for commencement, mostly by the
mid-1990s, and worth a conservative ADollars 33bn. This includes an
estimated ADollars 14m worth of petroleum projects, with another ADollars
5bn in each of the coal and aluminium sectors, ADollars 1.8bn in zinc and
ADollars 1.7bn in precious metals.
Rapid expansion has been the trade mark of the Australian minerals industry
almost since coal was discovered just 10 years after the arrival of the
First Fleet in 1788. Australian Mining Industry Council figures show that
the volume of the country's mine production doubled in the decade to 1992.
The industry's share of GDP has grown from 7 to 9 per cent and its share of
merchandise exports from 43 to 53 per cent in the same period.
Given the long list of new projects, further minerals growth relative to the
rest of the economy looks assured for at least the next decade. The Federal
Government-controlled commodities forecasting group, ABARE, predicts an 8
per cent rise to ADollars 30.5m in the value of mineral exports in the
current June year.
It is a solid outlook in recessionary times, but the fate of mineral
industry bottom line earnings will depend just as much on internal factors.
Chief among these is the environmental debate which has already
circumscribed some industry operations. Another big swing factor is the
currency. With the Australian dollar looking weak against its US
counterpart, mineral earnings may yet strengthen beyond expectations.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Survey of Australia (11): Getting the green message across -
Environmental Issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMILIA TAGAZA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE appointment of the new head of the Australian Conservation Foundation
(ACF) reflects a fundamental change in the strategy of the peak environment
group which, until 1990, could make or break political parties. The shift
also puts it on a different course from Greenpeace which maintains a radical
stance.
The new ACF executive director, Ms Tricia Caswell, is at ease with business
and industry leaders and has a strong background as trade union negotiator.
She heads a new-look ACF which is more economics-literate and willing to
face industry representatives across the table and negotiates in economic
terms.
Until 1989, the ACF had a confrontationist image, fired by a swell of
support from an increasingly conservation-conscious population. It rode high
on the support and used it to score major victories against big industrial
projects.
It also wielded great political influence which it mobilised during the 1990
federal election to put the Labor Party back in power.
But the movement now seems to recognise that a confrontationist stance no
longer works magic on a population whose main concern is unemployment, not
the environment.
A recent government-funded survey found that while the environment was now a
permanent, deep-seated and genuine concern among the community, unemployment
and the state of the economy were 'top-of-the-mind' concerns in late 1991.
For example, consumers told the survey they wanted to switch to natural and
environmentally-friendly products but they were deterred by their higher
prices. Many who had previously made the switch reverted back to normal or
generic brands during the recession.
The resurgence of economic issues in the development-environment debate is
evident in a new legislation designed to protect Australia's endangered
species. In effect, the legislation puts economic cost-benefit analysis high
in the list of criteria to be used by government agencies when deciding
whether or not to approve projects that may harm native flora and fauna.
The legislation, which applies to Commonwealth land, was approved by the
cabinet last month. It is a weaker version of an original draft which would
have given the environment minister the right to veto or delay projects that
might threaten endangered species.
During cabinet debate, Mrs Ros Kelly, the environment minister, was forced
to give some ground to the economic ministers. The final draft gives much of
the decision-making process to the portfolio ministers. Final decisions are
to be made in cabinet.
Despite the watered-down laws, the green lobby's reaction has been
circumspect. The ACF said the group was dismayed but said it would want to
ensure that Australia's remaining native forests and endangered species were
protected, while accommodating the country's economic aspirations.
'It is necessary to do both. It is possible to do both,' a spokeswoman said.
The group hardly sees the weak legislation as a defeat. It has had a big
victory in getting the government to adopt a national policy which makes
environment an integral part of development planning, along with economic
and social considerations.
The national policy for 'ecologically sustainable development' (ESD) which
was set up in 1990, has brought together conservationists, industry and
union representatives and federal and state bureaucrats to resolve many of
their disagreements. They did manage to agree on specific proposals on such
issues as greenhouse, land degradation and forest conservation.
However, business, unions and conservationists are disappointed that after
adopting the ESD strategy, the government has been slow in immersing itself
in the process.
The ACF now believes that lobbying the government may not be the most
efficient way of getting the green message across.
It has instead begun forming alliances with former enemies to work directly
on environment problems. The ACF and the National Farmers' Federation have a
massive joint project aimed at countering soil degradation in farmlands.
The ACF is attempting to convert workers to the green philosophy, and
through them get their message to industry.
Ms Caswell goes on frequent trips back to her old turf, the Australian
Council of Trade Unions, expounding the idea that a well-protected
environment creates more jobs.
As to the arch enemy, industry, Ms Caswell has a ready opener. She has said
not all industry people are greedy.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Survey of Australia (8): Two-pronged strategy - Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMILIA TAGAZA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE bulk of Australia's foreign earnings used to ride on the back of its
sheep. These days, a growing proportion ride on the seats of jumbo jets.
Last financial year, nearly 2.4bn international tourists arrived in
Australia, contributing ADollars 7.2bn to the coffers. This was about 10 per
cent of total foreign exchange receipts, the single largest earner,
outstripping the traditional wool and coal exports.
Mr Alan Griffiths, the tourism minister, expects 5bn tourists to arrive in
the year 2000, generating about ADollars 18bn.
The national strategy to achieve this target is two-pronged. First is an
advertising campaign to woo more Asian tourists - and thus lock in that
segment of the market which has propped up the industry during the past few
years.
The second part of the strategy is a shift in the Australian image being
projected abroad. The singlet-clad, beer-and-barbecue Australian lifestyle
depicted by Crocodile Dundee star Paul Hogan is being replaced by images of
sophisticated nightlife, first-class shops and fine restaurants, and
spectacular scenery.
Mr Hogan has successfully caught the imagination of the world market.
Australia is now recorded either the first or second most desired holiday
destination in its big markets.
Mr John Hutchison, managing director of the Australian Tourist Commission,
wants to convert that desire into bookings.
Asia, outside of Japan, is the main target of the advertising campaign.
Nearly half of a ADollars 28m advertising budget is being spent on campaigns
in South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand and
Indonesia. The rest is being spent in North America and New Zealand.
Accompanying the marketing campaign is a frantic pace in bilateral air
negotiations to increase capacities to and from Malaysia, Indonesia and
Singapore. And with the deregulation of the air routes, the privately-run
Ansett airlines has also jumped in, applying for flying rights to Malaysia.
In 1991-92 the number of Asian tourists, excluding Japanese, rose 28 per
cent from the previous year's figure, making the region the fastest-growing
source of inbound tourists. The Bureau of Tourism Research (BTR) says
tourists from these markets will increase by an average 12 per cent to the
year 2001. This compares with a 10 per cent growth expected in the Japanese
market, the main source of tourists.
Last year the fastest-growing market was Taiwan, which delivered a 134 per
cent increase in visitor arrivals. The number of tourists from Thailand rose
31 per cent, from Singapore 26 per cent, and from Hong Kong 26 per cent.
But Japan remains the richest market, with more than 500,000 Japanese
visiting Australia last year. While Japanese tourists do not stay long, they
spend the most money among foreign tourists. According to BTR, Japanese
tourists stay an average of eight nights and spend an average of ADollars
1,371 excluding package tours and air fares. In contrast, tourists from the
US stay an average of 29 nights and spend an average of ADollars 2,091.
The Japanese spending pattern is partly attributed to local Japanese tour
operators promoting the 'Japanese connection.' Japanese banks and investors
are heavily exposed to the Australian hotel industry. During the five-star
hotel boom of the middle and late 1980s, Australia built nearly 110,000
luxury hotel rooms worth about ADollars 30bn. Japanese investors including
Kumagai Gumi and Daikyo went on a buying spree and snatched 80 per cent of
the projects.
In 1990, these five-star hotels were valued at ADollars 22bn. Last year the
Building Owners and Managers Association hired an independent auditor who
valued the assets at ADollars 10bn.
And while Japanese investors are trying to unload their interests, Japanese
tourists are helping ease the pain by patronising the Australian tourist
market.
The glut in luxury hotel rooms has itself helped boost Australia's
desirability as a tourist destination. With owners forced to charge economy
rates for first-class rooms and service, it has gained a reputation of being
a holiday destination of excellent value.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Survey of Australia (6): All eyes on Gatt outcome - Trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, shocked many Australians
recently when he declared during a visit to Tokyo that Australia would
support Japan rather than the US in any future trade dispute.
Mr Keating's statement appeared to be intended to lay the groundwork for
Australian trade policy in the event of a collapse of the Uruguay Round of
negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
Officials said the government remained hopeful of a successful conclusion to
the talks, and played down suggestions that the statement flagged a big
refocusing of Australia's trade and diplomatic efforts.
However, Mr Keating was said to be concerned that the US might seek to
develop a series of bilateral trade agreements offering preferential access
to the recently-negotiated North American Free Trade Area (Nafta) if the
multilateral Gatt talks broke down.
Given that such an approach could be used to discriminate against Japanese
access to the US, the prime minister's unsolicited support for Japan makes a
lot of sense. Australia is one of the few developed countries to run a trade
surplus with Japan, which is by far its biggest trading partner.
Mr Keating's comments also reflect the growing view that Australia's best
interests lie in encouraging closer relationships with the dynamic economies
of its own region, rather than fostering existing historical links with the
US and Europe.
More than 60 per cent of Australian exports went to the Asia-Pacific region
(excluding the Americas) last year, including 27 per cent of the total to
Japan alone. By contrast, North America and the European Community (EC) each
took just over 12 per cent.
Most forecasters suggest that trade with Asia will continue to grow as a
proportion of Australia's total trade, which suggests that Mr Keating's
comments amounted to little more than a commonsense observation on where
Australia's loyalties would lie in the event of a trade war.
However, his statement also reflects concern that Australia's relatively
recent claim to be an integral part of the Asia-Pacific region may not be
enough to prevent its exclusion from any regional trade bloc which may
emerge. For example, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, has
made clear that Australia and New Zealand would be excluded from his
proposed East Asian Economic Caucus, which Malaysia envisages as an expanded
version of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean).
Even if the caucus fails to materialise, there is clearly no role for
Australia in the proposed development of a free trade area within Asean  -
an idea which is gathering support as the likelihood of a successful Gatt
outcome recedes.
Australia might be able to sign a bilateral deal offering access to Nafta,
but would first have to overcome US resistance to freer trade in
agricultural commodities in which Australia has an advantage.
Even if the agricultural problem could be overcome, such an agreement would
be unlikely to confer a net benefit if access to Asian markets was
simultaneously reduced because of Australia's exclusion from an emerging
regional trading bloc. This analysis explains why Australia has invested so
much diplomatic effort in the formation of the Asia Pacific Economic
Co-operation process (Apec), initiated by Mr Bob Hawke, the former prime
minister, in 1990.
Apec, which is establishing a permanent secretariat in Singapore, includes
Australia, Japan and the two big North American economies, as well as the
Asean nations and the three Chinas - Taiwan, Hong Kong and the communist
mainland. The key to Canberra's interest in Apec is that the member
countries buy about 70 per cent of Australia's exports. However, while Apec
members have discussed trade issues, the organisation is not yet a trade
bloc, and there are several problem areas which make it hard to see how it
could develop into one:
The size and diversity of Apec - the things which make it attractive to
Australia - mean that negotiations on a comprehensive trade agreement would
face the same problems as the Uruguay Round. Agriculture aside, the US and
Canada are likely to have conflicting obligations to Nafta, especially if
Nafta goes ahead with a series of bilateral trading agreements with third
countries.
An Asian trade bloc could not succeed without Japanese participation, but
Japan clearly has a greater interest in protecting its access to the crucial
North American and European consumer goods markets.
The lack of cultural economic affinity between Apec members. Australian
policymakers have tended to gloss over the cultural issue on the grounds
that other Asian nations are as different from each other as they are from
Australia.
However, Professor Richard Snape, head of the economics department at Monash
University, pointed out in a recent report on Australia's trading options
that successful regional trading blocs usually exhibit a high degree of
geographical proximity and similar levels of per capita gross national
product.
'To this list might well be added cultural affinity: there are no examples
of successful, substantial trading blocs where there is a marked cultural
diversity between the partners. This may reduce the likelihood of any
agreement involving Australia and Asian countries being successful,' he
said.
In spite of these difficulties, the consensus among both policymakers and
commentators is that Australia must continue to promote Apec because it is
the only mechanism which offers Canberra a seat at the regional table.
Professor Nancy Viviani, head of the international politics department at
Griffiths University, says Apec's importance to Canberra is hard to
overstate. 'The alternative is to be an orphan if the storms come,' she
says.
Mr Richard Woolcott, who as secretary of the foreign affairs and trade
department was one of the authors of current trade policy, says Apec can
help Australia prevent the formation of trade blocs from which it is
excluded. Nevertheless, the inherent contradictions in Apec make it a poor
second best to a successful Gatt outcome, which remains the primary target
of government policy. If the talks succeed, Mr Keating can forget about
making choices between Japan and the US. If they fail, Australia will not be
the only country searching for a safe haven.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Survey of Australia (7): Debate continues - Corporate
regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE entrepreneurial boom which took place in Australia in the 1980s long ago
petered out into corporate bankruptcies, recession, and a rash of criminal
charges and civil litigation against many of the key businessmen involved.
Opinions differ about the long-term effect on the mainstream business
sector. Mr Tony Hartnell, the outgoing chairman of the Australian Securities
Commission, the corporate watchdog, thinks it was severe.
'The entrepreneurs have had three long-term effects,' he says. 'They have
put up the cost of capital for Australian businesses; destroyed some of the
pioneering spirit which existed here; and ensured that Australia has fallen
further down the list of asset allocation priorities for overseas
investors.'
Sir Eric Neal, president of the Institute of Company Directors, says the
entrepreneurs did less damage than many observers think. 'I used to think. .
. that Australia's reputation would be damaged irreparably in the rest of
the world,' he says. 'But when I read about the Blue Arrow case in the UK,
and about Salomon Brothers and the savings and loan institutions in the US,
I realise that there are problems in all western countries.
'Without in any way condoning or expressing anything other than concern
about what was happening in Australia, it was not too different from what
was happening in the UK and the US.' Nevertheless, Australia has taken
seriously the widespread criticism that its corporate regulatory
arrangements were unequal to the task of restraining both unethical activity
and criminal behaviour.
The most obvious breakthrough was the establishment of the ASC last year,
after the federal government finally persuaded the states to give up their
rights to supervise corporate activity. Not only did the agreement allow the
federal government to replace the six state-based regulators with a single
federal watchdog, it also provided for an increase in funds from ADollars 7m
to ADollars 125m.
The commission is carrying out some 1,300 separate investigations and has
produced lengthy reports to the Director of Public Prosecutions on 15
leading companies. In addition, criminal charges have been brought or
recommended against several well-known businessmen.
To some extent, the establishment of the ASC represented a shutting of the
corporate stable door after the entrepreneurial horse had bolted. However,
the debate over the right corporate framework is far from over, and several
key issues remain to be settled:
Has the establishment of the ASC filled the gap in corporate law
enforcement, or has it merely papered over the cracks? The Business Council
of Australia (BCA), which represents most big companies, is one of many
lobby groups which believe the ASC's present role as both commercial
regulator and criminal investigator is unsustainable in the long term.
The BCA has called for the establishment of a separate corporate crime
authority, along the lines of Britain's serious fraud office, to allow the
ASC to concentrate on corporate regulation. This suggestion is in line with
the approach taken by Mr Hartnell during the ASC's first year. However, Mr
Michael Duffy, the federal attorney-general, recently directed the
commission to give more priority to criminal investigations.
The Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) has instituted a system of continuous
reporting which requires the market to be kept fully informed about issues
or proposals affecting listed companies. This continuous disclosure regime
is to be given the force of law through federal legislation giving the ASC a
formal supervisory role.
Both the ASX and a government advisory committee concluded that mandatory
quarterly reporting, the disclosure system adopted in the US, was not
necessary at this stage except for mining companies, which already report
quarterly. But many observers remain convinced that quarterly reporting is
the only reliable method of ensuring that markets are fully informed.
However, the most serious issue yet to be resolved is whether the
corporations law needs to be rewritten. The BCA, the Institute of Company
Directors and the Law Council of Australia have all called for a fresh
approach to the law to make it simpler and more relevant to modern business
conditions.
The argument is that the Corporations Act, which draws together more than a
century of corporate law-making, is unnecessarily complex, full of
loopholes, and fails to address issues such as the role of professional
managers and institutional shareholders in a modern company. Corporate law
experts say the legislation is one of the most complicated regulatory
regimes in the advanced countries.
The pressure for a comprehensive revision of corporate law has had some
effect on lawmakers, notably on the parliamentary joint committee on
corporations and securities, which has pressed the government to consider
redrafting and modernising the existing legislation.
However, Mr Duffy has indicated that he prefers to revise the law on a
piecemeal basis - the approach taken by the government in devising new
regulations to govern the relationship between directors and companies,
known as the related party transaction amendments.
Mr Duffy's office also believes that a total redrafting of all 1,300
sections of the corporations law would open up so many issues that it could
take five years or more to complete.
This proposition is contested by Professor John Farrar, a Melbourne
University expert on corporate regulation who helped design a relatively
simple corporate code for New Zealand, which suffered from a similar
problem.
Professor Farrar says a comprehensive revision of the law could be carried
out fairly quickly provided the government had a clear idea of its policy
objectives. The simplest approach would be to adopt the New Zealand code,
which would also help bring Australian and New Zealand corporate law into
line, as required by the agreement on closer economic relations between the
two countries.
'The NZ code has a great deal of intrinsic merit,' says Professor Farrar.
'It draws heavily on the North American model, which is the best model
around, and it innovates in a very original way. It makes the law
comprehensible to the intelligent businessman, and that gives you a head
start if you want an effective corporate regulation regime.'

FT  16 NOV 92 / Survey of Australia (2): An easy target - Fightback campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN his worst enemy would probably concede that Mr John Hewson, leader of
Australia's conservative opposition, is a brave man. Faced with an
apparently disintegrating Labor government, it would have been easy for Mr
Hewson to sit back and wait for the prime ministership to fall into his lap.
Instead, he and Mr Peter Reith, the shadow treasurer (finance minister),
persuaded the Liberal and National parties which make up the conservative
coalition to take an almost unprecedented step: publication of a detailed
programme for government, known as Fightback]
In most areas, Fightback] proposes to extend or complete structural economic
reforms initiated by the present Labor government or its predecessors. But
the scale and scope of the proposed reforms makes it an easy target for
Labor claims that the coalition plans a Thatcherite revolution.
Under a Hewson government, privatisation of government-owned businesses
would be stepped up, tariffs would be reduced to a maximum of 5 per cent by
2000, most of the remaining regulatory constraints on industry would be
swept away, and the resources industry would be largely freed from
constraints imposed by environmental and Aboriginal lobby groups.
Each of these proposals is controversial in its own right, as Mr Paul
Keating, the prime minister, and Mr Bob Hawke, his predecessor, have
discovered over the past decade in forcing more tentative changes through a
sometimes reluctant parliament.
But Fightback] goes further in two crucial areas:
Industrial relations. Australia has a unique industrial relations system
under which a network of quasi-judicial federal and state industrial
relations commissions set wages for about 80 per cent of workers, often
without reference to productivity, supply and demand or ability to pay.
The commissions can order compulsory arbitration of disputes and fine or
imprison workers or employers who fail to comply. Overlaying the commission
structure is a separate prices and incomes accord between the government and
the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), under which aggregate wage
increases have been restrained in return for tax cuts and improvements in
the 'social wage,' such as low-cost medical care.
Labor has initiated tentative reform by reducing the number of occupational
wage award classifications, and encouraging workplace bargaining agreements,
although deals must still be registered with the relevant commission.
Senator Peter Cook, the industrial relations minister, says this 'quiet
revolution' has led to nearly 400 agreements in the past 12 months.
Some agreements have triggered remarkable improvements in productivity. For
example, Mr Michael Deeley, the former chairman of ICI Australia, says
workplace agreements have transformed the competitive position of many of
the company's plants. However, many employers are critical of the limited
scope for negotiation allowed by Labor's new regime.
The industrial relations commissions retain the power to block deals between
workers and employers. For example, a recent deal between Qantas Airways and
18,000 employees was rejected by the federal commission on the grounds that
neither side had justified a proposed 10 per cent pay increase. Mr Ian
Spicer, chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
says many of the agreements which have been registered are 'quite
uninspiring' especially when compared with what is being achieved in other
countries.
Fightback] responds to this concern by proposing the abolition of compulsory
arbitration and occupational awards, except where employers and workers
agree to remain within the existing system. Compulsory trade union
membership would also be abolished, together with restrictions on overtime
and shiftwork, which often attract legally enforceable penalty payments
under the existing system. However, a minimum wage and other safety net
provisions would be retained, undermining government claims that Fightback]
would lead to exploitation of workers.
Fightback] also implies that control of monetary policy would be handed over
to an independent central bank. Mr Hewson has yet to spell out exactly how
this would be done, but it is likely to be a key element of the reform
programme if aggregate wage demand is to be restrained without the benefit
of the present government's accord with the unions. The most likely scenario
is a variant of the successful New Zealand model, under which the bank is
instructed to achieve a specified medium-term inflation target.
Taxation. Fightback] proposes the introduction of a 15 per cent goods and
services tax, similar to Europe's value added tax, to switch the emphasis of
revenue raising from direct to indirect taxes. The GST would raise consumer
prices, but would be offset by personal tax cuts and the abolition of seven
existing indirect taxes, including payroll tax, wholesale sales tax and
petroleum excise tax.
Economists are divided over whether the imposition of a GST would lead to an
increase in the savings rate, and hence to a long-term reduction in
Australia's perennial current account deficit and mountainous foreign debt.
But most agree that it would benefit export-orientated industries by
removing taxation from business inputs.
Mr Hewson says he is confident that voters will understand the reasoning
behind the GST proposal despite government attempts to portray it as a tax
on essentials. His position is also strengthened by Mr Keating's attempt to
introduce a GST in 1985, when he failed to win cabinet agreement in spite of
presenting a strong case. However, the taxation proposals have come under
attack from a wide range of organisations, including the ACTU, the poverty
lobby, the churches, the tourism and construction industries and local
authorities. In addition, the proposed tariff reductions are strongly
opposed by parts of manufacturing industry - notably vehicle manufacturers
and textile companies - and the plan to ease restrictions on mining has
angered both environmental and Aboriginal lobby groups.
The biggest fight is likely to be with the trade unions over the coalition's
labour reform proposals, described by Mr Martin Ferguson, ACTU president, as
a recipe for social conflict in 'a ratbag world of industrial relations.'
However, Mr John Howard, the coalition's industrial relations spokesman,
discounts the prospect of a bruising battle with the unions as a
pre-election bluff.
There is some evidence that he is right. Mr Ferguson told a recent business
conference organised by the Amdahl Executive Institute that the unions were
determined to protect workers by maintaining the award system. But he said
the ACTU's response to the election of a conservative government would
depend on circumstances. 'The ball is in the coalition's court. The union
movement will not pick an industrial relations brawl,' he said.
Nevertheless, Mr Hewson will need all his undoubted political courage if he
is to resist pressure for piecemeal changes in Fightback] So far, his nerve
has held. But holding the line may prove increasingly difficult as the next
federal election moves inexorably closer.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Survey of Australia (5): Tide of history seems to be against
Labor - Politics: Background to the forthcoming federal poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE most elections in the television age, the impending federal poll in
Australia is being described by politicians and commentators on all sides as
the most important ever. Mr Paul Keating, the Labor prime minister, says
voters are being presented with a clear choice between a pragmatic
government and an ideologically-driven Thatcherite opposition.
Mr John Hewson, leader of the Liberal-National Party conservative coalition,
says the election presents a unique opportunity for voters to rein in
corporatism and big government.
Both men are exaggerating. Australia is already undergoing dramatic economic
and social changes as a result of the generally liberal and deregulatory
policies followed by Labor since its election in 1983. A conservative
election victory would speed up the process of opening the economy to market
forces, but that would largely represent a consolidation of liberal economic
policies rather than a philosophical change of direction. Nevertheless, the
antipathy between the two leaders exceeds normal political limits. Mr
Keating, a master of the pithy phrase, has a variety of insulting labels for
the conservative leader, all designed to present him as a heartless economic
theorist, remote from the problems of ordinary people.
He says Mr Hewson is 'Gordon Gekko,' the fictional banker whose creed was
'Greed is Good;' he is Dr Doom or The Professor, recalling his stint as an
economics lecturer; he is the 'Feral (wild) Abacus', suggesting an
out-of-control calculator.
Mr Hewson uses less colourful language, but he takes little trouble, even in
private, to disguise his distaste for the prime minister's spiteful rhetoric
and street-fighting style. Mr Keating's attacks on the opposition are
undoubtedly politically astute. Most opinion polls suggest that Mr Hewson's
popularity has declined since the attacks began in earnest at the beginning
of the year.
The prime minister's relentless concentration on the character issue has
also helped to divert attention from the government's own policy failures,
notably Australia's 1990-91 recession and subsequent slow recovery.
As a result, Mr Hewson has been forced to spend time trying to soften his
personal image, instead of attacking the government's weak point - its
failure to prevent unemployment passing the politically sensitive 10 per
cent level.
Mr Keating can claim credit for a remarkable revival in Labor morale since
he replaced Mr Bob Hawke, the former prime minister, in a bloody leadership
coup in December. A year ago, government officials were resigned to losing
the election, which must be held by June. Now, some think Labor might yet
pull off a record fifth successive victory.
However, there is a long way to go: Labor's popularity rating remains well
behind the opposition - 12 percentage points in the latest opinion poll -
and the coalition has no shortage of ammunition with which to embarrass the
government. Election advertising, for example, is likely to exploit some of
the prime minister's less well advised one-liners, such as his successive
declarations that 'there will be no recession,' that 'this is the recession
we had to have,' and that 'the recession is over long ago.'
The federal government will also be weakened by the loss of state power in
Tasmania and Victoria this year, and the likely fall of weak Labor
governments in South Australia and Western Australia next year.
Mr Keating is not yet ready for the Elysian fields. But increasingly, it
looks as though the tide of history is moving against Labor. After
dominating Australian politics for a decade, the party may now be heading
for a period in the wilderness.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Survey of Australia (3): Inflation expected to fall further
 -The economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S Labor government is claiming victory over inflation, which fell
to 0.8 per cent in the September quarter, the lowest in the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
Inflation is expected to fall further in the current quarter and is widely
expected to remain below 2 per cent for much of 1993, in spite of the
probable end of a two-year downward spiral in interest rates.
In the longer term, cost-push inflationary pressures should be restrained by
the government's agreement with the trade unions, which restricts wage
increases to levels capable of holding inflation below the OECD average.
However, the decline in inflation is not unadulterated good news. Largely,
it reflects weak domestic demand caused by a slower-than-expected recovery
from the 1990-91 recession. Technically, the economy emerged from recession
in the September quarter of 1991. But growth has been weak and the
government may have trouble hitting its 3 per cent growth target, outlined
in the 1991-92 budget.
Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer (finance minister) continues to insist that
the government will achieve the target, but his confidence is not widely
shared. Many business leaders have expressed scepticism about the pace of
growth, including commentators such as Mr John Prescott, managing director
of BHP, Australia's biggest company. Even Senator John Button, the
government's third-ranking minister, admitted recently that he was 'not
confident' the target could be reached, although he later withdrew his
comments after a ticking-off from Mr Dawkins.
The government has responded to slow growth with moderate pump priming which
will increase the budget deficit to a forecast ADollars 13.4bn from ADollars
9.3bn in 1991-92, but unemployment is likely to remain above 10 per cent
until at least mid-1993.
In this environment of weak domestic demand, the best hope for growth lies
in exports, which have been growing strongly, helped by a 13 per cent
decline in the trade-weighted value of the Australian dollar over the past
year. However, imports are growing even faster - up three times as much as
exports in the September quarter, compared to the same quarter of the
previous year.
For the time being, the government remains on target to achieve its August
budget forecast for a current account deficit of ADollars 15bn, equivalent
to 3.75 per cent of GDP. However, the decline in the value of the currency,
combined with a ADollars 1.5bn current account deficit in September - a
20-month high - has refocused market attention on Australia's external
account.
International worries about Australia's ADollars 150bn foreign debt have
eased over the past two years as the debt burden appeared to be stabilising
at about 35 per cent of GDP. But some economists say the falling Australian
dollar could increase the debt load to more than 40 per cent of GDP, which
might re-ignite international concern.
If that happened, the Reserve Bank would probably have to display its
determination to defend the currency - and continued low inflation - by
raising rates, which is just what the sluggish economy needs least.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Survey of Australia (1): Opening the door to Asia -
Enterprising Australians have been trading with Asia since the 1950s. More
than 60 per cent of Australian exports go to the Asia-Pacific region and
integration with Asia is regarded as desirable as well as inevitable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN a Sydney conference hall, Hsieh Fu Hua, the Singaporean managing director
of Morgan Grenfell Asia, is telling a group of Australian businessmen how
Australia is perceived in the economically dynamic Asian countries to its
north. The news is not good.
'You should be aware of the loss of respect that Australia has suffered in
the region,' he tells them. 'You have lost respect because of (insensitive
reporting of Asia by) your bad press, your infamous businessmen in the
1980s, and the performance of your economy.'
Hsieh has much more to say, none of it pleasant. But at the end of his
speech he is applauded enthusiastically. Businessmen question him on how
Australians can improve their sometimes touchy links with Asia. Radio and
television networks queue to interview him for news bulletins.
'I was not surprised by the reaction,' Hsieh says later. 'One of the most
attractive things about Australians is that you can tell them the truth and
they listen to you. I could never have said things like that to an Asian
audience. They would have walked out.'
A few years ago, Hsieh's Sydney audience might have walked out, too. They
stayed to listen because most share the view that opening the door to Asia
is one of the changes which is essential if Australians are to avoid
becoming the 'white trash of Asia,' as Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the former prime
minister of Singapore, once forecast.
Mr John Fahey, the conservative premier of New South Wales, summed up the
emerging consensus concisely at the same conference: 'For decades, Australia
scarcely noticed the changes taking place in its own backyard,' he said. 'We
can no longer afford to do that.'
This view is not new. Enterprising Australians have been trading with Asia
since the mid-1950s when a forward-looking conservative government signed a
trade pact with Japan. Now more than 60 per cent of Australian exports go to
the Asia-Pacific region.
But, increasingly, integration with Asia is regarded as desirable as well as
inevitable. In 1992, it is almost impossible to imagine a serious political
commentator suggesting that Australia should apply for membership of the
European Community, as Mr John Elliott, then president of the federal
Liberal party, did only two years ago.
Part of the reason for the change in attitudes is the growing acceptance
that the nature of Australia has been irredeemably altered by mass Asian
immigration since the repeal of the discredited White Australia policy in
the mid-1970s. For nearly two decades, up to 50 per cent of Australia's
annual immigration intake has come from Asia, transforming the country from
an almost exclusively European enclave to a vibrant and increasingly
sophisticated multi-cultural melting pot.
The non-racial immigration programme has done much to counter Australia's
historical reputation among Asians for arrogant racism. However, the key
factor in speeding up the change in attitude which is taking place has been
Australia's relatively poor economic performance.
Sporting successes aside, Australians have not had much to celebrate since
the country slipped into recession in 1990. While the national rugby union
and rugby league teams were in Europe winning world cup competitions, the
rest of Australia has been struggling with slow growth and high
unemployment.
The economic problems have fostered a growing sense of gloom about the
future, combined with a loss of national self-confidence which contrasts
sharply with the euphoria of the late 1980s, when the economy was growing
strongly and Australian entrepreneurs were still roaming the world looking
for takeover targets.
The short-term result is likely to be a sweeping reversal of fortune for the
Labor Party, which has dominated government at both state and federal levels
since the early 1980s. All the signs are that the Labor decade is almost
over; Labor has already been swept out of office in Tasmania and Victoria
and appears likely to lose the federal election due by mid-1993, although Mr
Paul Keating, the prime minister, will fight hard all the way to election
day. With about six months to go before the last possible election date, the
atmosphere is becoming increasingly clouded by the smoke of battle. But the
short-term political confrontation disguises a remarkable degree of
consensus about future policy.
As Mr Paul Kelly, editor in chief of The Australian newspaper, argues in his
recent book The End of Certainty, the 1980s marked a radical move away from
the principles which had guided Australian governments since federation in
1901 - white-only immigration, trade protectionism, judicial regulation of
industrial relations, paternalism, and loyalty to Britain.
Both the main political groups are committed to continuing the process of
developing Australian political and cultural independence, and opening up
the formerly protected and regulated economy to international economic
forces. Hence there is a large measure of agreement on key issues - tariff
reductions; integration with Asia; and raising business competitiveness
through labour market changes and other structural economic reforms.
There is even some meeting of minds on touchy symbolic issues: Mr Keating
may have tried to present republicanism as a Labor icon but Mr John Hewson,
the federal Liberal leader, is only one of many conservatives who think
abolition of the monarchy is probably inevitable in the long term.
Of course, the new consensus is not complete. State politicians have local
industries to protect, business leaders and media commentators fear the
effect of competition on uncompetitive businesses, academics complain that
Australia's traditional egalitarianism is in danger. But the critics' impact
is limited by the absence of a rational alternative policy.
A recent book by Mr Michael Pusey, an academic sociologist, tapped a deep
vein of nostalgia for government regulation, but even Mr Pusey did not
suggest that Australia could return to protectionism.
As a result, the debate revolves around the pace of change. The
conservatives want rapid progress towards unencumbered free markets; the
government contends that Australians have already undergone all the reform
they can digest. Nevertheless, it is clear that Australia's course towards
an independent, open and pluralistic society has been firmly set. The
argument now is not about what charts the ship of state should be using, but
how much sail it should carry.

CROWN HOUSE ENGINEE RING is creating the 'ideal environment' for shows in a
new hall complex being added to Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre.
The Pounds 44m complex of four halls and concourse will increase show space
by an additional 33,000 sq metres.
The new halls, used seperately or interlinked, are expected to provide the
perfect exhibition setting with greater flexibility for displays and stands,
and improved quality of facilities.
Air conditioning and heating will be programmed to adjust automatically to
the varying size of crowds.
The Pounds 13.8m contract, awarded by Laing Midlands, the main contractors,
covers the design and installation of all heating, ventilation, air
conditioning, and electrical services in the new complex.
Exhibitors can have every facility and service supplied direct to their
stand in any desired location. Large service tunnels running below the new
halls and interlinked, feed a grid system of channels to supply water, gas,
air power, drainage, telephone and information technology to individual
stands and displays.
The NEC's glass-domed atrium concourse is being extended to link with the
new halls 9 to 12 and two new restaurants and a conference suite. The
exhibition space will be boosted to a total of 155,000 sq metres on
completion of the complex next summer, and 3,000 car parking spaces are
being added, making a total capacity for 18,000 vehicles.
The new halls are scheduled to open with the International Print Show in
September 1993.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE mid-month rush of UK statistics this week includes the October money
supply figures. Few will be surprised to see the M4 broad measure fall well
within the new target range, announced by the Chancellor in parliament last
week.
Target growth range for M4 - notes and coins in circulation and bank and
building society deposits - will be 4-8 per cent. Conveniently, M4 grew by
5.1 per cent in the year to September, almost bang in the middle of the
target range, and is forecast to drop to 4.85 per cent in the year to
October. With inflationary pressures subdued, most economists say the upper
limit of the target range is unlikely to be breached in the near term. It is
more likely to drift to its lower limit.
There is also important data on the US real economy. Figures for industrial
production today should give President elect Bill Clinton a better idea of
the scale of the task of rejuvenating the US economy.

RESULTS DUE
BRITISH Airways is expected to report a 40-45 per cent increase in
first-half pre-tax profits tomorrow, confirming its position as one of the
world's most profitable airlines. However, the City expects a small decline
in the company's second-quarter profits, reflecting the increasingly tough
outlook in the industry.
BA's first-half pre-tax profits are expected to be in a range of Pounds
250m-Pounds 260m, against Pounds 185m in the first half last time. But
second quarter profits are expected to total around Pounds 160m-Pounds 170m,
against Pounds 176m.
British Steel, struggling in the depressed worldwide steel market and a
flood of cheap metal entering the EC, particularly from Eastern Europe, is
expected to report a significant pre-tax loss today. Analysts put it at
between Pounds 50m and Pounds 100m in the half year to September (Pounds
13m).
The big question is whether the steel group will maintain or cut its interim
dividend, held at 3p last time. There is no financial reason to maintain the
pay-out, but British Steel may want to keep its options open, and wait to
play with the final dividend.
The market is expecting today another solid year to September from BOC, the
industrial gases and healthcare group, but the slowdown in earnings growth
is likely to continue. Analysts expect pre-tax profit of Pounds 345m (Pounds
310m) and eps of about 45p (40.98p). A 22p (20.4p) dividend is forecast.
Whitbread is expected to report flat first-half profits of about Pounds 142m
on Wednesday. Its retail operations have continued to suffer from tough
trading conditions, particularly in south-east England.
First-half results of electricity companies have only limited value as they
take in the spring and summer months when activity is low. However, this
year's crop, which start tomorrow, are bound to attract attention because of
the coal mine closures programme.
National Power starts off the month-long electricity results season with
analysts expecting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 230m, against last year's
Pounds 202m. PowerGen reports on Wednesday with expectations at about Pounds
100m (Pounds 97m). Dividend rises of about 10 per cent are likely.
Cable and Wireless, the telecommunications group, is expected to report flat
pre-tax profits of around Pounds 355m (Pounds 351m) for the half year when
it announces its results on Thursday. Strong UK performances from HongKong
Telecom and Mercury Communications have been offset by the weak dollar.
Storehouse, the retailer, is expected to report a break-even first half on
Thursday. Analysts are looking forward to better second-half profits of
around Pounds 30m, and will be keen to hear if Storehouse is making progress
on selling Habitat's loss-making US operations.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Risk and Reward: Traders in volatility relish the profits on
recent uncertainties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE events of the past two months could have been stage-managed for anyone
who trades on uncertainty.
The French vote on Maastricht, the US election, the Canadian referendum  -
each had the power to turn the tide in financial markets, and each seemed
too close to call in advance. For the growing band of volatility-traders -
the people who do not mind what happens to prices, as long as uncertainty
about them rises - it was a godsend.
Option pricing is a complex business. But it is intuitively not difficult to
grasp why volatility itself has a price. Uncertainty, for example, about the
outcome of an election, may have no effect on the level of interest rates or
equity and currency prices. But it will make it more expensive to hedge a
particular market exposure.
More people will want to buy protection, pushing up the cost. This extra
cost - the price of greater perceived risk in a market - reflects a change
in what options traders call implied volatility.
Trading on that volatility, rather than any actual movement in market
prices, has become a popular pastime among banks active in the derivative
markets, and even some fund managers.
To do it, traders buy two matching options, a call and a put, which exactly
cancel each other out. One may give the right to buy sterling at 1.50 to the
dollar in three month's time, the other the right to sell at the same rate.
Underlying market risk - known as delta risk - is neutralised.
What remains is a play on volatility - or gamma risk, in the jargon of the
options market. The volatility of the Italian bond futures market is around
8 per cent at the moment: prices have settled into a relatively narrow range
after the gyrations of September. If that volatility rate leapt back to the
25 per cent peak of September, then anyone holding matching put and call
options could sell both of them on at a profit.
Even if you're wrong about volatility rising, you can still make money this
way. If prices in the market move far enough, no matter in which direction,
you could exercise one option at a profit and let the other expire
worthless.
One risk is that volatility will not rise but fall, against a background of
stable market prices. That is roughly what has happened in recent weeks
across a range of markets. The volatility of German government bond futures
has fallen from 5 per cent a month ago to under 3 per cent.
This decline may be bad for anyone betting on volatility, but it has made it
cheaper for investors or companies to hedge their financial exposures. It is
better to buy an option when volatility is low. In extreme circumstances,
such as mid-September in Europe, it can be not only prohibitively expensive
but actually impossible to hedge.
Falling volatility is not the only way to lose money - as the events of
recent weeks have taught less-experienced options traders. Rising
uncertainty punishes traders who have sold, rather than bought, volatility.
Also, interest rates can jump through the roof, sending the carrying costs
of an option position soaring - in Sweden, the overnight rate leapt to 500
per cent at one point.
And it takes a real market shake-out to reveal the flaws in new-fangled
financial instruments. One such is the 'stop-out', or 'one-touch' option.
This was designed to reduce the cost of hedging: the option is exerciseable
if the price moves to a certain level, but if it moves far enough in the
opposite direction, the contract instantly expires. Recent oscillations in
some ERM currencies proved too much for these instruments, as prices bounced
up and down, killing off the options before they could be exercised.
Trading in volatility could itself have profound effects on underlying
markets - a consideration which has not been lost on regulators. Some
options strategies are actually designed to increase volatility.
Where will the volatility traders look next for a profit? Most still think
Europe offers the best opportunities. The French elections, the next event
stage-managed for the options market, are still some way off. But in the
meantime there is always the chance of some excitement at or beyond the
fringes of the ERM. Italy and Sweden, the most volatile markets in
September, remain the favourites. European central bankers should tighten
their safety belts: it could be a bumpy ride ahead.

FT  16 NOV 92 / International Bonds: A cold shoulder for Latin American
borrowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WARM reception which once awaited any Latin American equity or bond
issuer is cooling.
With a large queue of Latin American names waiting to tap the international
bond markets over the next few months, foreign investors have turned cold at
the prospect of oversupply.
As a result, several Latin American borrowers have had to offer more
attractive terms on their bond issues in order to raise the necessary funds,
while yield spreads on existing issues have widened by as much as 100 basis
points.
The pressure in the Eurobond market is prompting borrowers to consider other
means of raising finance.
For example, Compania de Telefonos de Chile, the Chilean telecommunications
company, is preparing to launch a convertible bond issue, and other
borrowers may consider subordinated debt issues with convertibility rights,
investment bankers have said.
The cold-shouldering of Latin American bond issues follows an equally frosty
response to international equity offerings from that part of the globe.
International equity offerings from companies such as Banacci, the Mexican
holding company which owns the country's biggest bank, and Grupo Synkro, the
Mexican consumer goods company, were postponed earlier this year due to
unfavourable stock market conditions.
On the recent increase in bond yield spreads, Mr Paul Luke, an analyst at
Morgan Grenfell, says: 'The Eurobond market has caught up with what happened
in the domestic equities markets.'
The trigger for the bond market has been concern about oversupply.
Mr Stephen Dizard, head of trading in Salomon Brothers' emerging markets
department in New York, shocked investors and bond market participants at a
conference in early October with his estimate that a total of Dollars 20bn
of Latin American bond issues was expected within the next 12 months, of
which Dollars 4bn was due by the end of 1992.
Mr Richard Watkins, chief executive of the LatInvest Group, an investment
banking group, says: 'The implication was that the figures were so large,
borrowers would have to pay a higher price in order to complete them.'
And one bond dealer adds: 'It has come as a shock to the market that there
was such a backlog of deals.'
Yield spreads on Latin American bonds - particularly those from Mexican and
Argentine borrowers - have shown a marked narrowing earlier in the year and
some bond market participants claim that by the summer of 1992, deals from
these countries were being launched at very aggressive prices. However,
recent worry about oversupply has caused a reversal of this trend, and the
yield spreads over US Treasuries have widened again.
To take an example: Nafinsa, the Mexican state development bank, has a bond
maturing in 2001 which traded at a yield spread over US Treasuries of 360
basis points at the start of the year.
The spread narrowed to 200 basis points by the summer, but it now lies at
around 310 basis points.
Latin American borrowers have had to adjust the yield spreads on new issues
accordingly. Dealers point out that oversupply concerns have added about 100
basis points to the yield spreads as a rough rule of thumb.
One syndicate manager says: 'A few weeks ago we were talking with borrowers
about yield spreads of 325 to 350 basis points over five-year Treasuries in
the pre-marketing discussions: we then had to move towards 375 to 400 basis
points, and eventually launched at 400 to 450 basis points.'
The Republic of Argentina's Dollars 250m five-year issue, which was launched
at the end of September at a yield spread of 300 basis points over
Treasuries, is now at a bid-offer spread of 385 to 360 basis points,
according to CSFB, the lead manager.
Yield spreads on Argentine bonds widened further last week as Argentina's
financial markets were troubled by rumours that Mr Domingo Cavallo, the
economy minister, might resign, coupled with concern about the government's
commitment to economic reform.
Salomon Brothers' recent Dollars 150m five-year deal for Grupo Dina,
Mexico's largest truck manufacturer, was originally supposed to be launched
at a yield spread of 350 basis points. Eventually it was launched with a
yield spread of 475 basis points, and the deal is now trading at 500 basis
points over the Treasury.
Goldman Sachs' recent Dollars 100m five-year issue for Gemex of Mexico was
launched at a yield spread of 475 basis points, whereas in the early
discussions with the borrower, the lead manager had suggested a spread of
350 basis points.
Investment bankers cite a host of additional reasons why investors are
rather less enthusiastic about Latin American issues today.
These range from the scandal surrounding President Collor in Brazil, to
political concerns in Venezuela, and worries about the size of the Mexican
current account deficit.
Furthermore, non-US investors have tended to focus more on the European bond
markets, seeking safety in the D-Mark bloc, and have shown less interest in
the US dollar markets because of the lower interest rates.
Dealers believe that some Latin American borrowers will simply postpone
their bond issues in the hope that yield spreads will narrow again.
However, others may have to accept the new pricing levels.
One syndicate manager says: 'Some deals simply have to be done because the
companies need the funding at any price in order to pay off bridging loans
and other commitments.'
Mr Paul Luke believes it is unlikely that the market will see any narrowing
of spreads given the impending supply.
Lead managers admit that they are having problems promoting the issues. 'We
are having to work hard to sell the credits' says one manager.

FT  16 NOV 92 / US Money and Credit: Rally marks diminishing fear of the
President-elect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLINTON-PHOBIA seems to be diminishing, at least temporarily, in the US
credit markets.
The long end of the government bond market, which reacted badly in September
and October to the prospects of a Democratic presidential victory, rallied
strongly last week in spite of Governor Clinton's impending occupancy of the
White House.
The rally - the most sustained rise for almost two months - was the more
impressive for occuring in circumstances which might normally be expected to
weigh the market down: a heavy Treasury bond auction and a slew of positive
economic reports.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was quoted in late trading on Friday at
a yield of around 7.572 per cent, down from almost 7.76 per cent a week
before. Three main factors appeared to underlie the change in sentiment:
First, the market seems to be coming round to the view - albeit warily  -
that it may have over-reacted to a Clinton presidency in sending long bond
yields soaring from around 7.22 per cent in early September, interrupting a
steady downward trend.
Mr Clinton has gone out of his way since the election to reassure the money
markets that he is not a fiscal firebrand, and Wall Street is increasingly
of the view that his proposed economic stimulus will not seriously ignite
inflation, as was once feared.
Second, the market saw the removal last week of a second leading cause of
recent uncertainty - the Treasury's Dollars 37bn quarterly refunding
programme, which turned out better than many had feared.
Third, the economic fundamentals still seem relatively benign for the bond
market, with inflationary pressures extremely subdued. The market was
especially cheered by Tuesday's news that the core producer price index
figure rose a scant 0.1 per cent in October, although the enthusiasm was
dampened a little on Friday by a strong, but possibly aberrant, consumer
price index figure.
True, there have been plenty of statistics over the past two weeks to
suggest that the US economy may be at last picking up steam, which would
normally tend to depress bond prices on fears of inflation. Friday, for
example, brought forth a stronger than expected jump in October retail sales
and signs of reviving consumer confidence.
Even so, growth next year is likely to be subdued at best - many forecasts
are pitched around 2 per cent to 3 per cent - and the gloomy end of the
economic spectrum insists that the vitality is a mirage. Mr Philip Braverman
of DKB Securities, asserts: 'The US economy not only remains mired in deep
economic distress, it is still in recession.'
The green shoots of economic growth visible over the past few weeks seem
likely to encourage the Federal Reserve to leave monetary policy on hold,
with the Fed funds rate at 3 per cent, when its policy-making Open Markets
Committee meets tomorrow.
Wall Street does not rule out the possibility of the Fed easing once more
before Christmas if the unemployment report for November, due out in early
December, turns out very weak.
Diminishing hopes of easier short-term money, combined with the rally in
long bonds, have helped to narrow somewhat the yawning yield differential
between short and long term instruments. The 30-to-10 year spread narrowed
to 76 basis points last week, while the 10-to-two year spread dropped to 230
basis points.
That could have further to go if the market keeps its nerve over
President-elect Clinton, though many analysts see a yield of 7.5 on the long
bond as a tough floor to break through in the short-term. However,
sentiment, could be significantly affected by the governor's choice of
treasury secretary.

FT  16 NOV 92 / UK Gilts: Treasury's mood change brings on the jitters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT A difference four months makes when it comes to UK public spending]
The change in mood at the Treasury about the UK economy in between its
assertions in July about public spending and last week's Autumn Statement
has caused jitters in the gilts market.
The nervousness concerns the large rise in government borrowing that seems
likely over the next few years, on account largely of the much longer than
expected nature of the struggle to lift the UK economy out of recession.
Back in July, the Treasury was relatively optimistic about progress being
made towards a recovery.
It had not then fully disowned its projection made at the time of the March
Budget that the economy would grow by about 3.1 per cent in 1993, ending the
period of economic decline that started around mid-1990.
However, in the Autumn Statement, Treasury forecasters had changed their
tune. They pencilled in growth next year of 1 per cent, after a 1 per cent
contraction this year.
As part of the price of higher spending and reductions in tax income,
government borrowing in 1992-93 is forecast to be Pounds 37bn, well up on
the Pounds 28bn projected in the Budget. The deficit could rise to Pounds
44bn in 1993-94, according to Treasury estimates.
The extra borrowing worries gilt practitioners, on account of the large
volume of gilts that will have to be issued over the next few years. Even
though last week prices for gilts traded in a narrow range - with a small
increase in yields at the short end of the yield curve after the much
expected reduction in base rates from 8 per cent to 7 per cent  - there is
some fear that prices may drop over the next few weeks as realisation about
the volume of issues sinks in.
The Treasury had some success last week in partially disguising the degree
to which government spending is likely to rise over the next few years as a
result of the recession and its aftermath.
Most attention focused on its new control total for public spending - which
excludes social security spending reckoned to be related to the economic
cycle such as unemployment pay. According to the Autumn Statement the
control total is to climb from Pounds 232bn in 1992-93 to Pounds 263.3bn in
1995-96, an average increase of 1.4 per cent a year in real terms, using the
new assumptions for inflation sketched in as part of the statement.
The yearly increases in real terms envisaged by the Treasury are similar, as
the table shows, to those which it pencilled in in July, as part of its
initial thinking about control-total spending over the period in question.
However, in the case of general government expenditure (GGE) - which
includes all payments by local and central government - the story is
different. Back in July, the Treasury was talking about limiting increases
in GGE (excluding privatisation proceeds) to 2 per cent a year on average in
real terms during the three-year period to 1995-96. The new figures outlined
by the Treasury last week are significantly bigger, according to which the
real increase is an average of 2.6 per cent a year over the period.
The worry for the gilt market is that what the Treasury has revealed in its
Autumn Statement puts an over optimistic gloss on what is the true likely
state of government finances over the next few years.
According to calculations by Mr Michael Saunders of Salomon Brothers,
borrowing could be bigger than the Treasury projects, rising from Pounds
40bn in 1993-94 to Pounds 58bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 65bn the year
afterwards.

   A MOOD of wide
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
though hardly wild - optimism has settled into the French bond market, after
the government continued its salami tactics of slicing another quarter
percentage point off interest rates on Thursday.
The consequent rise in bond prices led to some profit-taking, and the market
closed the week with the yield on the benchmark 10-year OAT government bonds
at 8.01 per cent, compared with 8.05 per cent a week earlier.
The most durable factor behind this optimism is that it is not built on
expectations of early cuts in German interest rates, or any immediate
further rate reductions in France.
Mr Bernard Godement, an economist with the Nomura Research Institute in
Paris, says it will be 1993 before German rates come down.
Certainly, the French government wants to avoid its mistake of a year ago
when it moved ahead of Germany in cutting interest rates, only to have the
foreign exchange markets force it to step smartly backwards. Having to
reverse an interest rate cut would be politically worse than no further cut
at all in the run-up to next March's parliamentary elections.
So far, all the Banque de France has really done this month is catch up with
the interest rate cut the Bundesbank made in early September. Some
economists, such as Mr Christopher Potts, a Banque Indosuez economist,
believe the current  3/8 to  1/2 percentage point margin of French money
market rates over German ones gives the government 'a slight margin of
manoeuvre', which it might use to lower official rates a bit before the end
of year.
These constraints limit a further narrowing, in the near future, of the
famous spread between the yields of long-term French OATs and German bunds.
This has shrunk, from 1.25 per cent at the height of September's currency
crisis to 0.68 per cent on Friday. Mr Potts does not see grounds for any
further big reduction in this spread.
However, the general gloom which has hung over the French economy is
vanishing for three reasons:
First, the franc has emerged with battle honours from its September crisis.
The Banque de France has larger foreign exchange reserves than before that
crisis, Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said this week. In addition,
the chances that France's likely centre-right government next year will
abandon the socialists' strong franc policy receded further last week.
Mr Philippe Seguin, the Gaullists' anti-Maastricht standard bearer and
leading proponent of a more flexible exchange rate policy, said he was most
unlikely to be part of the next government.
Second, if the recent interest rate cuts help contain servicing costs on the
public debt and promote investor confidence, then government forecasts of
2.1 per cent growth this year and 2.6 per cent next year may no longer look
like gross over-estimates. The public deficit will still be nearly FFr220bn
in 1992 and more than FFr200bn in 1993. But it may not skew the bond market
as much as it has. New government issues rose 42 per cent in the first nine
months of this year, but those of financial institutions and of industry
fell 21 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively.
Third, the opposition's commitment to a sizeable privatisation programme
gives hope for deficit and debt reduction. The bond market would clearly
benefit from this.

FT  16 NOV 92 / International Company News: Toyota considers output increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS BARRIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA is considering increasing production in the North American Free Trade
Area, according to Mr Osamu Kimura, president of New United Motor
Manufacturing (Nummi), a 50-50 Californian joint venture between the
Japanese vehicle maker and General Motors of the US.
Mr Kimura said the plans, being drawn up by Toyota's US projects division in
Tokyo, could entail investment to increase capacity by 100,000 vehicles to
200,000 a year in three to five years.
Under consideration is investment in a new plant in Mexico, in Toyota Motor
Manufacturing Canada and in Toyota's car plant in Georgetown, Kentucky,
which is doubling capacity to 400,000 vehicles a year.
Mr Kimura stressed the plans were at an early stage and no decision had been
taken. He suggested investment in a facility would cost at least Dollars
500m.
The company was attracted by the low wage costs of Mexico, but the lack of a
sophisticated supply infrastructure would mean importing parts from the US
mid-west, thereby increasing transport costs.
Nummi's California plant was also a candidate for expansion, he said. 'There
are many proposals from almost every state in the US. They are asking Toyota
to come to their state, to build a plant.'
He said Toyota 'has some hesitation' because of concern over the state of
the US market and the political danger of increasing capacity when Ford, GM
and Chrysler were under pressure. The company was watching carefully for
President-elect Bill Clinton's policy on Japanese transplants.
Mr Kimura was in Scotland to address industrialists at a Strathclyde
Institute conference on manufacturing. 'The recession is continuing in
Japan, America and Europe at the same time. Toyota's stance is very
conservative, to save money,' he said.
The company's resources were already committed to expansion at the Kentucky
factory, in the UK, in Turkey and China, and in a joint venture with GM in
Australia.
The agreement with GM that established Nummi expires in four years due to
limits placed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Mr Kimura expected
talks to begin with the FTC and GM over Nummi's future early next year.
Both Toyota and GM have said they would like the present joint venture to
continue.

AS speculation continues about Northwest Airlines, the fourth largest US
carrier, Standard &amp; Poor's, the big New York ratings agency, downgraded the
company's senior unsecured notes from B minus to CCC plus.
S&amp;P said that the downgrade 'reflects further erosion of the equity base,
due to ongoing losses and the bondholders' standing as unsecured creditors
of the holding company, which places them in an essentially subordinate
position'.

<TEXT>
INTERIM profits of Mitsui Fudosan, Japan's largest property developer, have
been hit by the country's property price slump and land holding taxes.
The company posted a 38.3 per cent fall in non-consolidated taxable profits
for the first six months to September, to Y17.4bn (Dollars 145m). Interim
sales edged ahead by 0.1 per cent to Y396.4bn, while net profits fell 39.5
per cent to Y9.1bn. Mitsui blamed the stagnation of Japan's property market.
Sales of the company's housing division fell 8.4 per cent to Y205.8bn. Newly
introduced landholding taxes worth Y2.4bn also eroded profits.
The company said capital spending for the current year would be slashed by
about Y100bn from the previous year to Y70bn.
Daikyo, the leading Japanese condominium developer, saw a sharp fall in
first-half profits due both to the slump in the Japanese property market and
an appraisal loss on securities holdings.
Pre-tax profits for the first half to September fell 36.5 per cent to
Y4.7bn, on a 24.3 per cent fall in sales to Y261.7bn. Net profits fell 14.7
per cent to Y2.8bn. Daikyo blamed the poor performance on a 35 per cent fall
in condominium sales to 4,907 units and losses on its securities portfolio
appraised at Y2.9bn.
However, Daikyo's sale of office buildings worth Y40bn to affiliates and
other business partners, as a part of its restructuring scheme, propped up
its sales figure.
The company's cash on hand and deposits fell 64.2 per cent to Y20.9bn, while
short-term borrowings rose 45 per cent to Y675.3bn.
Daikyo expects to slash profit margins in the second half to sell 6,000
condominiums to reduce inventories.

   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KVAERNER, the Norwegian engineering, shipping and shipbuilding group, has
acquired the 60 per cent it did not own in Kimek, a shipyard in Kirkenes on
the border between Norway and Russia, from Syd Varanger, a partially
state-owned company.
As consideration for the deal, Kvaerner will provide the yard - to be called
Kvaerner Kimek - with NKr30m (Dollars 5.2m) in fresh capital and NKr70m 'in
kind' including technological assistance. It will implement a NKr230m
expansion and modernisation programme to be completed in 1994.
The industry ministry will contribute NKr189.5m to the modernisation
programme, to allow the yard's workforce to expand by 100 to 250 employees
by 1995, and provide an additional 150 jobs as local spin-offs from the
yard's remotely-situated operations. Syd Varanger had planned to close the
yard.
Kvaerner Kimek will derive an estimated 80 per cent of this year's NKr150m
budgeted turnover from Russia, where it has a well-established market
concentrating primarily on modernisation and maintenance of the Russian
fishing fleet.
Since 1988, when Kvaerner acquired the Govan yard in Scotland from British
Shipbuilders, it has had an almost insatiable appetite for shipyard
acquisitions.
Its investment in shipbuilding expansion in the last four years has reached
an estimated NKr1.3bn.
In 1990 it acquired Masa-yards in Finland. Earlier this year it bought a
ship-repair yard in Gibraltar and a group of Norwegian yards. Last month the
group took control of the Warnow shipyard in eastern Germany for NKr4m in a
deal which propelled it to the position as Europe's biggest shipbuilder.
In 1991 shipbuilding accounted for one-third of the group's total NKr18.66bn
revenue. In the first nine months of this year the shipbuilding division
boosted operating revenue to NKr4.14bn from NKr3.9bn last year as profits
rose to NKr494m from NKr339m.

<TEXT>
CARTER Holt Harvey (CHH), New Zealand's biggest forestry group, has reported
a 12.4 per cent rise in net profits to NZDollars 112.4m (USDollars 61m) for
the first half to September 30 from NZDollars 84.9m a year earlier, in spite
of bitter and prolonged strikes at four of its forest products plants.
Mr David Oskin - who manages CHH for International Paper, the leading US
paper manufacturer, and Brierley Investments, the New Zealand holding
company, which jointly own 32 per cent of the company - said the result was
also achieved in spite of increasingly competitive markets.
He said that all CHH's main operating sectors traded at or above
expectations and all costs relating to the strikes had been included in the
figures. He did not give a profit forecast for the year, saying this
depended on international commodity prices. There were some good signs, but
pulp and paper prices remained a concern.
Mr Oskin said that during the past six months a new management team at CHH
had continued to reorientate the company into a focused and strongly
positioned forestry group. This work was near completion, and beginning to
be reflected in earnings.
Pre-tax profits rose 63 per cent to NZDollars 79.4m from NZDollars 48.8m.
Copec, the group's Chilean offshoot, contributed NZDollars 37.3m, down from
NZDollars 43.3m. Sales slipped to NZDollars 1.23bn from NZDollars 1.23bn.
Mr Oskin said the forestry and wood product sector was showing better
results. The falling availability of North American softwoods and tropical
hardwoods was becoming apparent in the Pacific area leading to higher sales
of the company's pine. The 4 cents a share interim dividend compared with 6
cents.
CHH delayed for the second week running an announcement on the outcome of
the NZDollars 400m sale of its Sealord fisheries division. There are two
bidders: a consortium of Maori interests and Brierley Investments and a
group led by Royal Greenland, a Danish fishing company.

<TEXT>
BANK Summa, one of Indonesia's 10 largest private banks, which is
privately-owned by the Soeryadjaya family, was suspended by the country's
central bank from clearing operations on Friday.
Meanwhile two tranches of shares in Astra International, the Indonesian
automotive group which dominates the country's stock exchange and is
majority owned by the Soeryadjaya family, were sold on Friday for Dollars
197m.
Bankers said the disposals were precipitated by Bank Summa's problems and
appear to indicate that the Soeryadjaya family were reducing their holding
in Astra. The buyers of the shares are not known.
Following the suspension Dr Adrianus Mooy, governor of the central bank, met
with President Suharto on Saturday to discuss, bankers believe, the possible
ramifications of Bank Summa's financial problems for the banking sector.
Bank Summa has been hit by a fall in the value of its property portfolio and
bankers say it needs a cash-injection of up to Dollars 600m.
Bank Summa officials said on Friday they hoped to resume clearing operations
today.
Astra has stressed that its finances and those of Bank Summa are separate.
In September, Mr William Soeryadjaya, the founder chairman of Astra stepped
down and was replaced by Mr Sumitro Djojohadikusomo, a former economics
minister and an associate of President Suharto.
Astra is Indonesia's second largest company with a market capitalisation of
Dollars 1.2bn.
It has suffered this year from a sharp decline in car sales and brokers
estimate 1992 net profits at about Rp74bn (Dollars 35.7m), as against
Rp210bn last year.
Brokers say that 20m shares went to a foreign buyer and a similar number to
a domestic purchaser on Friday.
Astra announced two months ago that Toyota of Japan would take a stake, but
Toyota yesterday denied that it had purchased any Astra shares.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUMANA, one of the largest hospital and healthcare companies in the US, is
to stop paying dividends next year. The news sent its shares sliding by
almost 17 per cent on Friday.
Humana linked the pay-out halt to its plans to split the business into two
separate companies. Its healthcare management business is being spun off
from its chain of 78 hospitals in the US and Europe.
The company gave few clues as to why the dividend was being suspended after
the payment due on February 1, merely saying that it would 'provide the
resources for taking advantage of opportunities post spin-off, whatever they
may be'.
Many institutional investors, which had held Humana stock partly for its
dividend, rushed to sell after the announcement. The shares were the most
actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday and closed down
Dollars 4 at Dollars 19 7/8 .
Humana has disappointed Wall Street over the past year with lower earnings
and reported a Dollars 166m loss for the quarter ended on August 31 after
hefty one-time charges related to the spin-off.
The company's hospitals appear to have been hurt by anger among doctors
forced to accept discounted fees from the health management side of the
business.
The physicians have been sending lucrative patients to rival hospitals. The
spin-off is intended to reduce this friction between the two sides of the
business.
However, analysts are at a loss to explain the reasons for the dividend
elimination, pointing out that the company enjoys strong cash flow from its
hospitals.

to Pounds 300m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASDA, the UK supermarket group, has arranged a Pounds 300m (Dollars 453m)
three-year facility to replace a higher-priced multi-option facility first
arranged in 1989, as part of an effort to improve its financial position.
Following its acquisition of 60 Gateway superstores for Pounds 704m in 1989,
the company has been struggling under a mountain of debt.
The latest refinancing represents an important stage in Asda's efforts to
bring its finances under control. The size of the facility has been
increased by Pounds 50m from Pounds 250m, and the maturity is being extended
by a year. In addition, the margin over the London interbank offered rate
has been cut from around 100 basis points to 85 basis points, reflecting the
company's improving financial position. National Westminster Bank and Swiss
Bank Corp are the arrangers.
The facility was last amended in October 1991 at the time of Asda's rights
issue, which has been seen as a turning point in the company's recovery
after it had lost its way in the mid-1980s.
Asda is also asking the banks to loosen some restrictive covenants.
Last month, Asda sold two development sites and one store for Pounds 57m.

FT  16 NOV 92 / International Company News: From bad guys to good guys - As
South Africa embraces Ansbacher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BARRY Swart, managing director of the First National Bank of South Africa
said: 'We are being targetted as the big bad guys back home'.
Mr Swart, who is in London to oversee the group's takeover of the UK
merchant bank Ansbacher, is frequently asked by people back home why he
bought a UK bank when there are not enough branches in the South African
townships.
The brutal answer, replies Mr Swart, is that without a London base, he would
not have been able to service his domestic multi-national clients, such as
the Anglo-American Corporation, which are expanding overseas.
Ever since 1986, when its British parent Barclays disinvested from South
Africa, Mr Swart has wanted to open a UK branch.
He explained that since South Africa was having problems making its debt
repayments the Bank of England refused to let First National open a branch
in the UK.
Then last year the Bank of England informed Mr Swart that there would be no
objection if First National formed a UK subsidiary. Unlike a branch a
subsidiary has its own resources and capital which to a large extent would
be ring-fenced from the parent.
With the green light from the Bank of England, First National immediately
started to look at potential UK acquisitions.
Ansbacher became an obvious choice because its biggest shareholder Pargesa
Holdings, the Swiss investment group, was keen to sell its 62 per cent
shareholding.
The South Africans also noticed that Ansbacher's management did not want to
sell out to their rival, Singer &amp; Friedlander, whom they suspected wanted to
buy Ansbacher in order to get their hands on the bank's strong balance
sheet.
Last week First National's offer, which values Ansbacher at Pounds 57.8m,
was declared unconditional with 92.3 per cent of shareholders' acceptances.
Mr Swart, who has replaced Mr Richard Fenhalls as Ansbacher's chairman, is
adamant that he does not want to turn the UK merchant bank into a South
African satellite. 'We are not trying to put a Johannesburg bank in London'
he says.
Although the non-executive directors appointed to Ansbacher's board by the
majority shareholders have all resigned, First National does not intend to
make any changes to the day to day management of Ansbacher.
Mr Fenhalls, who will be replaced as chief executive at the end of June 1993
by Mr Peter Scaife, First National's general manager, will continue his
connection with Ansbacher as a non-executive director.
There will, however, be two significant operational changes.
First, corporate finance operations, which have recently earned record
levels of fee income, and foreign exchange dealing, will be expanded to
service First National's South African clients.
'We expect Ansbacher to generate much more business from South Africa' said
Mr Swart.
Second, there will be far less lending to small businesses. Mr Swart said:
'There are few advantages in competing with the big UK high street banks to
lend money.'
Ansbacher incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.23m in the year to December 31
1991, after making heavy provisions to offset losses on loans to small
businesses.
Those loans have already been reduced. The net loan book was Pounds 80.8m at
the end of September compared with Pounds 99.1m at the end of June.
Strong performances from offshore operations and asset trading resulted in a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.13m for the nine months to the end of September.
The group's capital resources were Pounds 89.5m.
Mr Swart says his immediate ambition is limited to expanding and in
increasing Ansbacher's profitability and thereby becoming known as the good
guys in the UK.

FT  16 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Broker in mass recruitment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAWRENCE KEEN, the private client stockbroker, has recruited 11 new staff
members - including three who will become directors - from rival Granville
Davies.
The move is one of the most significant mass recruitments in recent years in
the private client stockbroking business which has been shedding jobs rather
than gaining them.
Lawrence Keen was created via a management buy-out from its parent, Lawrence
Prust, in 1986 following the spin-off of its former unit trust division,
Framlington.
Mr Mark Powell, chief executive of Lawrence Keen, said the 11 include seven
fund managers and four support staff who between them had managed roughly
Pounds 200m for their former employer. The move could increase Lawrence
Keen's client base by as much as 15 per cent, he said. The broker has
roughly Pounds 1.25bn under management for 8,000 clients, mostly
individuals, small pension funds and charities.
While there is no guarantee that the recruitment will result in a shift of
clients, Mr Powell noted that key personnel in such moves have traditionally
brought their customers with them.
'This is a very personal business and continuity of care is a very important
part of the business'.
Mr Powell said he does not expect there to be any legal obstacles to such a
mass recruitment. The matter has already been discussed with executives of
Granville Davies, a firm formed following a management buy-out by staff from
Vickers da Costa.

FT  16 NOV 92 / UK Company News: GPA asks bankers to waive debt repayments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA Group, the aircraft leasing company, has confirmed that it has asked its
biggest bankers to waive debt repayments on outstanding loans of between
Dollars 800m-Dollars 900m up to September 1996.
The waiver of the debt repayments is part of the rescheduling proposals
which will be put to the group's 73 banks at a London meeting on November
23.
GPA has had to increase its bank indebtedness to pay for aircraft it has
contracted to buy from manufacturers. The group's indebtedness since March
may have increased by Dollars 2bn, giving total borrowings of around Dollars
5bn.
A Dollars 325m facility is due to be repaid in spring 1994. A 'balloon
payment' of 61 per cent of the Dollars 2.17bn corporate credit facility is
due to be repaid in September 1996.
Some 61 per cent of the principal on the Dollars 1.19bn associated companies
long-term credit facility falls a year later. A waiver of the covenant
clauses would require the agreement of two thirds of the banks.
While GPA may have difficulty in paying back principal on the debt from cash
flow it appears able to pay its interest on its debt for the foreseeable
future.
The group's banks have already made it clear that the negotiations on
waivers of debt repayments are interdependent on GPA's talks with the
aircraft manufacturers.
GPA is pressing the aircraft manufacturers to introduce greater flexibility
into their contracts.
The group is committed to spend Dollars 4.7bn by the end of 1993 on the
purchase of 146 aircraft. It has paid Dollars 954.1m in predelivery
payments, with Boeing holding 37 per cent of the payments, Airbus 29 per
cent and McDonnell Douglas 26 per cent.
Mr Jim King, GPA's vice chairman, said: 'We are very encouraged by the
positive support from the suppliers and our discussions continue'.

FT  16 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Wilshaw advances 75%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A 75 per cent advance in pre-tax profits was announced by Wilshaw, the
specialist metals and building products group, for the half year to
September 30.
On turnover up 40 per cent from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 15.3m the profit
amounted to Pounds 809,000 compared with Pounds 463,000. Mr Guy Askham, the
chairman, was confident that a further increase in profitability could be
achieved in the second half.
He said that exports and overseas sales now accounted for 65 per cent of
turnover and that the realignment of sterling against the dollar would
improve profitability in overseas markets.
The interim dividend is lifted from 0.1p to 0.15p, payable from earnings of
0.6p (0.38p).

FT  16 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Improved package could seal ITN restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEAL is close on the Pounds 30m restructuring of Independent Television
News, the news organisation now owned by the ITV companies.
The consortium led by Mr Michael Green's Carlton Communications trying to
take over ITN will today put forward an improved package to representatives
of ITN shareholders.
Although negotiations are still continuing it is likely that two of the
three big companies which will determinme the outcome of the deal, Thames
Television and Yorkshire Television, will agree to sell their shares. The
third, Granada Television, will take a significant stake in the
reconstructed company.
The initial proposal put forward last month by Carlton, Central, London
Weekend and Reuters offered Pounds 1 a share and new funds of up to Pounds
30m. ITN has a Pounds 5m a year deficit on the lease of its new central
London headquarters.
As part of the deal, the four consortium members would get 80 per cent of
ITN. Last week's deadline passed without agreement and talks began on a
revised proposal.
A number of elements are now under consideration. There will be extra money
for those who lost their franchises such as Thames. For continuing ITV
companies there will be a larger slice of shares so that Granada and a
number of other ITV companies will still have a voice in ITN.
The most important element is ITN's news supply agreement with the TV
companies which is to average Pounds 53.3m a year over five years.
Companies such as Yorkshire are only likely to sell if there is a review
after two years so they can benefit from any cost savings resulting from the
reconstruction.
There will also be debate about how the payments are phased over the five
year contract period.
Because ITN's articles of association will have to be changed for the deal,
which requires a 75 per cent majority, any two out of the three large
companies which are not members of the consortium - Thames, Granada,
Yorkshire - can block it. If the new package is endorsed by the ITN board
tommorow it will go to the Independent Television Commission for approval on
Thursday.

FT  16 NOV 92 / UK Company News: A big boost for UK cable television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK cable television industry has received a significant financial boost
 -the first substantial injection of equity from US financial institutions.
EM Warburg Pincus and Bankers Trust are investing up to Pounds 70m in the UK
cable and telephone operations of the Comcast Corporation, which has around
2.8m cable television subscribers in the US.
The new investors will take a controlling stake in Comcast UK, although they
will not become involved managerially.
Cable television has developed slowly in the UK, mainly because of the
difficulty of raising the appropriate long-term finance.
Comcast is one of the UK's largest cable operators, with franchises covering
more than 1m homes, mainly in London and Birmingham.
The new finance will be used to help complete networks designed to offer
television and telephone services and possible acquisitions.
By July the number of homes subscribing to modern cable networks had risen
to more than 330,000 - an increase of 13.5 per cent over the previous three
months.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Global games war rageson the small screen: The fight for
lucrative share of the video entertainment market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mario, the moustachioed plumber of Nintendo video games fame, weaves his way
under shooting fireballs to escape the clutches of his formidable opponent,
Sonic the Hedgehog. Will the fearless Mario outwit the pursuer let loose by
Nintendo's main rival Sega? Or will there be a showdown culminating in the
destruction of one or the other or both?
The battle between Mario and Sonic is not available on any video game. It is
being fought on shop shelves between the two companies which dominate the
market - Nintendo, the Goliath of video games, and Sega, its main
competitor.
The games war promises to be particularly nasty this Christmas season as
Sega, a relative latecomer, blasts ahead in its effort to break Nintendo's
dominance over game addicts.
At stake is the Dollars 14bn (Pounds 9.2bn) video games market, one of the
few sectors that has seen double-digit growth amid the economic gloom in
industrialised countries. Turnover in the UK is expected to nearly double
from Pounds 550m this year to Pounds 1bn in 1993. 'For a whole generation of
kids video games have superseded pop and rock music as a form of
entertainment,' says Mr Chris Anderson, managing director of Future
Publishing, which publishes specialist magazines on video games.
Already 40 per cent of homes in Japan and 30 per cent in the US have some
kind of games console, according to Mr Philip Ley, marketing director of
Sega Europe. But Europe has been slower to catch the video games fever. At
the beginning of the year France had the highest household penetration in
Europe of 12 per cent, says Mr Stuart Dinsey, editor of Computer Trade
Weekly.
However, Nintendo and Sega are planning to take the European market by
storm.
For the Christmas selling season both are launching massive advertising
campaigns in a no-holds-barred bid to claim what market share they can.
In addition to sponsoring the European Football Championships on British
television, Sega has launched an Dollars 11m campaign to coincide with its
latest product launch in the US.
Not to be outdone, Nintendo, which has several tie-ups with fast-food and
other companies, is spending heavily in the UK in the last three months of
the year.
Market share is crucial in the video games market as an established base of
hardware owners drives software sales. And software is where the profits
will increasingly come from. Every hardware unit sold generates an average
six software sales costing Pounds 30 each.
Although Nintendo's pre-eminence in the global video games market is not yet
in serious trouble, the contest is increasingly close. Nintendo is still
well ahead of Sega in worldwide sales of its hand-held machines, Game Boy,
and in static consoles that connect to the TV.
However, by bringing state-of-the-art technology to the market ahead of its
rival, Sega has managed, in spite of its later entry, to pose a formidable
challenge to its competitor. 'The way Sega has come back against Nintendo is
the biggest-ever corporate fight-back in history,' says Mr Greg Ingham,
publisher of Future Publishing.
Sega trumped Nintendo when it launched the Mega Drive (known as Genesis in
the US), its games console which uses 16-bit technology and can therefore
play faster games than the previous-generation 8-bit technology.
The Mega Drive brought Sega neck and neck with Nintendo in the US and
Nintendo's worldwide market share has slipped from more than 80 per cent a
few years ago to about 70 per cent today.
But Nintendo is fighting back with its own 16-bit Super Nintendo
Entertainment System, and is expected to claw back market share from Sega.
'The general feeling is that Nintendo will grind (Sega's share) down by
Christmas,' Mr Dinsey says.
Europe, where Nintendo has slipped behind Sega, is witnessing one of the
fiercest offensives.
Nintendo is catching up with Sega's installed base of 600,000 Mega Drives in
the UK, (expected to rise to 965,000 by year-end) with a forecast 650,000
Super Nintendos sold by Christmas.
Meanwhile, Sega has taken the battle into yet another state-of-the-art
technology by announcing it will launch a CD-Rom attachment for the Mega
Drive using compact discs to store games.
CD-Rom, which will bring a leap in storage capacity, and improved speed and
quality in the games, is seen as the format of the future.
Nintendo, which is not launching a games system using CD-Rom until next
summer, is once again finding itself a step behind Sega.
Software support will be a factor in the outcome of the battle between the
two, and the ability to develop hardware technologies fast enough to drive
software innovations.
Nintendo has greater software support but Sega has been ahead in bringing
hardware developments to the market. 'The contest is too close to call,' is
the verdict of Mr Anderson.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Barclays responds to concern over top job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDREW Buxton, chief executive of Barclays Bank, has acknowledged for the
first time that shareholders in Britain's biggest bank are concerned about
his additional appointment as chairman, creating a dual role which, he said
yesterday, would be 'kept under review'.
In his first public statement since the concern surfaced, Mr Buxton said he
intended to become chairman as planned on January 1, when Sir John Quinton
retires.
However, he said the board would then assess whether the combination of
positions was working to the bank's advantage. 'You have to pay attention to
what shareholders think. I am not going to oppose the feelings of
shareholders,' he said.
Separately, it also emerged that Barclays is likely to make a provision of
around Pounds 100m in its results for the second half of 1992 to cover the
risk of losses on a Pounds 350m loan to Imry, the privately owned property
group. Barclays has already made provisions of around Pounds 140m to cover
losses on that loan, but the bank believes that further provisions are
likely because of continued deterioration in the property market.
Mr Buxton said he was not closely involved in the decisions to lend to Imry.
He disclosed that Barclays was about to start closing high street branches
at a 'significantly' faster pace than the current rate of 100 a year in
order to cut costs. An announcement is likely in the coming weeks.
He said the closures will lead to a greater cut in staff numbers in the UK
banking operations than the 15,000 cut which was originally planned for the
four years from January 1991. Discussions with BIFU, the banking union, are
taking place.
Barclays US operations are being re-organised to concentrate on investment
banking. All North American operations, including lending to big companies,
are likely to trade under the name of BZW. A decision to stop using the
Barclays name in the US was likely to be made in the next two months, a
senior Barclays executive said.
Barclays will also reduce its involvement in lending to big US companies. It
will only lend if the borrower buys BZW's investment banking services.
Mr Buxton said the subject of the combination of the chairman and chief
executive roles comes up 'at every meeting' he has with institutional
shareholders. But he added that shareholders understood Barclays'
arrangements to ensure that there are limits to the power he holds. On the
other hand, he said: 'I am not surprised the issue refuses to die'.
A report on corporate governance from a committee chaired by Sir Adrian
Cadbury recommended the separation of the chairman and chief executive
roles.

FT  16 NOV 92 / GM in mutual aidplan with suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors, the US carmaker undergoing a radical restructuring, is
trying to entice some of its parts manufacturers into an unusual form of
co-operation, which would involve the suppliers setting up operations inside
GM plants and using GM labour.
The scheme, which GM calls 'strategic insourcing', would help the company to
slash costs in its loss-making North American operations.
It is being put forward by Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who was
appointed earlier this year as GM's head of worldwide purchasing. Mr Lopez
has demanded that many GM suppliers cut their prices, but he offers
long-term supply contracts to those that meet the quality specifications.
The insourcing scheme covers certain high quality suppliers which GM is
prepared to offer additional business.
Mr Lopez has proposed that these companies be given factory space free of
charge in under-used GM plants, rather than expanding their own facilities.
In return, the supplier would agree to employ GM workers currently in the
company's jobs bank.
The bank, which is part of GM's three-year labour agreement with the United
Auto Workers union, guarantees UAW members who are laid off full pay
indefinitely.
The workers would remain GM employees but would be paid by the suppliers at
the prevailing GM union wage rates - which in general are higher than those
of non-unionised supplier companies.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Investors optimistic about US growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE quarters of Britain's leading institutional investors are more
optimistic about the prospects for US growth in the next 12 months following
Mr Bill Clinton's victory in the presidential election, according to a
Gallup survey for stockbrokers Smith New Court.
For the first time in a year the investors have declared an intention to
increase rather than decrease their holdings of US equities.
The fund managers continue to be more interested in increasing holdings of
UK equities than UK gilts. In three months time they anticipate the FTSE-100
index will stand at 2745 - it closed at 2697.5 on Friday - and in a year
they anticipate 2973.
The survey suggests there is less investor concern about inflation in the
UK. The investors' forecast of the 12-month inflation rate by the end of
1993 has fallen to 3.7 per cent from 4 per cent last month. Base rates are
forecast to fall to 6 per cent in a year's time.
The survey of 103 institutions handling Pounds 611bn of funds was carried
out before the chancellor's mini-budget on Thursday. The investors believed
average earnings will increase by 4 per cent over the next 12 months, the
lowest forecast for over a year.
For the first time since Smith New Court started the survey two years ago,
the investors have decided to reduce their holdings of Japanese equities.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Economics Notebook: Learning from September's currency
crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Norman Lamont's Autumn Statement did nothing to dispel the growing
impression that it will be a long time indeed before Britain rejoins the
European exchange rate mechanism. But the chancellor and his advisers would
be well advised to keep an eye on the ERM in the months ahead. For while
there is now less UK enthusiasm for detecting ERM 'fault lines' and pressing
for the system's fundamental reform, other members have started to draw
lessons from September's crisis. If and when the UK returns, the ERM could
be rather different to the system which Britain left on Black Wednesday.
At the very least, realignment procedures will have to be overhauled to
avoid any repetition of the events of September 12 and 13. That weekend
Germany sought a broad realignment of currencies but the end result was a
devaluation of the Italian lira only.
Recent contacts between the Commons Treasury and Civil Service select
committee and the Bundesbank have produced a plausible explanation as to how
Mr Lamont and the Treasury could insist that Britain's EC partners did not
seek a devaluation of sterling that weekend while the Bundesbank and German
finance ministry thought that they had asked for this.
It seems that the request was never passed on to London. Why not is a
question that should be put to Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, chairman of the EC
monetary committee and director-general of the French Treasury. It was his
job on the Saturday to sound out the EC member states about a realignment
after Bonn had initiated negotiations for such a move at the request of the
Bundesbank.
The reason for the apparent communications breakdown can only be guessed at.
It may be that Mr Trichet did not understand Bonn's intention. Perhaps he
had been convinced by the British government's earlier protestations that
sterling would not be devalued. However, European monetary officials have
also pointed out that the French franc would have been immediately in the
firing line if sterling as well as the lira devalued that weekend. With the
September 20 Maastricht referendum still a week away, it would have been
difficult to fend off speculative attacks against the franc.
The speculation against the ERM in September was unprecedented. Bundesbank
intervention in support of the lira, sterling and French franc reached
DM92bn (Pounds 38bn). In spite of the promises of a new openness in UK
economic policy, we may never know the true scale of the Bank of England's
efforts to prop up the pound. But they were huge.
Foreign exchange dealers throughout the world found that the UK central bank
was a ready buyer of sterling in the days of crisis leading to Black
Wednesday. Indeed, as the crisis unfolded, banks in Germany were seen to be
channelling their sales of sterling through London to the Bank rather than
to the Bundesbank in Frankfurt.
The flattering explanation for this phenomenon is that London is the world's
premier foreign exchange centre and more efficient than Frankfurt. Another
reason might be that the Bundesbank makes life a little bit harder for the
speculator than does the Bank of England.
The Bundesbank insists that banks selling foreign currency to it must have
collateral in the form of securities on deposit with one Germany's state
central banks.
These securities are the 'Lombard' which German banks can also use as
collateral for obtaining emergency liquidity from the Bundesbank. If a bank
sells sterling to the Bundesbank, the transaction is counted against the
Lombard to cover the settlement risk that arises in the two days between the
Bundesbank handing over the D-Marks and accepting the foreign currency from
the bank with which it does the deal.
It is unclear in practice how much of a deterrent these rules are to the
determined speculator. The Bank of England thinks that they do not make much
difference. But the authorities in Frankfurt feel that it gave them an
advantage in slowing the process of speculation compared with the Bank of
England, which has no such system.
Germany, like the UK, professes a firm belief in the freedom of financial
markets and is a firm opponent of capital controls. But the temptation to
throw some sand in the works of speculation was strong, not least because
September crisis cost the Bundesbank dear. Some estimates put its potential
losses at between DM1bn and DM2bn: an embarrassingly large sum when Mr Theo
Waigel, German finance minister, is expending political capital trying to
reduce public spending and Germany's huge budget deficit.
The losses have arisen because, under the rules of the European Monetary
System, the Ecu is the denominator for operations in the EMS intervention
and credit mechanisms and a means of settlement between the monetary
authorities of the EC.
During September's crisis, other central banks borrowed from the Bundesbank
to support their currencies. To the extent that these debts are not
denominated in D-Marks, they will be repaid in Ecu which have been devalued
substantially by the large downward movements of the floating pound and lira
since September 16.
These losses - and Germany's dominance of the EMS since the crisis - will
reinforce the determination of Frankfurt and Bonn to toughen up the rules by
which the EMS operates.
It is likely that Germany's arguments in support of more timely and less
disruptive realignments will be more influential. Countries with
fundamentally weak economies will be less able in future to treat the EMS as
a de facto monetary union.
On the other hand, nations in the 'inner core' of the EMS, whose aspirations
and economic performance match and in some cases better those of Germany,
need expect no discouragement from Bonn or Frankfurt if they seek to create
a monetary union of limited size later in this decade.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Ministers accuse Labour of 'muck-raking' on Iraq arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR MINISTERS accused Labour of 'muck-raking' in its attempts to put Mr
John Major in the dock over the sale of defence related material to Iraq, as
the political storm about the Matrix Churchill prosecution entered its
second week.
The opposition warned that pressure on the government would increase rather
than diminish. Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade secretary, said he would
produce today further 'damning evidence' linking the prime minister with the
affair.
Speaking on BBC radio, Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, said there
seemed to be a concerted effort by the opposition to tarnish Mr Major as in
the case of the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
He noted that Mr Major had been cleared in the Bingham report into the
collapse.
Similarly, in an interview on the Walden television programme, Mr John
MacGregor, the transport secretary, expressed confidence that the government
would be vindicated in the independent judicial inquiry announced last
Tuesday, and accused opposition parties of 'an attempt to muck-rake in the
hope that the initial allegations will stick in the public mind'.
In a move that underlines how seriously the government is taking the issue,
Mr Major issued on Saturday a vigorous defence of his role in the Matrix
Churchill affair, saying that Mr Cook should confine his comments 'to fact
and not innuendo'.
Mr Major said that while he was foreign secretary briefly in 1989 he had not
been told of the row between junior ministers about exports to Iraq, nor had
he been briefed to raise the matter with Mr Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi foreign
minister, whom he met in September 1989.
While Labour concentrates on Mr Major's role as foreign secretary, some of
the most recent revelations highlight the fact that the government was
clearing export licences for the last batch of Matrix Churchill machine
tools the very day before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
Denying any government attempt at a 'cover up', ministers emphasised that
the inquiry into the affair, to be headed by Lord Justice Scott, would be
wide enough to enable the investigation of all the issues raised. The terms
of reference are expected to be announced this week.
Among Tory backbenchers, the main concern appears to be the way that Customs
and Excise were able to proceed independently with the Matrix Churchill
prosecutions despite the knowledge within government that the executives on
trial had been working for the security services, rather than the details of
the sale of machine tools to Iraq.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday called for an
emergency Commons debate on the arms-for-Iraq affair. MPs have, however,
lost an immediate opportunity to discuss the issue, because last week the
Liberal Democrats did not choose the affair for debate today - one of the
rare occasions when opposition parties decide what the Commons discusses.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Britain breaks rules on satellite TV, says Brussels

THE European Commission says Britain is breaking EC law by imposing too many
controls on continental European television programmes broadcast into the UK
by satellite.
In a letter to the UK government, Mr Martin Bangemann, the internal market
commissioner, has given London two months to respond to the charge that
Britain's 1990 Broadcasting Act could hinder free circulation of television
programmes in the EC.
The letter, sent on November 3, is the first of three stages which could
lead to the UK being taken to the European Court of Justice for not applying
the EC's 'television without frontiers' directive properly. However,
Commission officials said Brussels was more likely to take a softly-softly
approach to ensure compliance.
Writing on behalf of the Commission, Mr Bangemann also ob-jects to the BBC's
April 1981 Licence and Agreement, which he says imposes a discriminatory
'national quota' by insisting on 'proper proportions of . . . programmes of
British origin and British performance'. The EC directive calls for a
majority of broadcasting time to be devoted to 'European works'.
Similar letters have been sent to all 12 EC member states, some of which
have not even tried to implement the directive. The Commission has accused
France of discriminating against foreign broadcasters and has alleged that
Italy has broken the rules on television advertising.
The directive - a foundation of the EC's audiovisual policy - came into
force in October 1991, two years after adoption by member states. It sets
minimum standards to regulate advertising and protect children from
broadcast pornography, violence and racism. Member states can impose
stricter standards on their own broadcasters but cannot hamper cross-border
TV services from other countries if they meet the minimum EC rules.
The Commission's main objection to the UK's Broadcasting Act is that it is
too strict on foreign satellite and cable broadcasters transmitting into the
UK, and too relaxed about broadcasts from the UK into other member states.
Brussels believes the act could force foreign satellite and cable
broadcasters to obtain a licence from the Independent Television Commission
in the UK, even if already authorised by another member state. This is an
illegal 'second control', according to the Commission. It also says that
broadcasters transmitting to member states outside the UK would not have to
comply with British law and would escape any EC regulation.
British officials said the directive had been properly implemented. 'If
nobody's managed to implement it correctly, it can't be much of a
directive,' said one critic.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Italy plans bank privatisations: Government aims to raise
Pounds 13bn in wide-ranging sell-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government is planning a radical reduction in state control of
the Italian banking and financial system as the central feature of a
far-reaching privatisation programme submitted to parliament at the weekend.
The programme is intended to raise L27,000bn (Pounds 13.1bn) over the next
three years through divestments by ENI, the state oil concern, Enel, the
electricity authority and INA, the insurance institute. In August these
groups became publicly quoted companies owned by the Treasury
The plan, prepared by six prominent economists and bankers in conjunction
with the Treasury, will be the most extensive privatisation undertaken in
continental Europe. Until now the 4 1/2 month old government headed by prime
minister Giuliano Amato has only announced two firm privatisations - Credito
Italiano, the sixth largest commercial bank, and Nuovo Pignone, ENI's
turbines subsidiary.
The funds going to the Treasury will be separate from those raised by IRI,
Italy's state holding company, which will be used to pump fresh capital into
subsidiaries and reduce its debts of more than L60,000bn. All banking
interests held by IRI - Credito Italiano (67 per cent), Banca Commerciale
Italiano (55 per cent) and Banca di Roma (35 per cent) - will be sold within
two years. The stake in Credito alone could raise L7,000bn.
The Treasury will also seek external funding for L2,500bn-L3,000bn to
recapitalise BNL, Italy's second largest commercial bank, while selling off
its subsidiary, Efibanca. Plans are being drawn up for the sale of the
Treasury's 50 per cent stake in IMI, the financial services group, valued by
Warburgs at L4,000bn.
The state controls directly and indirectly two-thirds of the banking and
financial system. If parliament endorses the plan, the state will by 1996
have largely withdrawn from this sector and substantially reduced its
presence in others. Under the plan the Treasury would hold 'significant. . .
minority' shareholdings in the advanced engineering, air transport, banking,
chemicals, civil engineering, electricity, insurance, large-scale retailing
and telecommunications sectors.
It is intended that these residual stakes would eventually be placed in a
new publicly quoted company, with the Treasury retaining 51 per cent of the
stock. This means that IRI, Italy's largest holding company since the 1930s,
would eventually cease to exist. Mr Amato wants parliament to approve one of
three suggested methods of supervising the privatisation process.
The aim is to make extensive use of the bourse in the sell-offs. In the past
two weeks, there has been feverish speculation in several of the
state-controlled companies already quoted, prompting accusations of insider
trading.
Where necessary, the government would guarantee control through a 'golden
share'. Those interests easiest to sell off would be first, with longer
periods for companies requiring restructuring. The INA sale could begin
within six months.
The plan, leaked in part 10 days ago, has been the subject of fierce cabinet
debate. Mr Giuseppe Guarino, industry minister, argued for the government to
create one or two 'super-holdings' to retain a strong state presence. But he
was ultimately isolated and may resign.
The old guard in the ruling Christian Democrat and Socialist parties also
fought to ensure they kept political influence over the state sector. This
battle is likely to continue in parliament.

FT  16 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: PSBR funding
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The gilt market should not be too disappointed at the chancellor's failure
in his Autumn Statement to relax the full funding rules. It would not have
been enough simply to declare that bank and building society purchases of
gilts would count towards PSBR funding. To make much difference, these
institutions would also have to be large scale buyers of government paper.
There is not much evidence that the advent of a positive yield curve has
given them much incentive in this respect - in contrast to the behaviour of
banks in the US.
Part of the reason is institutional. Banks and building societies
traditionally look to gilt market investment more for liquidity management
than profit. There may now be some temptation to step up gilt purchases,
especially given stagnating loan demand, but the margins for banks are
skimpy. Indeed, three month sterling has been higher than the redemption
yield on 5 year gilts for much of the period since Black Wednesday. To earn
a decent margin banks would have to move out along the maturity spectrum -
to a point where the risk of capital loss was now arguably greater than it
was before the devaluation.
Net bank and building society purchases of gilts were only Pounds 875m in
1991-92 and Pounds 980m in the first half of the current year. Allowing such
purchases to count as funding would not make a large dent in the PSBR. Nor,
unless the yield curve grows much steeper, can UK banks expect the kind of
windfall profits from government securities which have allowed US banks to
rebuild their capital after the ravages of the recession.

FT  16 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Southern Electric
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Southern Electric's decision to postpone its results until mid-December is
good for transparency. By then the market should have clearer idea of the
regulator's thinking on the vexed issue of electricity supply contracts.
With an interest in three gas-fired generation projects, Southern is
arguably the most exposed of all the regional companies. One danger is that
Professor Littlechild may decide to put gas-fired power to the test of the
market by denying Southern the right to pass on higher costs to customers.
The company would then have to swallow the difference between the
electricity pool price and the cost of gas-fired power. The cost of
gas-fired power is, of course, at the heart of the argument. Yet if
independent estimates are anything to go by, shareholders have not much
reason to flinch. Southern's Barking power project is reckoned to produce
electricity at around 2.8p per kilowatt hour. With the pool price currently
at 2.5p, covering the difference would have only a minor impact. The damage
would get worse if the pool price declined. But even on worst-case sums
Southern's profit would be cut by little more than 15 per cent. Dividend
growth would be secure, although cover might fall from around 3 times to 2.5
times.
Little wonder that the shares have enjoyed strong support despite the
uncertainty. Southern will, however, have won no friends among cash-hungry
fund managers by pushing its dividend payment into the New Year. That alone
may explain the 2 per cent fall in the shares last week on the day the
results were postponed.

FT  16 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BT will not be alone in making additional payments to its pension fund next
year. Low dividend growth from investments and an ageing population have
left an increasing number of funds in need of a top-up. On a rough
calculation, around 10m people pay into pension schemes from an average wage
of Pounds 12,000. Employers normally contribute about 10 per cent,
suggesting a total bill of Pounds 12bn if no holidays are taken. Quoted
companies account for around half of this, or Pounds 6bn in a normal year.
Since something like 50 per cent of all pension schemes are receiving no
contributions from employers, companies will have to find an extra Pounds
3bn a year once the holiday is over.
The impact on reported profits will be much less. BT is likely to pay an
additional Pounds 200m into its pension fund next year, but earnings will be
unaffected. Accounting standards mean that, in most cases, changes in
pension contributions are smoothed over the remaining working life of
employees, an average 16 years in BT's case.
If the sums are anything like correct, though, UK companies will have to
find additional cash equivalent to 10 per cent of total dividend payments.
For some companies at least, this will be another drag on dividend growth.
The spread of damage will become clearer next year. Pension funds revalued
this year benefited from strong dividend growth in 1989-90. Funds taking a
three-yearly revaluation in March 1993 will not be so lucky. It is one more
reason to take a close look at cash flow statements.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Securing a decent distribution network is crucial to the success of any
insurer. That is why last week's fine by the regulatory organisation Lautro
on Guardian Royal Exchange will not be lost on the rest of the industry. At
issue is the future of tied agents, or appointed representatives, to give
them their polite title - those insurance salesmen who trade under their own
name but who exclusively offer the products of one company.
GRE's record fine is a reminder that while independent advisers and direct
sales forces have not escaped the wrath of the regulators, tied agents have
presented the biggest headaches in the wake of the 1986 Financial Services
Act. Life insurers initially fell over each other to sign them up, as
polarisation forced intermediaries to choose between genuine independence
and attachment to a single supplier.
Golden hellos, subsidised development loans and commission advances were
features of a typical introductory package. More recently, however,
disillusion has set in. According to Lautro, 10 per cent of tied agents on
its register were removed in the 12 months to June as companies took a more
hard-headed look at the costs associated with these relationships.
Low quality business and the complexities of supervision have been among the
life companies' complaints. So are embarrassing knuckle wraps from the
regulator for inadequate monitoring, of which GRE's is only one example. To
be fair to the agents, Lautro is flexing its muscles and some of the
fall-out is recession-related. The trend towards direct sales forces,
though, shows no sign of slowing.

FT  16 NOV 92 / The incredible shrinking industrial base: Tony Jackson
assesses whether services can compensate for the decline of manufacturing in
Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a fair rule of thumb that whenever the British start extolling the
virtues of manufacturing, their economy is in trouble. It is thus a measure
of the depths of the present recession that in recent weeks members of the
government, from the prime minister down, have gone out of their way to
insist that manufacturing is close to their hearts. As usual, there is
corresponding contempt for the notion that the British can earn their living
from services: 'dressing in smocks', as a chairman of ICI once put it, 'and
showing tourists round medieval castles'.
The British bias towards manufacturing is partly a matter of history. The UK
economy was built on it, as the trade and industry secretary, Mr Michael
Heseltine, assured British industrialists last week. And as British
manufacturing has lost ground in a world context, so too has the British
economy.
The experience of the 1980s has added an extra twist. In the last recession,
the service industries of London and the south-east emerged relatively
unscathed. This time they have taken a hammering. Services, in the popular
imagination, now consist of yuppies in red braces, and estate agents. They
are not real and solid like manufacturing. They cannot be relied on when the
going gets rough.
A refinement of this view, repeatedly advanced at last week's conference of
the Confederation of British Industry at Harrogate, is that manufacturing
has absolute priority because services depend on manufacturing for a living.
A moment's reflection suggests this is nonsense. When Tesco decides to build
a new superstore or Forte a new hotel, the construction industry is being
driven by the demand for services. When the City of London went through its
Big Bang in 1986, one immediate result was a huge increase in demand for
computing equipment. Manufacturing and services, in short, depend on each
other.
They are also becoming increasingly difficult to unscramble. The point is
neatly illustrated in a recent publication from the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development*. Perhaps the archetypal manufacturing
company is General Motors of the US. One of its biggest suppliers is not a
steel or components company, but the health insurer Blue Cross-Blue Shield.
One of GM's biggest products is financial services, in the form of loans and
insurance to dealers and customers.
It is also easy to exaggerate how far services have supplanted manufacturing
as a source of British jobs. Granted, there has been a steady fall in the
proportion of the workforce employed in manufacturing. But over the last
decade the same is true of almost every country in the developed world,
including Japan and Germany. Of the 24 industrialised countries included in
the OECD, the UK ranks sixth - above the US or France - in the proportion of
its workers employed in manufacturing.
Unfortunately, this does not mean that the UK does not have a problem. It is
one thing to produce the same amount of manufactured goods with fewer
people. It is quite another to produce fewer goods than the population
consumes. For at least 40 years, the UK's balance of trade in manufacturing
has been in remorseless decline. In the early 1980s the balance slipped into
deficit, and has been there ever since. Somehow or other the British
appetite for imported goods has to be paid for. Can the export of services
do the job?
Judging by the historical record, the answer is definitely no. In 1990, the
UK exported Pounds 5.2bn more of services than it imported. This sounds
impressive, but in fact amounts to just under 1 per cent of national income.
Twenty years before, the proportion was almost identical. It is very welcome
that British services can hold their own in the world and contribute a
consistent surplus. But the surplus seems in real terms to be static, while
manufacturing continues to decline.
This raises the obvious question of whether the performance in services can
realistically be expected to improve. Judging by international comparisons,
the answer once again seems to be no.
Among the nations making up the OECD, it is a curious and revealing fact
that the half-dozen showing the slowest growth over the past 30 years have
all had faster growth in services than in manufacturing over the period. The
fastest-growing countries have all been the other way round.
The point is illustrated with particular starkness in the case of the UK.
Its growth in services - technically, growth in added value in services,
adjusted for inflation - was higher than in several other OECD countries, at
3.2 per cent a year over the 30-year period. Its growth in manufacturing, on
the other hand, was the lowest in the OECD, at 1.4 per cent a year. It
scarcely seems a coincidence that growth in its economy overall - 2.4 per
cent a year - was the lowest in the OECD as well.
This phenomenon is a little tricky to explain. But there may be a clue in
the fact that the worst-performing countries in those 30 years - the UK,
Sweden, Denmark, Germany, the US - were mature economies in the first place,
while the best performers - Japan, Turkey, Greece, Spain - were not. In
other words, the countries which were poorest at the outset grew the
fastest. As the phenomenal economic performance of China in the past decade
suggests, growth is a lot easier to achieve when it starts from a low base.
But it is also more readily achieved in manufacturing. The reason is a
familiar one: that it is much easier to improve productivity in
manufacturing than it is in services. The output of a shop-floor worker can
be hugely increased by the introduction of machinery. It is not so easy to
do the same with a lawyer or a hairdresser.
The point is once more borne out by OECD statistics. In the period 1979-90,
real added value per person employed in manufacturing in the OECD rose by an
average 2.9 per cent a year. In services, the figure was just 0.7 per cent.
The conclusion from all this is obvious and faintly depressing. The only
solution to the decline in Britain's manufacturing performance lies in the
reversal of that decline. But it would be wrong to suppose that Britain is
in this respect unique. Just as the UK was to a large extent the birthplace
of manufacturing, so its manufacturing base is the first to show signs of
age. But many of the same signs are present in the US. They are also
starting to appear in Germany. Some would even argue that they are
detectable in Japan. The question of whether the UK can reverse its decline
therefore has a wider relevance.
Given the forces of history, the chances of such a reversal might seem
negligible. But this is to reckon without the globalisation of world
industry. Increasingly, manufacturing is becoming divorced from its country
of origin. For a Japanese multinational, the relevant point about the UK is
that it still possesses an industrial infrastructure and a tradition of
industrial employment. Having forgotten how to make cars and consumer
electronics, Britain is now being re-educated by others. As a recipe for
revival it might seem something of a long shot. But it may be all there is.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, For Exchem, a UK chemicals manufacturer with 500 employees, the old
central exchange rate of DM2.95 in the pound might have been a bit on the
high side. But at least there was a clear target, to become competitive at
around that rate. Today, 'freed of the straitjacket of the ERM', companies
are pressed even harder to go abroad and export. Unfortunately the pound has
not only been devalued, it has also become volatile. And we find it
uncomfortable to bet on exchange rates, even between European countries.
Trade abroad needs a long-term commitment and broadly stable prices in our
customers' currencies. And medium and small businesses are not often geared
to currency juggling. The risk premium on exchange rates and uncertainty
over raw material prices have seriously reduced the benefit of the lower
pound.
For us the volatility of exchange rates is a matter of great consequence.

Word has reached Observer of a customer revolt at Child &amp; Co, London's
oldest bank. The upmarket private bank across the road from the Law Courts
has started charging members of the founding family - patriarch the Earl of
Jersey - for the honour of looking after their money.
After enjoying free banking for over 300 years the descendants of Sir
Francis Child and the Countess of Jersey have been asked to pay Pounds 25 a
month if the balance of their account dips below Pounds 1,500. This seems an
awful lot even for members of the landed gentry.
The Royal Bank of Scotland, which owns the bank, refuses to comment. But one
scion of the family, who was 'given' his bank account at the age of 13, is
outraged. He and his father have both closed their accounts and expect
several of their relatives to follow their example.
So much for Child's motto that 'the more impersonal other banks become the
greater this business will grow'.

Eleven brave Tory MPs with the smallest majorities have formed a new dining
club, 'the marginals'.
Indeed, the new boys feel confident enough to have chosen a tie. The
background colour is 'basil' blue and the stripes are the light and dark
blues of Cambridge and Oxford - the home of 'dons'. Basildon is, of course,
the constituency of David Amess, the 40-year-old Conservative MP, whose
victory on election night marked the turn of John Major's fortunes.
However, Amess seems to have bent the club rules to get in since his 1,480
majority is not among the 11 slimmest. A precautionary move perhaps to
ensure some continuity of membership after the next election?

Meanwhile, the faces at the top of London's stockbroking firms continue to
change with unseemly speed. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew has lost two heads of
research in little more than a month, and now Mike Geering, James Capel's
research chief, is moving into fund management and Nick Whitney, a veteran
of several houses, is resurfacing as managing director of Hoare Govett,
leaving chairman Peter Meinertzhagen free to concentrate on the group's core
corporate finance business.
Of the latest moves, Whitney's could prove to be the more hazardous.
Geering, who is joining Mercury Asset Management, is treading a well worn
path. Keith Percy and Ken Inglis, two of
P &amp; D's best research bosses, have both made successful career moves into
fund management, as has Tim Ferguson, a former County NatWest research
chieftain.
Fund management may not be as well paid as running and researching equities,
but it has its advantages. Not only are there fewer conflicts of interest,
but there are fewer big egos to manage and the profits are more reliable.

When it comes to high risk professions, being a Fleet Street editor must be
among the more hazardous. Yesterday's Maxwell-cleansing reshuffle at Mirror
Group Newspapers means that ousted editor Richard Stott has the distinction
of having been editor twice of both the Daily Mirror and The People - and he
is still not 50.
Stott's departure also probably means the end of Sir Peter Parker's efforts
to head a management buy-out team since Stott had been the prime mover. The
reshuffle is also bad news for Roy Greenslade, who was fired as editor of
the Mirror by the late Robert Maxwell. Until now he has been the favourite
editor-in-waiting at the Mirror. If Heinz boss Tony O'Reilly ever does
manage to get hold of the group, Greenslade may still be in with a chance.
But it seems as if the banks, who control 54 per cent of MGN and are still
showing a hefty loss on their shares, have decided to let the new management
knock the group into shape, rather than hand the job to a new owner.

If Washington carries out its threat to impose punitive duties on white wine

minister from 1988 until this year, Evin is 'furious' with Soisson's idea.
He accuses him of undermining 'consciousness of the ravages that alcohol
wreaks in family and social life' in a country which has the highest alcohol
consumption in the world.
Untroubled, Soisson retorts that he doesn't think much about the loi Evin,
and that, as president of the Conseil General of his region, he would not be
signing decrees for its application. That region just happens to be
Burgundy. Which explains a lot. The fact that more than half of the French
wines threatened by US tariffs are white burgundies explains even more.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Letter: DTI advice plan vulnerable to weakness of British
chambers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr GISELA DAVIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader was justifiably critical of the Department of Trade and
Industry's proposal to establish a nationwide network of 200 'one-stop-shop'
advice centres for providing much-needed business support ('One stop
advice', November 2). What the DTI proposal singularly fails to appreciate
is that the strength of many of the continental European chambers of
commerce comes from the mandatory obligation on almost all local businesses
to register or become members.
Having recently returned from a visit to Germany I was much impressed by the
very extensive services provided and the support offered to its members by
the German regional chambers of commerce, be this through training, advice
or other public tasks. Much of this is only possible because of compulsory
membership and the income this generates, as membership fees are composed of
a basic fee of some DM250 and a percentage of the members' turnover.
Compulsory membership allows the chambers to be representative of a
cross-section of industry, to act in the best interest of all its members
and at the same time protects them from becoming dependent on particular
financially strong interest groupings.
In contrast, the usefulness of the DTI's proposal must be very doubtful. The
UK chambers are already faced with the problem of non-compulsory membership,
which makes them vulnerable to pressures from interest groups, financially
strong members and the threat of falling membership.
Divergence into numerous interest groupings outside the chambers of
commerce, and chamber members representing only a small proportion of all
business in a region, can only weaken the benefits that might otherwise be
available to local businesses and British business as a whole.
Your leader says that a superficial and poorly funded exercise, strong on
publicity, weak on organisation, would do a great deal of harm. It is
difficult to see how the DTI's proposal can result in anything else.
Officials would be well advised to look more closely at the approach taken
elsewhere in Europe.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Letter: Buccaneering capitalism in a not so free market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From PHILLIP OPPENHEIM MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan's defence of liberal market capitalism ('Too early for
requiem', November 9) was as eloquent as it was effective, but, sadly,
implicitly conceded the common fallacy that German and Japanese capitalism
is more 'planned' than the 'buccaneering' Anglo-American variety. I hope
that I may be allowed to deploy some simple facts to counter this.
According to OECD figures, US state funding for non-military R&amp;D runs at
about Dollars 20bn a year - a third of all civil research spending - while
the Japanese government funds just 2 per cent of its industry's research. A
World Bank survey of non-tariff barriers showed that they covered 9 per cent
of all goods in Japan - compared with 34 per cent in the US - figures
reinforced by David Henderson of the OECD, who stated that during the 1980s
the US had the worst record for devising new non-tariff barriers.
Apart from massive subsidies to the coal, steel, car and aerospace
industries since the second world war, Britain has imposed import limits on
TVs, machine tools, VCRs, pottery, cutlery, fork-lift trucks, footwear, cars
and textiles, many of which are still in force. Germany has no import quotas
on Japanese cars and is the only major European country not to impose
Multi-Fibre Arrangement textile import quotas on developing countries.
The US, incidentally, uses the MFA to restrict clothing imports from 29
countries - one of which is Japan.
Sadly, the free-market image of the US and the rhetoric of its leaders
rarely match the facts, while the interventionism and protectionism of
Germany and Japan are habitually exaggerated by politicians and
industrialists for self-serving reasons. If these policies really were the
holy grail of economic success, Brazil and India would be economic
superpowers.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Letter: Feudal system is no safeguard of London's
architectural heritage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ANNE F MAXWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Colin Amery ('London's heritage in danger', November 9) criticises the
disembowling of English Heritage with respect to its role in London and
argues that 'the delicate architectural fabric of the capital' needs special
treatment, ie a strong, independent, centralised body with the power to
direct decisions on all listed building consent applications. I agree with
this.
However, I thoroughly disagree with Mr Amery's contention that preservation
of London's architectural heritage requires retention of the feudal
leasehold system. This is an argument currently being advanced by the London
estates, the same estates that in 1967 protected their empires by arguing
'redevelopment' - the Cadogan Estate was offering at the time to knock down
and redevelop a large part of Chelsea. London should not be relying on a
group of disparate estates with differing standards and development agendas
for preservation of its architectural heritage.
This preservation argument rests on the fundamental assumption that the
people who live in flats and houses in these special parts of London would
not be concerned to protect their economic and quality of life interests.
That assumption is flawed. People who spend hundreds of thousands of pounds
to buy leases in central London where freeholds are not available are highly
unlikely to allow their interests to be compromised. The small risk of a
maverick property owner with alteration plans unsympathetic to the
neighbourhood is virtually eliminated with a central planning authority with
some teeth as advocated by Mr Amery.
The author lauds the 'remarkably high standard' to which many estate squares
and crescents are maintained. In fact, this is often the result of efforts
made by the residents. I live on a square of 20 houses. We have a residents'
association and all voluntarily contribute an annual assessment. We maintain
the garden. This past year, we organised our own exterior painting to ensure
that we had the job done efficiently and to the highest standard possible.
The estate has responsibility for maintaining the garden railings and
structures. Nothing has been done for years.
Mr Amery specifically mentions Thurloe Square. He is presumably not aware
that Thurloe Square itself is managed by a volunteer group of residents and
maintenance is funded by annual membership subscriptions.
Lastly, Mr Amery suggests that there are no 'intelligent alternative
management proposals' to the estates. Once again, he is wrong. The proposals
provide for sensible management schemes for common areas that the estates
may adopt if they choose.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Letter: Packaging unites business and environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KIT SADGROVE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is not true that there is an 'irreconcilable difference' between
industry and environmentalists over packaging. It is also wrong to say that
companies 'want to sell more packaging' (Environmental Management survey,
November 10).
Packaging is, surprisingly, an area which unites industry and
environmentalists. Companies want lighter packaging, because it reduces
their costs; and they are happy to use the recycled materials. Today, even
plastic egg box covers are made from old cola bottles.
Companies know that the consumer is suspicious of unnecessary packaging, and
this gives them another incentive to avoid waste. Hence, technology is
helping companies to reduce costs and improve the environment. Many problems
still exist; but who would have thought that packaging could give business
and environmentalists something to agree about?

FT  16 NOV 92 / Cracks behind the unity: Efforts to curb the influx of
foreigners seeking asylum in Germany have split the country in two
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Irena K is fed up with foreigners in Germany. 'They are letting in too many
people from Poland, Russia and Romania. Nobody works hard any more.
Something has changed in Germany since unification.' As she whiles away the
late morning in a cafe in Poll, a comfortable middle-class suburb of
Cologne, she starts to complain about the gypsy refugees from eastern
Europe. There are more than 150 who have lived for the past four years in
temporary housing a mile away. 'They are ruining the country,' she says.
The irony is that Irena speaks with a heavy Polish accent. She came to
Germany only two years ago from Katowice in southern Poland. As an
Aussiedler, an ethnic German living outside the federal republic, she has
the automatic right to live in Germany.
Her views capture something of the confused debate arising from the social
and economic impact of German unification, and the current uncertainty about
how to cope with an influx of tens of thousands of foreigners seeking asylum
every month.
Unlike in other European Community states, no one can emigrate to Germany,
because it has no immigration law. Yet anyone can enter the country because
of Germany's liberal asylum law.
Asylum is once again the most controversial issue on the political agenda in
Germany. It has deeply divided the country. The opposition Social Democratic
party (SPD) today opens an emergency congress to debate the topic, which has
revived unwanted memories of Germany's ignominious history and fears of a
revival of the extreme right.
The SPD's national, Lander (provincial) and city leadership, under pressure
in the regions from the extreme right-wing, recognises that some controls
must be imposed on the influx of foreigners. But the traditional left, and
those SPD members not in power in the Lander, wish to preserve the right to
asylum at all costs, precisely because of the political persecution by the
Nazis. Mr Bjorn Engholm, the party leader, has put his position on the line
by favouring the introduction of curbs aimed at preventing people from
abusing the country's liberal asylum law.
The SPD's position is crucial to any amendment to the right to asylum, which
is guaranteed under Article 16 of the German constitution. Any change, such
as that proposed by the ruling conservative coalition of Christian Democrats
(CDU), Christian Social Union (CSU) and Free Democrats (FDP), needs the
support of the SPD to have a two-thirds majority in parliament.
Yet many believe that any outcome from the debate about amending Article 16,
which states unambiguously that 'persons persecuted on political grounds
shall enjoy the right of asylum', will be futile unless all political
parties recognise the need for an immigration policy.
No matter what amendments are made, these will still deal with the issue of
refugees instead of the whole question of allowing people to emigrate to
Germany. As it stands, the 6m foreigners living in Germany have few
political rights: because there is no immigration policy, access to
citizenship is restricted.
'The SPD, like the other political parties, will have to face the fact that
Germany needs an immigration law,' says Ms Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, an FDP
parliamentary deputy and head of the government-backed Department for
Problems of Foreigners. 'There is no point in amending the constitution if
we are not prepared to introduce a policy on immigration,' she adds.
The current asylum debate has arisen for two reasons: the growing numbers of
people seeking asylum in Germany, and the rise of the far right.
More than 193,000 people arrived in Germany in 1990 (see chart), all
invoking Article 16. The number rose to more than 256,000 in 1991, and is
likely to reach 500,000 this year. Within the European Community, more than
60 per cent of all asylum applications last were year lodged in Germany.
The numbers have swollen, not only because of the war in the former
Yugoslavia, but also because unification has given Germany a 1,300km open
border to the east, straddling Poland and Czechoslovakia. Much of it is
impossible to police: in stretches, the Oder-Neisse river is only six inches
deep. Those who cross the border can claim asylum and remain in Germany
until their cases have been heard. The cumbersome administrative and appeal
system means that many cases take up to four years, although the average
time has been reduced to about 11 months. The current backlog exceeds
418,000.
During their stay in Germany, asylum seekers are provided with housing and
social welfare benefits, which the right believes are being exploited by
those abusing the asylum law. Bavaria's right-wing CSU, the junior partner
in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition, is campaigning for an end to the
appeal process, the scrapping of the asylum right in Article 16, and an
immigration law.
The CSU, which is worried that the neo-Nazi Republikaner party is eroding
its political base, claims that the refugees are exacerbating the housing
shortage. There is a shortfall of between 1.5m and 2m apartments in west
Germany's urban areas. However, there are few signs of refugees jumping the
housing list at one small refugee camp in the middle of an industrial estate
near Cologne. The 200 asylum seekers, who include 150 gypsies from the
former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, live in cramped, one-room,
barrack-type housing.
The right-wing also criticises the cost of caring for the asylum seekers.
Last year, the German government earmarked DM6.4bn (Pounds 2.6bn), of which
DM5.4bn was spent on accommodation and social assistance, bringing the
annual cost for each asylum seeker to DM15,000. Criticism about the cost of
supporting the refugees has sharpened with rising unemployment, curbs on
public spending and increased financial aid to eastern Germany.
The reaction of eastern Germans to refugees has also hardened debate. More
than 20 per cent of asylum seekers have been assigned to the five new
federal Lander in the east. 'It has been an awful experience,' says Ms
Schmalz-Jacobsen, who spends her time monitoring the problems faced by
foreigners. 'The living conditions for refugees in eastern Germany are
appalling. The hatred between the eastern Germans and the foreigners is
terrible.'
Mr Stephan Eisel, a specialist in asylum issues at the conservative Konrad
Adenauer Stiftung think-tank in Bonn, says east Germans are not accustomed
to foreigners. 'In the former German Democratic Republic, the Cubans,
Angolans and the Vietnamese lived in ghettoes. There was no attempt at
integration. Foreigners were viewed with suspicion,' he says.
He and Ms Schmalz-Jacobsen believe that foreigners have become easy
scapegoats because eastern Germans did not go through a period of
de-Nazification, and are now facing massive social change caused by the
collapse of communism.
But neither blames the easterners alone for the rise in xenophobia,
anti-semitism and right-wing extremism. In the first seven months of 1992,
the Interior Ministry registered 1,443 criminal acts against foreigners.
Most were committed in the rich western states of Baden-Wurttemberg, Hesse
and North Rhine-Westphalia.
'I receive many letters from westerners who praise the eastern Ger mans'
hostile attitude to foreigners. They say they want Article 16 to be scrapped
and foreigners to be expelled,' says Ms Schmalz-Jacobsen. 'In this context,
I can understand why the SPD is torn over Article 16.
'Article 16 was born out of our Nazi past. It was enshrined in the
constitution to show that Germany was an open country for the persecuted.'
The leaderships of the four main political parties are close to a compromise
on amending Article 16. The CDU, FDP and SPD want asylum qualified in the
constitution by including the 1951 United Nations Geneva Convention on the
Status of Refugees. This defines a refugee as any person with a well-founded
fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality,
membership of a particular social group or political opinion. 'Economic
refugees' who use Article 16 to enter the country would find it more
difficult to claim asylum under the Geneva convention.
Furthermore, all the parties want the procedure for unfounded cases to be
speeded up, and the right to asylum protected against abuse. 'Criminal
organisations in eastern Europe are exploiting our laws,' says Ms Herta
Daubler-Gmelin, a deputy parliamentary leader of the SPD. 'The SPD wants the
constitution to define who is a political refugee. That is why including the
Geneva convention is important,' she adds.
As a means of curbing illegal immigration - the Interior Ministry estimates
that more than 150,000 people have illegal status - Germany has signed
agreements with Romania and Bulgaria, allowing repatriation. Some 7,000
would-be asylum seekers were repatriated 'voluntarily' last year.
As for the Aussiedler, who number about 2m in eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union, they are being discouraged from travelling directly to Germany
by first having to apply through the German consulates in their country of
origin. As a result, the number of such admissions to Germany decreased from
397,000 in 1990 to 222,000 in 1991.
Despite the proposed amendments, few officials from the main political
parties believe they will have any significant impact unless they are
followed by an immigration law.
The overall immigration pressure is potentially enormous. There is a backlog
of 700,000 Aussiedler applications, and a fear that continuing instability
in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union will unleash a wave of new asylum
seekers to Germany.
Legal experts believe that all the political parties, including the SPD,
will eventually adopt an immigration law, partly to conform with EC
standards, and partly to cope with immigration from the east. But Ms
Daubler-Gmelin sounds a note of warning. 'We should not amend Article 16,
let alone introduce an immigration law, if it means pandering to the far
right.
'We should do it because we believe we need it, and it is beneficial for our
democracy. On that basis the SPD might obtain a consensus.'

FT  16 NOV 92 / Leading Article: China's reformer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ZHU RONGJI, who arrived in London yesterday for a tour of Britain and
Scandinavia, has a reputation as a trouble-shooter who handles serious
problems sensitively. He will need these skills as, just promoted to the
standing committee of China's Politburo, he leads the first significant
mission to the west after the beginning of a new and difficult phase in
Beijing's foreign relations.
Uncertainties have been created by two events beyond China's control: the
election of Governor Bill Clinton, who promises as US president to take a
tougher line linking trade privileges to China's human rights performance;
and the proposals by Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, on broadening
democracy ahead of China's resumption of sovereignty over the territory in
1997.
The continued development of market-oriented prosperity in China lies at the
heart of both. It is also Zhu's responsibility since, as vice-premier and
head of the Economic and Trade Office - a new body which parallels Japan's
Ministry of International Trade and Industry - he is the chief executive of
Deng Xiaoping's economic reform programme.
The stakes for Zhu are high: previous pretenders to the mantle of
88-year-old Deng have fallen by the wayside. Renewed impetus for reform this
year has brought double-digit economic growth and a renewed influx of
foreign investment, but has raised fears of inflation and overheating. There
is an even greater need to reform state industries, cut down bureaucracy,
and break the 'iron rice bowl' while softening the blow for possibly
millions of redundant workers. These are Zhu's main tasks as the attempt to
create a 'socialist market economy' - capitalism under authoritarian
one-party rule - enters its most challenging stage.
Withdrawal of Most Favoured Nation trade status by the US - congressional
pressure for which was resisted by President Bush - would strike at China's
exports, making it a less attractive place to invest and undermining the
domestic position of reformers such as Zhu. He and his colleagues need to
canvass support abroad for the view that growing economic freedom is the
best way forward. Western governments should continue to accept that view,
fostering trade and investment while insisting on better performance on
human rights.
The approach of constructive engagement, to which Britain has subscribed,
should encourage China to talk sensibly about the chief issue currently
dividing them: Hong Kong. Zhu's visit offers an opportunity - particularly
since Mr Patten will also be in London - for quiet mending of the rift
caused by Mr Patten's proposals and the virulent reaction to them in
Beijing. China has failed to show that Mr Patten's limited suggestions break
previous agreements. An unstable Hong Kong would undermine the southern
powerhouse of Chinese growth. It is in China's interest to begin discussions
to head off such dangers.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Serb sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC SANCTIONS have not had a good press lately. In the case of Iraq,
the evidence is that many countries, including the US, Britain, France and
Germany, did not respect either national guidelines or United Nations
resolutions on the subject.
The fact that sanctions are broken, however, does not prove that they never
attain their objectives. Few people now doubt that sanctions made an
important contribution to the eventual defeat of the former white regime in
Rhodesia.
UN sanctions against Serbia have proved no exception to the rule. By
requiring all nations to stop trading with Serbia in any commodity,
including oil, for which Serbia relies on imports for 75 per cent of its
needs, the embargo had the potential of crippling the economy.
As so often before, the sanctions have proved very leaky. The extent of the
violations was underlined last week by Mr Cyrus Vance, one of the UN
mediators for Yugoslavia. Mr Vance told the Security Council that oil was
getting through in ever larger quantities to Serbia and that queues at
petrol stations in Belgrade had virtually disappeared. The US, meanwhile,
has accused owners or managers of ships in several nations of violating
sanctions in the Adriatic.
Yet the new UN sanctions resolution, due to be adopted this week, is not
just an empty gesture. It is intended to plug the loopholes in the present
regime by giving the international naval force in the Adriatic the right to
stop and search suspect ships, instead of just monitoring them. Tighter
controls will also be established by international 'sanctions assistance
missions' at key transit and transhipment points along the Danube and at
border crossings with Serbia-Montenegro.
It would be naive to believe that these measures will totally cut Serbia's
supply lines. But it should make life much more difficult for
sanctions-busters in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Greece. With a political
solution still remote, the effective application of sanctions remains the
most powerful tool in the hands of the international community to bring
Serbia to its senses.

FT  16 NOV 92 / The investment cult
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Within hours of my predicting that this would happen, Norman Lamont floored
an interviewer on the BBC's Today radio programme by asking whether he was
being accused of stimulating the economy too much or too little, or whether
he should have borrowed more or less. My own immediate answer was that the
chancellor was stimulating too little on the fiscal side, but taking too
many risks with monetary policy and sterling.
I am always relieved to find some City analysts agreeing with me. The prize
this time goes to Keith Skeoch of James Capel, who writes that Norman
Lamont's 'non-membership of the Magic Circle may have to be reconsidered in
the light of the Autumn Statement where, with the aid of mirrors, the
chancellor presented what amounted to a discretionary tightening of fiscal
policy as part of a recovery package. As we suspected it might, the new
growth-orientated policy consists of more of the same - cuts in interest
rates and a depreciation in sterling. Mr Lamont implicitly admitted as much
by cutting rates by 1 percentage point at a time when sterling's index was
at an all-time low.'
The risks were also admitted by the Treasury in forecasting a stalling of
the fall in inflation, at around its present level, despite the fourth year
of recession or abnormally low growth and an above-equilibrium unemployment
rate.
The hiccup is obviously owing to a minimal allowance for sterling's latest
depreciation. The realism of the government's commitment to maintain
inflation within the target 1 to 4 per cent band, still more to reduce it
eventually to its lower end, depends on this devaluation being the last of
many since 1967, and probably on its being partially reversed. This is just
as much the case if the government operates through domestic monetary
targets, which in an open, non-continental economy have a large part of
their effect via the exchange rate, as if it is operating an overt sterling
objective.
The Bank of England takes the inflation commitment and its forthcoming
quarterly inflation reports extremely seriously. A technically competent
analysis involves, however, not just past numbers, but a political judgment
on how far to believe government statements of future intentions. This will
be an extraordinarily embarrassing judgment to make - especially on
medium-term issues which the governor has promised to cover - while the Bank
remains a member of the official family, but has no direct responsibility
for decisions.
Meanwhile, there is the question of how the chancellor managed to produce an
apparent growth package within tight public spending guidelines. Michael
Saunders of Salomon Bros estimates the cost of the package at just over
Pounds 1bn in the current fiscal year and nearly Pounds 2bn in 1993-94. The
abolition of car tax should not, however, have been included, if one takes
seriously the chancellor's commitment to raise petrol tax or vehicle licence
duties as an offset next March. Perhaps the ideal is more vehicles piling up
in garages to provide orders for the motor industry.
The real package looks as if it has been paid for by the 1 1/2 per cent
public sector pay limit, which I favour as a crude substitute for the market
pressure restraining pay in private business. But I fear that this has not
been enough and that detailed scrutiny will show some painful cuts concealed
elsewhere.
The heart of the measures is in the investment stimulants. They embody the
conventional wisdom that the economy must be stimulated through investment
and not consumption. Yet I was always taught that investment is only
worthwhile if the total costs of production with the new equipment were less
than the direct costs of producing with the old. As yet no one has shown
that it is wrong, or that the community gains from subsidised investment.
The investment cult is a combination of different confused ideas. First,
business cycles have traditionally been associated with investment
fluctuations. But whatever the proximate cause, in a prolonged slump it is
demand that is lacking and a boost to spending in the shops is just as good.
Second, investment provides more scope for creative accountancy. The
paradigm case is the hire instead of purchase of railway rolling stock to
save government borrowing costs. A sensible business would decide on the
prevailing balance of financial advantage, and not on crude cash flow.
Third, there is an old confusion that because countries with rapid growth
rates tend to have high investment ratios, the way to growth is to subsidise
investment.
Fourth, spending on, for example, the Jubilee Line is said to be less import
intensive than consumer expenditure, which is really covert protectionism.
We are left with the fifth argument, that industries like construction now
have unusually large excess capacity and that it is good business to place
contracts with them early. There is something in this; but on its own it
would not be enough to justify the investment fetish.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Watchdogs off the scent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE SIR Kenneth Clucas first put the case for a single watchdog for retail
financial services in a report for the Securities and Investments Board
earlier this year, the debate on the proposed Private Investment Authority
(PIA) has sunk into a dismal stalemate.
The banks and building societies have little financial interest in signing
up, since they would then risk being saddled with a bill for the
shortcomings of Fimbra, the self-regulatory organisation (SRO) chiefly
responsible for independent financial intermediaries. Life assurance
companies are reluctant to sign up unless the banks and building societies
are on board, because they do not want to bear a disproportionate part of
the regulatory costs of the system. And Fimbra's members, who are unable
themselves to bear the full cost of compensating the victims of the black
sheep in their own flock, are a large and disparate bunch whose readiness to
vote Fimbra out of existence in favour of the PIA is open to question.
Such a deadlock would test the mettle of a game theorist. It poses a
potentially overwhelming challenge for Mr Andrew Large, the head of the
Securities and Investments Board, who has been asked by the chancellor to
review the workings of the system instituted by the Financial Services Act.
If leading practitioners are to be believed, the PIA is limping before
take-off. The chief executive of the Prudential recently declared: 'It has
become apparent beyond reasonable doubt that PIA does not enjoy the support
necessary among potential constituents to achieve its successful launch as
the sole regulator of private investor business.'
In dealing with Fimbra, Mr Large has a fundamental problem with the
voluntarist nature of the system. Practitioners are entitled to choose their
own SRO. Yet the SIB does not have many carrots with which to induce
voluntary compliance with its wishes. Short of offering total immunity from
infection by Fimbra, which would make a nonsense of the Clucas proposals, it
is hard to see how sufficient banks and building societies could be
persuaded to come in. And they can reasonably argue that if there is a
public interest in keeping a large number of independent financial
intermediaries in business, then the bill should fall on the public purse.
The sticks are more impressive, but not much more. The SIB has the power to
derecognise individual SROs. But that is a realistic threat only for Fimbra,
and its effectiveness might be hard to gauge. The more draconian sanction is
closer government oversight. Yet when the chief executive of the Prudential
is already arguing for precisely that, the threat scarcely looks daunting.
Nor is the government anxious to add the task of controlling predatory life
assurance salesmen to its problems.
All this points to a messy outcome, and there is a risk that the whole
purpose of the system will be lost from view. While the practitioners argue
about issues of competitiveness and regulatory cost, there is evidence that
a disproportionately large number of savers incurs painful losses as the
result of its unsolicited encounter with the insurance industry - a sorry
comment on the four years of operation of the new system.
To bring insurance companies and salesmen to cleanse their act will probably
require more rigorous enforcement and tougher penalties than anything seen
so far. Adequate compensation arrangements will continue to be vital.
Whether a practitioner-dominated system can deliver on those counts is
questionable in the light of the row over the PIA. The incremental approach
to reform which Mr Large instinctively favours may well be right for the
wholesale markets. But in retail finance tougher medicine is called for.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Arts: Heavy-handed Ida - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new Gilbert and Sullivan offering at the Coliseum, a heedlessly
energetic blending of the crass, the coarse and the witless, sets the seal
on a discreditable era of operetta performance at the English National
Opera. At this season's end the company's artistic triumvirate of Peter
Jonas, David Pountney and Mark Elder, 10 years old, will be folded up; and
no doubt many eulogies on the theme of Ten Glorious Years are already
planned to accompany their departure.
Most of these will be richly deserved; but this lamentable Princess Ida
affords the opportunity - irresistible to any critic worth his salt - of
getting in early with a discordant note. For, following on Orpheus in the
Underworld, The Mikado and last season's Fledermaus, it cruelly confirms the
judgment (in Opera magazine) of the theatre critic Michael Billington: 'ENO,
brilliant at cracking the tough nuts of the operatic repertory, (has been)
fatally heavy-handed with the lighter stuff.'
It is as though the desire to do these works - and, no doubt, to squeeze
badly-needed box-office juice from them - has clashed somewhere with the
strain of almost puritanical didacticism that has informed many of the
company's 'tough nut' successes over the last decade. All the
above-mentioned productions - even The Mikado, lightest-fingered of them -
have relied on elaborate feats of design as a method of satirical
point-making.
The tradition that in operetta the comic powers of the leading players serve
best as articulators of entertainment has very largely been abandoned. And
with it have been sacrificed the fizz, the glow of pleasure, above all the
edge of satire which these shows have been so cumbersomely constructed to
hone.
Princess Ida, perhaps the most lumpish of the lot, is Ken Russell's first
production in a British opera-house. (The celebrated film director has
already gained a reputation for creating opera 'controversies' on the
Continent.) The style is McGill postcard crossed with Carry On carry-on. The
time is 2002, the location a Buckingham Palace reduced to a theme-park
called Buck'n'Yen (geddit?).
King Hildebrand is a Charles look-alike with big ears (the theme-park logo);
Gama and his three sons are Japanese, with jokes to match; his daughter Ida
is mysteriously Occidental in appearance, and her Castle Adamant adherents
variously don boots, leather and lace. (The strict logic of farce is not
something Russell and his designer James Merifield seem to have bothered
about overmuch.) I laughed three times in Act 1 - at the camp antics of
Hilarion's companions Cyril and Florian, at the waterslide out of the
palace, and at Richard Van Allan's nicely observed Hildebrand-as-Charles
body-language.
Thereafter I slumped in disbelief, and tedium, ever greater, at the sheer
incompetence of the stagecraft - the bad blocking, the messy finale
line-ups, the placing of key singers so far upstage that their dialogue
needs amplification, the weakly distracting routines during arias, the air
of provincial panto that takes over the end.
The whole thing seems to have been got up as a New Look at a work - since
Gilbert's 'Respectful Perversion' of Tennyson's The Princess has developed a
reputation for unacceptable anti-feminism, apparently such a thing is
required. Yet, reading the libretto earlier in the day, I was struck by just
how newly topical its struggle of the sexes could prove to be, in a
production more alert to wit, more concerned with comic character, less
lame-brained in its knockabout.
At least the finesse, elegance and charm of the music - this is one of the
richest Sullivan theatre scores - are conveyed; we owe this demi-miracle to
Jane Glover in the pit, and to her knack of keeping the rhythms and textures
fleetly flowing in defiance of all the production clunking. One performer,
Geoffrey Dolton as Florian, lights up the stage with his zest and sparkle.
It is sad that so many others of ripe and proven talents are shown off so
disadvantageously: the bright-toned young soprano Rosemary Joshua in the
title role, Mark Curtis (Hilarion), Anne Collins (Lady Blanche), Anne-Marie
Owens (Lady Psyche), and, as the Sushi-King Gama, a distressingly unfunny
Nickolas Grace.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Arts: Wexford Trilogy - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the first three Saturdays in December it is possible to see all three
plays in Billy Roche's Wexford Trilogy performed on the same day. Since
London's tiny Bush Theatre will be almost certainly booked out, it may be
wise to try to catch any one of them while they appear separately on week
nights.
The order does not greatly matter. Each play stands on its own. What they
have in common, apart from the authorship, is a huge amount of insight into
life in a small Irish town and a marvellous cast directed by Robert Lefevre.
The first, A Handful of Stars, is set in a billiard parlour, the second,
Poor Beast in the Rain, in a betting shop, while the third, Belfry, moves as
its title suggests close to the church.
Until last Saturday I thought Belfry was the best, largely because it shows
Roche continuing to mature as a writer. Yet Poor Beast is at the heart of
the trilogy, for here we come up most sharply against the tragedy of small
town Ireland and perhaps of Ireland as a whole: the desire of some of its
brightest people to leave.
The key example in Poor Beast is 'Danger' Doyle, played by Liam Cunningham.
By any normal standards, he is not a big figure; by Wexford standards, he is
part of the mythology. Everyone remembers that he was in trouble with the
police, and left for England with a woman whose daughter remained behind.
Having lost his job in a British tobacco factory for stealing cigarettes, he
now works in a car plant. When he returns to Wexford to pick up the
daughter, he is in a smart suit and stays at the County Hotel. In other
words, he has made it to the big time.
Poor Beast works by juxtaposing those who leave, those who wish to go but do
not have the will, and those who stay. It also makes great play of the
differences between generations. Steven, the father of the girl, claims
never to have packed a bag in his life: Wexford is enough for him. Joe, from
the middle generation, says Wexford is 'the greatest little town in
Ireland', but still hankers after his boyhood days with Danger, when the
pair of them would raid the betting shop.
The background to Poor Beast is the All Ireland Final, the game being
hurling. It is the excitement of the year, partly because Wexford is
involved in little else except everyday life. Yet it is in the details of
this humdrum existence that Roche is so skilled: there are dramas beneath
the surface, like the girl Molly whom Danger has abandoned.
Molly is wonderfully played by Ingrid Craigie. She is not alone. Dervla
Kirwan as the daughter sheds real tears. Des McAleer, as Joe, will come into
his own in a bigger part in Belfry, which starts tomorrow. My only
reservation about the trilogy is whether it would work on a larger stage. At
the Bush it is close to perfection.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Arts: Dangerous Corner - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JB Priestly (1894-1984) wrote his first play, Dangerous Corner, in 1932.
England was in recession, unemployment around three million, and society
changing rapidly. Under identical circumstances in 1992, Priestly's message
holds true: the future must be reworked from the past, learning from
mistakes. The Birmingham Rep's production of Dangerous Corner offers a
meticulous account of this unquiet comedy thriller, entertaining and
instructive.
Dangerous Corner belongs with Time and the Conways (1937), An Inspector
Calls (1946) and with Anthony Ackland's The Dark River (1939). All are
forensic studies of society which start in the present to uncover the past.
The production opens with a billowing curtain drawn upward, like a dust
sheet, revealing a frozen social tableau. A chance after-dinner remark about
a cigarette box leads six upper-middle class characters into a sticky web of
connection. They deep question each other into the early hours. All emerge
as liars, sometimes pernicious, but more often muddled and confused: 'The
real truth is something so deep you can't get at it; all half-truth does is
to blow it all up. It isn't civilised.'
Priestly contrives a plausible ending by making the news of past events bear
on present relationships. But the play commits itself to more than the
search for truth, since the action uncovers sex, drugs, greed and hatred
beneath the sober patina of polite society. It amounts to social
archaeology. Just as Priestly's English Journey (1934) found old England in
York and Durham, Victorian England in Manchester, and post-war England in
filling stations and cigarette coupons, so Dangerous Corner finds women's
sexuality in an after-dinner smile, new commercial attitudes in the flourish
of a dress, old values in a formal goodnight.
Robert Jones' excellent design is a simple drawing-room with the Priestly
essentials: whisky and a way out to the conservatory. Gwenda Hughes's
direction misses the fun and cliche embedded in the play, and takes itself
too seriously: one woman returns to the party, convinced she is being talked
about; an outraged hostess awaits her husband's crooked business partner
with 'he'll get no sandwiches from me'. The acting of Marilyn Cutts, Graham
Padden and David Hobbs catches some of Priestly's wit; the other actors have
yet to find the right tone.
Priestly offers a quiet coda, repeating the first scene, in which the casual
question which started the previous three acts is deftly turned aside, a
road not taken. It is a witty turn into a social rather than philosophical
definition of truth. But then, even serious philosophers can be distracted:
Bertrand Russell once asked GE Moore, 'Do you always tell the truth?' Moore
replied, 'No.' Russell recalled: 'That was the only lie I ever knew him to
tell.'

FT  16 NOV 92 / Arts: Gounod's souffle - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French appetite for light opera has left a fascinating legacy from the
19th century. Although the major composers wrote operas as grand as any, it
is remarkable how many of them also found the ability to turn their hand,
when they fancied, to a musical souffle.
Gounod's La Colombe, being given a rare staging by the Guildhall School of
Music, is one of those. It is loosely based on a story from Boccaccio and La
Fontaine. Their original tale tells of a pet dove which gets eaten unawares
by its lady owner when it is roasted for dinner by her near-starving suitor.
The opera, however, dispenses with the moral: Gounod gives the dove a
reprieve and serves up a lighter and sweeter ending.
As so often in these little-heard French scores, the music is beautifully
crafted. In less than an hour's music (allowing for the dialogue) Gounod
packs in a delightful series of musical solos and ensembles, which make up
in sparkle what they lack in the way of memorable tunes. In the role of the
Countess Sylvie, the soprano Diane Charlesworth showed exactly how to sing
this music, all silvery, bubbling, chic appeal - quite delectable.
The Guildhall School had boldly decided to tackle the piece in French. This
was a gamble that paid off, for even those who were not fluent in the
language managed to sound as if they were. As Matre Jean, giving a cookery
lesson on how to prepare pheasant (or dove) for dinner, Simon Thorpe caught
the intonation of a French comic spot-on. A typically awkward French tenor
part was also sung with some style by Ivan Sharpe.
This divertissement left time for a companion piece. The choice fell on
Ravel's L'Heure espagnole, the composer's opera-bouffe set in a clock shop,
which demands second by second precision from all concerned. David
Lloyd-Jones led a reliable performance from the pit, although the
contribution from that department can never be too razor-sharp in this
score. Jennifer Akhurst played a nicely frustrated Concepcon; Nathan Berg
was the resonantly-sung Don Inigo Gomez.
The pair of productions, both by Francisco Negrin with designs by Tony
Baker, had an arty look, without being distressingly trendy. It is probably
hoping for too much to give Gounod's weak scenario wit and point, but the
Ravel - its comic mechanism neatly balanced by suppressed emotions below the
surface, as here - always makes the time tick away rewardingly.
La Colombe and L'Heure espagnole, sponsored by Bacon &amp; Woodrow. Further
performances November 16 and 18 (Box Office 071-638 8891)

FT  16 NOV 92 / Arts: Tablets of stone - Colin Amery visits the new Supreme
Court in Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Historic moments are rare. It was a privilege to be in Jerusalem last week
for an important moment in the history of Israel: the completion of the new
Supreme Court. Trumpet, drum and harp sounded. A sea of notables filled the
great hall to applaud and solemnise the inauguration of the seat of the law.
Only Jerusalem could have provided the procession of president and
patriarch, priest and rabbi, hooded Armenian and dusty robed Orthodox as
well as the graciousness and glitter of the internationally committed group
of supporters of Israel.
In 1986 I was asked to be a member of the international jury to select an
architect for a new Supreme Court. The project was to be entirely funded by
the Rothschild family foundation in Israel, Yad Hanadiv. There is an
appropriate symbolism in the opening of the courts for the Rothschild
family: it marks the 100 years since Baron Edmond de Rothschild supported
the first Jewish settlements in Eretz Yisrael. It also is a major landmark
for the family foundation that has consistently given discreetly to
innumerable projects in Israel. In 1957 the foundation gave Israel its
Parliament buildings, the Knesset, the first major public building in what
is now becoming the National Precinct in West Jerusalem. The new Supreme
Court is located in the same area - that part of the new Jerusalem which
lurks round the foot of the inelegant tower of the Hilton hotel. The whole
area is gradually to be integrated with older Jerusalem by a new master
plan.
When judging the international competition to find an architect the jury had
to tackle two problems. Firstly there were all the sensitivities of placing
a new public building on an important site that is not yet anchored in the
city. The second challenge was to find a design that could symbolise the
enormous significance of the law in Israel and yet not be oppressive or
overweening in its language. Not for Jerusalem the weight and pomposity of
the courts in Brussels or the gothic mystery of England's House of Lords.
The winning design was produced by two Israeli architects - the brother and
sister team of Ada Karmi-Melamede and Ram Karmi from Tel Aviv. The fact that
they came from a distinguished architectural family in Israel perhaps gave
them the crucial edge in understanding both the landscape and architectural
traditions of Jerusalem and the delicate question of the appropriate
architectural symbolism for this commission.
The architects have built before in Jerusalem, but this is their first joint
project. Things change during building but I can say with a certain
detachment that the final result is a triumph. My own reason for choosing
these architects was that they seemed to have a wonderful understanding of
the simple elements that make up the architectural context of Jerusalem. Two
of these are light and history. As the architects have said, Jerusalem is
'possessed by light and obsessed by its past'. I would add that above all it
is a city of stone.
The challenge for any architect building a public building in Jerusalem must
be - how to let the tide of history wash over your late 20th century
drawings. To be asked to enshrine the law in Jerusalem is almost like being
asked to design the Temple. The architects made one crucial decision that
supports all the others: the building is seen as part of the land. It is
long and low, rooted in the soil and introverted. As in the Old City, you
are always aware of the walls. In the new Supreme Court the dignity of the
outer walls extends inside with a long and powerful spine wall that runs
through the centre of the building. It is a reminder of strength rooted in
the land.
On one side of the spine are the five courts and on the other are the giant,
tall public foyer and the law library. The public entrance is at the knuckle
joint of the plan between the judges offices and the courts. The entry is
tight, presumably as a security funnel, but soon widens to a grand stone
staircase with a sumptuous view of Jerusalem through a large curved window.
Here you turn into the second 'gate' of the courts - a square hall beneath a
soaring pyramid roof. The visitor is urged to look upwards at this point
because here the architects' understanding of light is seen at its most
concentrated. Four circular openings at the apex of the pyramid allow a
column of light to move around the space in much the same way that light
moves around Rome's domed Pantheon from a single occulus.
This square hall and turning point in the plan is encircled by a curved
library of unassailable elegance. To move from the geometric intensity of
the pyramid to the grand and relaxed curved hall of the public foyer is to
experience an expansive contrast. Of course the grand arcade of Le
Corbusier's Chandigarh courts comes to mind - but here is marble, plaster
and golden stone, not sad and stained concrete. The five courts open from
this public space, each with its own stepped doorway cut and polished from
the same roughly hewn stone of the great wall.
Although the courts differ in size and detail, they share the language of
concealed sources of natural light and all have inner walls that are
separate from the outer stone shell. Judges will sit beneath smooth plaster
apses contemplating the calm atmosphere of these five rooms. Above all it is
the sensitive manipulation of light and the simplicity of the detail and
furnishings that makes these rooms beautiful.
When not in court the 12 Supreme Court judges will occupy a set of fine
offices grouped around a stone cloistered courtyard. It is a place of
silence interrupted only by the sound of a narrow rill of water moving
gently as though in some Moghul garden. This courtyard is a brilliant
example of an architecture suggestive of tradition and yet immaculately made
in the late 20th century.
The opening of the Supreme Court in Jerusalem was accompanied by a major
international seminar on 'The Public Building - Form and Influence' that
prompted lively international debate. But words do not make buildings.
Jerusalem's Supreme Court shows in stone the power of strong architectural
talent and judgment. It has a timeless and elemental strength that
miraculously reflects the law itself.

The young people in BBC2's documentary series Doctors To Be are seen in
today's programme saddled with responsibilities and obliged to deal with
other people's pain. Nick, 21, finds himself delivering the first baby of a
woman who is about his own age. He and Sarah witness a series of late
abortions which cause them to re-examine their own feelings. Mark has to
deal with an angry patient, and Sarah and Jane confront their fears about
dealing with the dying (8.00).
That is followed (8.50) by Vintners' Tales in which Jancis Robinson meets
Bill Baker, described as Britain's biggest wine merchant. C4's current
affairs series Cutting Edge (9.00) takes a look at 'everyday life' around
the corridors of the House of Lords. It seems that there are 777 hereditary
peers out of a total of 1,200, and 413 are old Etonians. Standing Orders
were written down in 1621. If a minister writes to you on blue paper you can
quote it, but if not you can't. There are 77 women in the House. It all
sounds desperately British.
In Panorama (9.30 BBC1) Tom Mangold reports that the first signs of the long
expected 'crack' epidemic have now surfaced in Britain.

Biwater, the privately-owned water contractor which also controls three
water supply companies, has appointed Kenneth Gardener as chairman of
Bournemouth and West Hampshire Water companies, following the resignation of
Martin Copp.
Gardener, 65, who spent two decades at ICI and who has been a director of
telecommunications group STC since 1987, has been on the main Biwater board
on a part-time basis for six years and is vice chairman (finance) and
chairman of its finance and audit committee.
Shortly before the resignation of 54-year-old Copp, who was also deputy
chairman of East Worcester water company, Biwater had effected an internal
reorganisation whereby the three water companies were put into a new
division, entitled Biwater Supply (Holdings), with Biwater executive Robin
Turrell installed as chief executive.
'I felt the company wanted to get more and more involved (in running the
water supply companies). I could no longer clearly see a role for an
independent chairman,' says Copp, who has recently become a non-executive
director of Portsmouth Water.
Biwater owns 98 per cent of Bournemouth and 80 per cent of both West
Hampshire and East Worcester.
Copp is an economist with a merchant banking background. Once regional
director for the south of England for Slater Walker, he moved after the
group's collapse in the secondary banking crisis of 1974-75 to Singer &amp;
Friedlander, where he ran the Bournemouth office.
Subsequently, he has pursued a variety of other business interests; he was
non- executive chairman of Fyne Machinery, which was sold to Beazer
Engineering in 1986 and a founder-director of commercial radio company Ocean
Sound.

FT  16 NOV 92 / People: Fanshawe for Sedgwick; Jackson for Royal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Fanshawe (right), formerly Sir Anthony Royle, is to take over as
chairman of Sedgwick, the insurance broker, following the departure of David
Rowland who is expected to be elected chairman of Lloyd's of London later
this month. Lord Fanshawe, now 65, is currently working with Sedgwick's
development group and has served on the main board since 1984.
He joined Sedgwick Collins in 1948 and worked with the group both on an
underwriting box at Lloyd's and as a senior marine broker in the 1950s. Lord
Fanshawe was elected MP for Richmond in 1959 and served as a minister in the
foreign and commonwealth office from 1970 to 1974 as deputy to Sir Alec
Douglas-Home. His other directorships include the Westland Group, TI Group
and Rank Xerox.
Royal Insurance has appointed Peter Jackson, former managing director of
Adidas UK, as its new group general manager for marketing. In supervising
marketing operations, he will be part of a team of senior executives, the
first time Royal has appointed a marketing manager at head office level.
The move follows the appointment of a number of other senior executives at
Royal who do not have a background in either the general insurance or life
insurance industries.
Richard Gamble, the chief executive, joined Royal from British Airways,
while finance director Mike Dowdy also comes from outside the insurance
industry.
Now in his early 50s, Jackson has experience with Mars and Procter &amp; Gamble,
as well as Adidas. He says he is keen to gain maximum advantage from Royal's
well-known brand name, explaining that the emphasis on marketing at Royal
reflects 'the way the business is trending'.
One of Jackson's first tasks could be a re-evaluation of how Royal markets
its direct motor insurance operation (sales by telephone and mass media
advertising), The Insurance Service. Set up in the late 1980s, TIS now
underwrites three out of every 10 motor policies sold by Royal, and is
making underwriting profits.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Management: Multinationals face game of snakes and ladders -
Companies must change the way they recruit and retain staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There can hardly be a company in Europe, America or even Japan where
employees are not fearful for their jobs because of current economic
pressures and the more deeply rooted trend towards 'delayering' and
'downsizing' of organisations.
But this does not mean that the fast-growing number of companies with
international operations can now forget their late-1980s worries about how
to recruit and retain highly skilled managers and other employees. Far from
it.
This is not only because the much-debated 'demographic time-bomb' is still
very much a reality in most European countries: a sharp fall is occurring in
the number of 15 to 19-year-olds, which will be followed by stagnation well
into the 21st century - except, curiously, in the UK, which has been
experiencing a baby boom.
At the same time, many companies that increased their workforces in the
1960s will face retirements en masse after the year 2000. The effect of this
will be compounded by the declining popularity among some employees of a
single-company career. Many people are becoming more choosy about what might
be called the quality of life in the workplace.
A number of other factors is also contributing to the recruitment and
retention problems of multinationals in particular: international mobility
is being hit as managers take more account of the wishes of their working
spouses and children; and a growing number of adults is reluctant to move
because they care for ageing parents.
The continued existence of all these challenges emerges from an article in
the latest Sloan Management review by Paul Vanderbroeck, human resources
manager of Shell Research in Schwabenheim, Germany*. He suggests a series of
actions that multinational companies should take in response to all these
challenges. Some actions are obvious, others less so.
Companies will need to hire - and promote - more women.
They must broaden their recruitment by hiring more people abroad, not just
for local jobs, but ones throughout the company.
They should hire more older managers, with more experience. And they should
consider introducing a flexible retirement age for key staff, in order to
retain high-quality people longer. At the same time, however, they should
use 'outflow management' as a real career development tool for people who
have peaked and really would be better off elsewhere.
They should get more out of existing managers through training and job
rotation. To keep the workforce flexible and deployable, a substantial and
unrelenting effort will be required.
Multinationals will have to fight competition from small businesses and
other employers. They may be able to 'market' themselves to graduates and
others by demonstrating the challenges offered by their own new
organisational structures - ones which favour small units, quick lines of
communication, and entrepreneurship.
Companies with newly shallow structures will also need to develop horizontal
and diagonal career lines in order to reward staff and avoid career
plateaus.
It cannot be overstressed, says Vanderbroeck, that a condition for
successful horizontal career development is the decoupling of hierarchy and
remuneration. A manager's remuneration should be based on skill and
contribution, not on the conventional basis of position in the hierarchy,
size of budget and number of subordinates.
As for international deployment, multinationals will have to provide
services to the spouses of expatriate managers, helping them find jobs. 3M,
the US group, offers a dislocation allowance, subsidies for studies abroad,
and placement service allowances upon return.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Protests over Companies House changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
USERS OF Companies House, which stores information on more than 1m UK
limited companies, have protested about new consultation procedures, saying
it will be harder to put their views across.
The Users Group, which has been a forum for customers of Companies' House
for 19 years, is being replaced by several specialist committees.
The users, including registration agents, credit agencies, chambers of
commerce, solicitors and accountants, complain that the procedures have been
introduced abruptly and that there will be restrictions on free discussion.
They argue that as Companies House has a monopoly on company registrations
consultation with its customers is essential.
Companies House plans at least four specialist user committees covering
large users, such as business information and credit-rating agencies; banks;
solicitors and accountants; and smaller credit agencies and chambers of
commerce.
Companies House says more focused discussions on specialist issues will be
feasible than was possible with the Users' Group, which typically attracted
between 20 and 30 people to its quarterly meetings.
A Companies House official said: 'The Users' Group was getting too big and
too general. The smaller groups will allow us to draw our specialist staff
into the discussions.'
Members of the group believe, however, that Mr David Durham, the chief
executive and Companies House staff, resented criticisms and comments made
at the Users' Group meetings.
Mr Terry Robinson, vice-president of the Institute of Credit Management,
said: 'At times they acted as a ginger group and I wonder whether the reason
for disbanding the Users' Group was that they they felt they could do
without the criticism.'
Mr George Corderoy, chairman of the Law Services Association, a grouping of
registration agents, said: 'The opportunity for a general debate will be
lost in the specialist committees.'
Members also believe that Companies House, an executive agency since 1988
and likely to be privatised in the next year or so, felt uneasy at taking
criticism from organisations which were increasingly becoming competitors.
Competition has come particularly from the search agents, which compile
company profiles from information supplied by Companies House.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Forum on training formed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and BOB LITTLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 100 national employers have formed a pressure group to represent
their views to the government on the structure and funding of training.
The National Employers' and Training Providers' Forum was established in
Northampton last week by representatives from several big employers
including British Gas, Eagle Star Insurance, IBM UK, Marks and Spencer, B&amp;Q
and Royal Mail.
Mr Roger Shaw of the British Printing Industries Federation, the forum's
chairman, said: 'Unity among major employers and providers of youth/adult
training is essential.'
Mr Trevor Thornett, British Gas's senior training adviser, said: 'Basically
we support the government's initiatives - including the proposed National
Managing Agency - but we feel it is important to make our views on training
provision and funding known.'
G10, the group which represents the views of Tec leaders to government, has
said it is 'delighted' that Tec budgets emerged largely unscathed from last
week's Autumn Statement. Mr Edward Roberts, the chairman, praised Mrs
Gillian Shephard, employment secretary for the way she 'fought the Tecs'
corner at a very difficult time'.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Tecs move 'undercuts chambers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAINING AND Enterprise Councils (Tecs) are developing membership schemes
that compete directly with chambers of commerce and undercut the chambers'
subscriptions.
This is one of the main findings of a survey of the Tecs in England and
Wales and Local Enterprise Companies (Lecs), their Scottish equivalents,
published today by the London School of Economics.
The study says that Tecs, which were envisaged as working with local
organisations rather than having memberships of their own, are competing
with chambers in small-business advice to members.
It shows Tecs charge an average annual subscription of Pounds 32, compared
with the chambers' average of Pounds 131.
Mr Robert Bennett, author of the report, said the government encouraged the
Tecs to set up membership schemes by means of performance bonuses but the
purpose of this policy was not entirely clear.
The survey noted that Tecs clearly planned to set themselves up in
competition with the chambers.
The G10 group of chief executives of 10 large Tecs claimed Tecs had a
membership of 100,000 in a recent submission to the department of trade and
industry.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Bucking the Trend: A magnificent deal with the greatest of
ease - In spite of the widespread gloom in industry, a surprising number of
companies are thriving against the odds. This is the first in a series on
companies - often small and relatively unknown - which are scoring successes
in the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TINY North Yorkshire company is tooling up to supply aircraft to the US
Air Force against a background of the worst recession to hit the UK's
aerospace and defence industries since the Second World War.
Slingsby has just landed the most important contract in its 60-year history
and its production of small propeller-driven military training aircraft will
double.
The company is based in a cluster of sheds which looks more like a farm than
a factory, just outside Kirkbymoorside on the edge of the north Yorkshire
moors.
The US Air Force has chosen Slingsby's T-67 Firefly aircraft as its new
basic trainer for pilots. Slingsby won an order from the US Air Force for up
to 113 Firefly trainers worth about Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.1m) after a
fierce international competition.
To win the order the small Yorkshire company, with annual sales of about
Pounds 7m, teamed up with Northrop, one of the giants of the US defence
industry.
Mr John Dignan, Slingsby's marketing director, said: 'This is really a case
of the mouse that roared.' The company will soon start shipping the aircraft
kits to the US for assembly by Northrop at Hondo in Texas.
The order came at an excellent time for Slingsby. Mr Michael Jones, a group
executive of ML Holdings, the engineering group which acquired Slingsby
eight years ago, said: 'Like everybody else we have had to cut back this
year because of the recession and the lack of work in the aerospace
business.'
However, Mr Jones said that after reducing its workforce from 202 to 140
people this year, the company's payroll was now expected to rise to 230.
Mr David Holt, Slingsby's managing director, said: 'Our production will more
than double from about four aircraft a month to nine a month. We've had to
gut our factory space and refurbish it to prepare for this big jump in
production.'
The company was founded in the early 1930s by a carpenter from Scarborough,
Mr Fred Slingsby, and originally made gliders and sailplanes.
Slingsby is still known locally as 'the glider company', but has evolved in
the last 20 years under a series of owners, including Vickers and British
Underwater Engineering.
It is now a high-technology designer and manufacturer of composite products
and components for the aerospace and marine industries.
The company supplies parts to some of the world's biggest aerospace
manufacturers including Boeing, Airbus and British Aerospace. It also
designs and makes parts for airships and underwater equipment and robots for
the offshore oil industry.
Mr Dignan said: 'It has taken us 10 years to establish the aircraft in the
market and we expect we will now win many new orders on the back of the US
Air Force deal.'
The first 10 Slingsby two-seater aircraft were built of wood on a licence
from Fournier, a French light-aircraft manufacturer.
In 1983 the North Yorkshire company applied its expertise in composite
materials to develop an all-composite version of the aircraft.
Since then, excluding the new US contract, the company has sold 104 trainers
to 10 countries, including Switzerland, Turkey, Canada, Hong Kong, the
Netherlands and Norway.
It claims the Firefly is now in a good position to be chosen as the new
primary trainer for the Royal Air Force, which is due to decide on an order
for 20 aircraft next month.
One of the aircraft's selling points is that it can perform, on a small
scale, many of the tasks of a sophisticated fighter aircraft.
Mr Norrie Grove, Slingsby's chief test pilot and a Spitfire veteran, said:
'This aeroplane is designed to train a pilot at the most important stage of
his early career, when he is learning the basic skills.'
It is expected that in the next five years 25 countries will replace their
primary military trainers, involving about 520 aircraft worth Dollars 300m
to Dollars 500m over the next 10 years.
Mr Dignan said: 'There are six manufacturers competing for this business and
there is not room for everyone.'
Slingsby has some advantages. Its labour costs are relatively low and the
company is one of the rare manufacturers in an area of small market towns,
enabling it to keep a stable local base of skilled labour. In its own tiny
way, Slingsby has become the Boeing of Kirkbymoorside.

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MR RICHARD STOTT was yesterday sacked as editor of the Daily Mirror
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the second newspaper editor to be removed from Mirror Group Newspapers in
under a week.
MGN said his successor, Mr David Banks, was joining the company 'without any
of the Maxwell experience that still infects the operation'. MGN also said
the Daily Mirror would stick to its line of trying to help the election of a
Labour government. But there would be a 'more modern approach' to political
coverage. One executive said there would be less 'ranting propaganda'.
The paper would also seek to recapture its crusading spirit 'on issues of
real concern to readers, like mortgages and other consumer issues'.
Mr Stott, who edited both the Daily Mirror and the People twice and had
worked for MGN for 24 years, left as Mr Banks flew in from Australia. Mr
Banks, 44, was editor of the Telegraph Mirror in Sydney. He has also been
deputy editor of The Australian and night editor of The Sun in London.
Mr Banks said: 'Today we finally bury Maxwell at the Daily Mirror. This is a
new beginning.'
Last week Mr Bill Hagerty was removed as editor of The People. MGN said
yesterday his successor would be Ms Bridget Rowe, editor of the Sunday
Mirror. Ms Rowe will be succeeded by her deputy, Mr Colin Myler - a former
news editor at Today under the editorship of Mr David Montgomery.
The changes follow last month's appointment of Mr Montgomery, former editor
of the News of the World as well as Today, as MGN chief executive.
Daily Mirror journalists last night described the events as 'the beginning
of the end'. A statement said: 'Three weeks after he promised editorial
independence and assured us that editorial jobs were safe, David Montgomery
has sacked two out of three editors.'

The highest contribution came from sales of Pounds 224m in the fifth issue

per cent over inflation if held for five years. These were withdrawn from

FT  16 NOV 92 / Coal county fears loss of its strongest prop: Paul
Cheeseright explains why Nottinghamshire has lost its former resilience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST round of pit closures will hit Nottinghamshire harder than those
of the 1980s. Then, the county's economy was more robust and there were
plenty of older miners who could retire early. Now the average age of
Nottinghamshire miners is only 33.
Fears that colliery closures could lead to a 15 per cent shrinkage of the
county's gross domestic product were aired last week in an inquiry into the
future of the coalfields conducted for Nottinghamshire County Council by Mr
Anthony Scrivener QC.
Nottinghamshire County Council complains that 'there has been no special
government assistance for the area, yet job losses equal those of three
Ravenscraigs and four Consetts' - a reference to steel-industry closures
which attracted government help.
The decline of the coal industry in the county has coincided with a
reduction of employment in engineering and traditional industries such as
textiles.
In early 1981 Nottinghamshire was the most prosperous county in the East
Midlands, measured by gross domestic product per capita. Its GDP was 103 per
cent of the UK average. By the end of the decade this had fallen to 97.5 per
cent. In the region the county had been overtaken by Leicestershire and
Northamptonshire.
In the 1980s there was a marked increase of employment in the services
sector, albeit off a low base, but the most striking characteristic in the
jobs pattern of the county economy was the diminished role of coal mining.
Since 1980 17 collieries have been closed with the loss of 26,000 jobs.
It is not clear to what extent those who lost their jobs have been absorbed
into the economy. There are no statistics to show how many miners retired,
how many found other jobs or how many remained unemployed. It is clear,
however, that the effect on the economy was severe.
The 1989 census of employment showed that 2 per cent of the UK workforce was
engaged in the water and energy industries, but in the Nottinghamshire coal
area the proportion was 12 per cent and, in rural areas, where most of the
coal mines were, the proportion was 34.1 per cent.
Direct coal-mine employment has fallen since 1980 from more than 38,000 to
fewer than 14,000. Under British Coal's initial proposals a further seven
pits, employing 5,680 directly, would have been shut.
This number has been reduced to two in the immediate future as a result of
the announcement last week by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary. They are Cotgrave, south of Nottingham, and Silverhill, in the
Alfreton-Ashfield area, employing 1,340 miners. The remaining five await the
outcome of Mr Heseltine's review.
The future of the county coal industry is thus uncertain. The stakes are
higher than simple colliery closures, however. British Coal in
Nottinghamshire has been paying out more than Pounds 260m a year in wages
and salaries. The county coal mines have been buying in goods and services
worth more than Pounds 210m a year. The coal mines are among the biggest
customers of East Midlands Electricity, spending more than Pounds 28m a
year.
Nottinghamshire County Council calculates that, for every two jobs which
disappear from the mines, another goes outside. It fears for the future of
the local coal-fired power stations. It is worried that the removal of
spending power from the economy will result in the atrophy of economic
activity, hitting the leisure and recreation industries first.
The pains of more coal-mine closures will vary in their severity. Cotgrave
and Calverton - the latter is on the review list - are on the fringe of the
diversified Nottingham city economy. Here the opportunities for employment
are likely to be higher than in the Alfreton-Ashfield and Mansfield areas,
where the other collieries - Bilsthorpe, Clipstone, Rufford, Bevercotes and
Silverhill - are situated.
Male unemployment rates in Mansfield are 20 per cent and in
Alfreton-Ashfield 14.5 per cent, explaining the government's decision to
grant Mansfield assisted-area status.
Unemployment rates are running consistently above the national average and
it seems that the expansion of the services sector has not been enough to
cope with the pains of a restructuring economy.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Union challenge to 24-hour banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bifu banking, insurance and finance union is considering industrial
action against TSB, Britain's sixth biggest bank, which is planning an
around-the-clock telephone banking service.
The experimental telephone service, staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year,
will offer full banking and insurance services.
Bifu, which represents about 90 per cent of TSB's 25,000 employees in
Britain, believes the changes, which TSB is to evaluate with a view to their
introduction nationally, are bound to mean job cuts and a poorer career
structure, with fewer branch-manager posts and a reduction in skilled jobs.
Mr David Carter, Bifu north-east England organiser, said: 'It will set the
precedent nationally. We aren't going to stand in the way of progress but
it's a question of how they do it.'
The Teleservice project is part of an Pounds 8.5m package of measures,
including weekday evening and all-day Saturday opening, which are being
introduced as a prototype into Tyneside, a TSB strong-hold.
TSB said the experiment, which included increased automation of branches and
the closure of a small number of its 22 Tyneside outlets, was aimed at
enhancing its services. It would not mean job losses.
Tyneside has been chosen for the experiment because it has a strong TSB
customer base and a large network of branches.
The bank is also investing Pounds 1.5m in its sole Watford branch to see if
upgraded services there can win more customers.
The Gateshead-based service, initially for use only by Tyneside and Watford
TSB customers, has started operating during the day, but will start
around-the-clock operation in February.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Call for action on laundering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL co-ordination is needed to counter the use of electronic
payment networks by criminals laundering the proceeds of drug trafficking
and robberies, the Bank of England warns this week.
The Bank says in an article to appear in its Quarterly Bulletin on Thursday:
'The increasing efficiency and integration of the world's financial system
creates an environment that organised criminals are only too ready to
exploit.'
The Bank is one of the seven founding members of the international Financial
Action Task Force, which is the main forum focused on combating money
laundering.
The task force has been particularly concerned that many electronic payment
instructions 'fail to include the names and addresses of both senders and
beneficiaries'.
As a result the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications
has told all its clients to include these details.
Few money launderers are caught. In the UK only two employees of financial
institutions have been prosecuted for money laundering under Section 24 of
the Drug Trafficking Offences Act, although about 12,000 suspicious cash
movements are expected to be reported this year.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Effect of the recent fall in the value of the pound
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT fall in the value of the pound in the international currency
markets will have 'increased substantially' the sterling value of Britain's
overseas assets, the Bank of England says.
The rise follows a sharp fall in the average for the first half of this year
from the average for the whole of last year. Preliminary figures suggest a
decline of Pounds 9.9bn to Pounds 6.2bn.
The changes reflect share- price and currency fluctuations, says a report in
the Bank's Quarterly Bulletin.
The report also says preliminary capital-flow data for the first half
suggest that net outflows increased from last year.
The bank warns, however, that the figures are 'highly provisional and are
inconsistent with a current-account deficit recorded over the same period'.
Earnings resulting from the interest, profits and dividends on overseas
assets improved in the first half, with a net inflow of Pounds 900m compared
with Pounds 300m in the whole of last year.

FT  16 NOV 92 / London's lead in forex deals grows: Bank oF England
Quarterly Bulletin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON HAS extended its lead as the world's biggest centre for currency
dealing, the Bank of England says. It adds that the change has come amid a
big increase in activity in the global foreign exchange market.
The Bank attributes London's dominance not only to higher turnover but also
to more diversified dealing. Operators in London deal in a very broad range
of currencies, while 74 per cent of dealing in New York is between the
dollar and the D-Mark, the yen, sterling and the Swiss franc.
The report, released ahead of publication in the Bank's Quarterly Bulletin
this week, lists big changes in the nature of foreign currency dealing since
the previous survey in 1989.
Among the changes are a rise in non-dollar transactions, especially those
involving the D-Mark, a fall in the proportion of dealing done through
brokers, and a sharp increase in the market share of the top 10 interbank
dealers in London.
The Bank survey was part of a project conducted in April this year in which
26 central banks analysed foreign exchange turnover in their countries.
The Bank says turnover increased in every leading centre, with net daily
turnover in London rising by 60 per cent since 1989 to Dollars 300bn this
year.
The second centre on the league table was the US, where the daily total rose
from Dollars 129bn to Dollars 192bn. Japan was third with a rise from
Dollars 115bn to Dollars 128bn and Singapore fourth with a rise to Dollars
74bn from less than Dollars 60bn. Switzerland, Hong Kong and Germany were
fifth, sixth and seventh.
The Bank says there has been a big increase in the volume of foreign
exchange activity over the past three years and the rise has almost
certainly been bigger than that for world trade.
'Part of the increase in foreign exchange turnover must have been generated
by the rise in cross-border capital flows which have been stimulated by the
deregulation of financial markets,' it says.
The rise in turnover has been accompanied by 'a significant shift' in the
balance between spot and forward business over the past six years. In
London, the proportion of spot business (immediate transactions) fell from
64 per cent in 1989 to 50 per cent this year. By contrast, the share of
forward transactions (in which dealers lock into a specific rate for a
determined point in the future) has risen by 120 per cent.
In London, the Bank reports, the 10 most active principals have increased
their market share, with a combined 43 per cent this year against 35 per
cent in 1989.

FT  16 NOV 92 / South-east housing cost 'hits the young'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COST of housing in the south-east of England is forcing young people to
remain living with their parents and to put off starting a family, according
to a report published today by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social
research organisation.
In a survey of people aged 18 to 35 in the south-east, one in seven said
that they had stayed with their parents for longer than they wished because
of concerns about the cost of a home. One in nine had delayed parenthood and
a similar number had delayed setting up home with their partner.
Of those with a mortgage, 60 per cent were paying more than Pounds 400 a
month. Those living with parents tended to pay only nominal rent.
The survey shows that only a minority of young people will get help from
their parents with housing costs. Less than a fifth of those who had left
home received any help.
The median amount was Pounds 1,000.
The effects of housing costs on young people's lifestyles, Joseph Rowntree

FT  16 NOV 92 / MPs may back energy body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BACKBENCH MPs examining Britain's energy sector are seriously considering
the idea of setting up an energy agency to help oversee strategic
decision-making.
Under one possible model Offer and Ofgas, the electricity and gas industry
regulators, could be merged and given enhanced powers in formulating energy
policy.
This agency would not seek to usurp ultimate authority from government
ministers but would advise them on subjects such as the appropriate energy
mix for the country's interests and pollution-related matters. Any such move
 -aimed at correcting widely perceived shortcomings in the present regime -
would probably require legislation.
The all-party trade and industry select committee started its inquiries last
month in the wake of the announcement of controversial plans to close 31
coal pits and make 30,000 miners redundant. It is due to continue taking
evidence for a further month.
Chaired by Mr Richard Caborn, Labour MP for Sheffield Central, the committee
is expected to publish its recommendations soon after MPs return from the
Christmas recess in January.
Among a series of presentations arguing for a more interventionist approach
to energy strategy, the views of Mr Dieter Helm, the Oxford economist, are
thought to have been warmly received by MPs across the political spectrum.
Mr Helm argued in evidence to the committee for an energy agency 'quite
closely mirrored on the government's proposals for an environmental agency'.
He added: 'This agency may well have the duties to produce capacity
forecasts . . . and it may well have licensing powers.' Offer and Ofgas, he
said, did not have 'the wider interests or the relevant powers to conduct
energy policy'.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Leasehold law reforms may be broadened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is urgently considering whether to broaden slightly its
proposed leasehold reforms giving private-sector tenants the right to buy
the properties in which they live.
The change would extend the reforms to leaseholders in some properties
where, for example, there are flats above a shop. At present, because the
reforms do not apply to tenants of properties where more than 10 per cent of
the floor space is used for non-residential purposes, there would have to be
nine floors of flats above a shop before tenants of that building could
benefit.
The move follows pressure from Mr Dudley Fishburn, the Tory MP for
Kensington, who is on the cross-party committee of MPs considering the
housing and urban regeneration bill debated by the Commons as a whole at the
start of this month.
Mr Fishburn has put forward an amendment to the bill which would include
within the reforms properties where up to 20 per cent of the floor space is
not residential.
The committee will have an opportunity to decide on the move tomorrow, but
there are signs that Sir George Young, the housing minister, is ready to
look again at the 10 per cent cut-off point.
Ministers hope that the signal from Sir George will be enough to persuade Mr
Fishburn not to press the matter to a vote tomorrow - if he did the
government could face defeat.
This sort of 'pro-tenant' proposal attracts opposition support and so poses
much more of a danger to the government than the louder clamour from within
the Tory party on behalf of landlords.
Mr John Battle, an opposition housing spokesman, has made clear that Labour
would prefer the leasehold plans to extend to properties where up to half
the floor space was non-residential, but the party would be ready to support
Mr Fishburn's more modest proposal to persuade the government to think again
about the limit.

Ann Widdecombe, a junior social security minister and a leading opponent of

Yesterday's Sunday services were the first since the vote by the general

women.
Miss Widdecombe has left the Church of England and said many other people
were in the same 'self-imposed excommunication'.
She added: 'Today I come as a visitor from nowhere.'
Dr George Carey, archbishop of Canterbury, said on BBC Radio that he would

FT  16 NOV 92 / Banks fight watchdog plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of the proposed Personal Investments Authority looked uncertain
yesterday as it emerged that months of talks have not moved the British
banking community any closer to joining the self-regulatory organisation.
The authority's formation committee, which includes two bank
representatives, is to meet this week to consider amendments to its proposed
charter in the light of comments from potential members.
Participation by a majority of Britain's banks is considered crucial to the
success of the new body. The Association of British Insurers said last week
that its members - which will provide the bulk of funding for the PIA and
its contribution to the Investors' Compensation Scheme - would not join
unless at least 95 per cent of potential members joined as well.
That means that unless the banks join, the life insurers will not join,
ensuring the authority's failure.
The British Bankers Association is said to have spelled out in a detailed
memo late last month its objections to the structure of the PIA and to have
outlined several changes which would have to be made before the organisation
could obtain its approval.
The bankers' association stressed that individual banks had to make up their
own minds, but is said to have told the formation committee in strong
language that the PIA proposal remained unconvincing on its merits, even
after months of discussions.
The bankers are said to have told the committee that there were few obvious
benefits to consumers from merging all the self-regulatory operations for
retail financial services into a single body.
Moreover, they said the new association was likely to be even more expensive
than the present system, under which different types of pro-viders belong to
different self-regulatory organisations.
Regulation was already underfunded for some businesses and, if the PIA felt
the need to keep costs down, it might sacrifice enforcement of conduct of
business rules in order to concentrate on efforts on reducing fraud claims
on the Investors' Compensation Scheme.
The bankers said that the proposed 30-member PIA board of trustees was
unworkable and would encourage conflict between constituency interests. They
said that the problem with the PIA was that its membership was too disparate
for the body to work well.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Pension curbs opposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS are strongly opposed to the prospect of pensions legislation
limiting their ability to use surpluses for their own purposes, accountancy
firm KPMG Peat Marwick found in a survey.
The government has commissioned an independent review of pension law under
Professor Roy Goode, whose committee has until next May to make
recommendations.
The 16 companies surveyed, all clients of KPMG, said employee contributions
to a pension scheme were fixed and intended to purchase a fixed level of
benefit in future.
They said surpluses arose when employers discovered that they had allocated
more than was needed to the fund, given the level of investment returns.
Employers should therefore have no restrictions on their ability to extract
surpluses, although they might choose to share some of a surplus with scheme
members.

FT  16 NOV 92 / DTI opens war on red tape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has launched a
sweeping review of every aspect of government impact on business.
He has asked every Whitehall department to provide details of all the
regulations for which it is responsible that affect business, including
those from the European Commission and from local government. The
information is due by the end of next month.
The aim of Mr Heseltine's 'baseline survey' is that everything on the list
should be considered for abolition or simplification, and that the survey
will form a mechanism for continuous review.
The DTI is conscious that the drive for deregulation is likely to work only
if it is accompanied by continuing ministerial pressure. Mr Neil Hamilton,
the junior industry minister, has started a series of meetings with
ministers in other departments to remind them that the initiative is
strongly supported not only by Mr Heseltine but also by Mr John Major, who
highlighted it in his speech to the Tory party conference.
The department has also won the first round of a battle over the
government's estimate of the cost to industry of complying with legislation.
Ministers have agreed to explore whether compliance-cost assessments can be
published at the same time as the legislation to which they relate. At
present the assessments trail so far behind that they have scarcely any
impact on policy or legislation.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Unpicking the US and UK savings paradoxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH THE US and Britain, according to conventional economic wisdom, have
savings problems. But is their shared problem too much or too little saving?
The answer, confusingly, is that both statements are true.
The depth of the UK recession, and the failure of economic forecasters to
predict its lingering nature, is largely explained by the uncharacteristic
willingness of consumers to save rather than spend. Since 1988, the UK
household savings ratio has doubled from a 1980s low of 5.1 per cent to 11
per cent in the first quarter of 1992. This occurred because consumer
borrowing, which counts as negative saving, has dropped sharply.
The UK personal savings ratio is still lower than its main European
competitors although it is now roughly comparable. The household savings
ratio in 1991 was 13.7 per cent in Germany, 12.7 per cent in France and 15.6
per cent in Italy.
The US, according to the released data, has a much lower household savings
ratio. According to the latest data, the US household savings ratio was a
mere 4.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year, down from 5.3 per cent
in the previous quarter but still well above its 1980s low of 3.1 per cent
in 1987. The implication is that US consumers cannot increase their
consumption as much as can UK consumers by reducing their rate of savings.
Yet this transatlantic comparison is misleading. The US household savings
ratio refers to personal savings and income, net of depreciation charges,
rather than to gross savings and income as is the normal practice in Europe.
In 1990, the US authorities deducted Dollars 229m (Pounds 151.6m) to cover
the depreciation of fixed household assets, equivalent to 6 per cent of
total consumption. Half of this depreciation applies to the decline in the
imputed value of housing wealth.
Mr Albert Edwards, an economist at Kleinwort Benson Securities, the
investment bank, has calculated the gross US household savings ratio by
restoring these depreciation charges. His adjusted US gross savings ratio is
shown in the left-hand chart.
The UK gross household savings ratio has, in fact, been converging on US
levels in recent years. UK gross household savings fell much further than US
savings in the 1980s but have since caught up. The US gross ratio was 10.7
per cent in the third quarter of this year while the latest UK figure was
10.3 per cent in the second quarter. Both countries need a fall in household
savings to fuel recovery.
Yet the medium-term economic performance of both countries has been hampered
by too little national savings, not too much. National savings is the sum of
private and public saving. The US government has been a net borrower
throughout the 1980s while the UK government is expected next year to have
twice as large a budget deficit, relative to the size of its economy, as the
US.
In theory, there should be little relationship between rates of national
savings and investment so long as low-saving countries are free to borrow
internationally. In fact, the correlation between national savings and
investment over the past 30 years is strong, as the right-hand chart shows.
High saving countries have tended to invest a higher share of their national
output, a relationship that has persisted throughout the 1980s. That is why
the new US administration aims to raise the US national savings rate, and
why that means tackling the budget deficit.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Dispute delays EC push for Japan trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A EUROPEAN Commission initiative to try to open up Japanese markets for
European companies is well behind schedule because of disagreements between
the Commission and the Japanese government over how it should be conducted.
A joint working group to monitor EC trade with Japan is likely to get under
way by late spring next year, far later than the Commission had hoped.
The analysis of EC trade with Japan, which the Commission proposed in May as
a central plank of its economic dialogue with Tokyo, was supposed to provide
the basis for an annual ministerial review of the issue.
The project could provide the first test of whether the general joint
EC-Japan declaration on political and economic co-operation adopted at The
Hague last year will lead to detailed economic policy recommendations.
The Japanese government reluctantly agreed to set up the working group in
response to the European Community's mounting concern about its growing
trade deficit with Japan, which is likely to reach record levels this year.
However, the working group has yet to start work because the scheme has been
dogged by disputes over the proper statistics to use. The initiative has
been delayed in part because it has taken much longer than expected to
collect the relevant information from Community member states.
The scheme was heralded as the start of a more comprehensive and rigorous EC
approach to trade with Japan when it was announced in May in a Commission
report to the Council of Ministers.
The proposal was partly a response to the development of bilateral trade
talks between the US and Japan which Community officials fear will
disadvantage European companies in the Japanese market. The US has been
reviewing access to the Japanese market through the Structural Impediments
Initiative launched in 1989.
The Commission's report noted that the Community's exports to Japan fell by
about 4 per cent last year, while the EC's trade deficit with Japan rose by
25 per cent to Ecu29.5bn (Pounds 23.98bn). Japan's trade surplus with the EC
was worth Dollars 16.3bn (Pounds 10.7bn) in the first half of this year,
fuelled by an 11 per cent rise in Japanese exports to Europe.
Under the plan, the Commission would identify obstacles which EC companies
face in the Japanese market, partly by comparing their performance in Japan
with their exports to similar markets.
The Commission says it will 'then proceed to a regular and systematic
evaluation with the Japanese authorities of the results of the analysis.
This analysis should lead to recommendations on the measures required to
advance the penetration of Japanese markets by Community companies'.

THE Angolan government put Unita on notice yesterday that a new parliament
would be convened regardless of whether the opposition movement took part,
Reuter reports from Luanda. 'Parliament will function with or without
Unita,' said Mr Johnny Pinock Eduardo, deputy foreign minister. 'We cannot
continue to be prisoners of a party which lost the elections.'
Unita began a military advance after rejecting results of Angola's first
multi-party elections in September, which gave the MPLA government a hefty
parliamentary majority. President Jose Eduardo dos Santos narrowly failed to
win enough votes to avoid a run-off with Unita's Mr Jonas Savimbi, his foe
in the civil war that ended in peace accords signed in May 1991.
The Luanda government is to convene Angola's parties this week to discuss
forming a new parliament and national unity government, and holding another

FT  16 NOV 92 / India rejects rapid tariff cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW DELHI has ruled out drastic import tariff cuts as part of its programme
of economic reform.
Mr Ashok Desai, the finance ministry's chief economic adviser, said tariffs
had been cut by 10 per cent since the reforms started last year and would
continue to come down at about the same rate. 'The average tariff can't fall
at more than a certain rate which is fairly slow,' Mr Desai told a
businessmen's conference.
India's import duties are among the world's highest, and constitute a key
barrier protecting Indian industry from external competition.
Mr Desai's comments will dash the hopes of foreign companies which believed
the reform programme would rapidly open Indian markets to foreign products.
But they will reassure many Indian industrialists who have expressed concern
that they have been given insufficient time to prepare for the rigours of
international competition.
Mr Desai's remarks come amid a stream of signals from the government that
the pace of economic deregulation will be slower than expected when Mr
Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, embarked on liberalisation in July 1991.
Recently, the government has backed away from a rapid move towards the full
convertibility of the rupee on the trade account. Hampered by the scandal in
the Bombay securities market, it has held back planned financial reforms.
Mr Rao has indicated that agriculture would continue to enjoy heavy state
support. He has diluted the impact of cuts in fertiliser subsidies by
increased support for farmers buying fertilisers. A long-awaited policy
paper on agriculture adopted by the cabinet said the government would
continue to play a central role in guaranteeing 'remunerative prices for the
farming community'.
The International Monetary Fund and World Bank have so far expressed
satisfaction with India's progress. Mr Lewis Preston, World Bank president,
has praised the reforms. But he and other senior officials have also urged
India to press ahead rapidly with further deregulation.
Mr Preston, who flew to Calcutta yesterday on the final leg of his Indian
visit, said maintaining the momentum of the reforms was essential. But a
safety net was important to ease the shock of moving to a more
market-oriented economy.
'No shortage of requests' for new borrowings had come from the federal and
state governments during his visit, Mr Preston said. But India must
contribute by funding basic infrastructure and raising the prices of
commodities, such as electric power. 'The government, at federal and state
levels, has an essential role to play in developing India's infrastructure
and investing in its people.'

FT  16 NOV 92 / Turkey seeks consensus on Kurds

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE suffering of the Kurds should not be used by outside powers as a pretext
to partition Iraq, Iran warned over the weekend after a meeting of the
foreign ministers of Turkey, Iran and Syria in Ankara.
A joint statement reiterated their shared concern about the evolution of a
Kurdish state, despite repeated assurances from the Kurdish leadership that
it does not seek to divide Iraq.
Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, Iranian foreign minister, said the situation in the
Kurdish regions was chaotic, with a total absence of responsible government,
despite the election of a Kurdish assembly in May. Mr Hikmet Cetin, Turkish
foreign minister, warned the situation 'should not become consolidated or
legalised'.
In the run-up to the Gulf war, Turkish President Turgut Ozal had warned
Syria and Iran not to exploit the power vacuum if Iraq was defeated.
The latest meeting is the first time Turkey has broken ranks with its
western allies by seeking a common stance with its regional neighbours on
the Kurdish issue.
Iran and Syria both expressed concern about the 'interference' of outside
powers, an apparent reference to the air exclusion zone over Kurdish areas
provided by British, French and US aircraft flying out of Turkish bases.
The UK has proposed a meeting to discuss an extension of the operation,
which must be approved again by the Turkish parliament this year. It is
certain to be discussed during Turkish Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel's
visit to London next week.
Turkey, like Iran and Syria, fears moves to establish a separate Kurdish
state could fuel separatist tendencies among its own Kurdish minorities.
Turkey is also concerned that the security provided by the allies has
allowed the Kurds to further their political goals. Turkey is to link its
electricity power grid to Iran's, in a further move aimed at strengthening
Turkey's economic links with its neighbours. Turkish and Iranian officials
meeting in Tehran decided to join their power lines within two months,
according to Turkey's official Anatolian news agency. The project follows a
protocol signed in Damascus in October to create a common grid among Turkey,
Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq.
Turkey is close to agreeing financing for a 692MW hydro-power plant at
Biricek on the Euphrates which will provide electricity to Aleppo in Syria -
the first leg of this five-country project.

FT  16 NOV 92 / The European Market: Leading players weigh up costs of an EC
base - Michiyo Nakamoto assesses the complex forces affecting semiconductor
manufacturers in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE Saxon town of Braunschweig, near Hanover, the ritual sake barrel was
hammered open and toasts were exchanged in proper Japanese style, as Toshiba
Semiconductor GmbH last month celebrated its tenth anniversary in Europe.
Several hundred yards away LSI Logic, the US semiconductor manufacturer, is
preparing to move out of its state-of-the-art semiconductor plant and
transfer production to Japan.
LSI's plant, like that of its neighbour, is an assembly and testing
facility, although it specialises in customised microchips rather than
memories which are Toshiba's main product.
The markedly different fate of the two plants reflects the complex forces
affecting semiconductor manufacturers in Europe.
On the one hand, high labour costs, lack of supporting infrastructure and a
weak customer base are seen by some manufacturers, including Philips and
Siemens, as big obstacles to manufacturing in the European Community.
But companies such as Toshiba, Motorola and NEC claim that the strategic
advantage of being located in Europe outweighs the costs.
The foreign companies have not necessarily been reaping the profits from
their European operations. However, NEC and Toshiba, the world's largest and
second largest semiconductor manufacturers respectively, which have both
been in Europe for 10 years, and Motorola, the world's fourth largest
semiconductor company with a 25-year history in the region, are all
expanding their facilities.
Intel, the US group, and Mitsubishi and Hitachi of Japan, are also building
production facilities within the EC.
Philips, however, the largest European semiconductor manufacturer, has moved
assembly work to Asia for cost reasons, as has Siemens. They have left
behind only high-end fabrication operations which require close contact with
European R&amp;D facilities.
Despite these differences, there are some common difficulties that face any
semiconductor manufacturer in the EC. For example, manufacturing costs are
higher than in the US, Japan or elsewhere in Asia.
Mr Heinz Hagmeister, head of the semiconductor division at Philips, says:
'The same (semiconductor) plant, of the same size, making the same product
in the same production volumes will have 10 to 20 per cent higher costs in
Europe than its identical sisters in the US and Japan, and more than 30 per
cent higher costs than an identical plant in a newly industrialised
country.'
European plant operators work fewer hours than their counterparts elsewhere,
so companies in the region need to employ more operators to produce the same
volume.
Even semiconductor plants in Scotland, where labour costs are level with the
US and Japan and labour regulations are more flexible than on the Continent,
have higher costs because of the lack of a European equipment base and of
high quality materials.
Most semiconductor manufacturing equipment must be imported from the US and
Japan and attract an import duty of 4 to 11 per cent.
The lack of Europe-based equipment manufacturers also means that
semiconductor companies must keep a costly inventory of spare parts.
Maintenance is another problem. 'If you get into trouble with machinery it
takes time to get expert help. In the US you get overnight assistance,' says
Mr Laurent Bousson, corporate vice president of manufacturing at
SGS-Thomson.
Europe also lacks suppliers of the extremely pure chemicals needed by
manufacturers. Shipping these from Japan can double or triple the cost of a
unit produced.
Another worry is that there are few opportunities for manufacturers to
innovate or develop leading edge technologies in Europe.
While many US and Japanese computer and electronics manufacturers locate in
the EC, new products using the latest technology, such as notebook PCs,
laptops and hand-held TVs, are generally not introduced there first.
Mr Hagmeister says: 'This handicap for European semiconductor manufacturers
will obviously increase as more of their customers emigrate either because
they themselves suffer from the higher European costs of manufacture or
because they themselves experience a lack of market pull from their
customers.'
Mr Tsuyoshi Kawanishi, of Toshiba predicts that 'our customers will
increasingly move their manufacturing to South-east Asia.'
However, views are divided over whether the benefits of being in Europe
outweigh the costs.
Local manufacturers can respond more quickly to market trends and customer
requirements. Demand for locally produced components by customers who
themselves need to meet EC local content rules is another incentive.
European-based manufacturers also need to be close to their R&amp;D facilities.
SGS-Thomson, for example, makes advanced products in Europe, but 'when the
product matures we move it to the Asia-Pacific region', says Mr Bousson
Many foreign companies believe productivity gains and automation can offset
the disadvantages of manufacturing in Europe. Both NEC and Motorola say
productivity at their UK fabrication plants is competitive with other
regions.
For companies which have a base in the US or Japan that serves as their main
profits source and as a driving force for innovation, the difficulties
encountered in Europe are perhaps surmountable.
But without the necessary infrastructure, competitive costs for supplies and
market influence, the manufacturing environment in Europe may be most cruel
to indigenous semiconductor companies, which wonder whether the benefits
outweigh the disadvantages.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Microchip maker launches fresh search for partner:
SGS-Thomson emboldened by Dollars 2bn cash injection over five years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SGS-THOMSON (ST), Europe's only independent maker of microchips, is to
relaunch its search for a big electronics industry partner, emboldened by a
promise of Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) over the next five years from its
French and Italian state owners.
The French government is urging the group to seek a share exchange alliance
with a leading customer or semiconductor producer, following last week's
agreement on the package. The pact brought to a climax a year's intense
debate between an eager France and a cautious Italy.
'Now that the public shareholders have shown their confidence in
SGS-Thomson, the group can relaunch discussions with other groups. It could
be a European client or components supplier or even a Japanese or US
company,' said a senior French industry official.
ST tried to entice Philips and Siemens, the Dutch and German electronics
group, to join forces last year, but they were not interested. They had
industrial reasons for making other plans, but officials admit that doubts
over Italy's ability to support ST through Rome's public spending crisis
made the company a poor prospective partner.
This is by far the largest investment in ST to date and involves Dollars 1bn
of fresh capital plus Dollars 1bn of state research and development grant.
It will more than wipe out ST's Dollars 900m debts and pay for two-thirds of
the group's investment needs for the period.
France has been an unfailing supporter of ST, the world's 12th largest
microchip group and the third largest in Eproms, an increasingly important
kind of memory chip. Paris sees ST as the flagship of European attempts to
resist Japanese domination of a strategically vital industry, a theme which
commands sacred importance in French government circles. Italy, worried by
its public spending crisis, was unsure until last week.
The cash will come equally from France and Italy, which each hold 45 per
cent of ST through groups of state agencies led by their respective atomic
energy bodies. The other player is Thorn-EMI, the British electronics group,
which owns 10 per cent of ST and sees itself as a passive investor.
Thorn-EMI says it will not buy new shares and thus is content to let itself
be diluted to 6 per cent.
ST reckons the deal will enable it to fulfil its plans to more than double
its overall market share from the 2.3 per cent around which it has stagnated
for more than a year, to 5 per cent. At this level, it would expect to be
profitable enough to fund its own R&amp;D and fight the industry leaders on
equal terms. ST spends roughly a fifth of turnover on R&amp;D - Dollars 320m out
of sales of Dollars 1.6bn this year - well above the industry average.
It is a spectacular bet, even by the standards of the French and Italian
public sectors. It dwarfs the Dollars 300m which ST's shareholders invested
in the business at its birth five years ago, from the merger of two French
and Italian state-owned semiconductor producers. Since then, ST has received
no fresh equity capital, although it has benefited from European Community
research programmes, a declining source of cash.
In the process, ST has built up nearly Dollars 467m of accumulated net
losses since 1987, having lost money in all but one of the past five years.
It now faces debt charges which wiped out operating profits several times
over in 1991 and will allow it to make only a small net profit - if ST
officials' hopes come true - this year.
Will the rescue work? There should at least be no problem in putting the
plan into effect, says the French industry ministry.
It does not expect the European Commission to object to the rescue under
state aid rules because government shareholders are as entitled as private
ones to put cash into a commercially viable business and R&amp;D grants are
legitimate, the argument goes. Officials deny suggestions that part of the
R&amp;D grant is covert aid to pay for ST losses.
In any case, Brussels might hesitate to upset two important member states at
a time when European unity is already shaky and when the European Commission
it is about to undergo its four-yearly organisational upheaval as
commissioners' mandates come up for renewal.
The first Dollars 500m will be paid before Christmas, so ST's debt charges
will fall from early next year. ST's operating costs are down too, thanks to
a cut in staff numbers by 4,200 to 17,300 over the past two years. All other
things being equal, ST should therefore be able to produce a sizeable
profits rise next year.
ST's current five-year plan, as agreed at a recent meeting with its state
shareholders, calls for a total investment of Dollars 3bn, so it will have
to find another Dollars 1bn from its own funds.
French officials believe ST can generate enough cash to make this possible,
now that its debts are to be paid. However, a new equity partner would
clearly help.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Russia told to get its reform act together: US denies that
west has failed to keep its promises over financial help for Moscow
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US administration is growing increasingly irritated by complaints that
the west has failed to keep promises to help Russia, and wants President
Boris Yeltsin's government to follow through on the economic reforms it must
put in place before more money can be provided.
'The issue is one of Russian reform, not of the extent to which the west has
been responsive. The ball lies primarily in their court,' said a senior US
Treasury official.
US and other western officials have been piqued by criticism voiced mostly
by economic advisers to the Russian government such as Professor Jeffrey
Sachs of Harvard University and Professor Anders Aslund of the Stockholm
Institute of East European Economics. The latter last week accused the west
of hypocrisy and indecision in failing to provide funds to support Mr
Yeltsin's economic reform programme, and said western nations suffered from
a 'prejudice that Russia can only be ruled by a Stalin in the Kremlin'.
Reflecting divergent opinion in Washington about aid for Russia in the light
of the slow pace of reforms, Senator Sam Nunn last night warned that without
urgent support the democratic experiment in the former Soviet Union would be
short-lived.
Senator Nunn, the chairman of the Senate armed services committee who has
been mentioned as a possible secretary of state or defence secretary in
President-elect Bill Clinton's administration, attacked the west for failing
to pour as much aid into Russia as possible. 'The west gave more assistance
to (Mikhail) Gorbachev's communist regime than we have to Yeltsin's
democratic regime,' he said.
US Treasury officials, however, say the west has lived up to the Dollars
24bn aid programme announced in April by President George Bush and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in partnership with other leading industrial nations
in the Group of Seven.
Around Dollars 11bn of the G7 package was to come from bilateral aid;
finance ministry officials say they are on course to meet that goal by the
end of the year. The US is also pushing hard for the rapid completion of a
debt rescheduling to strengthen Mr Yeltsin's hand before the Russian
congress convenes for a new session on December 1. If accomplished, this
debt package would go further than the Dollars 2.5bn of relief originally
projected.
The only parts of the Dollars 24bn package which have not yet materialised
are funds from multilateral institutions. The biggest portion, some Dollars
4bn, was to have come from the International Monetary Fund, but Russia has
so far received only a preliminary credit tranche of Dollars 1bn. Western
financial officials, blame Russia for not only failing to produce an
economic programme to support a full IMF standby agreement, but for missing
even the economic targets set as conditions for the first credit tranche.
Government spending has not been brought under control, and new credits to
state-controlled enterprises in the third quarter alone exceeded the target
set for the second half of this year. 'The multilateral financing is
contingent not on what the west does but on what Russia must first do,' a
senior US official said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Although Burgundy probably enjoyed the best vintage in France this year, the
depressed state of the market at yesterday's Hospices de Beaune auction of
its new wine led to a sharp drop in prices for the third year running,
writes Edmund Penning-Rowsell in Beaune.
Average price on the 567 casks of red wine fell by 21.8 per cent to
FFr17,242 (Pounds 2,113), and the 96 casks of white were lower by 25 per
cent to FFr21,625 (Pounds 2,650). Prices would have been lower but for the
constant intervention of the firm of Patriarche of Beaune which bought 26 of
the 81 lots on offer. The only prominent foreign buyers were Japanese; the

The Finnish government has appointed a group of foreign and domestic
financial institutions to consider the future of five state-owned companies,
writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm.
The companies are: Kemira, chemicals (100 per cent state-owned); Outokumpu,
mining and metals (57 per cent); Valmet, paper machinery and engineering (73
per cent); Imatran Voima Oy (IVO) (95 per cent) and Kemijoki Oy (77 per
cent), power generation.
The government is looking to expand the companies' ownership base and is
keen to ensure they have adequate financial resources for their development.
The Neste oil and petrochemicals group is already earmarked for
privatisation.

SWISS VOTERS look likely to defy their government and reject membership of
the 19-nation European Economic Area (EEA) in a referendum on December 6,
Reuter reports from Geneva.
A survey in two local newspapers showed that only six, mainly
French-speaking, cantons favoured the EEA, while another seven, all
German-speaking and mostly in central Switzerland, continued to be strong
opponents. The remaining 10 cantons were previously evenly divided on the
issue.
Three days before Sweden's parliament votes on ratification of EEA
membership, an opinion poll yesterday confirmed growing opposition among
voters to EC entry.
According to the newspaper survey, in October, opponents of the EC leapt to
43 per cent from 38 per cent in April-May. Supporters dwindled to 35 per
cent from 39 per cent.

<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S industrialists cemented a new alliance with President Boris Yeltsin
at the weekend when they promised to support his market reform strategy in
return for an agreement by the government to compromise on its policies.
After attending a congress of the Russian Union of Industrialists and
Entrepreneurs on Saturday, the president said he had previously
underestimated directors of state-owned plants as a source of support.
The industrialists' main lobby group in turn issued a statement supporting
'the president's reform course' but demanding changes to avert
'deindustrialisation', to provide decent living conditions for all, and to
avoid mass unemployment.
However, Mr Yeltsin, who two years ago likened a fatal compromise on the
radical 500-Day Programme to 'mating a hedgehog with a snake', insisted
there were certain compromises he would not make. He told the industrialists
that Rbs1 trillion in fresh credits promised last week by Mr Viktor
Geraschenko, central bank chairman, would not be forthcoming because they
would trigger hyperinflation.
He also ruled out any attempt to restore price controls or the old system of
state orders under which the government supplies enterprises with the inputs
they need to carry out state procurement. Both the latter are included in a
programme presented by Civic Union, the opposition umbrella group of which
the industrialist lobby is a key component.
A compromise between the two sides is already being negotiated behind the
scenes, and to a certain extent, achieved in everyday life with constant
concessions by the government, which has all but given up its commitment to
Polish-style shock therapy.
Before the industrialists even met, Mr Yegor Gaidar, acting prime minister,
asked Mr Anatoly Chubais, his deputy responsible for privatisation, to set
up a task force with Mr Arkady Volsky, leader of the industrialists and a
key Civic Union figure. Its job will be to merge an alternative Civic Union
programme with the government's latest anti-crisis plan.
The gathering, in a Moscow bearings factory, simply rubber-stamped the
compromising ahead of a critical session of the Russian super-parliament
which will try to strip Mr Yeltsin of his emergency powers and his right to
appoint the government when it meets on December 1. 'This congress was only
a small part in a great political game,' said one of Mr Volsky's colleagues.
Meanwhile, General Pavel Grachev, defence minister, denied the government
had been contemplating imposing emergency rule. He said that emergency
powers were needed to impose order in crisis spots such as North Ossetia and
the former Chechen-Ingushetia, where up to 300 people have been killed in
fighting over land between local ethnic groups. Russia and the breakaway
southern region of Chechnya have agreed to pull their troops back from a
disputed frontier today, Itar-Tass news agency said.

Finland has already earmarked Neste, the oil and petrochemicals group, for
privatisation. The Finnish Communist Party, which has played an important
role in the country's history, yesterday decided to file for bankruptcy. It
is a victim of Finland's deep recession and of share investments gone bad,
Reuter reports.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Brussels considers steel aid proposals

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission may ask east and central European countries to
impose export taxes on steel production, under a draft plan to protect
Community manufacturers from cheap imports.
It is also considering ways of strengthening protective measures, such as
duties on steel 'dumped' in the Community, and safeguarding clauses in
existing political and trade agreements with Hungary, Poland and
Czechoslovakia.
Commissioners will debate the plan to help the ailing EC steel industry on
Wednesday in Strasbourg. It should include the offer of Ecu240m (Pounds
195m) over three years to help lay off or retrain as many as 50,000
steelworkers, plus further funds for plant closures and rationalisation.
EC steelmakers last month called for a far-reaching programme of political,
commercial and financial assistance and will lobby commissioners before
their meeting.
Brussels officials failed on Friday to decide whether such a plan could be
funded from the existing budget and reserves of the European coal and steel
treaty, as well as structural funds. But there is greater consensus among
commissioners on capacity cuts - which would be based on a consultancy
report to the industry - and so-called 'external' measures.
The Commission's trade and external affairs directorate is understood to
have suggested an export tax as one solution to the problem of cheap non-EC
imports. However, some officials feel this would be at odds with the EC's
attempts to encourage free trade with eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet Union
and would almost certainly be rejected by the countries concerned.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Fuel embargo on Serbia flouted: Queues vanish as petrol
tankers violate United Nations sanctions
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCORES OF petrol tankers are crossing borders into Serbia in violation of
United Nations sanctions designed to end fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina, the
former Yugoslav republic.
At the weekend, a stream of lorries plied barely-monitored routes in and out
of Serbia and Montenegro, which make up the reconstituted, though
unrecognised, Yugoslav federation. They are heading for petrol stations in
Serbia, where fuel queues have disappeared because supplies appear now to be
plentiful.
The UN Security Council is today expected to consider measures to close
loopholes in sanctions on Belgrade. It is due to debate a ban on transit
through the former Yugoslavia, including strict measures to control shipping
along the River Danube and Adriatic ports in Montenegro.
The UN imposed sanctions on the rump Yugoslavia, including a trade and oil
embargo, on May 31. The sanctions are designed to put pressure on Serbia to
end bloodshed in Bosnia-Hercegovina, where Serb-backed forces have taken
over large swathes of territory.
Road traffic was halted this summer as queues for petrol snaked throughout
Serbia. Many petrol stations closed down and tens of thousands of workers
were sent on 'forced holidays'.
But after five months of sanctions, Serbia has secured fresh supplies
through a wide network of black marketeers. Organised crime also appears to
be involved in the importing. At least 14 private petrol stations have
opened in Serbia in the past two months, all licensed by Serbian
authorities.
European diplomats believe the renewed petrol supplies has boosted popular
morale which will help Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and his ruling
Socialists at the polls in elections on December 20. Mr Milosevic vowed
recently that 'Serbia will neither freeze nor go hungry. It will not allow
state and national interests to be brought into question because of
pressure.'
The Serbian president is seen by the international community as the chief
instigator of the ethnic violence in Bosnia.
Tankers bearing number plates from Serb-held cities in Bosnia are daily
crossing the border into Bulgaria, Greece and the former Yugoslav republic
of Macedonia, returning laden with petrol for Serbia.
Western diplomats say petroleum-based products are also being shipped from
Romania along the River Danube. They say oil is also being supplied from
Russia and the Ukraine. 'Petrol will always get into Serbia,' one lorry
driver said at the weekend.
Most lorry drivers show falsified documents, according to border police and
diplomats, claiming their cargo is bound for Bosnia or destinations beyond
the former Yugoslavia.
A customs official at Gevgelija, on the Macedonian-Greek frontier, who
requested anonymity, said: 'They no longer use the main border crossing but
take other routes, at Novo Selo for instance.'
At the weekend, snow blanketed the winding mountain road to Kriva Palanka, a
mining town in eastern Macedonia near the Bulgarian border. Macedonian
border police say that despite its remote location, it is one of many routes
used to transport petrol. They say Bulgarian tankers regularly deliver
petrol to Serbia despite Bulgaria's call for sanctions to be stepped up.
The 100 monitors posted on Yugoslavia's international borders and the
western naval fleet in the Adriatic have reported hundreds of violations but
do not have the power to intervene, diplomats say.
Meanwhile, fighting continues in Bosnia. A UN-brokered ceasefire among Serb,
Croat and Moslem military leaders was widely violated at the weekend.
Fighting was reported in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, and in northern
Bosnia as Serb forces launched an offensive on Maglaj, one of the last
strongholds of the mainly Moslem Bosnian forces.

<TEXT>
THE UN'S military commander in Bosnia, Gen Philippe Morillon, was yesterday
trying to obtain a halt to fighting west of the city of Travnik, writes
David White in Split.
However, UK officers said a controversial proposal by Gen Morillon to use
British troops to rescue wounded refugees fleeing from Serb attacks now
appeared unnecessary. Using British forces in this way would have meant a
widening of the UN's military role in Bosnia.
The proposal came after hundreds of Moslem refugees from the Karaula area
near Turbe, west of Travnik, passed through Travnik on Saturday night on
foot or in horse-drawn vehicles with household belongings, sheep and cattle.
A number were believed to have been wounded as their route between Karaula
and Turbe was attacked.
The Moslem commander asked the British for help on Saturday but yesterday
withdrew his request.
Twelve hundred evacuees left Sarajevo yesterday in two convoys of women and
children, the old, the sick and the wounded, Reuter reports from Sarajevo.
Seven hundred Serbs left on board 10 buses on the short but perilous journey
along 'Sniper Alley' to the airport and across the runway to Lukavica, and
then north to Belgrade - the Serbian heartland.
Later, 500 Croats and Moslems crowded on to five buses for their journey
west through the lines of the Serb besiegers to Kiseljak, 30km away.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Czechs and Slovaks face the pain of breaking up: The
problems of dividing archives, armed forces and buildings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PITY the unfortunate officials at the Czechoslovak Defence Ministry. They
have been saddled with the task of dividing up, as fairly as possible, not
just the country's armed forces and weapons but also its archives, including
important records from the second world war and the years of communist rule.
Worse, they have to find a solution before the country divides into the
republics of the Czech Lands and Slovakia on January 1 1993.
Apart from cutting everything in three and handing two pieces to the Czechs
and one to the Slovaks, to correspond to the population ratio, they simply
do not know how to begin dividing such historical material.
As an example of the problem that breaking up can bring, the issue of the
archives is not entirely trifling. Slovakia's defence minister, Mr Jozef
Tuchyna, has said that if there is no full agreement on defence between the
two republics before January 1, Slovakia may not accept any others.
Defence, agriculture and the division of federal property are the three
crucial areas on which no consensus has yet been reached. The federal
property issue is proving particularly difficult and is unlikely to be
resolved by January 1. The main problem is that the federal parliament has
been unable to muster the necessary three-fifths majority to pass a bill
authorising the division.
Both the Czech and Slovak national councils have threatened to pass a
resolution forcing the parliament to act. The federal cabinet, meanwhile,
has agreed to set up a special commission of senior officials from both
sides, headed by the federal prime minister, Mr Jan Strasky, to get things
moving.
Property will essentially be divided territorially and in proportion to
population, with special measures to compensate either republic in instances
where most of the property of a federal institution is located in the other.
Slovakia is expected to be the bigger beneficiary. Not only are most
government buildings, for example, in Prague, the Czech capital, but the
Czechs also have most of the federal defence installations, though the
armaments industry is in Slovakia.
Despite these difficulties, however, progress has been made in other areas.
To date, 22 agreements governing future relations between the Czech republic
and Slovakia have been signed by the republics' prime ministers, Mr Vaclav
Klaus and Mr Vladimir Meciar. The most important is a customs union due to
come into force on January 1, which provides for abolition of all trade
restrictions between the two republics, a single customs territory, and
common tariffs on trade with third countries.
Both sides have also agreed to continue with a single currency - the koruna
 -for up to six months after the split.
Other agreements include a pact on friendly relations; the harmonisation of
social security and health benefits; environmental protection; double
taxation agreements; the protection of each republic's investments in the
other; and the maintenance of transport and telecommunications links.
These achievements reflect areas with a broad element of consensus. The real
haggling is over those areas where there is no common approach. Western
diplomats praise the 'businesslike' manner adopted by both sides. However,
one senior diplomat pointed out the importance of reaching 'some kind of
definitive arrangement' on the issue of federal property by the deadline,
otherwise 'it will drag on for years and will no longer be a priority'.
This point was underlined this week by Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, Czech republic
trade and industry minister. Returning from a trade mission to Italy, he
said the 'vagueness' surrounding the split had affected business confidence
in Czechoslovakia, and politicians must spell out more clearly what has been
achieved so far.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bernard Attali, Air France president, has protested to Sir Leon Brittan
that the EC competition commissioner is operating a double standard,
favouring recent takeover bids by British Airways (BA) to the French
carrier's detriment.
Mr Attali wrote to Sir Leon last week, threatening legal action and warning
that if BA's takeover of Dan Air and its planned half-share in TAT, the
French regional airline, went ahead, state-owned Air France might invoke a
review clause in its own 1990 takeover of another French airline, UTA.
Specifically, Mr Attali has charged the Commission with:
Adopting the wrong approach in clearing BA's takeover of Dan Air. By failing
to include Dan Air's total turnover at the time of the takeover in its
calculation, the EC anti-trust directorate put the deal below the threshold
of mergers to be vetted under the EC merger regulation.
In any case, Air France complains that the BA-Dan Air merger should have
been regarded as an illegal abuse of dominant position, because the two
airlines would have 60 per cent of slots at Gatwick airport and, together
with TAT, 'a total monopoly' of the Gatwick-Charles De Gaulle route.
Failing to prevent BA's purchase of 49.9 per cent of TAT going ahead while
it carried out an investigation. Mr Attali complained that Brussels had
checked Air France acquisitions in UTA and Air Inter for nine months in 1990
while it carried out a similar investigation.
Under that 1990 deal Air France was forced to sell its 35 per cent stake in
TAT and stay out of it for four years, Mr Attali said.
Failing to investigate BA's plan to take a stake in USAir, though it claimed
the right to scrutinise competition implications of other deals extending
beyond the Community.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Zero growth for western Germany expected in 1993: Forecast
by 'five wise men' gloomiest yet over economic prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'five wise men' who give independent economic advice to the German
government will today forecast a zero real growth rate for the western
economy in 1993, the most pessimistic assessment of German economic
prospects to date.
Although they expect a slight recovery in the economy in the second half of
the year, this will not be enough to outweigh the downturn of the next six
months, they say.
Unemployment in west Germany next year will rise by about 340,000 from its
present level of 1.83m. In east Germany it will be up by another 150,000
from the current 1.09m in spite of great efforts to soak up eastern job
losses in job creation, short-time working, and retraining schemes.
The first details of the report of the five wise men - leading economics
professors hired to give the government independent advice - were
circulating in Bonn yesterday and provide significantly more pessimistic
forecasts than the five leading economic institutes, which reported earlier
this month.
The institutes predicted a 0.5 per cent growth rate for both gross national
product and gross domestic product in 1993, but stressed that even that
would require a clear relaxation in the Bundesbank's strict monetary policy,
including lower interest rates.
Both reports are much more pessimistic than the government's own economics
ministry, which is still looking for western German growth of between 1.0
and 1.5 per cent next year, although that is already a reduction from the
forecast of 2.5 per cent it made last June.
Gloom over Germany's economic prospects has grown rapidly in the past three
months, as it has become evident that industrial orders were sharply down,
including investment in plant and equipment, and that there was no prospect
of early relief from the export market.
As far as east Germany is concerned, the five wise men expect a 6.5 per cent
growth rate, compared with the 7.5 per cent forecast by the economic
institutes.
They are believed to forecast an inflation rate of 3.5 per cent in the west,
and 8.5-9.0 per cent in the east (particularly reflecting higher rents).
The wise men are expected to focus on the failure of the 16 federal states
(Lander) to curb spending to the same extent as central government. Instead
of keeping to a maximum budget spending increase of 3 per cent next year, as
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, has urged, his own state of Bavaria
plans a 5.9 per cent rise, Hesse 5.8 per cent and Baden-Wurttemberg 5.6 per
cent.
Because of the economic downturn, overall public sector tax revenues will
drop by a net DM10bn (Pounds 4.1bn), according to the finance ministry.
Mr Waigel has imposed a ceiling on spending growth of 2.5 per cent on his
own central budget, although he has proposed that net borrowing increase
from DM40.5bn this year to DM44bn next year, to make up for the loss of tax
revenues. The Lander argue that with 40 per cent of their costs going on
personnel, they cannot curb spending to the same extent.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Leaked report revives Gatt dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DOCUMENT leaked to a French newspaper from an alleged European Commission
source yesterday revived the bitter dispute over EC concessions to the US on
world trade three days before the resumption of crucial talks in Washington.
The document contains figures which purport to prove that Mr Ray MacSharry,
EC agriculture commissioner, is going beyond the price and production cuts
agreed under reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy in his farm trade
negotiations with the US.
An official close to Mr MacSharry said it looked like a French attempt to
undermine the negotiations. These 'are certainly not official figures', he
said, adding: 'It's a fabrication.'
The leak comes just as the internal Commission battle over the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and European agriculture appeared to have
ended. Mr MacSharry returned as negotiator last Tuesday having angrily
resigned, accusing Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, of
undermining the negotiations and siding with his native France.
EC-US talks aimed at settling their oilseeds row and agreeing farm subsidy
cuts under the Uruguay Round of the Gatt talks resume on Wednesday night in
Washington.
The leaked document, carried by the Paris newspaper, Liberation, confirms
that the battleground will remain whether any Gatt deal brought back from
Washington is compatible with the CAP reform.
It claims that the 10m-tonne ceiling on production of oilseeds being offered
to the US by Mr MacSharry would require 21 per cent of land to be taken out
of production, against the 15 per cent 'set-aside' agreed now.
If the US demand for an EC output ceiling of 9m tonnes were accepted, idle
land could reach 38 per cent, the document maintains. However, the document
forecasts oilseeds output this year of 12.5m tonnes, sharply at variance
with official Commission forecasts of 11.4m tonnes.
Mr MacSharry's department maintains that what the Commission is offering in
the Gatt talks is well within CAP output and subsidised export projections
on cereals, beef and dairy produce.
These projections were thrashed out by member states - including France - to
fix a budget for the new CAP.
However, France, under pressure from its farmers, has argued against a Gatt
deal on the terms sought by the EC.
Paris claims farmers will be faced with cuts beyond those agreed this year
in the CAP reform. Its main objection is that the 24 per cent cut in the
volume of subsidised food exports prescribed by Gatt will hit its big farm
trade surplus.
France is expected to go on the offensive when EC farm ministers meet today,
having last week lost its battle to get the Community to prepare for a trade
war with the US.
Washington has announced Dollars 300m in punitive tariffs from December 5 on
EC food exports as a sanction on Community oilseeds subsidies, twice
condemned by the Gatt.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Heathrow rail link plans near collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS for the public and private sectors to set up a Pounds 300m rail link
between Heathrow airport and London are near collapse amid a bitter dispute
over who is responsible for undermining them.
The row could deliver an embarrassing blow to plans announced by the
government last week to bring public and private sectors together to build
badly needed roads and railways.
The Heathrow Express project, intended to speed passengers between Heathrow
airport and central London's Paddington station in 16 minutes, is being
developed jointly by BAA, the private sector airports group, and state-owned
British Rail.
The plan is for BR to carry the trains on its existing tracks for
three-quarters of the 16-mile journey. The private sector would build and
operate the spur needed to take the trains off the main line to Heathrow
airport.
Last week BAA accused British Rail of undermining the viability of the
project by asking too high a price for the use of the mainline tracks. But
BR is furious over the allegation, claiming that BAA's refusal to put more
money into the project is to blame.
A senior BR manager said the Heathrow Express trains would take 43 per cent
of the capacity of the fast tracks into Paddington, and the track charges it
was proposing were 'right at the bottom end of what anybody would regard as
reasonable'.
British Rail says the real reason why the project is in jeopardy is because
it yields a return on capital of only 7.8 per cent - too low to attract the
private sector backers needed to fund it. BR argues that BAA should be
prepared to put its own money into the project because the line will bring a
big increase in passenger numbers at Heathrow, BAA's most profitable
airport.
An annual subsidy equivalent to 2 per cent of BAA's annual pre-tax profits
would make the project viable, according to BR. Based on BAA's last reported
profit of Pounds 192m in the year to March, that would be about Pounds 4m.
British Rail and BAA are due to meet transport minsters this month in an
attempt to save the scheme. Sir John Egan, BAA's chief executive, is
believed to be hoping ministers will press BR to bring its track charges
down.
BR says it is 'naive' to think the government will do this when
privatisation is about to introduce a track-charging regime likely to be
even less favourable to the Heathrow Express.
However, BAA said yesterday that the project should be treated differently
because it held out the possibility of getting Pounds 300m worth of private
sector investment in a vital rail link which would not otherwise be built.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Major will urge business to seize opportunities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR will tonight make a direct appeal to British industry and
business to seize the opportunities on offer, as the government steps up its
efforts to create economic confidence.
In a break with tradition, the prime minister will use his speech at the
Lord Mayor's banquet in London to focus on the economy rather than foreign
affairs. The move is part of a concerted effort by senior ministers to keep
plans to pull the economy out of recession, announced last Thursday, at the
top of the political agenda.
Mr Major will tell his audience that following the Autumn Statement from Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, measures are in place to enhance confidence
and lead to economic recovery. His message is that all that is needed now is
for the private sector to take advantage of the current circumstances and
openings.
Mr Lamont yesterday also urged business to make the most of the
opportunities available, but refused to rule out tax increases in his next
Budget.
Speaking on BBC television's On The Record, he emphasised that the 3
percentage point cut in interest rates and the large devaluation of sterling
since Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism in September
amounted to a 'very considerable relaxation' of policy that would give a
'very important stimulus' to the economy.
He conceded that unemployment, currently 2.87m, would continue to rise 'for
some time', but said the measures he announced last week to help specific
sectors of the economy would assist the employment situation.
Mr Lamont expressed particular concern about the housing market and will
today meet mortgage lenders, when he is expected to press for the bank base
rate cuts to be passed on swiftly to borrowers. Lenders have used recent
cuts to widen margins rather than ensuring borrowers gained the full
benefit.
The chancellor would 'neither rule in nor rule out' tax increases in his
next Budget in March, and said the high level of government borrowing was a
'worrying feature' of the present economic situation.
This was why the government had agreed a very tight spending round in the
Autumn Statement, he said. A judgment on whether or not to raise taxes would
be made in March or at the end of next year, when the first unified Budget
covering government spending and revenue raising will be delivered.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, immediately labelled Mr Lamont 'the
unemployment chancellor', and challenged him to admit that thousands of
people would lose their jobs in the coming months. Mr Brown will seek to
press home his argument on Wednesday at the start of the two-day Commons
debate on the Autumn Statement.
Before then, both Mr Lamont and Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief
secretary, will face questions from the cross-party Treasury committee.
The scale of the government's task in trying to create confidence was
underlined by a Harris poll for Granada's World in Action programme, which
found that 84 per cent of those questioned believed Britain was worse off
financially than a year ago, and 52 per cent believed it would be worse off
still in a year.

<TEXT>
BELARUS, among the most conservative of the newly-independent former Soviet
states, is moving tentatively towards privatisation, writes David Waller,
recently in Minsk.
The Belarus government has appointed western advisers to help with the
privatisation process and plans next year to introduce legislation dealing
with the mechanics of the transition to a market economy, officials of the
government's State Property Agency said in Minsk last week.
So far, fewer than 200 out of 30,000 enterprises - employing just 1.4 per
cent of the country's workforce - have been privatised, largely through the
sale of vouchers to employees.
The government plans to introduce a legal framework next year which will act
as a catalyst to further privatisation, for example laying down private
property rights. The Uberoi Group of Germany is advising the government.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Job satisfaction higher in east Germany than west: Survey
points up the growing divide between those with work and the unemployed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS in eastern Germany express more job satisfaction than their
counterparts in the wealthy west of the country, in spite of poor job
security, lower wages and worse working conditions, according to a new
survey.
The result underlines the growing divide in the former Communist part of
Germany between those who are delighted to have held on to their jobs in the
new market economy, and those who have lost them and face prolonged
unemployment.
The survey of more than 1,000 workers in both parts of the country, carried
out by the London-based International Survey Research, concludes that 95 per
cent of east German employees believe they are doing something really
worthwhile in their job, 86 per cent say their work gives them a sense of
personal achievement, and 82 per cent think that their job is varied and
interesting.
'Equivalent scores in western Germany, though still high in absolute terms,
are significantly lower by comparison,' the survey reports.
'There seems to be little doubt that the high regard eastern German
employees continue to have for the value and purpose of their work enables
them to maintain a very high level of morale in the face of difficult
economic circumstances and diminishing employment security.'
Indeed, as might be expected, their confidence in job security is much lower
than in the west, and they are significantly less satisfied with their pay
and fringe benefits. For example, only 44 per cent of east German employees
believe fringe benefits are adequate, compared with 74 per cent in the west.
They are also less positive about western-style management practices in
their enterprises, such as performance recognition, training and development
and corporate communications, suggesting that such practices have yet to
gain much priority in the east.
The study is one of the first in the former Communist parts of eastern
Europe to be carried out by ISR, which specialises in surveys of employee
attitudes.
It points out that eastern employees are perhaps surprisingly confident
about the quality of the work produced in their companies (71 per cent), a
finding mirrored by east German management, in spite of the problems of
marketing eastern products on western markets.
The survey concludes that for Germany as a whole, employees are noticeably
less confident about the prospects for their companies than in other west
European economies: only 22 per cent of the Germans expect a change for the
better, compared with 36 per cent in France, 33 per cent in Britain and 32
per cent in the Netherlands, according to comparable ISR surveys.

FT  16 NOV 92 / Management: Quantum Leap into the dark - Alcoa has turned
conventional wisdom on its head as part of a radical reorganisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Paul O'Neill is giving one of America's oldest, most hide-bound and
hierarchical corporations the biggest management shake-up in its history.
From his position as chairman of the Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa),
he suggests that the world's biggest aluminium producer - like too many
other companies - has been following ideas rooted in the industrial
revolution.
Companies attempt to establish standard patterns and practise them uniformly
anywhere in the world. Their purpose is to 'eliminate the upsets that come
from human beings and to make things ever more mechanical and robotised'.
O'Neill suggests: 'The value of that model is exhausted. The model of the
future for a company like ours is one where there is a framework that is
understood and accepted by managers and employees but where there is an
expectation of local initiative and creativity and testing the boundaries,
rather than doing what somebody orders from thousands of miles away.'
To this end O'Neill has inverted the conventional management pyramid at
Alcoa. Instead of having the chairman at the top and the production group at
the bottom, O'Neill has put the customers at the top with the operating
units - the wealth-creators - directly beneath. Each layer then supports the
one above and O'Neill sees himself at the bottom.
Rather than the usual chain of command, the heads of each of Alcoa's 25
business units have been given considerable responsibility to manage their
operations in their own way. They report to O'Neill and also have the help
of a three-strong team of 'counsellors', all previously senior vice
presidents.
When the FT last looked in depth at the company a year ago, O'Neill had told
his business unit managers to analyse the performance of their best
competitors and he had given them two years to get to 80 per cent of that
'best'. He estimated then that by 1995 the so-called Quantum Leap programme
would add Dollars 1bn to Alcoa's operating profits. Now, half way through
the programme, O'Neill is taking stock of progress.
In his office in one corner of the 30th floor of Alcoa's headquarters
building in Pittsburgh, O'Neill seems a happy man. A small, energetic
person, he frequently swings his chair away from his desk to grab a 'mouse'
to bring up statistics to prove a point on the computer screen behind him.
He is now confident that, rather than an extra Dollars 1bn from the Quantum
Leap, Alcoa could reap an extra Dollars 2-3bn in operating earnings - 'if we
could operate at the limit of our potential'. Alcoa's best achievement so
far was operating earnings of Dollars 1.4bn in 1989.
'In many respects they (Alcoa business unit managers) have exceeded both
mine and their own expectations about the level of changes they could make
and the pace at which they could make them,' says O'Neill.
Alcoa's size - 157 locations worldwide - makes it impossible to pinpoint
exactly how much Quantum Leap has contributed to the company's financial
performance so far. But O'Neill is sure that the programme is giving Alcoa
an edge on its competitors.
One reason the programme is going so well, he believes, is because each of
the business unit presidents set their own goals. O'Neill says: 'I asked
them to give me their ideas on how we could achieve 80 per cent of the
world's best practical limits as we know them. They were asked what the
measures for the Quantum Leap should be and how they should be attained and
the pace at which they should be accomplished. And there was not a single
plan that I did not 'buy'. If you leave it to individuals to set their own
goals, usually they set goals more difficult than a third party would set
for them.'
The 'counsellor' system is also working well, says O'Neill. 'This system
enables the business unit people to talk to others who have seasoned
judgment without feeling they are talking to the boss. They can get a
different perspective but they don't have to take the counsellors' advice.
We have created a group of 'wise men' for the business unit managers to
consult.'
Information flows freely around Alcoa via its computer network. If a smelter
in Brazil cracks some complicated technical problem, all of Alcoa's other
smelters know about it almost immediately. The most important exchanges take
place on Friday afternoons when the business unit presidents tap in
information about all the most important happenings and trends in their
organisations. This information is not just for O'Neill but is available to
all senior managers, so the presidents read one another's reports. O'Neill
suggests this system makes it almost impossible for an individual to hide
any bad news from the others for very long.
While the presidents are running their businesses like individual
entrepreneurs, O'Neil spends a great deal of his time working on Alcoa's
strategy, particularly on its expansion outside the US.
'Alcoa needs to expand significantly outside the US: we continue to look at
a lot of things. But we won't jeopardise our financial position for the sake
of growth,' says O'Neill.
Meanwhile, a year through the Quantum Leap process O'Neill is sure that most
of the original goals will be met and 'some will be met far sooner than we
expected. In some businesses we have made so much progress that already we
are looking at major improvements to the goals set in the last quarter of
1991.'

FT  16 NOV 92 / Ankara plans telecoms sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY intends to sell 20 per cent of the state telecommunications monopoly,
and hopes to raise Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.5bn), Mrs Tansu Ciller, chief
economics minister, has told Turkish industrialists.
The sale would be Turkey's largest privatisation, and is certain to attract
strong foreign interest, although industry officials suggest there is still
considerable groundwork to do before the company is ready for sale.
Mr Yasar Topcu, minister for transport and communications, confirmed plans
to split the PTT between the postal and telecoms services to pave the way
for eventual privatisation. Industry officials say it still requires a
change in the law to allow an operator other than the PTT into the telecoms
sector.
The government has already sold PTT's two manufacturing subsidiaries, Netas
and Teletas.
Mr Topcu said the recent private-sector tender for mobile telephones, won by
Netas, a subsidiary of Northern Telecom of Canada, underlined the
government's aim to sell the entire operation.
Mr Fikret Ucel, head of Teletas, now part-owned by Alcatel of France, said
it was too early to think of selling PTT. According to the 1991 accounts,
the telecoms division accounts for 89 per cent of PTT's operating revenues
of TL10,459bn (Pounds 850m). The company made an operating profit of
TL580bn. It employs about 90,000 people.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Chess monster turns cartwheels: How the world's press has
become like a theatrical agent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMAGINE THE excitement if the team of Swedish boffins currently engaged in
the most exhaustive and scientific trawl of the depths of Loch Ness, were
actually to locate the famous monster. Better still, imagine that, having
picked up an awesome and otherwise inexplicably large blip on their sonar
equipment, the Swedish scientists were, with some local help, able to induce
the great beast to rise to the surface, for all to see.
Initially, I am sure, the attention of the world's media would be absolute.
Photographs of the monster would even displace the Princess of Wales from
the front pages of the tabloid press. John Major and the rest of his Cabinet
could sigh with relief as their daily traumas were relegated to down column
items. But their respite would be short. For within days the Loch Ness
monster would have lost its 1,000-year-old mystique. The Swedish scientist
would quickly have categorised the slimy brute and shown how closely it was
related to many other and more colourful species which trawl the bottom of
our oceans.
Russian scientists would immediately claim that a more interesting monster
had been discovered by them at the bottom of Lake Baikal. Above all, the
Loch Ness monster, simply by being seen and made available to the public,
would become mundane.
Much the same fate, I am afraid, has befallen Bobby Fischer. The comparison
springs to mind because the American genius has been so often described as
'The Loch Ness monster of world chess, often sighted but never seen'. The
man was already something of myth during his first incarnation. American
Champion at 14, World Championship contender at 16, World Champion at 29,
and the only non Russian to hold the title since the 1930s. Then a
Garboesque silence, sustained by the belief that he was the undefeated world
chess champion. Thus, Fischer's return match against Boris Spassky was
accorded the most monumental media attention when the event got underway at
the beginning of September.
Magazines made their covers available to Fischer, based on interviews which
consisted of no more than a few words of Fischer-speak, and thousands of
words of padding. Last week the match finally ended after 30 gruelling
games, with Fischer the winner by ten to five. It was a very impressive
margin of victory for a man who has not played for 20 years, even if the
more practised Spassky is not the player he was.
Yet Fischer's triumph was almost ignored: the television news bulletins
which broadcast extensively on the first game of the match, had no time for
the decisive one. Perhaps the modern media, which has become so much more
ephemeral even in the years since Fischer last played Spassky, could not
cope with the drawn-out drama of a top class chess match.
Partly to cope with this trend more grandmaster tournaments are adopting a
time limit of half an hour for an entire game, rather than the timeless
variety practised by the fuddy duddy veterans Fischer and Spassky. Cynics
might argue that Fischer did not demonstrate enough of his famed
eccentricity to capture the headlines. This is not the case.
I have subjected both Fischer-Spassky matches to eccentricity analysis and
there is no doubt that Fischer is more loopy now than he was in 1972. In the
earlier match he merely failed to turn up for one of the games, and barred
the television cameras from the event.
In the second match Fischer insisted on wearing a dark green leather visor;
argued that the second half of the event should be played with both players
encased in a giant glass bell; demanded that the players' private lavatories
be raised by two inches; barred his opponent's seconds from the playing
hall; would not allow his opponent to sit down before he did; and demanded
to play with a chess set last used in the Dubrovnik Chess Olympiad of 1950.
In between Fischer played at least two games of sublime, incomparable
brilliance. But still the media were bored. What more could an emergent
monster do to capture the public's imagination?
By analogy, it was as if the Loch Ness monster, on being dragged from the
murky deep, performed cartwheels and sang Auld Lang Syne and was booed off
the stage. The modern world's press has, in truth, become like a theatrical
agent with too much talent on his books. Sorry, Bobby luv, seen it once,
seen it a 1,000 times. Next]

FT  14 NOV 92 / Still sparkling on Sunset: Billy Wilder, undimmed at 86,
tells Nigel Andrews of a life in film, about Monroe and Lemmon, Hitler and
McCarthy, Chandler and Lubitsch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
'I AM against censorship. But I tell you, at de same time dair can be good
tings come out of it. Ven you have a new freedom, immediately it's exploited
by de pornographers]'.
Billy Wilder's Viennese accent is on overdrive.
'A director like Lubitsch, you see, was so much more subtle. In de old days
you could not say 'Son of a bitch', you had to say, 'If your mother was a
dog . . . ]'
'Now you ask me about de McCarthy era . . .' I had, ten minutes ago. But
meeting Billy Wilder is like wandering into a fireworks factory with a
smouldering cigarette. The greatest living veteran among Hollywood
film-makers is 86. But when I met him for a tete-a-tete in Los Angeles
recently, he still behaved like the felt-hatted pyrotechnician who made
Double Indemnity, Sunset Boulevard and Some Like It Hot.
If censorship had not existed, Wilder would have had to invent it. For 40
years after coming to Hollywood from Hitler's Germany, the Austrian-born
director was the cinema's court jester. He exposed forbidden topics to
gleeful satire or melodrama and never mind Senator McCarthy (that 'American
Dr Goebbels throwing his weight around') or any other of the moral or
political nay-sayers.
Wilder gave us adultery and murder in Double Indemnity; alcoholism in The
Lost Weekend; more adultery plus Marilyn Monroe having her skirt blown
around her thighs in The Seven Year Itch; transvestism in Some Like It Hot.
Today Wilder's kind of cinema, racy and literate, high-farcical and
sophisticated, is almost defunct. What he thinks of its modern replacement
we discussed when we met in his office off Wilshire Boulevard: a small
cream-coloured cube with a window that the filtered the sound of honking
summer traffic. First, though, where did Wilder come from?
'I was what they called a ghost writer, working without credit on scenarios
in Germany. That was before 1929-1930, before sound. Then in 1933 I left
Germany, the reason being Mr Hitler.' Wilder was on a skiing slope in Davos
when he heard that Hitler had become Chancellor. 'Already everyone knew what
this man was doing. Your office was taken over by someone you never knew;
you were thrown out of your job; and this was not just Jews but gentiles. If
you were an artist, you had to look out. Erich Remarque, Thomas Mann, Brecht
. . .
'So I came here where I could speak the language a little, which I had
learned from Hollywood pictures]'
Billy Wilder's US career began at sprint pace, scripting for 1930s comedies
like Midnight and Ninotchka: frothy escapism for an America wrestling with
the Depression. But the war changed Hollywood's mood and Wilder's style. As
director he had his first dark-toned triumph with Double Indemnity. Sex,
homicide and whipcrack dialogue: wrought by an unlikely, squally partnership
between Wilder and thriller master Raymond Chandler.
'I was young, always chasing girls. He was older, alcoholic and married to
this woman who was about a hundred years old. He had no idea how to write a
script. But he had this great ear for dialogue. There's a line in one of his
books where he says this man 'had hair growing out of his ears long enough
to catch a moth'] There's something perfect there. It's as good in its way
as Hemingway or Scott Fitzgerald.'
Chandler and Wilder cudgelled James M. Cain's novel into shape, although the
script's initial ending was one of two legendary scenes Wilder shot but
never used. 'I had the hero Fred McMurray dying in the gas chamber. But it
was too strong, it was out of key with the rest of the film.'
The other intriguing lost sequence is the beginning of Sunset Boulevard.
Wilder's giddy melodrama about a fading star (Gloria Swanson) and the young
writer she adopts as secretary-toyboy (William Holden) now opens with
Holden's voice-over, issuing as if from his dead body afloat in a pool. But
the film once began in a mortuary.
'We had the idea of the writer's corpse being delivered to the morgue. And
then we had a scene where he and the other corpses talk to each other about
the events that led to their deaths.
'It was very surrealist. But at the previews, once the scene began, people
started laughing. It tickled them. So I said, the hell with it. We just
begin with the pool.'
Wilder insists that screenwriting is as much a craft as an art. 'You can
come down from the mountain with a poem or novel, but not with a screenplay.
There must be technique, there must be architecture.' Yet his best movies
are also triumphs of the unplannable. Gloria Swanson stepped into Sunset
Boulevard as fourth choice. (The first was Mae West). The Lost Weekend owed
its haunting title to a printing error: the film was originally called The
Last Weekend. And directing two movies with Marilyn Monroe, The Seven Year
Itch and Some Like It Hot, required a mixture of saintly patience and blind
faith.
'It's tough, you sweat it out and you want to kill her. But you tell
yourself while this is going on - ten takes, 30 takes, 80 takes - well, one
day this is gonna be finished. You're not married to her.
'On Some Like It Hot we had Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon standing around all
day in the heat, wearing dresses and high heels. All this while Monroe tried
to remember a three-word line] 'It's me, Sugar.' She couldn't do it.
'If you caught her on a bad day it was hell, like squeezing a tube of
toothpaste. There was a kind of inhibition there, a kind of blank wall, and
of course she had a history of mental maladjustment in her family. But if
you caught her on a good day, it could be absolute joy. She had that Element
X, you know: something magical that draws you to the character so you don't
tire of it after five seconds.'
Some Like It Hot, Wilder's best-loved comedy, was followed by his own
favourite, the triple-Oscar-winning The Apartment. But then the prizes and
plaudits ran out. Wilder himself doesn't know why audiences shunned
bitter-sweet late comedies like Avanti], The Private Life Of Sherlock Holmes
and Fedora. 'Maybe I was trying to please them too much, tell them I'm a
good fella. They weren't successes.' By his light or theirs? 'When you have
1,000 people together in a theatre, you have to trust them. They are a kind
of genius, you know. Whether they laugh or are silent, you can hear it if a
film is working.'
But there are different kinds of silence. One can be discriminating
attention, another punch drunk stupefaction. Wilder in his eighties cannot
get used to a modern movie age in which people 'want action, car crashes,
957 kinds of explosion. The dialogue in a film today is the time to go out
and buy the popcorn.'
No wonder he feels a kind of despair whenever the urge comes to pitch a new
project. It is 12 years since his last film Buddy Buddy. 'I still think I
can make a picture. But what is difficult for me is to go in and 'sell' it.
You know, I go to an office at Paramount or Universal and across the desk
from me is the guy who used to be the mail-boy at the William Morris Agency.
And he is telling me how pictures should be made?'
Philistinism, claims Wilder, is innate in the structure of a modern
Hollywood studio. 'In the old days they operated like fiefdoms. Everyone was
under contract. Paramount had 104 writers under contract. Everyone had to
deliver ten or 12 pages every Thursday.
'Today studios are like the Ramada Inn. You hire the soundstage, the editing
rooms and dubbing theatres, then you get out. In the old days everything was
done under one roof. You had your actors right there. Warners had Bogart,
Rains, Cagney - all as contract players. Today, it's agents and packages and
deals. It's an industry run by big stars and strong agents.'
Hence the anomaly of this one-time movie prodigy working (or making plans
about working) from a tiny office, where in a desk drawer he still keeps his
notebook full of ideas for projects. Sunset Boulevard - 'Silent star wants
to make a comeback, gets herself a writer half her age.' The Apartment - 'I
had the idea after seeing Brief Encounter, and I wrote, 'How about the guy
who owns the apartment where the lovers meet, and has to crawl back into the
still warm bed?' Perfect for Jack Lemmon.'
Perfect for its time too. But Wilder believes the Golden Age of mordant
humanism has gone, replaced by the gimmickry of ra-ra plot ideas and
show-off special effects. Certainly few modern film-makers would look twice
at the sign he still keeps on his wall saying 'How would Lubitsch do it?'
'He was the all-time master. He never showed off. Directing a film should be
invisible. If someone grabs your arm during a picture and says, 'Look at
that camera angle' or 'Look at that special effect' - no good] Pictures
should be shot with style, but not to prove how inventive the director is:
like those scenes in a living-room that are shot through the fire in the
fireplace; because then I have to think there's either a burglar or that
Santa Claus has come down the chimney] You shouldn't be aware of cuts or
angles. Everything should be shot from a character's point of view.'
Wilder's own point of view may soon be much in evidence since he's writing
an autobiography. 'I suggested a title, but they thought I was kidding. Who
I Was, How I Became What I Am And Who The Hell Am I?'
'Because there's nothing pompous about me' he needlessly adds: in what may
be the first pompous remark he has made in an hour of conversation. But in
the age of PR and the hard pitch, perhaps even Billy Wilder realises he must
sometimes blow his own trumpet.

I AM ON a spending strike at present. Not a full-out spending strike. I
still buy food, toothpaste, cigarettes. Still travel into, and home from,
work. Still visit the movies. But in all other respects I have reduced my
spending to zero and at zero it will remain so long as Norman Lamont remains
chancellor of the exchequer. Lamont has got to go  - as go he will
presently, at which point I will career to the shops and start buying suits,
shirts, sportsjackets, shoes, electrical and electronic equipment, fine
foods and wines, paintings, etchings, silverware, books, expensive
stationery and pens - a Mercedes, I shouldn't wonder.
I am not alone in my Lamont strike. It is being imitated up and down the
land. Detestation of the chancellor is probably the single factor most to
blame for the continuing recession and the misery of retailers. Doesn't John
Major read the papers? Does Major do anything, apart from shilly, shally and
bleed?
No matter. For I have been reading some of the literature put out by
retailers in the run-up to Christmas, and exciting material it is, heralding
a liftoff in consumer sales just as soon as Lamont quits Number 11 Downing
Street. That may not be in time for Christmas 1992, but Christmas 1993 ought
to see people fighting to spend money on things they are presently doing
without.
Forget the state of the British or world economy; the bankruptcy of
politics; threats
of trade wars; the looming millennium; the diseases and disasters that are
obliterating the surface of this bone-weary planet.
I give you . . . personalised welcome mats. The latest catalogue from
Innovations includes a 'doormat with a difference - it can be printed with a
house or family name or with a message of your choice.' 24in x 14in, up to
12 letters on each of three lines, Pounds 9.95. Absolutely brillo. I am
tempted to order one. You can write a supremely rude message with up to 12
letters on each of three lines.
I give you . . . the amazing Aquamag. 'Developed in the UK (Pat. Pending No.
9108667.8), Aquamag is a breakthrough in the treatment of limescale. The
powerful curved ceramic ferrite magnets contained in Aquamag produce a super
field of high magnetic flux.' Eco-friendly, fits in seconds around your cold
water inlet, 15mm or 22mm, Pounds 29.95 or Pounds 34.95 - a
recession-wrecker if ever I heard of one.
I give you . . . a Sterling silver toothpick, crafted by hand, 3in long when
open, twist-barrel action, 'can be worn as a pendant or attached to a key
ring,' Pounds 19.95.
I give you . . . the smokeless ash tray, battery-powered, 4 1/2 in x 2 1/2
in, Pounds 9.95 . . . water-filled insoles for wearing inside your shoes to
act as shock-absorbers, developed in Japan, sizes 5-12, Pounds 8.95 . . . a
desktop document shredder with easy-empty waste box, 7in x 4 1/2 in x 5 3/4
in, Pounds 19.95 . . . and the Pet Vac and Cat Vac battery-operated
thingummies to vacuum-clean your pets, lightweight, cordless, non-abrasive
brushes, Pounds 19.95 and Pounds 8.95.
Above all, I give you . . . the 'amazing precision-made Litetronics light
bulb, guaranteed for 10 years.' I explained some time ago that my flat in
Notting Hill is illuminated by 46 light bulbs - in fact it is 47; I forgot
the light in the fridge - and that I constantly have to replace them. The
bulb in the Innovations catalogue is said to last 16 times longer than
ordinary bulbs and comes in pearl or clear, bayonet or screw, 40-100-watt,
Pounds 11.95 per three. I am ordering 48.
Do you see what I mean? The sooner Stormin' Norman quits Downing Street, the
sooner you, me and all our friends and pets can embark on a
recession-busting spending spree of brillo proportions. But I don't like
gadgets. Apart from the long-life light bulbs, I want none of the items
listed above.
I lead a simple life. For Christmas, I want cheap and simple presents. In
descending order, they are: 1) A John Major dartboard. 2) A Norman Lamont
dartboard. 3) A Michael Heseltine dartboard. 4) A Douglas Hurd dartboard. 5)
A Gillian Shephard dartboard. 6) A Paddy Ashdown dartboard (I voted for
Wing-commander Ashdown last April; how dare he not struggle with every sinew
to unhorse this ghastly government). 7) A Margaret Beckett dartboard (no
particular reason; she'd just look nice on a dartboard). 8) A Jacques Delors
dartboard (or anyone from France). Plus a box of darts.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Arts: The great deceivers - Screen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX YEARS ago director Ridley Scott declared: 'A lot of people don't talk
about production design nearly enough. Blade Runner was well photographed,
but what was being photographed was what had been built, over a period of
months, and carefully thought about and selected by the designer (Lawrence
G. Paull). For me, the designer is as important as anyone else on a film,
bar none.' This month Blade Runner's visual glories are about to go on show
in the film's restored version. In the intervening years, though, little has
changed in terms of credit and kudos for the unsung craftsman in movies.
Ten years ago, when I first researched film design, I discovered that nearly
all the great coup de foudre visual moments we remember in cinema - the
ghostly Xanadu in Kane, the Babylonian elephants of Griffith's Intolerance -
were the designer's inspiration more than the director's.
Who gave The Wizard Of Oz its fantasyland charm: the film's four
chop-and-change directors or its two stay-the-course designers (Cedric
Gibbons, William Horning)? And who imprinted the epic tableaux of Gone With
The Wind on our minds? As much as the two directors and their capricious
producer (D. Selznick), it was surely William Cameron Menzies, fresh from
Britain where he had designed and directed Things To Come.
Every craft guild fanfares its own importance. But the film designer's
Cinderella status has been a long-lived injustice. Patrizia Von Brandenstein
(Amadeus, The Untouchables, Billy Bathgate) was supervising set-building on
the new Robert Redford film Sneakers, which opened in Britain this week,
when I visited her on a noisy Universal soundstage. I began as a devil's
advocate. Film has long been fanfared as the most realistic of the arts, a
'window on the world.' Why do we need production design at all?
'It is very hard to tell a dramatic story except in the barest documentary
terms without someone interpreting it visually. Design is an emotional
reinforcement to the story. It is giving the audience visual clues; it is
leading them in and fooling them a little or illuminating them. A screenplay
is like a novel with three quarters of the words missing and we have to fill
them in.'
So here she was, building this loft where Redford and his surveillance
cronies will pore over their computers and data-banks. Brandenstein soon
gets metaphorical about her work on Sneakers, whereupon the designer's job
shifts up yet another gear.
'The interest in this set' - a wave at the Piranesi pattern of girders and
struts - 'comes from the geometrical complexity. The strength of the beams
and girders are strong and sheltering, but they're also part of our theme of
'rectangles.' We talked a lot about painters who used squares and rectangles
in their images - Chuck Close, Jasper Johns - and what interested me was the
motif of squares a circuit-boards: squares representing pieces of
information, because data-banks feature so much in the story.'
So the designer's job is not just a craft, it can be an art with its own
poetic encodings. Note Brandenstein's work in Silkwood, where she 'wanted
the nuclear plant to be very clinical and claustrophobic like a modern
prison, while the heroine's home was more close to nature, almost a log
cabin.' And in The Untouchables: 'All that Beaux Arts architecture in
Chicago weighed down the characters who were trying to rise. So you had the
motif of weight: in the buildings, in Al Capone, in the weaponry, even in
the clothes designed by Armani.'
Richard Sylbert (The Graduate, Chinatown, Reds, Dick Tracy) takes Chinatown,
the broad-daylight film noir he designed for Roman Polanski, as an example
of a through-designed film. 'What are the basic elements of the story?
Drought, 1939, Los Angeles. No clouds. The sun must beat down. You make a
choice that your palette will be variations on burnt grass. Beiges, ochres,
browns. The actual wallpaper we bought to use in the Water and Power
Building is called 'Burnt Grass.' What's the hottest colour?'
Er - red? 'White. If it is hot every building must be white. And if the hero
is a detective, every building must be above eye level.' Why? 'Because he is
searching, he is struggling, and it is always harder to go uphill.'
We are a long way from slapping paint onto six-by-ten canvas flats, which is
how Sylbert started, c1950, in the infancy of live television. Henry
Bumstead (Vertigo, The Sting, Cape Fear, Unforgiven) started even earlier,
in the glory days of 1940s Hollywood, where he was schooled in the even
bolder artifices of pre-TV cinema.
'Everything was done on soundstages' he says. 'If you wanted to make Gone
With The Wind you made it in Culver City (MGM's Los Angeles home). The
master of this was Hitchcock. He carried it on right on into the 1950s. Just
about the whole of Vertigo was shot on stages. Even the 'location' scenes
were mostly actors acting against back-projection.'
Bumstead also remembers his search for a perfect street in Hitchcock's
Family Plot: the eerie, sloping city street with the lock-up garage. He
found such a street; the players were assembled and the lights and camera
set up; then Hitchcock said the actors were too cold and ordered everyone
back to the studio. Here, at enormous cost, Bumstead had to build an exact
duplicate of the location.
But Hitch may have had more than his cast's warmth at heart. There is
something tantalising about a set that looks slightly unreal. Bumstead
achieved the same effect with the one-street town he built for Clint
Eastwood's Unforgiven: a collage of clapboard buildings that Bumstead put up
'in just 32 days', for which he was given complete artistic licence by the
director. The result, like a hilltop ghost town come insidiously to life,
imparts its haunting neo-Gothic mood to the whole movie.
Backlots masquerading as landscapes; DIY timberlands as real Western towns.
The designer's art is a deceiver's art and Richard Sylbert thinks the
deceptions prove the rule: that these pieces of visual magic and metaphoric
enrichment give a movie its power and personality. So if the designer is
this all-influential force on a film's making, why is he so undervalued?
Sylbert: 'There is a great confusion about the parameters of his role. We
know what a scriptwriter does, or a cameraman or a director. But what does
the designer do? 'The other job descriptions are clearer. So is the
patronage factor. The cameraman works half as long on a movie as a designer,
but he gets paid more. Why? Because he is attached to the star's ego. An
actress does not say, 'I want So-and-So to design my movie.' But she might
want So-and-So to direct her or So-and-So to costume her. And sure as hell
she would want a cameraman she knows to photograph her. So the job kudos
follows the money; and the money in Hollywood - it hasn't changed, whatever
they tell you - still comes with the star.'

FT  14 NOV 92 / Arts: Tuned to erotic possession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUARTER-century ago, Pier Paolo Pasolini's Teorema ('Theorem') was not
only a film but a novel; and now, thanks to a commission from Henze for the
Munich Music-theatre Biennale, it is a 'musical parable' too. The composer
Giorgio Battistelli's version is for a silent cast 'of actors or dancers',
with the musical burden carried by a 22-strong orchestra - the Officina
Musicale Italiana, at Wednesday's performance in the Queen Elizabeth Hall.
Many filmgoers will recall Pasolini's story. A wealthy nuclear family, with
peasant maidservant, is descended upon in their Milanese suburb by an
attractive, vaguely Christ-like guest (originally Terence Stamp); each of
them, male and female, succumbs to him in turn. Then he departs abruptly;
whereupon they become variously exalted, depressed or demented, and the
fable ends with the father howling naked in a wilderness. Some mythic
significance is intended, though at ground level this is so plainly a piece
of stuff-the-bourgeoisie wish-fulfilment by a radical Left gay that one
might not feel the need to delve further.
Yet the action has a satisfying shape, and one which leaves sympathetic room
for exploring the facets of abject erotic possession. Some of us found
Pasolini's cinematic version risibly portentous: protracted, stagey images,
but the editing apparently done with a meat-axe and bathetic lapses - like
signalling a seduction with the camera tracking discarded garments from the
bedroom threshold down to the smalls at the bed-end.
Here, Lucy Bailey's staging was hypnotically slow but always fluid, often
beautiful. As lit in chiaroscuro by David Lawrence, Simon Vicenzi's
lofty-but-frail set was a visual pleasure in itself. Impeccable Euro-cast,
this being a European Arts Festival affair - British, Irish, Belgian and
French, but all of them would have passed muster with Visconti or Antonioni.
Lacking Stamp's laser gaze, Philippe Giraudeau mimed the Guest as a languid
upmarket gigolo, with detachable clothes and hints of tender, protective
wisdom while he accepted everybody's overtures. In slow stages he undressed
to his briefs, dressed again, and then stripped altogether for the final
seduction. That image seemed deeply British: a naked actor, decently
flaccid, in symbolic congress with another man in a suit. As for the saintly
maidservant, whom the film showed actually levitating at a great height,
Rena Vets here got more of a downer, being interred alive in a man-shaped
hole on the stage floor.
So far, so wistfully 1960s; but Battistelli's score infuses the proceedings
with non-vocal singing life. Each of the Guest's successive prey is twinned
with his or her instrumental Doppelganger: a violin or cello, a harp or a
bass clarinet, with their own expressively wrought cadenzas.
While their intricate flights are faithfully up-to-date, elusive and
a-rhythmic - real 'school-of-Henze', though reminiscent of Bartok's sexy
clarinet in The Miraculous Mandarin too - Battistelli sets them against
simpler brass fanfares, and broader percussion-rhythms: a sultry waltz-beat
through all the seductions, a lusty Latin-American pulse for the climactic
Expressionist throes. It is a clever, effective compromise. Much more than
just film-music, this score may inspire many more productions.

RADIO 4's concern with personal distress moves into industry. All with
Smiling Faces, 'ganging along the Scotswood Road to see the Blaydon Races,'
recalled when Vickers Armstrong employed 20,000 men and there were 54 pubs
in four miles - in 1862. Wendy Pilmer's moving feature presented people who
had known a happy Scotswood but felt 'the heart had gone out.' Riots, theft,
joy-riding were the news. 'You get accustomed to things, you have to live
with it.' But building has begun. The Newcastle Business Park may employ
5000, but in desk jobs, not engineering. The future Scotswood will be office
blocks and housing estates. No one will sing about that on the halls.
Come the Revolution on Wednesdays concerns change in workday life. Last week
its presenter Neil Walker dealt with the dockers of Hull, their pay ensured,
even without work, by Attlee's Dock Labour Board scheme. Not now. The scheme
was repealed in 1989.
This week Walker met the railwaymen. Like the dockers, they reckoned theirs
was the only trade, for themselves and their sons. Nationalisation in 1948
meant that blaming the railways for anything was now blaming themselves. Sir
Brian Robertson could be lived with; even the change from steam to diesel,
though this meant redundancies. But Dr Beeching, who preached 'make it pay
or cut it out', was too much. He closed 5000 miles of track, nearly 2000
stations, and it was little help to the man on the footplate when the
General Secretary of ASLEF wrote to the Press in his support. The
oldfashioned loyalty to the railways, that began at school, was no more.
In Striking Out on Thursday we joined the miners in the 1984 strike, or
rather their wives. They learned for the first time that they were not just
'somebody's something' but independent folk. They made speeches, they
organised committees - one, who had never before been further from her
Sheffield home than Barnsley, went to Belgium to talk to the women there. A
wave of feminism engulfed them. Their men had to look after themselves; and
when the strike was done, they had learned to be properly cooperative.
Presenter Chrys Salt got women from Yorkshire, Kent and Wales talking
cheerfully, even singing what I take to be their own songs, about their
awakening. They were pleasant company, but there was a down-side - 'Before
the strike,' one said, 'I did not know what I'd missed, so I was happy.'
Industry has a bright side too, and on Sunday we learnt who had won the
Radio Times/Radio 4 Enterprise '92 Awards. The Pounds 10,000 Category 1
prize went to Tina Magdalinsky for her Pretzel's Continental Bakery in
Cambridge; the Pounds 5000 Category 2 award to David Whyatt, who now heads
his Glossopdale Bus Company in Cheshire. Both winners praised their bank
managers.
Classic drama this week from both Radios 3 and 4, that I have left too
little space for. On Sunday, Radio 3's fine production of Webster's The
Duchess of Malfi had been recorded by director Alison Hindell in Llancaiach
Fawr Manor, and it gave a three-dimensional quality. The Duchess was
beautifully played by Fiona Shaw, and there was a telling Bosola by Roger
Allam. The performance was worth every second of its 140 minutes.
Monday evening brought Of Mice and Men, by John Steinbeck. The grim
friendship of simple Lennie and watchful George in the Californian farmlands
was persuasively traced by Kerry Shale and Peter Whitman under Richard
Wortley's direction. On Saturday evenings, the eponymous classic is
Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita, but this goes on for three weeks more.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Arts: Simon's subtle sentimentality - Malcolm Rutherford
reviews 'Lost in Yonkers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEIL SIMON's Lost in Yonkers looks a better play in London than it does in
New York. The piece won the 1991 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and is still
running on Broadway. The main reason why I disliked it there was that it
suffered from excessive sentimentality. It still does. On the other hand,
that is plainly why so many people throng to see it. And the the London
production has a redeeming virtue in a remarkable performance by Maureen
Lipman.
Simon is frequently compared with Alan Ayckbourn for two reasons. One is
that they have an equally prolific output - about a play a year. The other
is that they tend to be better received on their own side of the Atlantic.
Here Simon is best known for works like Barefoot in the Park and Brighton
Beach Memoirs.
Lost in Yonkers is ostensibly more serious in that it is about the strains
of an American-Jewish family in New York in 1942. The old mother is a
refugee from the Nazis. In her enforcement of family discipline, however,
she has become more Prussian than the Prussians: no-one in this household is
allowed to cry. Her iron rule extends to her grandchildren.
This old battle-axe is played by Rosemary Harris, just as she was in the
early months of the New York production. Ms Harris has lost none of her
stage presence, although she does not have to say very much. For the most
part, she just stands or sits there looking fierce, but capable of shedding
the odd tear herself.
In New York Ms Harris seemed to have the leading adult role in the play. In
London there has been a shift. Quite the most interesting part is that of
Bella, her 35-year-old retarded daughter. Here is the triumph of Ms Lipman,
which presumably owes something to David Taylor's direction. In New York
Bella was, like most of Simon's characters, pretty flat. In London she
develops.
She starts as amiably backward, a child despite her age, with sudden
retreats into temper and moodiness. Then she reveals her feelings as a
woman. As the play goes on, she becomes increasingly the focus of attention.
By the end it is clear that it is the mother who is dependent on her rather
than the other way round. Ms Lipman's Bella has come to look attractive,
self-confident and quite grown up. The role reversal is very cleverly done:
it makes Lost in Yonkers seem a more subtle play that I first thought.
For those who enjoy sentimental theatre, there are further pleasures:
notably, child-acting. As the younger of the two grandsons deposited in the
old gorgon's house, Benny Grant has such self-assurance that it is brave of
the adults to appear on the same stage. Grant also played the part of the
13-year-old in New York. In London he will alternate with Matt McGuire whom
I have not seen. Of course, everything is loaded in his favour: he has some
of the best lines and the best opportunities to show off. Precocity is
written all over him, but he does it with great charm. I doubt if a British
writer would think of creating such a part. This is a tribute to Simon's
professionalism.
One small part stands out - Janette Legge as Gert, the daughter who speaks
the first half of a sentence sucking out and the second breathing in, so
that the latter is unintelligible. The technique of the speech defect is
picked up from farce, but is another sign of Simon's eclecticism.
Still, sentimentality prevails and cloys. Like the line: 'I love this
country because it took in the Jews. There are lots of Germans over here
fighting for America, but there aren't any Americans over there fighting for
Germany.' Even Louie, the criminal son, goes off to join the US air force in
the Pacific. I also wonder if Jewish families have to be so needlessly cruel
in order to be kind. This is formula writing: nothing really surprises. But
perhaps that is the key to its popular success.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Arts: Loyal audience returns - Max Loppert attends the
Wigmore Hall reopening gala
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONG days and nights of closure are done: the Wigmore Hall is back in
action. In the last few days, as the date of the Gala Reopening Concert
approached ever nearer, there have been outbursts of anticipatory
excitement, in print and on the air - quite out of character with the
normally sober, reticent demeanour of the loyal Wigmore audience.
This audience embodies the most knowledgeable and un-glitzy aspects of
London's 'serious music' public. For the past 16 months during the Hall's
refurbishment it has been forced to behave like the Messiah sheep: 'gone
astray, and turned everyone to his own way'. No wonder there has been a
palpable air of disaffection and no wonder this is now being replaced by
torrents of enthusiasm and joy.
For no other hall in London offers soloists or chamber ensembles the same
encouragement, in equal parts acoustical and atmospheric, to freely inspired
performance; no other promotes the same intimacy of communication between
executant and audience; and no other has developed a programming policy so
intelligently balanced, so full of artistic nous, and - as a direct
consequence - so assured about attracting and retaining the services of the
international singing and playing elite. (Indeed, for a previously unknown
or untried artist or ensemble, a successful Wigmore debut recital - such as
the ones given by Olaf Baer in 1983, the Carmina Quartet in 1987, or Sergey
Leiferkus in 1989 - often results in immediate access to that elite.)
The auditorium has not been tampered with: that was never the aim of the
refurbishment. The 550 seats; the plush red carpets; the mahogany surfaces;
the air of Edwardian ease - all are untouched. The frieze in the cupola, an
art nouveau allegory of Music breaking free of Materialism, has been
restored to gleaming brightness; the wallpaper has been changed, the paint
renewed. Yet, to the regular Wigmore-visitor, the opening minutes of
Thursday's concert proved almost strange in their sense of reassuring
familiarity. Soon it was as though no time at all had elapsed between July
1991 and November 1992, as though one had never been away at all.
It is in the exterior areas that the changes have been made - the foyer and
greatly expanded basement, with its enlarged cloakroom and toilet facilities
and brand-new wine bar and restaurant. The classic Wigmore characteristics
of the past were 'luxe, calme et volupte' in the concert-hall, and crush,
traffic gridlock and spilled coffee and ice-cream in the foyer. The latter
will now be considerably modified - though it must be recorded that on
Thursday the coffee bar produced scenes of opera buffa chaos as staff
struggled with an intractable till and a wildly dysfunctional espresso
machine (they had only been allowed in for the first time that morning).
The Gala concert (transmitted live on Radio 3) was a splash of festive fare,
a brilliantly calculated and excellently achieved re-opening fanfare.
Indeed, it concentrated into summary form what, under William Lyne's 26-year
directorship, has come to betoken everything that is most enlightened about
Wigmore Hall artistic planning. It was a 'Celebration of Shakespeare'
programme - in song, and in the interleaved readings by Jill Balcon. Two
pianists, Graham Johnson (newly appointed the hall's Song Advisor, and
programme-deviser of the evening) and Geoffrey Parsons were in charge,
superlative performance-masters both.
In order to commence proceedings with the Vaughan Williams 16-voice Serenade
(in a two-piano arrangement conducted by Matthew Best), Lyne, Johnson and
Parsons had gathered for the occasion 16 of the many fine recital-singers -
American, Austrian, French and Icelandic as well as British - with Wigmore
links already established, albeit of different degree of duration. All need
to be named: the sopranos Barbara Bonney, Margaret Price, Dawn Upshaw and
Lillian Watson; the mezzos Felicity Palmer and Sarah Walker; the contralto
Catherine Wyn-Rogers; the countertenor Derek Lee Ragin; the tenors John Mark
Ainsley, Gunnar Gudbjornsson, Keith Lewis and Adrian Thompson; the baritones
Wolfgang Holzmair, Kurt Ollman and Francois Le Roux; and the bass Alastair
Miles.
It was a programme of profuse pleasures - some familiar (Mr Ainsley
ravishing in Schubert's 'Who is Sylvia?'), some rare (Finzi's 'Fear no more
the heat o' the sun' sung with regal gravity by Miss Wyn-Rogers), some
operatic (the Act 2 duet from Thomas's Hamlet, the Willow Song from Otello),
some popular (Miss Palmer and Mr Ollman deliciously droll in numbers from
Kiss Me Kate). Everything seemed to flow, in context no less than
performance, from a common basis of artistic understanding; everyone caught
up in it, audience no less than performers, seemed glad to be there, and
glad to be alive.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Records: Jazz with fire, faith and soul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS 20 years since pianist Keith Jarrett teamed up with ECM
producer/proprietor Manfred Eicher for the first in a series of intense solo
explorations which included The Koln Concert, reputedly the best selling
solo piano record ever. The Vienna Concert (ECM 1481 513 437) is the latest
in this distinguished line of improvised solo recordings from Jarrett. With
characteristic passion, he says: 'I have courted the fire for a very long
time, and many sparks have flown in the past, but the music on this
recording speaks, finally, the language of the flame itself.'
Certainly, 'Vienna' is a spark-free zone whose appeal lies instead in
drawing the listener nearer to a warm fire of gentle melody which is given
space in which to wax. His playing on this live recording, beautifully
reproduced by Eicher, and his temperament are sublime. Coming in between his
recording of Shostakovich's 24 Preludes and Fugues and a tour with the
Standards Trio in memory of Miles, gentle Vienna sounds almost an antidote
to the two.
Slow burning throughout its 68 minutes of intensity, Jarrett's tone is
evenly burnished, the right hand fanning the melody, the left independently
but darkly stoking the rhythm. In the background and thankfully at a safe
distance Jarrett moans and emits the anguished utterances which have become
a controversial feature of his concerts. If, as its accompanying notes
claim, the solo series is a diary that mirrors Jarrett's progress as an
improvisor, The Vienna Concert is a sign that the enfant terrible of the
concert hall is beginning to mellow. Every home should have a copy for the
cold winter nights to come.
A new album you will not find lying around the Jarrett household is Pontius
Pilate's Decision (RCA Novus PD90669) from Delfeayo Marsalis. Jarrett has
gone on the record as saying he reviles the Marsalis clan, which comprises
tenorman Branford, trumpet playing Wynton, trombonist Delfeayo and drummer
Jason in order of seniority. All of them appear in this saga, which charts
Christ's progress to the cross, at one time and another contributing to a
seriously swinging piece of work.
That 26-year-old Delfeayo should already have three Billboard No 1 albums
under his belt as producer as well as film soundtrack credits (Spike Lee's
Do The Right Thing, Mo Better Blues and Jungle Fever) suggests hot-housed
precocity. But Marsalis's handling of a potentially cheerless theme like
this is far from naive and features some inspired writing in its 70 minutes.
Although, like so many Marsalis family projects, Pontius Pilate's Decision
is a well wrought and highly organised affair both Wynton and Delfeayo's
mercurial horns compensates for any intermittent longueurs.
British tenorist Courtney Pine, like Delfeayo Marsalis, found a following
early in his career and, against the odds, has grown older gracefully (he is
28). Like Marsalis, he is also a spiritual young man who makes vivacious and
open music. To The Eyes of Creation, (Island 514044) his latest album, is a
rich celebration of all that has gone towards moulding his peculiarly
English jazz sound - from John Coltrane to Bob Marley; from psalms to soul
singing via knees-up ska rhythms. Not only does the material give vent to
Pine's alternately abandoned and melodious improvisation on tenor and
soprano, it also showcases many of his talented British peers: pianist
Julian Joseph, drummer Mark Mondesir and bassist Gary Crosby among others.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Records: Heavy breathing syndrome - Antony Thorncroft
prefers Dylan's latest to Madonna or Prince
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTMAS is the time when boxing heavyweights dress up as Widow Twankey and
pop heavyweights release albums to catch the present mood. Often the music
sounds as if it has been written to fulfil a recording contract (which it
has) rather than a spontaneous creative impulse, and, having just signed a
Dollars 50m deal with Warners, that must be especially true of Madonna's
Erotica, the album of her book, Sex.
One imagines that Madonna expects the world to sit at home breathing
heavily, flicking through the photographs of her sexual fantasies while
listening to the album. I tried it out and it is very much like being
hypnotised: not unpleasant, in fact rather soothing. The pictures are for
peering at rather than for generating pleasure and the songs on Erotica have
that metronomic disco beat that says get up and dance or else nod off.
At office parties throughout the land Erotica will doubtless kindle many
morning-after embarrassments. Best not to listen to the words, which have an
obscure suggestiveness, like a child trying to shock; just concentrate on
the remorseless beat. It takes some skill for Madonna to be both soporific
and rhythmic at the same time. On songs like 'Where life begins' she seems
to have invented trance dance.
You can hear the money shouting through what is really a disappointing
album, lacking a leavening of the good natured pop songs like 'Holiday', or
locker room singalongs, like 'Like a Virgin', which made Madonna's previous
albums notable. There are some infectious riffs, like 'Words', but basically
this is just a cop out for disco DJ's who will be able to press the button
and disappear for an hour while Madonna struts relentlessly and, ultimately,
tediously, on. The sooner she stops being the sexual midwife to the world
and gets back to escapist pop songs the better for everyone.
Madonna is not alone in breathing heavily over her output. Prince has also
done quite well out of blatancy and his latest album, packaged under a wonky
looking male gender symbol, is almost a direct riposte to Erotica. Yet there
is something tongue in cheek about Prince, his tiny, mannikin body being
sexually threatening in a decidedly controllable way. Also his songs are
strong enough to stand on their own, without the innuendo.
He starts his album with Madonna-like self absorption, with 'My name is
Prince', but really this is nothing more than an excuse for a funky rap.
Then on to the no-nonsense 'Sexy MF'. What separates Prince from Madonna is
that his sound, lyrics and sexual politics seems directly to reflect black
urban culture; he is the outlet for the fantasies of his generation. Madonna
is alone with her fantasies.
The new album hardly elevates Prince's work to a new creative plane, but it
is beautifully crafted. Here the sound rides over the egomania, with hints
of jazz and soul in the excellent brass backings. Both these albums are
aimed at dudes, not prudes, and it is odd that pop, so late in its day,
should be pandering so narrowly to the youth market.
For the most endearing characteristic of pop is that it ends up embracing
every artist who ever graced the charts. Critical disaster areas, like ABBA,
can be certain of becoming the centre of the largest cults. The only
performer excluded from the party is perhaps the greatest pop star of them
all, Bob Dylan. Perhaps Dylan asks for it by his perverse concert
performances where he performs badly and in the dark, but in the 1960s he
gave pop music the cultural and intellectual respectability that it has
never lost.
His latest album, Good as I been to you, has been massacred by the critics
and yet it is fascinating. He has gone back to the traditional ballads which
inspired some of his greatest songs (like 'Boots of Spanish Leather'), and
records them in one take and with no over dubbing. Even the most mundane of
songs, 'Frankie and Albert' (Johnnie, to you) somehow seems more real, more
immediate in Dylan's hands, hands that fly over the guitar like demons.
Sometimes he sounds like an old man howling on the corner, but always there
is an intensity, a humanity in that nasal drone. Perhaps it is one
dimensional but this is Dylan's most accessible album in years, minimalist
in format but big in impact.
In contrast to Dylan, his contemporary, Neil Young, enjoys growing critical
acclaim, perhaps because, in his old hobo stage act, he has matured with wit
and style. His latest album, Harvest Moon, is a clever parody of Harvest, a
seminal album of 20 years ago which featured such pained classics as 'Heart
of Gold'. He actually calls on some of the same musicians, notably James
Taylor and Linda Ronstadt, to join him on Harvest Moon.
The songs do not have the same aching grip as those of the previous
generation, but they sound smoother, gentler, more reflective. There is a
nostalgic air of time passing, but the mood is more superficial, even in the
questioning 'From Hank to Hendrix'. But perhaps that is the difference
between seamless CD and crackly old LP.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Records: Pianists and a bit more - Young musicians, some
more virtuoso than others
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   I HAVE been listening to a clutch of pianists in their middle years
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
for their own interesting sakes, not to choose Best Buys among the works
they have recorded. 'Middle years' here covers a wide spread: at least 20
years, and more if Piers Lane is even younger than Marc-Andre Hamelin. (The
sleeve-note for Lane's Hyperion CD tells us absolutely nothing about him.)
But they are all past the teenage-prodigy stage, while still short of Senior
Authority status.
The eldest of these, Stephen Kovacevich (sometime 'Bishop') might by now
have succeeded to that. From the start he was a wise head on young
shoulders, and the senior musical establishment seized him to its bosom; yet
something nervy, even anxious, often sets his playing apart from those
devout performances that aim at a definitive or monumental condition. That
is what enlivens his new EMI recording of three late Beethoven sonatas (CDC
7 54599 2).
Even the much-trodden Allegro of op. 111 refuses to be sculpted here,
instead hurtling away upon an urgent personal impulse. Nor is the Arietta
movement treated as a sacred frieze; Kovacevich finds a variety of
subjective moods in it - and still allows the celestial heights of the music
to float timelessly free. The gentle, two-part op. 90 is natural territory
for him; the A major op. 101 too, though in the quick movements he snaps at
upbeats so tetchily that we have to listen hard to hear them. It is pleasure
and a relief to hear an artist who is not concerned to file a Document.
Nevertheless, his performance of young Brahms's D minor Concerto with
Wolfgang Sawallisch and the London Philharmonic (EMI again: CDC 7 54578 2)
is the quintessence of a 'young man's reading' - exactly what is required:
clean-lined, forward-pressing, directly felt. Sawallisch matches that
perfectly, even if they don't always coincide on the beat. Their strong,
up-tempo Maestoso is hugely satisying. No concert-hall performance I have
heard in years has sounded as alive as this recording of the concerto; and
there is a lovely bonus in the fill-up - not solo piano pieces, but the
mezzo Ann Murray delivering the two op. 91 lullabies with Kovacevich and
Nobuko Imai's viola (molto vibrato).
More Brahms: Rian de Waal, first noticed in the daredevil piano repertoire,
joins the Allegri Quartet to make up the F Minor Quintet (Cala CACD 1009).
Surprisingly, he is the member who occasionally sounds a touch deliberate,
while the Allegri are excitingly febrile; but they collaborate in rewarding
many a passage that has come to seem routine with fresh attention. Better
still is the Clarinet Quintet on that same CD, where the soloist James
Campbell's opening phrase - a whole Romantic dream in one breath - promises
poignant delights, and the entire performance fulfills the promise. In its
exquisite twilit vein, it has no competitors.
Campbell is also the soloist in Berio's orchestrated version of the great F
minor Sonata, op. 120 no. 1 (together with Schoenberg's version of the G
minor Piano Quartet on CACD 1006), but the recording is far less happy. It
sets Campbell in a dry foreground, sans ambiance, whilst Geoffrey Simon and
the LSO make dignified noises from afar. The intimate duetting of the
original clarinet-and-piano is much missed - and anyhow I think Berio is
wrong to transfer some of the piano part to sustained winds. Like any
pianist-composer, Brahms took full account of the inexorable 'decay' of
every note played on his instrument, and the Andante here is meant to trade
hauntingly upon that deliquescent effect.
The pianist Andrei Gavrilov is admired as an athlete and considerably more,
but on the strength of his new DG Schubert (D. 899 and 935, four Impromptus
each: 435 788-2) we have no further evidence about the 'more'. His address
is prickly, often aggressive. More discouraging still is the fact that
Schubert's most delectably original passages of pure pianism (conceived,
remember, for a mere wooden-frame piano) sound so lumpen and clangy on his
modern machine. As an antidote I warmly recommend Katharina Wolpe's recent
recording of D. 899 on an 1840 fortepiano (cassette, Symposium 1082), a
model of informed, lyrical sympathy.
The young French-Canadian pianist Hamelin has made a great impression upon a
few London audiences, especially the St. John's, Smith Square audience who
heard him traverse the unparalleled hazards of Alkan's solo 'Concerto' with
almost superhuman confidence. That blazing performance is reproduced on
Music &amp; Arts CD-724: perhaps without the extra inspiration of a live
audience, but if cooler no less staggering. There is also a rich Hamelin
trawl through more-than-showoff Liszt - the Don Juan and Norma fantasies,
two of the most winning Etudes, the 'Benediction de Dieu dans la solitude' -
on CD-723.
Hamelin has the ping and the pantherish pounce of the true virtuoso, as well
as a thoughtful musician's modesty: a rare combination. Piers Lane evinces
as much sympathetic dedication in the complete roster of Skryabin's Etudes,
very early to very late, on Hyperion CDA66607. Musically, it offers a fine
conspectus. Lane is never perverse (unlike many pianists who imagine
themselves licensed by the Master's cranky example), and he illustrates
Skryabin's extraordinary development with illuminating care.
As a technician, however, he earns only a beta-plus. Hands too weakly
synchronised (which means loss of clarity in intricate passages), the left -
which has to deal with Skryabin's skittery basses - not very fluent; his
theatrically abrupt changes, like subito piano and tight dynamic 'hairpins',
either shrunken or too heavily signalled in advance. You might find Lane's
trek through Skryabin a repeatable pleasure, but later be amazed every once
in a while by so-and-so's properly brilliant account of this or that Etude.
In fact I think that an enviable position to be in: get to know the music,
and then relish the live-action potential of Skryabin's piano-writing when a
real virtuoso fastens upon it.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Records: Sing on demand - Richard Fairman reviews recent
opera recordings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRYING to apply the usual economic theories of demand and supply to the
world of opera is a Humpty Dumpty business. The demand for the product is
probably higher than ever before, but the supply of top singers to meet it
is never likely to grow at the same pace. Show a record company an opera
singer who can sing almost anything and the chances are she soon will.
In the last few years the American soprano Cheryl Studer has become that
omnipresent recording star. Mozart's stratospheric Queen of Night, Wagner's
noble Elsa, Rossini comic sopranos - Studer has had a go at them all and her
voice has stretched up and down, this way and that, with a commendable
degree of success to meet each in turn.
It was inevitable that Verdi's La traviata would soon follow. The role of
Violetta is among the most technically demanding in all opera and is often
said to require three different voices, one for each act. Her new recording
for DG shows that she has no fear for its difficulties. Perhaps the vocal
fireworks of the first act do not get airborne without an effort. But the
lyrical music is filled out with bright and warm singing, which is generous
in its emotional openheartedness.
Her Violetta sounds a healthy, outgoing young woman. Not a portrait always
easy to reconcile with Dumas's fragile lady of the camellias, but it is of a
piece with what is going on around her. James Levine, the conductor, is only
in his element as a Verdian when he can set the thunder and lightning
ringing around the ears and the performance is vague about what it wants to
say until the big moments, where he lets himself go. The effect is of an
all-purpose, generalised theatricality.
By coincidence another set of the opera has turned up at the same time. The
buyer has a real choice, too, as this Teldec recording is the mirror image
of its rival. Where Studer was unspecific, Edita Gruberova is precise and
detailed. Where Studer let her emotions open out, Gruberova closes up into
studied unspontaneity. What the Czech soprano does manage, however, is to
use beautiful vocal phrasing in its purest form to convey her emotions.
The setting of La traviata is here plausibly Gallic, a world of delicate
sensibilities and moral propriety. The Italian conductor, Carlo Rizzi, is
generally stylish, but not very theatrical. If Levine's way of showing his
enthusiasm for Verdi's music is to hug it and shout his affection out loud,
Rizzi whispers his intimate knowledge of its beauties in one's ear. He and
Gruberova are at their best when Violetta is alone or in dialogue.
A choice between the two is awkward and the supporting singers do not help.
Nobody would generally buy a set of La traviata for the Alfredo, though they
might when the tenor is Luciano Pavarotti (on DG), slightly less golden of
voice than usual, but still preferable to Teldec's Neil Shicoff. With the
baritones the advantage is round the other way, for Giorgio Zancanaro on the
Teldec set makes more of Germont pere's role than DG's dull Juan Pons. The
Teldec, though, has the better recording quality. That is the more stylish
and would be my choice.
For variety one might prefer to turn to Offenbach's Les Contes d'Hoffmann -
though not in the cast, as Cheryl Studer promptly turns up again. She has
had time to change her nationality, but not her profession. Here she plays
the Venetian courtesan, Giulietta, a portrayal that lacks any distinct
personality, though the music is more than capably sung. Unfortunately, for
other reasons entirely, her participation in this set has to be judged an
opportunity lost.
The enticing question here is whether Hoffmann's three loves are, in fact,
three women-in-one, a fantastic triple vision of a single feminine ideal. To
have the multi-voiced Studer in the cast and yet restrict her to one of the
roles is a shame, and not least because Eva Lind's squeaky Olympia and
Jessye Norman's grande dame of an Antonia are respectively inadequate and
inappropriate in the other two. Francisco Araiza's Hoffmann also lacks
charisma; Samuel Ramey is vocally impressive in the bass roles. Jeffrey Tate
conducts.
The set may still yield some interest, however. It uses new material from an
edition of the score that is currently in preparation, which will utilise
music found in Offenbach's sketches. The additions and excisions that have
been practised here are by no means uniformly successful: the opera takes an
age to get started and then finishes very abruptly. We are still feeling our
way to a version which might be as true as possible to Offenbach's
intentions and this is the latest step in that direction.
The new recording of Poulenc's Dialogues des Carmelites also marks a step
forwards, in this case towards securing for the opera a future at all. There
are few chances to catch this piece in the theatre: the opera may be easy on
the ear (Poulenc was happy to clothe his religious scores in lasciviously
sensual harmonies) but it is not easy on the intellect. This is a drama of
the mind: a good opera, in fact, to listen to on disc.
It is set in a Carmelite convent during the French revolution, but all
contact with the outside world is shut off by the thick convent walls.
Inside, the nuns find themselves facing death, some through old age, others
because of the political turmoil, and the opera shows us the different
feelings with which they go to meet their end. Some go in fear, others see
it as the road to glory; one rejects her faith, another finally embraces it.
There are a lot of good roles and the new recording (only the opera's
second) is well cast. Catherine Dubosc as Blanche, the fearful novice, heads
a roll-call which includes many of the finest French-speaking singers of the
day, including Martine Dupuy as the hard Mere Marie, Rita Gorr as the wise
Old Prioress, Jose Van Dam and Francois le Roux. Only Rachel Yakar's New
Prioress is a disappointment vocally. The set is based on live performances
in Lyon, conducted with evident sympathy by Kent Nagano. The recording
quality is exemplary, the best of the month's selection.
Finally to Maria Callas. To mark 15 years since the soprano's death, EMI has
issued a new recital disc, featuring a few rare live recordings from her
early years (exciting Mozart and Rossini) and some rather sad alternative
takes from the later ones. The company may be scraping the barrel, but with
Callas the dregs can still be as good as another singer's champagne. And
what a range of music] With her vocal ability to shine in roles of so many
guises, whatever operas might she be recording, if she were alive now?

THE MIST IN THE MIRROR

A RATHER ENGLISH MARRIAGE

THE JUDAS CLOTH
by Julia O'Faolain
Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 14.99, 464 pages
SUSAN Hill's mastery of suspense in The Mist in the Mirror is more valuable
than any number of post-modernist gimmicks. Long established as a novelist
who matters, she does not have to try to be trendy. This ghost story looks
back to the turn of the century for its inspiration - not only for its
setting, but for its virtuoso pastiche style.
Its hero, Sir James Monmouth, is a distinguished-looking old gentleman
regarded as something of a loner in his Pall Mall club. Despite his
self-contained exterior, he is troubled by memories, and the causes of his
anxiety are revealed in an autobiographical manuscript which he hands to a
fellow-member.
Brought up in ignorance of his parentage in colonial Kenya, he went on,
after the death of his guardian, to spend the first 20 years of his adult
life as a traveller in the Far East, emulating his hero, the great - though
forgotten - explorer, Conrad Vane. Coming home to England, middle-aged and
unattached, he sets himself the task of writing Vane's biography. But his
very first night in London is marked by sinister disturbances - the
pale-faced boy, the scream, the mysterious old woman - and when he starts
making enquiries about Vane, he is warned off the trail by everyone he
approaches.
Shards of childhood memory begin to mingle with the supernatural, as the
story moves through a series of coincidences towards its climax, maintaining
its momentum by repeatedly creating a sense of security only to shatter it.
Psychologically astute and disturbing in its ambiguities, its impossible to
resist the manipulative power of this finely constructed tale.
By contrast, Zeph, a comedy by AL Barker, has only a rambling sense of
direction, despite its brevity. A series of scenes, loosely tied together
without the reader-friendly convenience of chapter-breaks, it meanders
around its eponymous heroine and her megalomaniac ambitions to become a
great author.
After her mother dies in a collision with a rubbish-bin, Zeph decides to
turn their slightly surreal suburban home into a writers' colony. No real
authors apply to her carefully worded advertisements, so she has to make do
with whomever is on offer: sexy Nell, an old school friend with a crazed
two-year-old son and a sullen husband who makes sculptures out of chicken
bones; Maria, Zeph's father's black girlfriend, who daubs in oils and tells
rather good fairy stories; and Toplady, failed seducer and maker of blue
videos.
Despite the odd startling one-liner, this novel never quite gets off the
ground, principally because its heroine is more exasperating than endearing.
Her lunatic literary bumptiousness can be funny, but you are never laughing
with her, only at her. This is the sort of fiction that keeps its characters
at arms length, and its off-beat humour is too brittle to satisfy.
Angela Lambert, on the other hand, is not afraid of telling a
straightforward story and going right to the heart of her characters. A
Rather English Marriage contrasts two men, both in their seventies, whose
wives die on the same day in the same hospital, and who move in together
after the local vicar suggests they might provide mutual support in their
bereavement.
At first glance, Squadron-Leader Reginald Conynghame-Jervis and ex-milkman
Roy Southgate look like stereotypes. Reginald is an upper class military
chap with a rigid upper-lip and an inability to get through the morning
without a snifter. Roy is a loveable advertisement for old-fashioned
working-class family values. But Angela Lambert handles their relationship
with such sensitivity that they both emerge as living, breathing
individuals.
Straightforward, compassionate, and honest with himself, Roy is a foil to
Reginald's more interesting, more pitiful personality. Crushed by a lifetime
of emotional self-repression, Reginald behaves on the surface like a parody
of himself and only begins to see the truth about his marriage towards the
end.
A Rather English Marriage is observant, wry, and ultimately poignant.
Successfully avoiding sentimentality, it offers a credible dramatisation of
class tension and generational conflict.
If Angela Lambert looks at British social history with the eye of a
miniaturist, Julia O'Faolain's massive novel paints its characters larger
than life. The Judas Cloth is set in 19th century Italy, and follows the
fortunes of Nicola Santi, a priest brought up by Jesuits, through the long
and turbulent reign of Pope Pius IX, which saw the rise of Italian
nationalism and the diminution of papal political power. Despite some slow
and stodgy passages, Julia O'Faolain manages to bring the extraordinary
complexities of this historical period to life.

EVE WAS FRAMED: WOMEN AND BRITISH JUSTICE
by Helena Kennedy
Chatto and Windus Pounds 16.99, 285 pages
DO WOMEN get a fair deal at the hands of the criminal justice system in
Britain? That is Helena Kennedy's central question. Her answer is an
unequivocal 'no'. Her book is a sober and sobering explanation of why this
is so. She puts her case, and suggests remedies, with compelling clarity.
This is an important book; if it gets the wide readership it deserves it
will make a substantial difference to public debate about Britain's legal
system.
Kennedy practises at the criminal Bar. There are more lucrative and mannerly
regions of the law, but Kennedy's choice is governed by the fact that in
criminal proceedings the liberty of the subject is at stake. Her
achievements are not restricted to the courts; she is an active campaigner
for penal and constitutional reform, and television has made her widely
known.
Women have to struggle to succeed in any of the professions, the Bar not
least among them. But that is not Kennedy's main point. Her concern is with
those who are at the receiving end of criminal justice, especially women.
Practising as a barrister has given her ample opportunity to experience the
failure of the system to treat women and other disadvantaged groups fairly.
It is a mere commonplace to say that the legal system was created by men for
men. Relatively few women commit serious offences, and the assumptions and
practices of the courts reflect this fact. They show it also when women come
before the courts as victims of crime. In a host of ways the courts fail to
recognise the reality of women's lives, with unjust results. The same
applies to members of ethnic minorities. Kennedy uses a wide range of cases
to show how women are disadvantaged, whether as victims of rape and domestic
violence, or as defendants on charges ranging in seriousness from
prostitution to murder. Even though in a recent instance a woman was
exonerated from a murder charge, the cases make grim but profoundly
instructive reading.
A salient example is that of battered women who appear before the courts
either as accessories to the killing of a child, or because they killed
their partners. There are widespread misconceptions about such women among
judges and juries, who cannot understand why they stay with their battering
partners. Do they take perverse enjoyment in beatings - or are the beatings
not really so bad after all (as if there were an acceptable minimum of
domestic violence)? In the US the behaviour of abused women has been
recognised as a species of stress disorder, now called 'Battered Woman's
Syndrome'. Research shows its devastating effects: victims come to be
oppressed and controlled by the mere threat of violence, and find themselves
frozen into an inability either to escape or resist - even, in some cases,
into inability to protect children at risk, as in the Hedda Nussbaum case in
New York.
Battered women mask the physical and mental effects of their suffering, and
in court seem emotionally detached. Profound misperceptions result. One
concerns the crucial matter of provocation. A defence can attempt to reduce
a murder charge to one of manslaughter by pleading provocation, but courts
will only comply if the provocation was immediate - as when someone
discovers his wife's infidelity, and kills her in a rage. There have been
cases of women killing partners not in blind anger, but when the men were
unawares, perhaps in drunken sleep. The cumulative effects on women of years
of persistent beatings and fear are still not understood by courts, who
apply the standard provocation test, with resulting injustice.
These misunderstandings parallel many assumptions about women which distort
the law's treatment of them. Whereas 'fragrant' examples of femininity like
Mary Archer prompt lyricism from judges, the case is otherwise for
prostitutes, lesbians, and women with children in care, who risk
condemnation as much for what they are as for the crime they have committed.
Barristers learn to urge women clients to dress and behave demurely in
court; anything that challenges acceptable stereotypings runs a risk. This
applies as much to the rape victim as to the alleged murderess, and deeply
affects the justice either can hope to receive.
Kennedy describes case after case where these considerations apply. Her
sober language cannot hide their shocking nature, and as they accumulate one
has the sense that the law is truly a foreign country for women who find
themselves in its toils. But the story is not entirely negative. Kennedy
applauds the improvements - few and slow though they are - which are taking
place, and suggests further reforms. These include public scrutiny of
judicial appointments, training for judges, and positive action to increase
the number of women judges. As her book eloquently testifies, reform is long
overdue.

THE AMERICAN WAY OF BIRTH
by Jessica Mitford
Victor Gollancz Pounds 16.99, 288 pages
EVERYONE knows America has too many lawyers and too many doctors. Americans
have long loved to hate the legal profession.
Nowadays it is about doctors that Americans grouch most. Why is it, they
wonder, that they pay more for medicine yet receive worse health care than
any of their industrial competitors? Why should medical insurance for
workers add Dollars 900 to the cost of every General Motors car? How is it
that the 280,000 strong American Medical Association has torpedoed every
effort at reform?
Such are the concerns behind the health debate currently raging across the
Atlantic. Jessica Mitford, who tackled the US funeral industry in The
American Way of Death 30 years ago, has predictably joined the fray. Her new
work is a survey of childbirth practices that shows how expectant mothers
are abused and overcharged by their doctors.
When Jessica Mitford wrote about the eccentricities and excesses of mortuary
practices American-style, her revelations were fresh, shocking and funny.
Perhaps 30 more years of California have dulled her experience, but this
companion book, The American Way of Birth, seems less filled with pertinence
that with granola-and-aerobic breathlessness.
The typical American new-born, we find, costs over Dollars 2,000 in
obstetricians' fees. Should the birth be Caesarean - and in America's can-do
hospitals it often is - the price doubles. Should the mother-to-be number
among the one in three Americans without insurance, she will give birth in
an emergency room and receive no pre- or post-natal care. In many states,
trained midwives have been hounded underground by the doctors whose prices
they undercut.
Money is not the only price mothers pay. American medicine, Mitford tells
us, treats pregnancy as a dangerous disease. As a result women are said to
be humiliated by being strapped to an electronic foetal monitor and tied to
a hospital bed for hours at a time.
Still, this is a far cry from past practice. The earliest successful
Caesarian (no relation to Julius; it comes from the latin caesura meaning a
cutting, we learn) was performed in 1500 by one Jakob Nufer, a Swiss
pig-gelder. Over time, men increasingly intruded on the process of
childbearing, so much so that in the 16th century midwives in Europe were
executed as sorceresses.
In America it is only in the past decade or so that professional women have
begun to make inroads on this male preserve. Mitford is at her shrillest
describing how midwives with spotless safety records have had to fight for
the right to practice. Yet slowly, she believes, home delivery is making a
much-needed comeback.

<TEXT>
A LIFE 1887-1965
by John Jolliffe
Michael Russell Pounds 15.95 184 pages
CLIVE Pearson was the second son of Weetman Pearson, the first Lord Cowdray.
His father made a big fortune as one of the most successful contractors in
the world, building, among other successful projects, the Admiralty Harbour
at Dover, the Tehuantepec Railway in Mexico and the East River Tunnels in
New York which, an aggressive American matron told him, proved the
superiority of American engineers over all others. He politely replied that
he would make a point of inspecting them after his next transatlantic
voyage. His assets were reckoned at Pounds 10m in 1921. When he died in 1927
he was said to be the sixth richest man in Britain.
He certainly provided lavishly for his children. Later he diversified the
company into Mexican oil and long after his death the Pearson Group acquired
the Financial Times.
Clive was his successor in the business. Because of the firm's dealings in
Mexican oil - essential for the Navy - he was exempted from military service
throughout the First World War. He was unhappy about this. The pointing
finger in the famous Kitchener poster haunted him, as did the death in
action of his younger brother, Geoffrey. The dilemma of civilian or military
service vexed many people in both world wars. No one can say that Clive was
wrong.
This biography is written at the request of his three daughters; Mrs
Tritton, Mrs Smiley and Lady Gibson. Books with such a provenance can be
bland and boring, uncritical works of piety like the marble effigies on
tombstones commissioned by children in memory of much loved parents. The
author's task is not made easier by the existence of three overlapping
earlier books; JA Spender's biography of Weetman Pearson, Desmond Young's
Member for Mexico, and Mrs Smiley's account of life at the family home, A
Nice Clean Plate. Of course they are useful sources, but biographers tend to
prefer an untilled field. John Jolliffe has overcome all these difficulties
and has written an entertaining, perceptive and very readable book.
Clive was concerned with a host of important business transactions, first in
conjunction with his father and later on his own. He was much involved in
Latin America, though oddly he never learnt Spanish - rather like the
British wine merchants in Oporto who disdained Portuguese till the
revolution of 1974. In South America he ran into the perennial problem of
Third World countries, their belief that capitalism is part of foreign
exploitation and that the remedy for former colonies in search of a national
identity must be socialism. This naturally suits their tyrannical populist
dictators but is invariably an economic disaster. Latin America is at last
abandoning this Marxist nonsense. Africa has been ruined by it and may never
recover.
Clive Pearson commissioned Evelyn Waugh to write his least known book,
Robbery under Law, attacking President Cardenas of Mexico, the chief
expropriator. Waugh was not proud of it and excluded it from his collected
works. In business Clive was meticulous and thorough. The Pearson fortune
had been created partly by the most careful calculation of costs and prices.
But directors of BOAC, of which he was part-time chairman, did wonder
whether the width of margins on the typed minutes of board meetings
warranted so many hours of discussion.
Lord Cowdray in 1921 acquired for Clive two immense houses, Parham near
Pullborough and Castle Fraser a few miles from Aberdeen. Clive's wife Alicia
Knatebull-Hugeson was a born collector, graduating from rabbits' front teeth
at the age of nine to the antique furniture, splendid pictures and
armorially bound books which forms such features of Parham. Before 1939 the
house was staffed by a butler, three footmen, a valet, a housekeeper, a
cook, four housemaids, two kitchen-maids, a scullery maid, a still-room maid
and a night watchman, plus a nanny and nursemaid to look after the children.
Even the very, very rich could not live in this style after 1945.
The Pearsons were among the earliest owners of stately homes to open them to
the public, and they did it with great success. John Jolliffe has written an
agreeably nostalgic life of a second generation tycoon who bridged the gap
between the Victorian and the modern Elizabethan era. It is the perfect
Christmas present for people - one must use words carefully - for people of
a certain age.

SOMETHING TO REMEMBER ME BY: THREE TALES
by Saul Bellow
Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 13.99, 222 pages
THE PLAGIARIST
by Benjamin Cheever
Hamish Hamilton Pounds 9.99, 322 pages
TWO VOICES are there: one is of a 77-year-old living novelist, the other of
the son of a not-quite-so-famous dead short story writer. The latter,
Benjamin Cheever, invites the description because of his inability - as a
psychiatrist tells his fictional alter ego - to distinguish between where he
begins and his father ends.
Because Cheever's novel, The Plagiarist, is his first, it might seem unfair
to compare his performance with that of the mature Bellow, but the book has
been received with such acclaim in the US that a closer look is needed.
In real life Benjamin Cheever is of course the son of the New Yorker writer
and New England novelist John Cheever. The hero Arthur of The Plagiarist is
the son of Icarus Prentice, a 'famous writer'. He gets a job on a digest
magazine where everyone is paid a great deal of money for doing almost
nothing. Bored, he writes a story - about a man who has a son called Arthur
 -and submits it over his father's name.
The turning-point in Arthur's life comes with his confession that his
father's 'contribution' is actually his own work. Almost at the same time
the cantankerous old man who has ruled his career for so long dies and
suddenly a new self-reliant life seems possible.
The Plagiarist has a certain winsome charm because of the very nakedness of
the autobiographical element. But Cheever fils does not seem to have learnt
the first rule of novel-writing - a measure of detachment, even ruthlessness
is needed to make what DH Lawrence called 'the one bright book of life' out
of intensely personal material. Merely setting down the facts is not enough.
By contrast Bellow's story entitled Something To Remember Me By is writing
of a high order - although considerably different in tone from the stories
which precede it in this volume: A Theft and The Bellarosa Connection,
previously published on their own and reviewed here on publication.
This new piece is set in the Depression in Chicago. One winter's day,
'armoured in gray ice', Louie, a teenage boy whose mother is dying of
cancer, is delivering flowers to a funeral. On his way back he calls at the
office of his brother-in-law a dentist, who is not there. He goes to find
out whether he is with Marchak the doctor next door and discovers a naked
woman on a couch.
From her appearance - although he is no expert - Louie suspects that the
woman has just had intercourse. Her wrists are wired to a machine and he
knows that Marchak is in the habit of getting women off the street to record
their reactions to sex. The woman senses that Louie is excited and takes him
back to her room where she tells him to take all his clothes off and get
under a blanket. When he is undressed she throws his clothes out of the
window and disappears after them. Louie rushes to the window and sees an
accomplice gathering them up.
Louie finds a filthy dress and braves the killing Chicago cold outside
dressed as a girl. The local druggist sends him to a speakeasy where he is
interrogated by a Greek and persuaded to help a drunk back home to his two
little girls. When Louie gets home himself and his father hits him, the blow
'fills him with gratitude'.
In a sense, Saul Bellow's story could also be thought of as autobiographical
in that he was the same age as his protagonist in February, 1933, and also
lived in Chicago. There is also a seemingly personal note to his son: 'I
haven't left a large estate, and this is why I have written this memoir, a
sort of addition to your legacy.'
In this case, however, it does not matter whether the subject-matter is
autobiographical or not. The test is that we are not invited at every twist
and turn of the story to refer back to Bellow's own life. The style is
conversational and personal, reminding us of that tradition of American
literature which runs from Mark Twain to Sherwood Anderson. In its theme -
the transition from innocence to experience - it is also in the Anderson
mould, reminding us of those moving stories 'I Want to Know Why' and 'I'm a
Fool'.
Although Something To Remember Me By does not have the pyrotechnic
brilliance of A Theft and The Bellarosa Connection it is no less impressive.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Dying for a drink? Then die if you do: A deadly treatment
for Russia's drinkers

<BYLINE>
   By NANETTE VAN DER LANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW. Alexie is dying for a drink. Vodka, perfume, chemical fluid
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the hardened alcoholic has drunk every possible liquid that ignites. But
now, he would not even think of taking a sip of wine, even if his life
depended on it.
Alexie Rogozhin thinks his life does depend on it. Last week, a drug was
sewn under his skin, which, he is convinced, will kill him if he drinks any
sort of alcoholic beverage. The treatment is administered to desperate
alcoholics. Fear of death becomes the only way to prevent them reaching for
the bottle.
Of the thousands of Russian alcoholics who seek treatment in state-run
clinics each year, Rogozhin is one of about 5,000 patients who receive one
of two drugs designed to control the disease.
The first, Esperal, comes in 10-pack tablet form and is sewn under the skin
near muscle tissue. A milder liquid version, dubbed the 'torpedo', is
injected intravenously.
Both stay in the body five to 12 months and remain inactive until alcohol
intake. The widely administered drugs in Russia cause an allergic reaction
if alcohol is consumed. If the alcoholic does drink, excruciating pain
results. Ultimately, doctors say, the allergy can have fatal consequences.
Although the method is highly controversial treatment at Moscow's
Narcological Hospital No 17 seems to work. 'I don't drink anymore, because I
know it will kill me,' Nikolai, a lanky 42-year-old engineer, explained
seated on a bed at the clinic. A near-death experience has convinced him
that a torpedo is no laughing matter.
At a different hospital four years ago, Nikolai was given an injection by a
doctor which made him 'die'. 'I could hardly breathe anymore and I got
incredibly hot,' he says, turning red just thinking about it. The doctor
resuscitated him and told him that next time he drank the same would happen
to him, only there would be no one to bring him back to life.
'It worked,' says Nikolai, proudly pointing to his mouth. 'For the past four
years, not one drop has passed these lips.'
Rogozhin, too, has not come near liquor in a year. 'I once sniffed at a
glass of vodka and it made me sick right away,' the actor says. 'I'm cured,
for life. I can't remember the time that I wasn't drunk every day. I even
ate bread drenched in shoe polish. If you leave it on the radiator
overnight, scrape off the cream and eat the bread, you can get a buzz,'
Rogozhin smiles. 'But those days are over,' he sighs. He pulls a document
out of his wallet, which testifies that he has an Esperal and that he is
aware of the possibly fatal consequences. He points to his stomach and says:
'There she is, right there.'
Alcoholism has been called Russia's most serious ailment, and for many
kicking the habit is basically impossible in a country where not raising
your vodka glass at dinner is perceived as an insult to the host.
According to official reports, 14 out of every 1000 people in Russia are
alcoholics. Aleksandr Sergeyev, deputy chief of the clinic, believes the
actual number of cases to be much higher, however. Although he has no
statistics, he judges 60 per cent of the nation to have serious drinking
problems.
Although patients do get ill, no one has died from torpedoes or Esperal,
said Sergeyev. He added that over the past 10 years 200,000 alcoholics have
been treated at the clinic. Every fourth patient received a torpedo. What
happens at private clinics, however, he says, is uncertain. 'If a patient
dies, then it is because of alcohol misuse of course, not the drugs we give
them,' Sergeyev contends.
Sergei Golovin, a psychiatrist at hospital No 17, does not approve of the
drug. 'It is bad to stimulate fear and I discourage the use of medication to
treat alcoholism, but it is up to the patient to decide how to deal with it.
We only give torpedoes or Esperal to healthy people. If a patient has a bad
heart, we would not think of it.'
Vladimir S, who considers himself to be an alcoholic although he has not
drunk in three years, calls torpedoes and Esperal 'barbaric'.
'The drinker simply fools himself, it's crazy,' says Vladimir. He believes
the Alcoholic Anonymous program, introduced to the clinic by a group of
Americans last year, is the only sensible way to treat the disease.
'This sort of thing is condemned in the West and with good reason. An
alcoholic with a torpedo simply counts the days until the drug wears off and
then he starts drinking again, and harder. Although it may keep someone from
drinking, ultimately it is not a real way to treat the problem.'
Ryastoslav Prochorov, a counsellor at the clinic, is cynical, saying that
drunks are smart and will not even be deterred by death. He clicks his thumb
and middle finger against the side of his throat, the Russian gesture that
means 'drunk'.
'Russians enjoy drinking, it's our national pastime,' he states
matter-of-factly. He says he can cite many cases of 'sewn-up' alcoholics who
simply took a bottle to the entrance of the clinic and drank there knowing
they would be treated if things went wrong.
'After all,' he says, 'neither the prospect of death nor anything else can
keep a Russian man from drinking.'

EVERYONE NEEDS a hobby, a consuming but frivolous means of escape from work,
career, decorating the house, staring lugubriously at the bank statement and
other necessary but uninspiring aspects of life. Without such a passion we
become dull and stale.
This applies as much to politicians as to anyone else. One of the more
dispiriting characteristics of the current breed is how hard they all work,
and how little interest they seem to have in anything else. If the health
and happiness of the nation increased in proportion to the hours devoted by
Cabinet ministers to their papers, we would now live in Nirvana. But we do
not, so the whole approach is obviously flawed.
I am aware that prime minister John Major loves poring over the cricket
averages and cheering on Chelsea football club. But that is insufficient and
far too passive. He should beware the example of his hobby-less predecessor,
who might have done well to take up hot-air ballooning or clay pigeon
shooting. At least Edward Heath had his sailing and tinkling at the piano,
while Harold Wilson had golf as well as his famous affection for
Huddersfield Town.
Actually, I hope Major does not take up golf. Too many of our prime
ministers have professed a fondness for this worthy but dull game - among
them Asquith, Bonar Law, and Ramsay MacDonald. In any event, I believe the
dicky state of his knees would preclude it. This handicap is a shame, for
walking is a respectable pastime for a PM. Baldwin combined it with what the
Dictionary of National Biography calls 'an affection for the atmosphere and
simple fare of old country inns.'
Somehow, I cannot see Major emulating Palmerston, who loved horse-racing and
killing animals in equal measure. Lord Aberdeen's passion - otter-hunting -
would hardly be acceptable today. Pitt the Younger drank port, and Canning
wrote poetry - neither of which seems quite in character for the present
premier. Balfour listed motoring as his recreation, but no one could motor
for pleasure in this age.
It is a disturbing fact that only two of our prime ministers were serious
fishermen - Neville Chamberlain and the former Sir Alec Douglas-Home. I
fancy that MacMillan may have dabbled a little, for the other day I found a
photograph of him in tweeds and flat cap, rod in hand, beside a famous Irish
salmon river. But I suspect that shooting creatures was more in his line.
The fact that Chamberlain had a 6lb Test trout to his credit suggests that
he was no mean performer. There is a touching account in a book by John
Bennie of a weekend by the Test, at which Chamberlain was a guest. The PM
fished all day for salmon and trout, caught the biggest fish, drank several
glasses of port, and 'in his enthusiasm reminded me much of a schoolboy on a
weekend holiday.' It was May 1939; war, resignation, and death were just
around the corner.
A few months before that weekend, Chamberlain had returned from Munich
waving his piece of paper. Hardy Brothers, the tackle-makers, presented him
with a 10 ft Rogue River fly rod - 'as a mark of esteem and appreciation for
his determined efforts in averting a World War,' the inscription on it
reads. I handled the rod recently at an auction in London (it was bought by
a member of the Chamberlain family for Pounds 2,000), and wondered if that
inscription had troubled him.
The champion prime ministerial angler is Lord Home of the Hirsel. In his
volume of sporting memoirs, Border Reflections, this most modest of demon
fishermen hardly bothers to mention the capture of salmon to 38lb and sea
trout to 16lb. He allows himself no more than one boast: an account of how,
having left all his baits at home, he carved a lure from a piece of
driftwood and caught six salmon with it.
He is a trout man, too - 'so give me a light trout rod, and the dry fly, and
a stream which rises clear through moor or meadow, and I ask no more of the
day.' Now, that is the prime minister for me]
So, it is clear that Major should take up fishing. He might find wading
rivers after salmon and trout a bit arduous, but he could sit comfortably in
a boat, or by a lake; and since he would be able to command access to the
best waters, he would surely catch something, if the detectives kept their
heads down. Above all, the agonies and ecstasies of fishing would surely
provide him with a new and enviable sense of proportion about the cares of
his great office.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Britain trims its wise council: A UK agency respected abroad
but forced to scrabble for profit by its own land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British Council, the UK's cultural diplomacy outfit has long been
portrayed as a bunch of ineffectual amateurs promoting decadent pursuits
abroad. There is unlikely to be much of an outcry, therefore, over cuts in
government spending announced in this week's autumn statement which threaten
to curtail the council's activities.
That will surprise many in eastern and central Europe, where the council is
playing an important role in the transition from communism to capitalism.
Amid all the gloom over the UK's diminishing role as a world power, there is
a high regard for the old bulldog in the former countries of the Soviet bloc
for which the British Council can take much of the credit.
In Czechoslovakia, the council could operate throughout the communist period
only as the cultural section of the British embassy. After the velvet
revolution in 1989, the council expanded its activities, aided by resources
provided by the Foreign Office for former Soviet bloc countries.
'There was a pent-up hunger for the sort of cultural contact with the west
after years when such contacts were disapproved of,' says the UK ambassador,
David Brighty.
The council has moved out of the embassy and into offices in Prague which
used to house the East German trade mission. These, refurbished and equipped
with the latest technology, establish 'a public presence that flaunts
itself, providing an excellent shop window for Britain', says Brighty.
When Vaclav Havel, then President, opened the new centre in April, he
recalled that in his childhood, his mother's twice-weekly nights out at
British Council events in pre-communist days had been the highlights of her
life.
Milos Brunclik, now the Czechoslovak news agency man in Bratislava
also has fond memories: 'I was at a British Council lecture in 1948 which
broke up when a boy burst in to warn us that the secret police were parked
outside,' he recalls. 'Most of those present slipped out of the back door to
avoid harassment, but I escaped by linking arms with two formidable English
women who worked for the council and walking out through the front door -
the police assumed I was British.'
In Czechoslovakia the council has seven resource centres in provincial
cities to underpin the teaching of English in schools. These offer books,
tapes, videos, teaching aids, information on examinations, courses and
advice for teachers. Specialists are seconded from the UK to train the
thousands of new English teachers who are needed, and to retrain Russian
teachers whose skills are redundant.
The council is also a channel for development aid from the Know-How Fund, a
programme for developing the skills of budding capitalists and democrats.
These range from bringing top managers over to study business in the UK, to
training management trainers and support for local training organisations to
develop sustainable management institutions in Czechoslovakia.
But why should the people of this central European country, of which we in
Britain famously know little, want anything to do with a second-rate fading
offshore island? After all, there is little doubt over who is the regional
power at the heart of Europe, as the flood of German tourists and
businessmen crossing the Czech border attests.
The answer appears to be that the Czechoslovaks are reluctant to become a
mere appendage of their powerful neighbour. Bill Jefferson, the council's
man on the ground, says there is much competition for further Council
centres between mayors who offer prime sites at peppercorn rents to see the
union jack flying in their towns as a visible rejoinder to the overweening
power of the deutschemark.
There is also an interest in British arts and culture which the council
meets through the customary programme of cultural exchanges and visits -
such as a much talked-about tour by the Royal National Theatre 18 months
ago. Ironically, the tour was sponsored by a Japanese bank, Nomura.
Council revenue from sponsorship has risen from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 5.5m
since 1990. More than Pounds 40m, around 10 per cent of total income, comes
from the fees charged for English language teaching.
There are other sources of income which the council has become adept at
tapping, such as contracts for development work from the World Bank and the
EC. But the government grant and contracts for UK development aid provide
the bulk of the income, and both are threatened.
The impact of this week's direct cuts is insidious enough - withdrawal from
some of the 90 countries where the council works must be on the cards, at a
time when the break-up of the Soviet Union and the liberation of central and
eastern Europe has created some 20 new countries, all needing encouragement
through the transition to democracy.
But there is also the slow-burning fuse of the government's market-testing
programme. This requires the Foreign Office's Overseas Development
Administration to put out to tender development work currently done under
contract by the council.
John Hanson, the council's new chief executive, is confident that it will
win most of those contracts. But already the council has lost some to
outside competitors. As Sir Martin Jacomb, the retired banker who chairs the
British Council, puts it: 'The loss of a contract can mean losing critical
mass in a country. And once you have had to withdraw from a country, you
will be seen to have turned your back on it forever.'
The example of Czechoslovakia is particularly apposite. After the communist
coup, the restrictions on its operations might have led the council to cut
its losses and write off this Soviet satellite. If that had been done, the
contacts and influence which have made British aid and bridge-building so
effective since the return of democracy would have been much harder to
re-establish.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Gardening: A beautiful but neglected plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW years ago most of my bamboos flowered and then died. To be more
accurate, I presume they flowered, for I know of no other cause for their
sudden extinction and, bamboos often - though not invariably - die after
producing flowers. But their flowers are small and I did not notice them. I
was only aware of trouble when the plants began to fail.
Now comes a fine book, Bamboos (Batsford Pounds 19.99) by Christine Recht,
with fine colour photographs by Max F Wetterwald, to throw light on these
beautiful but neglected plants. It arrives directly after another book,
written and admirably illustrated by Graham Stuart Thomas, entitled
Ornamental Shrubs, Climbers and Bamboos (Pounds 25, John Murray), an
excellent encyclopedia. But Rechts' book clearly has scope to deal with just
one subject in greater detail. Do not expect them to agree altogether on
names for the genera and species, because accurate identification depends
largely on flowers and bamboos flower very irregularly - sometimes not even
once in 100 years  - so it is difficult for botanists to obtain material to
confirm their studies. This need not deter anyone from planting bamboos
which are, in general, beautiful and easily grown plants, some of which are
small enough to be planted in tiny gardens or in containers.
Recht has a lot to say about the cultivation of bamboos, which are happiest
in moist soil and semi-shady places. A goodly number of species and garden
varieties will be found in nurseries and sources of supply can be traced via
The Plant Finder, a book which makes things easy for gardeners.
It is not always understood that bamboos are related to grasses. They are
the tree and shrub members of the enormous grass family. They are all
evergreen. They spread, sometimes rather too freely for comfort, by creeping
roots known as rhizomes but can be fairly easily restricted by chopping them
back with a sharp spade. Detached portions of the root can be replanted
elsewhere if desired.
Nearly all the wild bamboos come from Asia. In Chinese art bamboos represent
the male element - the yang - in contrast to the softer female element - the
ying - of flowers such as the chrysanthemum or plum blossom, two favourites
with the Chinese.
These are all matters that are dealt with in detail by Recht. Both text and
illustrations give many ideas for planting.
When grown in containers they need a good rich soil, a John Innes type of
mixture rather than peat, unless they are fed regularly and generously. Most
plants are sold in containers from which they can be moved at any time of
year. Recht recommends spring planting because new root growth is strong and
the plants can become well established by midsummer.
Spring is also the best time for plants moved from open ground, whether from
nursery to garden, or from one part of the garden to another. Any newly
transplanted plants must not be allowed to suffer for lack of water. Bamboos
make a lot of leaves and are thirsty plants.
Bamboos differ in size, leaf shape and the pattern and colour of their
canes. There are varieties with variegated leaves, such as golden striped
Pleioblastus viridistriatus or silver striped P. fortunei, and there also
kinds with coloured canes, such as Sinarundinaria nitida, in which the canes
are deep, purplish grey.
I have nothing but praise for Bamboos - except for the proof reading which
seems to have been done by a machine, checking spelling but not able to
consider the meaning of a sentence. There are, of course, no such
shortcomings with Graham Thomas's book, for he is too meticulous an author
to allow anything like this to happen.
His is a volume of 585 pages giving a comprehensive account of hardy and
nearly hardy shrubs and climbing plants - and a very adequate one of
bamboos. It is clearly organised and should have a prominent place in the
libraries of gardeners. His illustrations are from his own photographs,
flower paintings and line drawings - a marvel to consider for Christmas.
Either book would make a handsome gift for any keen gardener.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Gardening: Wild and wet November reveals its glories - Robin
Lane Fox has been picking all the flowers he can lay his hands on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOON has been scudding wildly above the spires of Oxford; everything is
once more remarkable and received wisdom is being turned upside down by its
light.
In mid-November gardeners are supposed to be losing heart. If you believe
what you read, you should be returning to gloom, cutting down the borders
and wondering how to aerate the lawn. Nobody has a kind word for the season
until it is time to write about catalogues. This year, however, the school
of garden gloom has got it all wrong.
Naturally, FT readers do not believe all they read: go out there and check
it, take the scissors and look carefully. Gloom is not the word for it. The
past fortnight has been wonderfully mild and wet, providing us with pleasure
which I last remember on such a scale in 1976.
Spring-flowering plants, late flowering climbers and shrubs which ought to
know better are opening their buds and still showing colour.
The primroses are enjoying a postscript; violas are ignoring the calendar;
many of the roses have new buds long after the season. According to the
books, the only certain flowers for every gardener in November are universal
pansies. Pansies may be creeping up on us, but these late encores in a
garden are an opportunity.
Wherever you see flowers or colour, cut them and bring them indoors.
Inhibitions are irrelevant. During the high summer, I pick flowers with
restraint, absurdly anxious that I will leave a noticeable gap if I take too
much from the main plantings.
I hold back, tell myself to economise among profusion and never take an
unopened bud. In November, the game is quite different. Flower-picking
becomes like shoplifting when the windows hav been smashed and the
government has fled.
Whatever you leave behind, nature will soon take it instead, sending frost
or a storm to ruin it. For some weeks now, the weather has been as
changeable as the high seas so nothing can be risked or left to its mercy.
Whatever flowers appear end up inside the house: I have even been picking my
best successes of this autumn, the pink schizostylis which open wonderfully
if the stems are picked in bud.
From the window, all may look ravaged, quite unlike the experience which I
am reporting. Look closely, and you will be amazed what is lurking among the
leaves. In less than an hour, I have picked some crazy mixtures of spring
and autumn, pinks, blues, whites against a backing of the pearl-pink berries
which are better than ever on the sorbus trees.
In November, a ceanothus has no right to be covered in buds, but the last
fortnight has brought my Trewithen Blue into yet another covering of
flowers. This variety continues to grow furiously up an exposed south wall
but these flowers are best taken indoors before November remembers its bad
manner. I have been relishing the paradox of these blue flowers from spring
among the first scented mahonias of winter, sprigs of the tireless winter
Cherry and some faded buds from Rose New Dawn.
Rosebuds are wonderfully suited to late picking because they will open fully
in a warm room if picked with the faintest flush of colour. Indoors, heating
does the work of summer: I find that my favourite apricot-yellow climber,
Lady Hillingdon, is second to none for its late scattering of buds which can
be brought on under shelter.
At this late season, whoever would expect pinks and double primroses,
spring-flowering viburnas, perennial wallflowers, clouds of the low-growing
gypsophila or yellow potentilla in its herbaceous form called recta? The
old-fashioned pinks have gone on strike, but the newer hybrids from the West
Country are flowering on and on as if in answer to those who find their too
formal or too bright.
Pale peach flowers on the Cranmere Pool variety have lasted indoors for more
than a week among great bunches of double lilac. The admirable small
perahades have never stopped flowering in their charming shades of sky-blue
and white. Their small evergreen bushes make a pleasant edging for low
borders, although nobody seems to exploit their quality. With me, they have
survived all frosts in the last five years
Spring-flowering Viburnums in November are a supreme conceit, yet they are
showing this year while their autumn relations are flowering madly in
pepper-scented shades of pink and white. Heads of Viburnum carlesii smells
even better in November among small bunches of musk roses, pink Selicia or
the white Prosperity.
As the air is so cold, the scents of these flowers are far stronger than in
July. As backing, I have been using the clouds of tiny white daisies on the
connoisseurs' favourite low-growing Aster, the one called laterifolius
Prince the dark little leaves of which are notable throughout the summer.
The connoisseurs' oldie among chrysanthemums has also come into its own.
Pink flowered Emperor of China won a first class certificate as long ago as
1889, but nowadays critical gardeners may well wonder why. The leaves turn
to a strong beetroot red, but the flowers are small and spidery and the
bushes are thin and straggly, whatever the conservation plantspeople like to
claim in their favour.
At the last of this season's flower shows even the nurserymen could not show
this old variety in any better shape. The answer is to pick it, not show it.
Small vases of its pale pink flowers have the hazy delicacy of a Fantin
Latour painting. Buy it for this purpose and put it out of the main
sightline where you can ignore it until its mid-November picking.
Indoors, these details show up and individuality can be loved. Outdoors,
November's 'antis' do have a point. This year, the young wallflowers are
almost all of a miserable size for bedding. Because the cold and wet weather
hit them at just the wrong point in the summer. Accompanying flowerbulbs
have now soared by 15 per cent in price to cope with the pound's collapse in
Holland during this planting season. Spring bedding has never been so
expensive, but late autumn budding has never been better. Adjust to
November's encores, pick them without mercy and if it does not freeze all
winter, we will need far fewer of those hyacinths at ever higher prices.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Property: Yorkshire peaks and troughs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HANSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE not many buyers in the Yorkshire Dales these days, but this does
not seem to be getting through to those owners who have been chasing the
market downwards for the past three years. There are few country houses in
Yorkshire worth more than Pounds 1m, but this does not stop people trying to
get more.
Earlier this year, the Marquess of Zetland thought he had found a buyer for
his Copt Hewick Hall estate near Ripon. He had been asking Pounds 2m for his
13-bedroom Regency house standing in 88 acres and he accepted an offer, only
to have the buyer pull out. Anxious to find a buyer before February 1993,
when he plans to move to the Zetland family seat, Aske Hall outside
Richmond, North Yorkshire, the marquess reduced the price of Copt Hewick
Hall to Pounds 1.25m.
'That is an extremely attractive price and I am quietly confident that we
will sell the property by Christmas,' says Johnny Jackson, of J H Jackson &amp;
Co at Boroughbridge (0423-323171). Joint agent Henry Holland-Hibbert, of
Lane Fox in London, confirms that there has been interest from overseas and
the UK - but as yet no buyer.
If Copt Hewick Hall cannot attract a buyer at Pounds 1.25m, what chance does
David Aykroyd have of finding one for the Priory at Nun Monkton, near York,
for which he is asking Pounds 4.5m? That price was placed on the property in
June 1991, and still holds today.
'I agree that it an extraordinary price,' says Johnny Jackson, this time
joint agent with Strutt and Parker in Harrogate (0423-561274). 'But we have
had several people interested in buying the whole estate, as well as those
who just want to buy the main house.'
The reason the Priory is so expensive is that it is not just a magnificent
William and Mary house, built some time between 1660 and 1690 and listed
Grade II*. Nor is it because it has 257 acres of farmland and parkland. It
is because it represents the perfect property for a businessman - a
beautiful house with offices and warehousing in beautiful grounds.
David Aykroyd inherited it from his father, Colonel George Aykroyd, who
bought it in 1948 for Pounds 25,000. The 11-bedroom house has been restored
and remodelled internally under the architectural supervision of Sir Martyn
Beckett. In 1987, David Aykroyd built 5,000 sq ft of offices in the grounds
in the form of a traditional country house designed by Malcolm Tempest. Next
to this he created 23,600 sq ft of warehouses in traditional materials. The
offices are let to the Yorkshire Fine Wines Company, which David Aykroyd
used to own until he sold it to Bibendum Wine of London.
The Yorkshire Fine Wines Company occupies the offices and warehouses on a
25-year lease from 1987 at a rent of Pounds 69,307 a year, with upward-only
rent reviews every five years, the first of which is due on November 23. It
is this commercial element that accounts for some - but not all - of the
Priory's Pounds 4.5m price.
What sort of properties are selling in Yorkshire? Strutt &amp; Parker recently
sold Cliff Lodge, a nine-bedroom Victorian house at Leyburn, with four acres
of gardens. The asking price was Pounds 350,000, but it went for just over
Pounds 300,000.
'Pounds 300,000 will buy you quite a lot of property in Yorkshire at the
moment,' says Philip Procter, of Humberts in York (0904-611828). When Crayke
Cottage, a six bedroom late Georgian house, came on to the market in 1991,
its asking price was Pounds 400,000. A buyer was found at Pounds 350,000 but
fell through. When the property was remarketed in August at Pounds 297,500,
a buyer was found within three weeks.
Bryan Jarram, of Jackson-Stops &amp; Staff at York (0904-625033), who is
offering Hornington Grange at Bolton Percy, near York, at Pounds 295,000, 32
per cent below its original price of Pounds 350,000, blames 'stubborn
Yorkshire clients who won't lower their prices' for the glut of unsold
properties.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Property: Flat owners roll out the welcome mat - A look at
legislation which will shift power from freeholders to leaseholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disaffected leaseholders will soon, it seems, have something to celebrate.
Legislation going through parliament will give many of them the right to own
their properties outright.
The Housing and Urban Development Bill, which amounts to a radical shift in
power away from freeholders, passed its second Commons reading earlier this
month in a blaze of controversy.
Advocates such as Sir George Young, housing minister, said it will abolish a
'feudal and unstable' leasehold system. Backbench critics described it as a
Robin Hood Bill, which gave leaseholders the right to rob their landlords.
Under the legislation, which is due to become law next summer, many
landlords will be forced to sell their freeholds. Of the 750,000
leaseholders expected to benefit from the new law, many are flat owners who
live in London and on the south coast. But the law will also embrace
relatively expensive houses, mainly in central London, that were excluded
from leasehold enfranchisement legislation in 1967.
The logic behind the legislation is two-fold: it will tackle the problem of
wasting assets and it will give leaseholders more control over their
property.
The predicament of wasting assets arises because lenders are loathe to grant
mortgages on properties with leases of less than 70 years. That makes them,
in effect, unsellable. This problem is intensifying because large numbers of
houses began to be converted into flats with 99-year leases during the
1960s.
Equally important is the proposed shift in power towards leaseholders, who
complain they have limited rights over their property despite having paid a
full price for their lease. 'It is unfair that a Pounds 500 freehold
exercises control over a Pounds 100,000 flat, giving leaseholders all the
'obligations of ownership but only the limited rights of tenants'', says the
Enfranchisement League, one of many pressure groups that has urged reform.
Specifically, the measure will allow flat owners to take the management of
their property into their own hands. Previous attempts to give leaseholders
more control over the management of their property, such as the Landlord and
Tenant Act 1987, have largely failed. Leaseholders have often found
themselves powerless when they are faced with landlords and managing agents
who are negligent or corrupt.
More controversially, leaseholders may gain financially from
enfranchisement. Critics of the new legislation argue that leaseholders will
be able to buy their freehold too cheaply, a claim hotly denied by
leaseholders. The Grosvenor Estate, the owner of much of London's Belgravia
and Mayfair and a vocal opponent of the Bill, believes that leaseholder's
windfall gains could be as high as Pounds 100,000.
Disputes over price seem inevitable. But unless the Bill is changed in
committee stage, the basis for calculating the cost of enfranchisement will
be three-fold.
First, the open market value of the property, which is calculated by
capitalising the value of the ground rent. Second, at least half the
'marriage value' of the freehold and leasehold interests. The marriage value
arises because the whole is worth more than the sum of the parts. Freeholds
with vacant possession (which may have, for example, development potential)
are worth more than the combination of the landlord's and tenant's
interests. Third, the landlord's costs and compensation for any potential
gains lost by the forced sale.
There may be an additional boost to property values as a result of
enfranchisement. Robert Orr-Ewing of estate agents Knight Frank &amp; Rutley,
said: 'In the early days, a freehold flat will have a rarity value which
will earn a premium.'
Values may be enhanced, even if a leaseholder does not take advantage of the
new law. 'Many purchasers of short leaseholds in the future will be
investors looking for added profit through the prospect of enfranchisement,'
says estate agent Savills. It believes that prospective gains will depend on
location. Marriage values in prime areas will be lower than in non-prime
areas, because short-lease values hold up more strongly when purchasers do
not need mortgages.
But the new law is bound to disappoint some leaseholders. The Commonhold
Flats Campaign, a lobby group, says that the government proposals will only
help 38 per cent of long leaseholders. (That said, in many of the cases
where long leaseholders cannot enfranchise, they may be able to extend their
leases).
Leaseholders will only be able to enfranchise if 90 per cent or more of the
floor area is residential, if two-thirds of the flats are on leases of 21
years or more and if two-thirds of those flats vote in favour of
enfranchisement. Moreover, the ground rent must be less than two-thirds of
the rateable value if the lease was granted before April 1 1990 or less than
Pounds 1,000 in Greater London or Pounds 250 elsewhere if it was granted
after April 1990. The aim is to exclude people who are renting rather than
leasing.
Exemptions include properties owned by the Crown, charitable trust housing
already let at a discount and conversions with four or fewer flats, one of
which is occupied by the landowner.
In any case, the new law will not be a panacea. Flat owners in large blocks
of flats may well find it difficult to agree on repairs and service charges
amongst themselves. 'In some cases the lack of professional 'caretakers' and
the added responsibility of repair and maintenance could discourage
potential purchasers especially those who are away from their property for
long periods,' says Ms Yolande Barnes, head of research at Savills.
Flat owners may also find it difficult to club together and buy the
freeholds of tenants who do not want to buy their flats.
Critics point to a plethora of other disadvantages arising from the bill.
The opportunity to buy leases of varying lengths may disappear, restricting
choice and pricing some people out of central London. The resurgence of the
rented sector may be set back by the fear of more anti-landlord legislation.
The appearance of some of the most exclusive parts of central London, which
currently benefit from the long-term stewardship of the 'great estates', may
deteriorate.
But set against the unwanted effects of this new law is the prospect of
halting the erosion of the value of leases and ending the hostility between
numerous leaseholders and their landlords. Even though the problems of flat
owners will not disappear as a result of enfranchisement, leasehold
enfranchisement will mean they have no one to blame but themselves.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Practical Traveller: Culture and jelly in Tripoli
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR ago I joined a nine-day Swan Hellenic art treasures tour of
Tripolitania and Cyrenaica - Libya to you. It was extremely well-run.
Occasionally tiring, maybe, for someone like me, whose mind wanders easily
and whose visits to archaeological sites have to be strictly rationed if I
am not to die of ennui; but it packed a great deal in.
The visit was run in association with the British Museum and offered keen
value at Pounds 1,675 per person (single room supplement: Pounds 15 per
night).
Sissie Chan, Swan Hellenic's marketing director, was there to keep a
minder's eye on me. Every time I flagged she gave me a book to read or
ordered a plate of jelly. And I was constantly startled by the skill of the
guest lecturer, Dr Susan Walker, assistant keeper of Greek and Roman
Antiquities at the British Museum, in noticing that my attention could
generally be revived with a bit of classical statuary or incongruous
note-swapping on films and modern novels.
In addition, there was the itinerary itself: Tripoli, Sabratha, Leptis
Magna, Benghazi, Al Beida, Cyrene, Apollonia, Tripoli - all much enjoyed by
the enthusiasts who jostle to join such trips.
Swan Hellenic is the UK market leader for cultural tours and cruises. It has
nearly 40 years' experience, having organised its first Mediterranean cruise
in 1954.
It runs a well-rounded programme: cruises to virtually everywhere, including
the Nile and European rivers; and land-based art and natural history tours.
It even has a brochure of Christmas and winter breaks covering 14
destinations. Examples: eight days in Rome, December 21-28, Pounds 1,390;
eight in Madrid, same dates, Pounds 1,275; seven in Prague, December 21-27,
Pounds 1,650; and nine in Sri Lanka, February 14-22 1993, Pounds 1,175. The
single room supps are Pounds 15 per night (Rome), Pounds 39 per night
(Madrid), Pounds 69 per night (Prague) and Pounds 16 per night (Sri Lanka).
The company says it has combined new ports and sites with traditional
itineraries for next year's Mediterranean cruises. There are 18 different
ones, all accompanied by experts in history, art, architecture and
archaeology. Prices start from Pounds 1,450, including flights, transfers,
accommodation, meals and excursions. There is a no-tipping policy aboard its
cruise ship, the Orpheus.
One of next year's cruises (June 16-30, from Pounds 1,580) is due to make a
one-day stop at Tripoli for excursions to Sabratha or Leptis Magna. And
there are two land tours of Libya pencilled in next year (13 days each, May
13-25 and September 16-28, Pounds 2,695).
Swan Hellenic's natural history tours next year include Madagascar (14 days,
Pounds 2,850), Tanzania (13 days, Pounds 2,450), Patagonia (19 days, Pounds
3,275), and Antarctica and the Falkland Islands (17 days, Pounds 5,495 for
an outside twin-bedded cabin on Discoverer Deck of Clipper's World
Discoverer; other prices available).
London tel: 071-831-1515 for Swan Hellenic Mediterranean and Nile cruises;
071-831-1616 for land tours and European river cruises.
The British Museum itself has a division, British Museum Tours (tel:
071-323-8895 or 071-323-1234), which runs a full programme, drawing on
curators' expertise and covering art, archaeology, history and ethnography.
All tours are accompanied by a museum-appointed lecturer and a tour manager.
Examples next year: Easter Island and Tahiti (February 7-21, Pounds 2,930,
single supp Pounds 105); Medieval Bohemia (May 12-18, Pounds 1,180, single
supp Pounds 195); Indonesia: Sumatra, Java, Bali (July 29-August 18, Pounds
2,304, single supp Pounds 372), and Syria (October 19-November 3, Pounds
1,950, single supp Pounds 342).
Among larger operators, many of which try to include cultural jaunts
somewhere in their brochures, is Bales Tours, owned and run by the
experienced Bales family (George, Molly, Anthony, Joanna, Mandy, Jane),
which has a full range of escorted tours. Examples next year: Jordan and the
Holy Land, 19 days, Pounds 1,895; Moghul India, 16 days, Pounds 1,695, and
China, 10-21 days, with various extensions and prices. All tours have
numerous departure dates. Tel: 0306-885991/876881.
Two other specialist companies are Prospect (081-995-2151), which also runs
opera and music holidays; and Jasmin Tours (0628-850788).
Hardened culture vultures can easily organise their own short or long
breaks. Among the best city brochures is that of British Airways Holidays
(44 cities on three continents; prices from Pounds 149 for two nights in
Paris; new additions for 1993: Bruges, Faro and Salzburg, starting from
Pounds 177, Pounds 187 and Pounds 279 for two nights respectively;
0293-615353/061-493-3344).
Another good city brochure is Travelscene's (081-427-4445). The company
reports marked growth this year in short-break travel to
less-well-established centres, partly because of boredom with longer summer
sun holidays but also because oldies, many of them fairly well insulated by
their pensions against recession, have been skipping off on city breaks.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Travel: No oiks or Hoorays - Keith Wheatley and family enjoy
a French mobile home holiday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SEEMS to me that relaxation on holiday is next to impossible if one
cannot get on with fellow travellers. Who could enjoy a Caribbean strand if
the beach bar were full of oiks swilling lager? How many skiing holidays
have been made anxious by a careless chalet mixture of Hoorays lavishly
employed in merchant banking and salaried civil servants anxiously counting
their francs?
The big barrier that companies that sell camping holidays have to cross with
first-time punters is the pyschological question: 'Who else goes camping?'
Gut-reaction and historical prejuice tend to suggest a mixture of the
indigent and khaki-clad fresh-air fiends.
Rumours continue to filter through that French camping is different, but it
could just be good public relations. With four children under 10 who would
willingly live on the beach if possible, I knew why I was at Camping de la
Plage, just outside La Trinite-sur-Mer, in southern Brittany. But who else
was there?
My eventual answer, and subsequent Theory of Continental Camping, owes
everything to the curious British practice of labelling car registrations
with a letter revealing the vehicle's age. Adjacent to virtually every tent
or caravan seemed to be a Volvo or similar respectable saloon with an E, F
or G on the number plate: cars four and five years old.
Where were the brand-new Sierras, the pristine Vauxhalls, the solid Rovers
with only 15,000 miles on the clock? In short, what had happened to the
company vehicle? My new-found tennis partner, the Rev Henry Whyte of
Kingston, Surrey, (C registration Volkswagen Passat estate), confirmed my
observations. Company man was not a camper.
These were families where the bread-winner was self-employed, a partner in
professional practice, or in jobs such as teaching - people of modest
affluence, smart enough to buy a good car but not daft enough to suffer the
punitive depreciation on a new one.
They were also extremely good company. Sitting next to a chap for an hour
while one's toddlers explore the gravitational mechanics of the playground
slide, a good deal of ground gets covered. Statistics from Eurocamp
confirmed my own evidence that three-quarters of their customers are on a
second or third visit.
French camp-sites provide a matchless environment for small children.
Enclosed, with a pool, playground, companionship and usually adjoining a
beach, they provide a context in which the big parental decisions are
whether to eat out or light a barbecue.
It may be fair to say that the tents, large and permanently-erected, are
designed to make the experience as comfortable as possible. Yet somehow a
tent does not make the kind of demands that even the most modest house can
impose.
Having twins still short of their second birthday, our family opted for a
mobile home rather than a tent, on the grounds of easier washing facilities
and wail-proof walls.
With double doors and picture windows, it came close to the ideal of outdoor
living.
It might not be the average adult's perfect holiday, for it lacks even the
minimum sophistication that makes everyone occasionally buy unsuitable
clothes or pick up The New Yorker at airports. But people shrewd enough to
buy those cars are probably going to escape by themselves - minus children -
later in the year.
Keith Wheatley holidayed at La Trinite-sur-Mer c/o Eurocamp: 28 Princess St,
Knutsford, Cheshire. Tel: 0565-633844. Eurocamp quotes prices which include
camp-site accommodation and return ferry crossing. Until December 21, an
early-booking offer for 1993 is available, mostly at 1992 prices. Example:
Two adults plus car (tent, 14 nights): Pounds 255-Pounds 719, depending on
season; extra adult: Pounds 62-Pounds 95; each young adult (14-17): Pounds
30-Pounds 60; children under 14: generally free, except in high season;
additional or fewer nights per party: plus or minus Pounds 8-Pounds 39;
mobile-home supplement per night per party: Pounds 15-Pounds 32.75.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Travel: The greatest show on girth - Tokyo is pricy. But
some of the best sights are free
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MCCOOEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST SURVEYS that compare costs for business and tourist travellers put
Tokyo at the top of the world league. But if you want to get a feel for
Tokyo, there are a number of attractions that will not cost an arm and a
leg. In fact, they are free. Two of them will entail getting up early, but
what the heck.
Start with a three-mile walk around the Imperial Palace. Once on the
perimeter of this green oasis you can walk round in perfect safety, as no
public roads are allowed to cross the 285 acres. Even the subways are not
allowed to pass beneath the Emperor's temporal home, which makes some subway
journeys complicated.
A walk around the palace, anti-clockwise from the British Embassy, will
reveal a microcosm of a city that has been dubbed the 'safe monster.'
Reason: the chances of being mugged in Tokyo are extremely slim. There is
crime, but it is well-organised and disciplined (protection rackets,
prostitution) and not random, confrontational and drug-related as in the US
or, increasingly, some parts of Europe.
In any event, there are so many security police in the area that the walk
can be made at dawn or dusk or at any hour of the day or night. The Japanese
word for policeman is omawarisan, which translates, roughly, as 'honoured Mr
Plod,' and their presence on the street and in their police boxes with a red
light on top will reassure the faint-hearted.
On the walk, to your left, is the massive, impassive stone walls of the
Imperial Palace, overhung by gnarled pines; steep grassy banks fall away to
the moat, which in winter is home to thousands of ducks from Siberia.
As you walk around, you go between massive guarded gateways and cross a
great gravelled open space, something extraordinary to find in one of the
densest conurbations on Earth. Its purpose remains the same as when it was
designated four centuries ago, by the shogun, the supreme military dictator,
as a refuge for when the unthinkable happens. Visitors could well experience
an earthquake, though hopefully not one of the magnitude of that that
devastated Tokyo in 1923.
To your right is the National Theatre where bunraku (puppet theatre) and
kabuki are regularly performed, and then the Diet and the ministries and the
soaring and (supposedly) earthquake-proof buildings of the great trading
companies. At dusk the contrast is striking: on one hand Tokyo's dark,
dramatic past, with the Emperor hidden away; on the other, the confident
dynamic future, with businessmen and bureaucrats in their office blocks and
serried ranks of lights blazing.
Tsukiji (pronounced skee-ji) is the world's busiest fish market, and is well
worth getting up early for (or not going to bed). It is located on the
waterfront south of the Ginza, where the Sumida river spills into Tokyo Bay.
Most of the fish, however, arrives by road and rail, from all over Japan and
abroad. Porters using yellow motorised carts or hand-pulled wooden barrows
whizz the fish to the auction rooms and dealers in a cavernous, open-sided
hall just inland from the waterfront.
On any one morning as many as 3,000 tuna fish, most frozen stiff and
white-frosted, are laid out, corpse-like. Men move among them silently,
shining torches, taking notes. The impression is of medical staff taking
details of casualties on a battlefield. In reality they are prospective
buyers checking for quality and assessing how much to bid at the 5am
auction.
A fresh 6ft tuna can sell for as much as Y4m (Pounds 20,000), which helps
explain why Tokyo heads most 'expensive city' lists. (For the cheapest and
freshest sushi in Tokyo, breakfast with the porters and mongers at one of
the numerous tiny bar-restaurants adjacent to the fish market).
The aproned fish-mongers use samurai-sharp knives to swish the bones of the
fish from the flesh at extraordinary speed while yelling to potential
customers. In the manner of market traders worldwide, porters engage in
banter with everyone, particularly foreign visitors. There is all manner of
marine life here; and death. Eels have their throats cut and are then dumped
in tin buckets to thrash around in their death throes; mottled stone fish
sulk in tanks and grotesque sea slugs await a happy eater; fugu - the deadly
poison fish that can only be prepared by approved restaurants - blow
themselves out in an apoplexy of indignation when a customer seals their
fate.
Further up the Sumida river is Ryogoku, where the sumo wrestling hall and
museum is located. Most of the sumo stables (the hostels where the wrestlers
live and train) are located nearby. When the wrestlers are not on the road -
there are six 15-day tournaments a year, three outside Tokyo - you can watch
the greatest show on girth, for the daily training sessions are open to the
public.
The most junior wrestlers enter the clay ring first at about 6am. They are
naked except for a coarse cotton loincloth and they perform bending and
strengthening exercises before crashing into each other in practice bouts.
Life for the lower ranks is spartan not just because of the strict training
discipline but because they are obliged to act as servant-valets to those
above them. Those that make it to the top, like the 40-stone Samoan,
Konishiki, enjoy superstar status. The senior wrestlers waddle into the ring
after 8am.
Most of the stables have their own hairdresser who combs the wrestlers' hair
into the distinctive top-knot every day. One of the most lingering memories
of a trip to a sumo stable may well be an olfactory one, rather than the
brute force on display and the rituals of a centuries-old sport. The oil
that wrestlers use on their hair is a mix of waxes and oils, some of which
are so strong and unpleasing that they have to be disguised by aloes-wood
perfume.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Travel: Swaying across the shimmering plains - African
elephants are reputed to be impossible to train. But three of them carried
Michael J Woods through the Okavango Delta - on their terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX WHITE, black and tan wild dogs, the rarest and most endangered of
Africa's carnivores, reluctantly rose to their feet and disdainfully stepped
aside as we pushed into the thick thorn scrub where they were resting in the
heat of the day.
For the first time in my life I felt quite invisible, my universally feared
human form subsumed into that of the African elephant on which I was riding,
for the dogs had no inkling of our presence. All they noticed were the great
grey ghosts padding almost silently past. This magic was to be repeated
again and again during our safari. For almost a week, I became an elephant.
Even giraffes with small calves and notoriously grumpy lone bull buffaloes
allowed us to come much closer than I had believed possible.
Sadly, the only animals it was necessary to avoid were wild elephants and we
had more than our fair share of encounters during our five-day elephant-back
safari from Abu's camp, run by Ker and Downey in Botswana's Okavango Delta.
Generally speaking, distant animals would be easily deterred by the sight of
Randall Moore, the owner of the three riding elephants, Abu, Bennie and
Kathy. He accompanied us on foot and was armed in case of problems. Twice,
though, we were followed. On the first occasion a troubled Kathy repeatedly
sent deep, rumbling growls far into the forest from her vibrating body; on
the second, it needed two shots, fired over the head of a persistent bull,
before he would retreat.
Each of the three adult elephants carried two passengers on its back,
sitting in a mixture of saddle and play-pen with the handler or mahout
riding astride the elephant's neck. From here the animals were controlled
with verbal commands, prods from the bull hook and rewards of cattle nuts.
African elephants are reputed to be impossible to train, being larger and
supposedly of more uncertain temperament than their Indian counterparts.
While Randall Moore has proved this to be a fallacy, I always felt our trip
was conducted on the elephants' terms.
Once, when they worked themselves into a frenzy of fear over a non-existent
danger and finally bolted with us on board, there was little Abu's handler
could do about it, in spite of beating him over the head with the bull hook
until its fibreglass handle shattered, sending the business end spinning
into the undergrowth. The elephants simply came to a halt when they felt it
was safe to do so.
Riding an elephant in these conditions was a little like sitting upstairs in
a silent, invisible, all-terrain, open-top, double-decker bus driven by an
ever hungry, somewhat obstinate and slightly unpredictable eight-year-old
guided by calls and prods from the top deck. They are an ideal form of
transport in the intricate web of sandy islands and shallow, clear waters of
the Okavango, for they are undeterred by all but the thickest thorn scrub
and the view from high on their backs is unsurpassed.
Our expeditions were enlivened by the presence of seven baby elephants, aged
between three and five, orphans of culling operations in Kruger national
park, which turned each outing from a gentle walk into a foray with a gang
of vandals, tearing branches from trees, uprooting grasses and shrubs and
generally leaving a trail of destruction behind.
When we walked along the channels which snake through the delta, the babies
would indulge in serious feeding, snatching succulent rushes as they passed
or pulling down with their small trunks the carefully selected fluffy
seed-heads of reeds.
Although the water is rarely more than 6ft deep, occasional pools exceeded
that, and then the youngsters would completely disappear. First a trunk tip
would come questing above the surface - followed by a little elephant, black
and gleaming, which would bob up before slipping under again.
Now and then a spirit of abandon would overtake the babies and they would
thrash and beat the water with their trunks, throwing spray high into the
air with great exuberance. Once, we came to a small mud wallow and this they
could not resist, falling on to their sides and working their way into the
dark morass, or picking up gouts of mud and tossing them over their backs
and under their bellies.
The activities at Abu's Camp are not restricted to elephant riding, and keen
fishermen may take a mokoro (a canoe punted by a local guide) out on to the
water where the catches can be prolific. Game drives are also on offer, and
one afternoon I escaped with a driver and a safari truck to look for the
wild dogs again.
After a two-hour search, we came across them lying in long grass and stayed
with them as they began to grow increasingly restless, greeting one another
and preparing for an evening's hunt. With the sun sinking in the sky, they
rose as a group and trotted off to look for supper.
Ever the showman, on the last morning Randall Moore found it impossible to
conceal his circus roots and treated us to a whole series of elephant film
stunts, from mock charges to babies crawling through the sand. This,
together with the occasional need to fire over the heads of wild elephants
and the slow acting sedative administered to Kathy after her nervous bolt on
the first day, left me slightly uneasy.
On the other hand, I treasure the memory of riding with a slow, steady
elephant rhythm across a shimmering plain of waving golden grass, studded
here and there with copper-leaved mopane trees and bordered by a frieze of
rustling lala palms, their blue-green foliage making feathery rosettes
against the clear blue sky of the Kalahari winter.
Michael Woods' elephant-back safari was arranged by Twickers World, of 22
Church Street, Twickenham, TW1 3NW, 081-892-7606, and was run from Abu's
Camp in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. The camp has en-suite facilities and
includes such luxuries as a daily laundry service and hot water bottles.
Elephants make unstable platforms for photography, so keen photographers
could combine an elephant-back safari with a stay at one of Ker and Downey's
photographic safari camps in the delta. The winter weather is dry,
pleasantly warm during the day but rather cold at night. Potential elephant
riders should note that they will be required to sign a comprehensive
release form, and agree not to sue, before being allowed to ride. From
London, elephant-back safaris cost from Pounds 3,037 per person for a total
of nine days.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Travel: Merzbacher - the world's weirdest lake / In
Kirghizstan, Giles Whittel buys a motor cycle and goes in search of a lake
famous for its disappearing act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES WHITTEL

<TEXT>
'Welcome to our sunny republic', chirps the poster on dehydration in the
tourist hotel in Urgench, the town with the ugliest name in Uzbekistan. But
Uzbekistan is more than sunny.
IN JUNE, at any rate, it is terrifyingly hot. The heat mugs you the moment
you step out of the shade. To cool down, you have to heat up first by
drinking tea, then sweat. There is often a wind but never a wind chill
factor. It is like being in a fan-assisted oven.
Forgive me, then, for racing through the immortal cities of Bokhara and
Samarkand on a night bus bound for Bishkek, the renamed capital of
neighbouring, and very much cooler, Kirghizstan. I was meant to be slogging
through the desert in the footsteps of an eccentric correspondent of The
Times who walked this way in 1914. But he was tougher or madder than me. For
the time being I had given up.
Russian colonists used to escape the central Asian summer in the mountains
behind Bishkek rather as the British did in Simla. But since the collapse of
the Soviet Union, Kirghizstan's Russians have been returning to the
Motherland in their thousands. Nikolai Shchetnikov, a
geologist-turned-travel-agent with a quiet and efficient manner belied only
by his screw-topped metal briefcase full of vodka, is one of the minority
staying on.
We were watching his video, Holiday in Kirghizstan, in his flat in Bishkek.
An orange helicopter banked steeply over a glacier against a backdrop of
bleakly beautiful mountains. It flew down the glacier past a series of dark
triangular buttresses, each about 3,000ft high. Suddenly, we saw a lake,
filling the mouth of a neighbouring valley, pushing against the flank of the
glacier, studded with icebergs.
'Merzbacher', said Nikolai, and pressed 'pause.' Merzbacher was a German
geographer who penetrated the Central Tien Shan several times early this
century and discovered what may be the world's weirdest lake: 15,000ft up
and extremely remote, the lower Merzbacher lake is held in most of the time
by the second biggest glacier in the CIS. But every summer its ice-plug
melts and in three days of furious gurgling it disappears.
It is hard to get to, but not impossible. Nikolai will take you there on a
16-day trip including high-altitude sightseeing by helicopter and some
trekking for about Pounds 450 excluding travel to and from Bishkek.
I preferred to travel independently as far as possible, so we arranged to
meet at a distant helipad.
To get there, I bought a motorcycle. Throughout the former Soviet Union the
military police and many others ride motorcycles called Urals. Based on a
1946 BMW 650cc machine with spoked wheels and a sidecar, they have
tremendous character but as much oomph as an ill camel. Mine was nearly new
and cost Pounds 200. I called it Ural.
Ural and I were pulled over five minutes into our maiden ride. The
policeman, checking the first English driving licence of his career,
decently ignored the paragraph which says its holder may not ride a
motorcycle. But his finger stopped at the word 'Provisional.'
'Professional, da?'
'Da.' It was the first of countless checks, but the closest any Kirghiz
traffic cop came to speaking English. More often, convinced of alcohol's
warming properties, they would simply offer vodka or 96 per cent pure
spirit.
The road passed another lake, far more famous than Merzbacher. This was
Issyk-Kul, 100 miles long, ringed by snow-capped mountains and fed by 70
rivers (though none, mysteriously, flows out). It is the Lake Geneva in
president Akayev's vision of Kirghizstan as the Switzerland of central Asia.
But it is somehow disappointing. Laurens van der Post wrote in 1966 of
people still living nomadically and hunting with eagles on the shores. They
don't now. Wide-boys and hypochondriacs come from all over the CIS to its
half-built concrete sanatoria. And mafiosi whose poppy-growing is no longer
supported by the regime smoke, disconsolately, tobacco.
Beyond Issyk-Kul, the road turned south up a wide alpine valley and the
weather changed to snow. Herdsmen retreated into round felt tents while
their horses and the great red screes higher up turned white. At the pass,
the arctic-looking Ehan Tengri range came briefly into view, still 100 miles
to the east. Lake Merzbacher was up there somewhere in the ice.
Then the road dived into a long, twisting canyon which ended at an almost
deserted tin-mining town. Nikolai was waiting there with some Spanish
climbers - his only dollar-paying clients of the year - and a cauldron of
ibex stew.
Where central Asia resisted Sovietisation, Islam, not mountains, did the
resisting. In fact, the Russian enforcers of Soviet imperial rule seem to
have relished defying geography in the highest, coldest outposts of their
empire.
Enter the Mi-8, a five-rotored beast of a helicopter. Its orange Aeroflot
paint-job is always streaked with soot from its two deafening turbines. It
was the standard Soviet mountain helicopter for doctors, vets, engineers and
climbers. Now it serves western heliskiers too, at Dollars 400 (Pounds
245.30) an hour. It is king of the wilderness, operating from lonely
roadheads up to a staggering ceiling of over 18,000ft.
We flew 50 miles up the Inylchek glacier with the windows open, landing on
fresh snow amid yawning crevasses an hour's walk from Nikolai's base camp.
The camp faced the awesome north wall of Pik Pobeda, the highest mountain in
the Tien Shan. Behind the tents, a spur of rock rose steeply towards Pik
Maxim Gorky, where some of Nikolai's proteges were in training for a
climbing competition.
Lacking money, Russian climbers pay heavily for their thrills in both lives
and frostbite. Four Siberians from Tomsk were recovering in the camp after a
stormy ascent of Khan Tengri, a legendary marble mountain further up our
side of the glacier which is said to glow pink on fine evenings. It seemed
to take them three days to warm up, sitting like zombies in the dining tent
in all the clothes they owned, picking occasionally at the scabs on their
swollen faces.
During this time I had a go at Ehan Tengri myself, and was a mere vertical
mile from the summit when my heart ('motor' in Russian) had had enough. Then
Nikolai informed me that the three Siberians who could still walk (one had
had part of a big toe removed with a pair of scissors but no anaesthetic)
were to form my escort to Lake Merzbacher.
None of them had been there before, but Nikolai said the route was easy:
descend the main glacier, passing its first three tributaries - glaciers
Dikki, Komsomol and Proletarian Tourist - and camp under Pik Frunze
Technical College. It would take six hours.
We left at 8am and were still going 14 breakneck hours later. By the end I
was gasping like a bad actor and my 'motor' was hurting again. I cursed the
Siberians for being so fit after seeming so nearly dead.
There were three more hours to do next morning to the lake. Within sight of
its icebergs we were stopped by an especially sinister and serpentine
crevasse.
'How much longer?' I asked, unfairly.
'Forty minutes.' The Siberians conferred on how to jump the crevasse. 'No.
Maybe two hours.' We backtracked but still found no way through.
'Is it impossible?' I asked.
'It is possible, but this year . . . maybe two days from here.' Two days to
do a quarter of a mile? We ate some bread and cheese and turned back.
Two days later the lake began to drain. I knew because by that time I was
down near the snout of the glacier trying to take a mineral bath in a hot
spring, but the spring was under 9ft of cold grey water surging angrily
towards China. Here were tens of millions of tons of ex-lake thundering down
an ex-Soviet canyon only to evaporate in a vast and uninhabitable desert,
the dreaded Takla-Makan depression - Mars-on-Earth. It wasn't the lower
Merzbacher itself but it was extraordinary enough, and cooler than
Uzbekistan.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Travel: Walking in the air - Grand Hotel / Lucia Van der
Post concludes our Hotel series with a visit to Reid's in Maderia, a
personal favourite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU COULD, if you were so minded, spend a week or more without ever leaving
the genteel environs of Reid's Hotel, Madeira. There you could move
effortlessly, from room to balcony, from balcony to swimming pool.
You could summon tea, cucumber sandwiches and the ritual Madeira cake, some
freshly-squeezed orange juice or something much more exotic and it would all
come, exactly as you asked.
You could pass your days sitting under the palms or the dragon trees in
among the pelargoniums, the plumbago and the bougainvillaea. You could toy
with the cold buffet by the pool, spend the afternoon pondering the weighty
matter of which of the restaurants you fancied that night.
Should it be casual and informal in the Villa Cliff? Or black tie, posh
frocks, foie gras and a particularly fine Puligny-Montrachet in Les Faunes?
Or, depending whom you are with and why, maybe room service with dinner on
your own balcony overlooking the pool, the palms and black, black night? Ah
. . . decisions, decisions . . .
You could, as I say, idle the days away. But I do not advise it. Cocooned in
comfort, surrounded by fellow sybarites, you would never know that up in the
mountains is another world, a world of mists and clouds, of laurel woods and
forests of eucalpytus and pine, of rivers and banks of flowers. Higher
still, above the forests, there is an open moonscape of grey lava stones and
lonely roads, of scrub and heather, wild bilberries and rocky hills. Here
you can walk and be alone with nothing but you, your companions and this
strange landscape.
We were lucky, we were taken there by Richard Blandy, an old family friend,
whose family owns, among much else, Reid's Hotel. Up we drove from Funchal,
through villages, round bays, past forests, until we came to the start of
one of his favourite walks, alongside a levada, an irrigation channel.
We saw no-one else at all. What we saw were hawks flying high over the
hills, butterflies fluttering among the heather, goats scampering away and
skies that changed from cloudless blue to cotton-woolly mists and back
again.
We walked until it was time to unpack the wine, the Madeira ham and cheeses,
the fruit and the cake and then we walked again . . . all day long. It was a
perfect day.
But, although everybody should be so lucky as to have Richard Blandy as a
companion, it is possible to walk the levadas without him. Buy the classic
book Landscapes of Madeira, by John and Pat Underwood, when you get there.
Once a week Reid's Hotel takes a small group of guests walking, packing an
Edwardian-style picnic for the traditional lunch-time stop. But then Reid's
will make everything easy for you. It will take you to museums, to wine
tastings, to embroidery factories. It will organise barbecues by the pools
and evenings of that rich, mysterious quintessential Portuguese outpouring
of the soul known as Fado.
There is no getting away from it, if you judge a hotel by the company it
keeps then Reid's Hotel moves in the highest circles. Kings and queens,
princes and consorts, counts and pretenders, empresses and film stars have
stayed there. Lingering in the corridors is that indefinable sense that
history gives, a sense of an hotel that believes itself to be the best.
The days have passed since passengers arriving by liner ( . . .'the best
hotel is Mr Reid's' . . . said the London Fortnightly Review) were ushered
ashore. Today the regular shipping lines no longer call but at Funchal
airport there is still the sense that those who are heading for Reid's are
heading for the best.
In the summer I daresay Madeira has its rivals. But in the European winter
Madeira and Reid's come into their own. Where else do you know that is
almost certainly warm, sunny, balmy even, within 3 1/2 hours flying time
from London and involving no jet-lag?
For those who are looking for a trendy, jet-set kind of place, Reid's is not
it. Reid's is quiet, almost sedate . . . but if you are in need of
unfrazzling, it is perfect. GB Airways flies direct to Funchal on Tuesdays
and Saturdays for about Pounds 246 return, depending on the time of year.
Several companies, among them Thomson Holidays and Cadogan Travel offer
inclusive deals which include flights and 7- or 10-day stays. A single room
with a balcony and sea view starts at about Pounds 125 per day.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Food: Treat for the bank manager - Nicholas Lander goes in
search of proper Christmas puddings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUMMER HAS gone and taken with it the tourist trade. The onset of winter
means fewer visits from those who have second homes in the area. What do
restaurants, which have relied on these two sources of income, do to
generate cash-flow through the winter?
Some restaurateurs, such as Rick Stein of the Seafood Restaurant in Padstow,
Cornwall, open a delicatessen with a bakery and wine shop to feed the
locals. Those with smaller overheads lay off staff and hope to weather the
cash-flow crisis that will inevitably be at its worse from January to March.
At the Carved Angel in Dartmouth, Devon they wait for the Dart Regatta to
draw to a close at the end of August. Then they pull out a well-thumbed copy
of Eliza Acton's Modern Cookery for Private Familes, first published in
1855, a large Hobart mixer and a battered steamer and start making Christmas
puddings.
Their total production of 1,000 puddings with, on quiet nights in the
kitchen, two batches going through. Margins are smaller than in the
restaurant but the process does not involve extra overheads or expensive raw
ingredients. More importantly, the large cheques from the shops arrive early
in the New Year to keep the bank manager happy and allow Joyce Molyneaux,
the Carved Angel's widely respected chef-proprietor, to take off for six
weeks rest and relaxation.
Like so many good ideas in the restaurant trade, the making of these
puddings was born out of desperation. Molyneux opened the Carved Angel in
1974 with Tom Jaine, who is today editor of the Good Food Guide. Both had
worked at the Hole in the Wall in Bath, the most innovative British
restaurant in the 1960s and 1970s. She admits today that they displayed
their first menus with a touch of arrogance and merely sat back and waited
for the crowds.
The crowds came, looked but walked on. During the winter of 1974-75 the
restaurant's cash position was critical. It was Jaine who suggested the
puddings, primarily for local customers, and Molyneux who reached for Modern
Cookery.
They quickly found a good London outlet in the David Mellor kitchen shops.
The shops have remained loyal customers in spite of a mouldy pudding, opened
by Mellor, that had gone sour because someone had put too much apple in the
mixture.
The same year also saw the puddings' first export success. Devon is twinned
with Calvados and Jaine joined a delegation of local businessmen on a stand
for the two-week Caen agricultural fair armed with puddings, English fruit
cakes, preserves, lemon curd and Chewton Mendip Cheddar.
In spite of the fact that the French did not understand what was meant by
suet - an essential animal fat ingredient in this recipe - the puddings and
all things Devonian and edible were a success. The margins, however, were
not enough to justify Jaine's expenses - although he spent the two weeks
under canvas - and the people of Caen ate the Carved Angel's puddings only
once more, in 1977.
Molyneux has managed to fit the production of these puddings into the normal
working hours of her commercial kitchen because of the organisational
philosophy she implements. Although she hires cooks and waiting staff with
impeccable professional training, no one is allowed to remain in any one
job. All jobs are interchangeable. The biggest organisational barrier in any
restaurant - the perennial conflict between chef and waiter does not seem to
exist here - and to symbolise this the Carved Angel has no swing door
between the kitchen and the dining room.
So, from early September, as the evening service is coming to an end, one
member of the kitchen staff, possibly from the pastry section or the person
on the cold starters, will assemble all the 15 ingredients and make the
mixture.
Then, using a flavourless nut oil, they grease 12 plain 2lb pudding bowls
(with which, after Christmas, you can make steak and kidney puddings or
pigeon pies), and fill them with the mixture, finally wrapping them in foil.
The puddings are then loaded into two steamer trays and await the maestro's
touch.
This comes at about 5am or 6am the following morning when Molyneux goes
downstairs for a cup of tea. She then puts the steamer across two gas
burners and the puddings on to cook.
They are ready by midday, conveniently just before the lunch service. When
next there is a lull in the service these puddings will be checked, cleaned,
wrapped in calico, tied and labelled. They are stored upstairs until ordered
by shops.
Molyneux admits to one change from Acton's original recipe - the addition of
crystallized ginger, of which she is very fond.
Although the making of these puddings is now on such a scale that it could
not possibly permit the personal washing and pipping of dried fruit such as
muscatels or the grating of butcher's suet, they do retain the essential
ingredient which initially attracted Molyneux to the recipe - its lightness.
This is not generally thought of as a Victorian quality but, as Molyneux,
puts it: 'Bully for Eliza Acton]'
The Carved Angel's Christmas puddings are priced at Pounds 7.95 from: David
Mellor Shops London SW1 (tel: 071-730-4259), SE1 (407-7593) and in
Manchester (061-834-7023); Clarke's London W8 (221-9225), Villandry W1
(224-3799), Sonny's SW13 (081-748-0393) and locally from the restaurant, 2
South Embankment, Dartmouth, south Devon, (0803-832465).

FT  14 NOV 92 / Food: Christmas with Uncle Sam - A look at some US food
favourites obtainable by mail order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITONS in search of American foods for the holidays, to give as gifts or
serve on their own tables, are in luck this year.
Technology is making it easier and faster to mail-order food from the US,
and there is a widening variety of mail-order companies from which to
choose. But Britons' best and easiest source for American foods this holiday
season is Harrods, which has chosen 'Christmas in New England' as the theme
of its annual holiday promotion.
Housewares, furniture, clothing, accessories, toys, as well as food products
from the New England states of Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont,
Massachusetts, Maine, and New Hampshire are featured.
Harrods has constructed a 5,000 sq ft New England-style village and a
miniature version of Boston's historic freedom trail, for children in its
Knightsbridge store.
Harrods worked with the Massachusetts Port Authority to locate not only
well-known companies such as Ocean Spray cranberry products, Cross Pens and
Dexter shoes, but US cottage industries. (There really is a Dave, for
example, behind 'Uncle Dave's Vermont-Made' sauces and cocktail mixes.) All
the food products usually associated with New England are available at
Harrods including tinned Boston baked beans and Vermont maple, blueberry,
raspberry, and boysenberry syrups. New England's famous seafood is
represented by Olde Cape Cod's tinned soups, chowders and bisques, as well
as fresh clam chowder made from Boston-based Legal Seafood Restaurant's
recipe.
New England's reputation as a source for homemade sauces and spreadable
products is growing in the US. Among those available at Harrods are
Underwood barbecue sauces, Atwood and Cooke's honey-cinnamon,
chocolate-raspberry, and banana flavoured peanut butters, and Gourmet
Products' corn relish and honey mustard sauces.
Specialty sweets on offer include Lake Champlain Chocolates from Vermont,
Renee's Vermont Buttercrunch candies (toffee centres dipped in chocolate and
rolled in nuts), and lobster-shaped chocolate lollies from Massachusetts'
VIP Sweets.
Harrods Food Hall has long been a mecca for homesick Americans in search of
familiar food products, and many essential components to American holiday
dinners can be found there: fresh cranberries for cranberry sauce, pink and
yellow fleshed sweet potatoes, and home baking ingredients including tinned
pumpkin (a 16 oz tin is Pounds 1.60), Karo brand corn syrup (16 oz jar,
Pounds 3.05), and whole pecans for pecan pie. For those who prefer their
baking done for them, Harrods' patisserie has fresh-baked pecan pies (Pounds
6.50 for a six-portion pie).
Selfridge's Food Hall, Fortnum and Mason, Partridge's in Sloane Street,
Hampstead Food Halls and Cullen's food stores throughout London are also
well-stocked with American food products.
Many American food companies will ship their products. Credit cards, fax
machines and express mail services expedite mail orders, but it is important
to order as soon as possible given the holiday rush.
Overseas shipping charges are heavy, sometimes doubling the purchase price,
and make sure to inquire about duty and taxes before placing your order, as
they do add additional costs.
Pepperidge Farm makes some of America's most popular cookies and crackers;
Pepperidge Farm's Goldfish crackers are the quintessential American snack
food, served at superior cocktail parties and collegiate beer bashes alike.
Some Pepperidge Farm products are available at Harrods.
A selection of cookies, nuts, chocolates, snack mixes and crackers, many in
decorated tins and gift boxes, can be mailed to Britain from Pepperidge
Farms' Connecticut HQ.
Fruit cake is an American holiday standby - the ultimate 'you either love it
or hate it' food. Quips about there only being 10 fruit cakes in America,
constantly handed on every holiday season but never eaten, are as common as
mother-in-law jokes, but there are as many people who find the chewy
nut-and-preserved-fruit concoctions (denser, less boozy versions of
Christmas pudding) delicious.
Fruit cakes, although not particularly easy to transport, do have good
keeping qualities. A good source is the Collin Street Bakery in Corsicana,
Texas, which has specialised in mail-order pecan fruit cake for 96 years.
Also familiar to Americans are Oregon-based Harry and David's gift baskets
of fresh and dried fruit, cheeses, sausage, and sweets.
Many of Harry and David's products can be shipped to Britain - cakes,
candies, preserves, and even a vacuum-packed north-west smoked salmon
(Pounds 26 for a 1lb 4oz portion, plus 30 per cent shipping charge).
Freeport, Maine's LL Bean, which has raised catalogue sales to a high art,
ships New England-style foods including muffins, pancakes, bread mixes,
syrups and honey products. Using Federal Express, LL Bean can rush orders to
Britain in two weeks - regular air mail takes a month.

Farm's deadline for shipments to Britain is December 4; for shipments within

FT  14 NOV 92 / Sport: The prodigy returns to say his farewell - Rugby Union
/ John Hopkins recalls the young Botha and anticipates seeing him play again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE afternoon a dozen years ago, a photographer and I drove in a pick-up
truck to an appointment in Pretoria, South Africa.
The truck was the only vehicle we could rent in the dorp, or two-horse town,
of Potchefstroom where we were staying while accompanying the 1980 British
Lions on their tour of the Republic.
Our rendezvous was with one of the most important men in South Africa. His
name was Botha, a normal-enough surname in the capital city and the seat of
government. It was not PW, the prime minister, nor Piet, the foreign
minister. It was Hendrik Egnatius Botha, otherwise known as Naas, South
Africa's new find at stand-off.
Naas Botha was a prodigy in 1980, the great white hope of South African
rugby. He had first played for his country a few months earlier in a Test
series against the Argentinians and made his name with some prodigious
kicking. Though he was under 6 ft and weighed less than 11 stone, he could
punt, drop and place-kick a ball ten or 15 yards further than anyone else.
Distances of 65 yards were commonplace, 70 yards not exceptional, 75 yards
not unheard of. Even in the rarified atmosphere of the veldt, this was big
kicking, as beefy as, and even more accurate than, the New Zealander, Don
Clarke, 30 years earlier.
But it was not just that Botha was extraordinarily long and uncannily
accurate. Starting in that Test series against the Argentinians and refining
it against the 1980 British Lions, Botha re-invented the drop goal as a
scoring ploy.
He dropped three goals in one Test against the Argentinians, a world record.
It did not matter that he could kick only with his right foot. He was so
quick on his feet that he was capable of dropping a goal from anywhere in
the opposition's half.
Twelve years ago Botha's voice was firm, his handshake soft, his manner
confident, his English mangled. Sitting in his parents' house he spoke of
his two greatest heroes, Frik du Preez, the Springbok second row forward,
and Welshman Phil Bennett: 'Frik were a character in South African rugby and
Phil is the best fly half I have ever saw,' he said before scooping up half
a dozen balls and going out to practise.
Then he was beginning his career as a Springbok. He was just 22. Now he is
at the end of it, captaining the Springboks against England at Twickenham
this afternoon.
In between, Botha spent ten years out of international rugby. That 1980 tour
was the last visit by the British Lions before South Africa was cast into
the wilderness by the UN ban on sporting links. For a decade Botha's only
appearances for his country were half a dozen games against artificial,
sanction-breaking teams. He flirted with American football as a specialist
kicker, played five seasons for Rovigo in Italian rugby and, all the while,
remained the pin-up boy for Northern Transvaal, the heartland of the
Afrikaaner's laager. He has scored 306 points in international rugby,
including 18 dropped goals.
Now his face is fuller, his manner more defensive. His kicking remains
prodigiously long but criticism of his reluctance to tackle, to do anything
but kick, has taken a toll.
This afternoon's game will almost certainly be the last Botha plays for his
country. The career that began in Pretoria early in 1980 will end on the
most famous rugby ground in the world at tea-time today. Form points to
victory by England yet the speed with which the South Africans have
recovered from their ten years of sporting isolation suggests the match will
be close.
'For a side that has been out of action for ten years, they have done
remarkably well,' says Don Rutherford, the Rugby Football Union's technical
adviser. 'Had we (England) been out of international rugby for that length
of time we would not have become so good so quick.'
Roger Uttley, formerly the England coach, spent a month in the republic last
summer coaching rugby at Stellenbosch University. 'What I thought then was
that though they had some talented footballers, they lacked a sense of
purpose. Their isolation had led to rivalries and they had to learn to play
cohesively again. They were very set-piece oriented. There wasn't a lot of
system. They applied pressure, won the ball and gave it to Botha to kick the
leather off it.
'Physically they are big and strong but they lack the modern techniques for
recycling the ball and they do not have the levels of fitness that are
necessary to play today's dynamic rugby.'
When South Africa were well-beaten in the second Test by France last month,
it seemed as though they still had a lot to learn. But since arriving in
England, the Springboks have improved beyond measure. They are happier
because they can speak the language. The French quartered them in noisy
hotels and gave them liaison officers who spoke little English. By contrast,
the RFU have made their visitors feel welcome.
In this improved atmosphere the South Africans have worked on their
weaknesses. The result was convincing victories over the Midlands and North
divisions without a try being scored against them and a thrilling, though
not emphatic, victory over England B at Bristol a week ago.
'If we (in Britain) are as strong as we think we are then the Midlands
should have been able to take care of the Springboks,' said Uttley. 'That
victory was comprehensive even allowing for the new points structure. What
we saw then was that if you allow the Springboks to move the ball wide, they
can wreak havoc. Give them space and they will knock holes in any defence.
They are very competitive and very strong.'
Twelve years ago Botha explained how important it was to adopt a routine for
kicking and to stick to it. He always put the ball down the same way with
the seam pointing at the target, he said, and he was very precise in his
movements. He kept his head down, swung his right foot back slowly and then
followed through smoothly.
It worked then as it works now. Watch him this afternoon. He is a master of
this particular art and you will not see many better.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Sport: Amateurs who learnt how to mutiny - Sailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THEY CALL it port-rot. Too much time alongside the harbour wall rots men and
ships, say the old salts. The 10 yachts of the British Steel challenge leave
Rio tomorrow on the next leg of their round-the-world race. For most of the
140 sailors it cannot come too soon.
Seven weeks ago the fleet sailed out of the Solent, crewed by enthusiastic
amateurs. After 5,000 miles of racing these doctors, managers and firemen
now hang around the waterfront bars with the authentic mien of deep-sea boat
bums. All agree they have changed as people.
At Easter this year I visited the newly launched Heath Insured, sponsored by
the eponymous City brokerage. Snug in Brixham marina the crew were strangers
to one another; the voyage ahead of them merely words in Chay Blyth's
brochure. All they had in common was a willingness to spend Pounds 15,000
and the courage to walk away from ordinary life for nearly a year.
This week, sail-testing in the shadow of Sugar Loaf mountain, Heath's crew
had more about them than just deep suntans. Coming third in a highly
competitive leg had hardened them up and made them realise they had signed
on for a race rather than just a physically challenging round-the-world
cruise.
'A lot of the crew's personalities were not the same after a few weeks at
sea,' said Lisa-Marie Wood, in normal life a superintendent of a Cambridge
nursing home. 'We weren't as caring of one another. We shouted, and Pleases
and Thank Yous disappeared.
'I lost my temper and flew at someone for the first time in 14 years. I
couldn't bring myself to say sorry the next morning. It wasn't until we got
to sea that I felt how much everyone on board, especially our skipper,
wanted to win this thing.'
Blyth is himself surprised at how intense the competitive ethos has become.
'We thought we were putting together a round-the-world adventure, within the
structure of a race,' he observed in the Yacht Club Rio de Janeiro. 'With
hindsight we might have put in a few more controls to keep the pressure,
both from sponsors and internally, at bay.'
Adrian Donovan, skipper of Heath Insured, is experienced both in the charter
and racing world. He is accustomed to having paying guests aboard; surprised
at what happens when they start wanting to win.
'They could all sail to a greater or lesser extent when we started this
leg,' said Donovan. 'What they've acquired is the focus to race hard with
total concentration for weeks on end. I probably didn't steer for a total of
five hours out of the five weeks at sea.
'One of our crew, Bill Vincent, is the most placid man you could meet. But
when another yacht would look like catching us he would glare at it with
total hatred for minutes at a time. The Vincent Glare is now a legend on the
boat; we summon it up like voodoo.'
The sub-plot running along the Rio waterfront this week has been the 7,000
miles of sailing between here and Hobart. Every crewman will tell you he
knows dozens of others who are deeply apprehensive about facing nearly eight
weeks in the freezing cold and rough seas of the Southern Ocean.
As far as Cape Horn the leg is likely to be a gentle broad reach, with the
yachts able to fly their new asymmetric spinnakers. Once they turn to the
west the average wind speeds will creep towards 35 knots, with steady
oncoming 60 ft rollers. On deck it will be cold and nasty; down below far
worse. One briefing for the crews described it thus:
'Imagine standing outdoors for four hours in a thunder storm on a very cold
day. Rain is sheeting down. Every 30 seconds someone throws a bucket of
water over you. Even in oilskins and wellies you are going to get very wet
indeed.
'After four hours on watch you will be allowed to rest in the coldest room
in a small cramped building nearby, and then back outside for another four
hours of wetness. Oh, and it will be dark for much of the time.'
Perhaps surprisingly the dropout rate after one leg has been tiny. The
heaviest casualties have been among the 10 skippers; all professionals hired
by Blyth to lead from the front. In the past eight weeks one has been fired
and two quit for 'personal reasons'. It has begun to resemble a nautical
Agatha Christie novel.
'We'd prefer to have had 10 skippers start and the same 10 finish,' admitted
Blyth. 'Perhaps we should have had them in place even earlier. It's our
mistake as organisers if things do go wrong in that area.
'However, the fact that we've only had one crew member quit is amazing.
Remember these aren't yachties; they've got stuff back at the ranch; wives,
families, businesses.'
Blyth mentioned one crew-member, self-employed as many of them are, with a
business in possible terminal trouble back in the UK. 'He's agonising about
whether to go back or keep on with the race,' he said.
The most recent skipper to arrive is Devon yachtsman Peter Phillips, charged
with the task of gingering up a demoralised Rhone-Poulenc crew who have had
two skippers in just over a month. 'They're about to learn that this isn't a
nice game,' said Phillips. 'If anyone gets off this boat in Hobart it isn't
going to be me.'
Meanwhile, aboard the calm and well-scrubbed Heath Insured, Adrian Donovan
was about to take some sponsor's guests - Peruvian insurance executives -
for a sail around Copacabana Bay. 'I look at some of these boats and wonder
if they've got it in them to battle on,' he mused.
Chay Blyth designed the Challenge as 10 identical boats racing around the
world. Already the immutable facts of human nature are showing that, as
Orwell wrote, some are more equal than others.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Motoring: High marks from the high heeled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CARS ARE often categorised. A purple metallic Ford Escort or VW Golf
cabriolet is a hairdresser's car; a Porsche 911 a yuppy's car (whatever
happened to yuppies?); a Nissan 200SX a florist's car; a Volvo 340, Honda
Civic, Nissan Sunny or Toyota Starlet a pensioner's car.
Yes, it is unfair. But life is unfair, to motor manufacturers as it is to
everyone else. The biggest category of all, though, into which many a car is
dismissively consigned, is that of the woman's car.
But what is a woman's car? Is there really such a thing? Or is it a mythical
concept, put about by men fighting a rearguard action against what they
perceive as a female assault on a male bastion? And I must make the point
that those who use the term 'woman's car' pejoratively often reckon any car
taking longer than eight seconds to hit 60 mph (96 kmh) from a standstill is
a mechanised shopping trolley - and a fairly arthritic one at that.
When I say I have been researching what makes an ideal woman's car, I really
mean that I have asked my wife. She is not a typical woman motorist in that
she drives more cars each year than most people do in a lifetime. But this,
I would argue, makes her better qualified than the woman who has driven
nothing but Minis since passing her test in one 30 years ago. (Yes, they
really exist).
So, what features would the thinking woman driver expect of a car?
First comes reliability, because women have good reason to fear the danger
as well as the inconvenience of a roadside breakdown. Next is safety. The
car must feel and be strong. There must be good all-round visibility from
the driving seat. Windscreen pillars must not be too obstructive. There
should be see-through rear quarters. A rear window wipe/wash system is
useful on a saloon, essential on an estate or hatchback.
Ideally, the car will have anti-lock brakes and the ride will be fairly firm
for confident handling. Power steering is essential, automatic transmission
desirable. The turning circle should be small.
Seats should be soft and cloth-trimmed and the outside mirrors adjustable
from inside the car. Controls must be light with all the minor ones as near
the steering wheel as possible. I am told a treadle-type accelerator pedal
makes driving in high-heeled shoes much easier.
Other female desirables are a good-sized lockable glove box, door panniers
and net pockets for maps in the front seat backs. ('I cannot', says my wife,
'bear loose things moving around on the seats or floor'). The boot must be
as large as possible, with a flat sill to make it easy to lift things into.
Four wide-opening doors are preferred to only two. In any case, they must
have strong stays to keep them open - 'I want to get in and out of a car
parked on a steep camber without fear of having my legs amputated.'
Nothing should reflect in the windscreen; there should be an interior
release for tailgate and fuel filler flap and the filler cap must be easy to
take off and replace. ('On some cars, they have been so stiff and awkward
that only a gorilla could have managed them without a struggle').
The car must be nippy enough for quick, safe overtaking. Statistics
promising neck-jerking standing-starts and licence-losing maximum speeds cut
little ice with women drivers. Excess muscularity comes a poor second to
perceived strength and safety - and the car must still have reasonable value
at trade-in time.
So what might be a typical 1992 woman's car? The latest Pounds 10,995
Daihatsu Applause 1.6GXi that my wife and I are now taking it in turns to
use gets her approving nod on most counts.
True, it does not have a treadle-type accelerator and the door stays could
be stronger. But the 16-valve, 105 horsepower engine is lively, even if it
becomes a bit buzzy when cruising on a motorway, and the five-speed gearbox
and clutch are light.
It has central locking, power-operated windows and door mirrors and - most
unusually - front and rear seats that recline. Around 40 mpg (7.06 l/100 km)
is achievable on a journey. Tailgate and fuel flap are released from the
driving seat and the filler cap is as easy to manage as the top of an
instant coffee jar.
The seats are nice and squashy, the boot huge and low silled. Although it
looks like a four-door saloon, the Applause is really a hatchback and, yes,
the back window which lifts with the boot lid has a wash-wipe. It is about
as exciting as a food processor, but just as useful. And it comes with a
three-year unlimited mileage warranty.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Fashion: As the Suits crumple the creative Jackets take over
at the top - A look at a welcome change in fashion for the business elite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL KEERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Private Eye, the satirical magazine, launched a cartoon called The
Suits, you knew that the tide had really begun to turn. Now, it is The
Jackets who are making the most creative business decisions.
In the late 1980s, the classic suit became the symbol for every kind of
professional achievement. Both style and status were captured in the
designer interpretations of the traditional City two-piece. But now that
finance no longer has its gung-ho image, the suit is a symbol of the drab
money men who come and pore over the books - men for whom the word cut has
more to do with costs than clothing.
To describe someone as 'a suit' is an insult. And so, creative professionals
have been turning away from the suit, towards combinations of jackets and
trousers for business wear. From Jasper Conran's jackets in vivid orange and
acid green, to Marks &amp; Spencer's range of soft, woollen mouflon jackets in
rich colours from blue to raspberry, menswear right across the design
spectrum is turning its attention back towards jackets - and for business
rather than pleasure. The suit is no longer the be-all and end-all of the
professional wardrobe.
In September, Dunhill presented to the press their new menswear range. Alan
Duddle has been brought in as director of merchandise to bring the label
into line with the 1990s. And as part of his strategy, he explained, the
company's range of suits was being ignored for the time being. Instead, the
energy was going into developing the separates, the jackets and trousers
which have traditionally been reserved for weekend wear.
He explained that 'The suit is a required portion, but no longer a pivotal
portion, of a man's wardrobe.'
Just two autumns ago, Anthony Bottomley, managing director of Hermes GB,
presented a menswear collection which contained no suits at all. 'It
reflects,' he said 'the increased Europeanisation of our dress sense.'
And at the same time, Burberry's similarly acknowledged that 'the blazer and
slacks have been accepted in the office on the continent for more than ten
years, and it could catch on in the UK. We are certainly selling more
blazers than before.'
If the Italians were the biggest continental influence on the suited look of
the 1980s, then the French have more responsibility for the rise of the
1990s separates. For years, Frenchmen have done business in sports jackets
and trousers, wearing in the boardroom a look which the English would
reserve for the bar room.
Not, of course, the heavy tweed jackets of the English country weekend;
rather, jackets in cashmere and linen, with subtle patterns and checks, or
in plain but rich and sophisticated colours. It is this style of jacket
which is being accepted as business dress in advertising, architecture,
retailing and design - the creative professions which always spearhead
changes in the executive dress code.
In response, companies like Dunhill and Hermes are putting their energies
into jackets rather than suits. Hugo Boss, the designer label responsible
for many of the sharp-shouldered suits of the 1980s have switched their
advertising images to portray men in relaxed jackets instead. George Bush
was prepared to make policy statements in his Kennebunkport wardrobe of
preppy sports jackets, worn over cotton chino trousers.
The English sports jacket emerged in the 1920s. As the lounge suit began to
replace formal, morning dress as proper professional attire, the tweed
jacket worn with flannels became its casual counterpart. It was a sign of
status to have a separate jacket for 'sports' with its suggestion of a
country estate on which to pursue them.
That is why, to the Englishman, the jacket has always been a country item,
out of place in business. And its colours and patterns have been
predominantly those of the country.
But the French, in spite of their fascination with le style Anglais, never
relegated the jacket to the countryside. In Paris, the jacket retains the
metropolitan chic of the intellectuals and creative types who wear it.
Jackets, or blazers, with separate trousers, are acceptable business dress
in all but the most formal French professions. And the concept is spreading.
Bernard Lanvin, who works most days in a cashmere blazer, explained his look
to Americans when he took on Lanvin, the US wing of his family's designer
label.
'Whereas I have suits for specific occasions,' he said, 'my blazers are for
the office, for travelling and for the country.' (He did not elucidate on
the specific occasions which that did not cover.)
Hermes designer Veronique Nichanian was more direct. 'You don't need to wear
a suit to look smart,' she declared.
Combining separates does give men a greater opportunity to combine colours
and patterns in an individual way. 'People's personality comes through
more,' insists Duddle. 'Business dressing today is much more about enjoyment
and about putting different things together in a personal way. The days of
every man looking like a clone have gone.'
Which does make dressing a little more difficult. Gone may be the simple
choice of a plain, dark suit each morning. The US financier Ivan Boesky wore
a black, three- piece suit with a white shirt to his office every day. Asked
why it never varied, he replied 'I have enough decisions in my life
already.)
Of course, if you are wearing separates for business, you do have to wear
them with the formal accoutrements, the proper shirt, tie and shoes, that
would accompany a suit.
Mark McCormack, the sports agent, often wears a sports jacket as opposed to
a suit, but with a formal shirt and classic tie. He recalls correcting
another executive who matched a blazer with grey slacks and an open silk
shirt. 'Many of our clients are in their twenties, and many of them,
particularly the tennis players, show up for meetings dressed casually. But
many of these 20-year-olds are also millionaires, and we handle their money.
'They want our executives to look more like bankers than like tennis players
 -even nicely dressed ones.'

FT  14 NOV 92 / Fashion: Stocking up on accessories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN you hang up your stocking for Santa this year, make sure it is a matt,
black, opaque one. Into such a voguish receptacle the modern Father
Christmas (wearing red biker's leathers trimmed with white fake fur and
riding a Harley Davidson instead of a reindeer sleigh) will be unable to
resist pouring all your accessory requests.
With many women exercising a strict moratorium on serious fashion buys, this
year it is the essential accessory or inexpensive basic item that updates
your wardrobe and most of them are not too pricy for the present list.
Start with jodhpurs - although you may need a pillowcase rather than a
stocking if that is what you really want.
Jodhpurs are this year's advance on leggings to go with last winter's
comfortable loose sweater or shirt, but also good with dandy-style
equestrian jackets. Best in basic black, they are Pounds 49.95 by Huntsman
from Fenwick, Pounds 29.99 at Stirling Cooper and from Pounds 19.99 to
Pounds 34.99 at Miss Selfridge.
Black leather jeans are every designer collection's must-have, but Top
Shop's are only Pounds 59.99, Miss Selfridge's Pounds 69.99.
The new long-skirted or slim-trousered silhouette demands a new shoe shape,
with more of a heel, perhaps a slight platform (do not overdo it unless you
think Minnie Mouse is elegant) and a higher cut such as lace-up or
elastic-sided ankle boot.
Red or Dead's styles in this vein go from Pounds 60, Pied-a-Terre's from
Pounds 39 to Pounds 99 and Russell and Bromley have wonderful long-toed
lace-up ankle-boots for Pounds 95.50.
Bored with the plain white shirt that has gone under your suit jacket for
the past three seasons? Then abandon the jacket and try a cobwebby black
crochet waistcoat as the first salvo in the 1970s fashion war.
Costing Pounds 25 at Miss Selfridge, and Pounds 24.99 at Top Shop, the black
crochet will also see you through party evenings over velvet or chiffon.
Printed waistcoats are a big part of the dandy look for women and men - from
Pounds 25 at Marks and Spencer to Pounds 59 and Pounds 99 (this one in silk)
at Fenwick.
Another variant on the white shirt is an old-fashioned men's white silk
evening scarf (from antique shops or new version at Fenwick, Pounds 19.95)
tied stock-style on the neck. Newest in scarves, and a pointer for next
spring, is the long, 1920s style, in shimmery pale printed panne velvet,
Pounds 69, or soft plain silk with contrast border, Pounds 85, from Georgina
von Etzdorf (who can match the print in ties and scarves for your man).

FT  14 NOV 92 / As they say in Europe: Pick your sides; peasant or cop -
James Morgan is reminded of a confrontation outside a pub
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK I was reminded of an incident of some 20 years ago when I emerged
from a south London pub with a friend of Irish ancestry at 11pm. He went up
to a policeman a few feet away and asked what he was doing. The policeman
said he was checking that customers left the pub on time.
My friend detected a Belfast accent and replied, 'It's a free country over
here you know. We can't have any of your police state customs in London.'
I stole off into the night but was later reprimanded by my friend for having
left him in the lurch. 'I would have stood by you if you had been in
trouble,' he said.
Thus the French papers turned on their partners, especially Germany, for
having left France in the lurch over the Gatt row.
France-Soir had a cartoon showing Germany and Britain, supporting the
world's policeman, the US, by stabbing France in the back.
In Le Figaro Alain Peyrefitte, a prominent peasant worshipper, criticised
his government's weakness: 'Why did we wait so long to show our partners
that France attaches an essential importance to the need for the
indispensable compromise not to damage our agriculture? Why did the
Community give way in advance to American demands without having received
anything in exchange?'
The view that the French have been excessively diffident in the defence of
their interests is not one that finds much of an echo elsewhere. But it is
Jacques Delors, and his supposed dedication to the interests of his
motherland, who has become the target of an upsurge of anti-French
sentiment. Handelsblatt of Dusseldorf wrote, 'It is extraordinary that
Delors, one of the leading campaigners for European integration, should bear
the main responsibility for the biggest crisis the Community has yet faced.'
The Paris correspondent of the Borsen-Zeitung said Delors was among the
losers of the present row. Jorg Foshag shared the British view that the
EC-President was putting his ambition to become President of France ahead of
European interests.
Politiken of Copenhagen sounded even more British: 'If, in a kindergarten,
one small bullying child is intent on dominating other children, causing
trouble with other classes, sabotaging unity and able to see things from
only one perspective, the good teacher enters the fray and makes that child
behave. But that does not happen in the European Community. No, we are not
talking about Denmark, but France . . .'
But is it the British, the Danes or the French who are the most unpopular in
the Community today? The Dutch business paper NRC- Handelsblad ran two
editorials on this disruptive trio in tandem.
The first concluded: 'France has done everything it can to torpedo an
agricultural agreement with the United States. In France agrarian and
anti-American sentiments go hand in hand.'
The second consisted of a critical account of how British domestic politics
had damaged the process of Maastricht ratification and asked if the majority
'really want - if they wish to save the Union - to pull the Community from
the downward spiral into which it has fallen because of the Danes and
British.'
In southern Europe, there was less fury but what there was was directed at
Britain. The delay in ratifying the treaty became the main international
headline in the Madrid paper, ABC on Tuesday. The paper's Brussels
correspondent, Francisco de Andres said the promise of the British foreign
secretary, Douglas Hurd, that the Edinburgh summit would clear up
outstanding questions would no t allay the fears of Britain's partners, 'Nor
would the platitude 'better late than never,' which refers implicitly to the
delaying agreement reached with the 'Eurosceptic' wing of the party, and
which is the only way of assuring that Britain will ratify Maastricht in its
present form.'
On the other hand the British believe they have made a new friend this week.
President Yeltsin's welcome was about as lavish as any such occasion could
be. But the Moscow press looked coolly at the event.
I make no apology for ending this column yet again with Komsomolskaya
Pravda: that one-time organ of the communist youth organisation combines
limpid prose with lateral thinking in an unusual manner.
'London streets saw no-one rejoicing at the Russian president's arrival in
Britain. And the press reported the visit in quite moderate terms . . .
Yeltsin definitely managed to produce a favourable impression on the British
MPs even though he overdid his thesis on the collapse of communism. But then
the British were putting too much stress on Yeltsin's heroic ascent of the
famous August 1991 tank.'
The president is not quite the hero in Moscow that he is in London. But that
is nothing new.

FT  14 NOV 92 / How To Spend It: From Scotland to Nepal . . . a catalogue of

goodies from the National Trust, Lucia van der Post has been searching the
Christmas brochures for interesting and attractive presents for the entire
family

CHRISTMAS is coming and the thud of catalogues landing on the doormat is
getting louder. If you feel you are still busy enough with your
non-Christmas shopping (it was the writer Keith Waterhouse who first noticed
that long before December he could not buy a thing that wasn't gift-wrapped
or topped with holly) try and remember what it was like last year . . . and
probably the year before that. Hectic, was it? Lists blank, mind blanker?
Take heart. With this week's How To Spend It guide in one hand, a drink in
the other, you can do it all from the peace and comfort of your armchair.
The General Trading Company, 144 Sloane Street, London SW1X 9BL. Tel:
071-730-0411. Pounds 1.
As always, beautifully presented, lots of full colour pages and almost
everything is tasteful. The company seems to have made a real effort to
present lots of ideas at Pounds 20 - blue-rimmed glasses from Mexico at
Pounds 5.90 a time, plain initialled tumblers at Pounds 7.55 a time, scented
candles in frosted glass containers at Pounds 5.75 and a really pretty sauce
ladle with a fruit and leaf embossed bowl for Pounds 10.75. Those who fancy
spending more will have no trouble - a soft, wool, blue and white, checked
Welsh blanket is Pounds 106, some pretty nightshirts, Pounds 47 and a
charming doorstop, a teddy bear copied from a Victorian original, Pounds 72.
Past Times, Witney, Oxfordshire OX8 6BH. Tel: 0993-779339.
Filled, as you might expect, with nostalgia - Victorian chocolate coins for
stockings (ten for Pounds 4.95), Dickensian advent calendars (Pounds 2.95),
Florentine crackers (Pounds 14.95 for six). An original copy of The Times on
any day of your choice since 1900 will cost you Pounds 19.95, the Chatsworth
trays are pretty and just Pounds 10.95 each.
Barclay &amp; Bodie, 7-9 Blenheim Terrace, London NW8 OEH. Tel: 071-372-5705.
Pounds 2.
Relatively new to the catalogue scene, Barclay &amp; Bodie is an enchanting shop
filled with seductive ideas for the house. Plain dark green pin board is
Pounds 43 for a small size, Pounds 54 for large. A neat little device for
measuring the height of the tennis net (vital now that the heads of racquets
are so big) at Pounds 14.95 would make a good stocking present. For bridge
fanatics there is a wildly extravagant (but beautiful) hand-embroidered
bridge cloth (Pounds 395), padded and frilled needlework baskets at Pounds
25 and some exceptionally pretty hand-embroidered, lace-trimmed cotton guest
towels (Pounds 24.50).
The V &amp; A Museum Catalogue, Freepost SU361, Dept. 5316, Hendon Road,
Sunderland, SR9 9AD.
Lots of lovely things, in particular jewellery - faux pearl earrings with a
pearl and bow brooch, (Pounds 29.95 for the brooch, Pounds 24.95 for the
earrings but just Pounds 46.90 if you buy both). Faux pearl earrings with a
twisted gold-plate setting (Pounds 14.95) and a charming rhinestone,
silver-plated copper and lilac enamel brooch and earrings (Pounds 22.50 for
the brooch, Pounds 24.95 for the earrings) and a beautiful Etruscan style
jasper and jade necklace (Pounds 75). Then there are some classically styled
verdigris candlesticks, Pounds 19.95 the pair, a small but good selection of
children's toys (nice old-fashioned drum and top, a jack-in-the-box, a penny
whistle and a series of wooden nesting cats). There is a really beautiful
hand-quilted patchwork bed cover - a copy of a 19th century ring design with
a scalloped edge. All in pure cotton, it costs Pounds 199. An innovation
this year is the introduction of 48-hour delivery (Pounds 6.50 extra
though]) and fax ordering services.
The Royal Academy of Arts Gift Catalogue, Royal Academy Enterprises, 8 Forge
Court, Reading Road, Yately, Camberley GU17 7RX. Pounds 1.
For those who are tired of nostalgia, this catalogue is a splendid antidote
 -resolutely contemporary images appear on plates, jugs, scarves, mugs, many
by eminent names such as ike Michael Rothenstein (who has embellished a jug,
a plate and a scarf), Hugh Casson, Paul Hogarth and Michael Kenny.
Influenced by the Tibet exhibition at the academy there are some really
enchanting papaier mache bowls (Pounds 14.95 embellished with an elephant or
a horse, Indian miniature-style). There is a good selection for the cook and
a small selection of stationery, all beautifully designed.
Scotts of Stow, Admail 222, The Square, Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucs. GL54 1AF.
This is the catalogue for presents for the cook - from simple things such as
a plain white French-style soup tureen and soup bowls to a set of stainless
steel copper-based saucepan, to more esoteric gadgets like the Atlas Pasta
Machine and Le Saucier (an automatic sauce maker). If you are looking for
small things there is the Robert Welch Garlic Press (all sturdy cast-iron,
green, red or white, Pounds 14.95), the Parmesan cheese mill (Pounds 14.95),
Robert Welch's cast-iron salt and pepper mills, (Pounds 16.95 each).
Shaker, 25 Harcourt Street, London W1H 1DT. Tel: 071-724-7672.
If you like Shaker-style then this slim leaflet lists most of what is on
offer. New this year are some pure cotton throws - choose from Bear Paw
Throw in navy and cream or red and cream or the Lovers Knot Throw (both
Pounds 47.95) or the Country Friendship Throw in cranberry, navy and cream
(Pounds 55.95). There is a beautiful pure Shetland wool navy and white
blanket at Pounds 79 but also lots of smaller things.
Halcyon Days, 14 Brook Street, London W1Y 1AA. Tel: 071-629-8811. Pounds
1.50.
There is a fine selection of tiny one-off antiques - all expensive but
exclusive. Then there are the famous Halcyon days enamels - boxes
embellished with everything from flowers to endearing messages. The smallest
is Pounds 30.50, bigger ones are from Pounds 55 to Pounds 75.
Teddy Bears, 99 High Street, Witney, Oxfordshire OX8 6 LY. Tel. 0993 702616.
Pounds 2.
The catalogue for anybody who is planning on giving a teddy bear this
Christmas . Teddy Bears has been specialising in traditional teddy bears for
seven years and has established a good reputation. There are now some 92
different bears, 30 of them exclusive. The shop prefers telephone orders and
inquiries.
Traidcraft, Kingsway, Gateshead, Tyne &amp; Wear, NE11 0NE, UK. Tel:
091-491-0591.
Traidcraft believes ardently in trading fairly with the third world and,
although almost all its prices do seem exceedingly reasonable, it is at
pains to point out that cheap goods at the cheapest possible price is not
the point of the exercise.
It aims always to pay a fair price for the work involved and hopes that its
customers will look to it for some of the handiwork that it is difficult to
obtain in the west, rather than simply look for low prices. One problem is
that although the craft element is obviously still there, many of designs
lack the sophistication and finish that richer countries have become
accustomed to.
This autumn Traidcraft offers four different catalogues. Alternatives homes
in on clothing, jewellery and accessories, all of which have a strong ethnic
feel. There are hand-woven fabrics, batik block prints, natural dye knitwear
and traditionally embroidered fabrics such as the mirrorwork from Bangladesh
and the cross-stitching from the hilltribes of Thailand, all worked into
cosmetic bags, evening bags, scarves, shirts, dressing-gowns or boxer
shorts, many of them charming.
Nicest to my mind are the softer bags made from the hand-worked or
hand-embroidered fabrics, like the small cotton bag embroidered with
Gujerati mirrorwork (just Pounds 4), and the Red Akha Knapsack (a splendid
present for a teenager) made from hand-woven cotton with Akha hill tribe
embroidery, Pounds 12.95.
Interiors has some of the best ideas, dhurries at good prices (from Pounds
13.95), padded cotton bedspreads, antique carved mirrors (Pounds 22.95),
gold-leafed candlesticks, carved perfume pots, blue and white china, or an
enchanting hand-painted papier-mache bowl (Pounds 18.95).
Handmade &amp; Recycled Paper offers some truly charming cards, wrapping paper
and recycled paper, while the Christmas Cards &amp; Gifts catalogue has a
collection of cards with traditional Christmas images.
Oxfam Trading, Murdoch Road, Bicester, Devon OX6 7RF.
Oxfam, too, believes in helping poorer countries by trading rather than by
simply giving aid. Its catalogue offers pots from Nicaragua, carpets from
Tibet, papier mache from Kashmir, brass from India, and sweaters from
Guatemala; there is hardly a needy country in the world that it has not
visited and traded with.
Most readers by now are familiar with the standard Oxfam range but it is
only fair to say that it has gone to great lengths to improve quality. If
you prefer to do your Christmas shopping this way you really ought to be
able to find something for almost everybody.
For example, a beaded evening bag at Pounds 17.95 is both reasonably priced
and very attractive, a 34in square table cloth with four napkins, all
embroidered by women of the Garo tribe with innocently sweet birds and
flowers, is just Pounds 26.95, and a colourful Takka work bedspread is
Pounds 49.95.
Save The Children Home Shopper, PO Box 40, Burton-on-Trent, Staffs. DE14
3LQ.
Another perennial with plenty of cards, ribbons, crackers, wrapping paper
and other traditional festive delights to choose from.
It is a bit thin on actual presents, although if you look hard enough there
are a few things, such as a rather fine fountain pen, finished in red
lacquer, for just Pounds 4.99, or some carpet bowls for Pounds 26.50 that I
would not be dismayed to find in the stocking come Christmas morning.
I like best the old-style monks' hat, straight from Tibet, in bright cotton
from Bhutan - at Pounds 12.99 it would be a wow on any of the costas. The
selection of children's toys has something for most age-groups but is not
large. If you really want to help this particular charity you might find the
food section at the back more inspiring.
British Heart Foundation, PO Box 45 Burton-on-Trent, DE14 3LQ. Tel:
0283-512040.
A selection of cards, all of which can be personalised and a few of which
are really lovely (especially two from the Museum &amp; Gallery selection),
ribbons, wrapping paper et al (although much of the et al is not, if I may
put it this way, quite to my taste). A small selection of proper presents of
which the nicest seem to me to be a sturdy weekend holdall in a good green
with leather straps for Pounds 24.95, some useful gadgets for the DIY set
and some exceptionally pretty padded hangers.
NSPCC, 67 Saffron Hill, London EC1N 8RS.
Lots of cards, in every size, taste and mood, wrapping paper (some stunning
in plain gold and black and gold) and a range of gifts from an eye-catching
marble-faced watch (Pounds 22.95) to a jaunty selection of satchels,
duffle-bags and other paraphernalia for children. Some nice silk ties for
the chaps (just Pounds 14.99), small toys for children (nice elephant
bookends and a really charming wooden wagon packed full of animals).
Tearcraft, PO Box 777, Carlisle, Cumbria, CA3 OQS.
Another of the charities that trades with the Third World, believing
passionately in the dignity of work. Goods come from Peru, Thailand, India,
Bangladesh. Lots here that is very nice - I am a bit tired of T-shirts
personally and yet we all wear them all the time.
Tearcraft has two rather charming ones, one embellished with a parrot and
palm leaves, the other a faux naif aquataic scene of dolphin, sea and
underwater life. Both are just Pounds 12.95 each. There are bright and
cheerful wooden toys for children, a sweetly embroidered children's wall
tidy, some leather for chaps, which may not be of the same quality as our
big Western names but are an awful lot cheaper (black wallet for Pounds
8.95, credit card holder for Pounds 5.95).
Unicef - UK, Unit 1, Rignals Lane, Chelmsford, Essex CM2 8TU. Tel:
0245-76315.
A small catalogue mainly homing in on cards, paper and stationery but there
are some exceptionally attractive cards and those of a modernist turn of
mind who have trouble finding cards to their taste ought to find something
here (a particularly nice range by Michael Gaumnitz of France).
Countrywide Workshops Charitable Trust, 47 Fisherton Street, Salisbury,
Wiltshire SP2 7 SU. Tel: 0722-326886.
Countrywide Workshops features the work of handicapped people all over the
country but this does not mean that the work is substandard - much of it has
especial charm. For instance the selection of cooks' and gardeners' aprons,
household bags (for linen, pegs, shoes), dishcloths, oven gloves are really
very pretty indeed, the leatherware is excellent value (a woman's handmade
in real hide, while not in the Kelly bag class is nicely made and
wonderfully priced at Pounds 39.75). There is lots of willow ware and some
sturdy wooden toys for children including old-fashioned things like
blackboards, cribs and nativity scenes.
The National Trust for Scotland, 5 Charlotte Square, Edinburgh, EH2 4DU.
Tel: 031-243-9355.
A very small catalogue but with a distinctly Scottish flavour, which does at
least mean it stands out from all the others, many of which buy from
identical sources. Lots of tartan - choose from Royal Stewart, Dress
MacDuff, Hunting Scott. Tartan crackers, rugs, ribbon, hangers. Some
sterling silver pieces - jam spoons, salmon pate knives, honey spoons, all
with a distinctly Celtic air. A beautiful pure silk scarf with hand-rolled
edges, richly coloured after the style of the painted ceilings at Crathes
Castle, also caught my eye.
The National Trust (Enterprises) Ltd, PO Box 101, Melksham, Wiltshire SN12
8EA.
Of all the charity catalogues this one probably has more things that most of
us would really like to find at the bottom of the tree. Lovely simple wooden
picture frames (from Pounds 14.95), a set of six absolutely plain pure Irish
linen napkins taken from an 18th century design at Wimpole Hall (Pounds
54.95), a sterling silver christening spoon for a lucky baby (Pounds 45),
some English pewter hair and clothes brushes (Pounds 25.50), good waterproof
travelling bags (sponge, shoe, dress covers etc), lots of attractive cards,
games, diaries and address books. There are also some nice games for
children and the usual National Trust selection of edible goodies.

FT  14 NOV 92 / How To Spend It: A Bavarian Christmas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BENTLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STREETS of Nuremberg from the Hauptmarkt to the railway station will be
festooned with white poles carrying garlands and lights on November 27, the
Friday before Advent.
Surrounding a Christmas crib in the centre of the market, fir-clad stalls
will be selling decorations, elaborately decorated candles, the work of
local craftsmen and women, and comical little figures made of dried fruit
and crepe paper called Zwetschgenmannle or plum people.
On that Friday at 5.30 pm an elected 'Christchild' will proclaim the start
of the city's annual Christkindlmarkt from the balcony of the mighty 14th
century church of Our Lady. The sun sets, the lanterns of the stalls are lit
and the church is floodlit. So is Nuremberg's stupendous fountain, the
gilded Gothic Schoner Brunnen which is nearly 20 metres high and decorated
with statues of the German electors, Teutonic heroes and nine Old Testament
prophets. Around this fountain children's choirs and brass bands will regale
the visitors throughout the Christkindlmarkt.
By the time the market ends on Christmas Eve, 2.5m guests will have visited
Nuremberg, some 30,000 of them brought in by 50 special trains put on by the
German railways, not to speak of 50 extra flights from Switzerland. They
come to eat the city's pork sausages which are the size of one's little
finger, and another Nuremberg speciality, the honey and gingerbread cakes
known as Lebkuchen. They wash down the grub with mulled wine spiced with
cloves and cinnamon.
Nuremberg's Christkindlmarkt is Germany's oldest Christmas fair. Its origins
lie in the mid-1550s, when the Lutherans of the city took to giving their
children presents around Christmas. Their canny religious compatriots
spotted the chance to make a profit from this pious habit, and by the
beginning of the next century traders were bringing toys to sell in the city
from as far away as Holland - in particular, the Dutch sold dolls here,
known as Docken. These are probably the originals of the Christmas angels
made of golden foil which, nowadays, you find throughout Germany.
Initially all this commerce and festivity took place at Nuremberg's normal
markets, but in 1629 the city fathers decided to set up special stalls in
anticipation of a pre-Christmas spending spree. Since then the
Christkindlmarkt has never looked back. Special events this year include a
lantern procession from the Hauptmarkt to the Olberg on December 12,
beginning at 6.15 pm, and followed by a Nativity play. Two days later the
celebrated boys' choir of Regensburg cathedral (the 'cathedral sparrows')
arrives to sing in the Hauptmarkt at 4 pm.
This Christkindlmarkt is the benchmark for a cluster of other fairs which
make the run up to Christmas a treat elsewhere in Bavaria. At Munich the
Christkindlmarkt, lasts from November 28 to Christmas Eve, developed out of
the medieval celebration of the feast of the patron saint of children, Santa
Claus (St Nikolaus), which falls on December 6. Later, the stallholders of
its thriving vegetable market cashed in on the festival to host a
long-running fair.
Since 1972 the Christkindlmarkt of Bavaria's capital has centred on the
exquisite Marienplatz and its surrounding pedestrianised zone. An enormous
Christmas tree decked with countless lights dominates the square with its
maze of booths and stalls. The air is redolent with the scent of mulled wine
and burnt almonds. On November 28 and 29, Advent carols will be sung here,
and on December 17 Christmas carols in the monastery church of St Anna.
Not far away at Augsburg, weekend visitors to the Christkindlmarkt (which
starts on November 27 and ends on Christmas Eve) are offered a treat that
verges on the kitsch. In 1493 Hans Holbein the Elder painted some angel
musicians for its cathedral high altar. Today modern Madchen, winged like
these angels, their long tresses curled, play lutes for the spectators at
the Christkindlmarkt. And even Augsburg's Lebkuchen are baked in the shape
of angels.
Splendid though these Bavarian cities are, none can match in glamour the
town of Rothenburg ob der Tauber, perched above the river Tauber and
surrounded by medieval walls. The stalls of its annual Christkindlmarkt,
selling candles, gingerbread cakes and every conceivable Christmas
decoration, are set up in the Marktplatz, shaded by an arcaded town hall
which is half-Gothic, half-Renaissance. On November 27 the Burgermeister and
a brass band concert will inaugurate the market, after which festivities
will continue till December 20th.
Every day either a brass band or a group of singers will perform in the
Marktplatz. On Sunday December 13 the slender, late-14th century basilica of
St Jakob will host a concert by the Windsbach boys' choir, one of the finest
in the region. It's already a sell-out. A week later the basilica is the
venue of a Bach trumpet gala, performed by the Trumpet ensemble of Munich.
Bavaria's Christmas markets are this year being specially promoted by
Lufthansa and DER travel service.
