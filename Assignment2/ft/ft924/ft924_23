FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Industry stops short of
complete approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRY last night withheld unqualified approval for the chancellor's
package, although it was widely welcomed as an encouraging starting point
for economic recovery.
Doubts remained over whether confidence, the one factor beyond the
chancellor's control, would now improve significantly.
There was some disappointment among industrialists that today's
interest-rate reduction will be limited to 1 percentage point and concern
about whether the measures would provide a coherent strategy in the longer
term for sustained investment and recovery.
Other business leaders suggested that the cheapest borrowing rates for 15
years, combined with what was in effect a 14 per cent devaluation of
sterling, would provide a needed boost to the economy.
Mr Lamont's short-term plan for reviving industry with a blend of measures
to stimulate investment, expand production and increase sales met many of
the demands on industry's shopping list.
Even so, Mrs Ann Robinson, head of policy at the Institute of Directors,
said she was only 'partially satisfied' with the package. She was concerned
about the government's longer-term spending plans, given the danger that
insufficient revenues would boost public-sector borrowing and again raise
interest rates.
The Engineering Employers' Federation, which has been increasingly critical
of Mr Lamont's policies, said the package represented 'a great improvement'.
Mr Neil Johnson, federation director-general, welcomed the short-term
elements of the package, but added: 'Rebuilding the UK industrial base is a
job which demands much longer-term policies.'
The least impressed were smaller companies. Their Forum of Private Business
 -representing 20,000 businesses - claimed the chancellor had offered 'only
crumbs of comfort'.
The emphasis on maintaining capital investment at the expense of current
spending and the signalling of a new regime for encouraging joint ventures
between the public and private sectors were well received by big business.
The Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors said the priority given to
big infrastructure projects would be good for the construction sector.
The modest but short-lived measures for investment in plant, machinery and
industrial buildings, along with Mr Lamont's direct intervention to help the
housing and motor industries, also won approval. The Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders said the abolition of the special car tax would
boost sales.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said the improved investment allowances would benefit industry. 'No one can
be sure these measures will be sufficient to bring us out of recession,' he
said. 'But they will begin to rebuild industry's confidence in itself and in
the government.'
Mr David Mann, managing director of Logica, the UK's largest independent
computing services company, said the increase in capital allowances would
encourage its customers to undertake computer hardware and software
projects. The extra Pounds 700m cover for exporters available through the
Export Credits Guarantee Department was generally welcomed, although it is
the high cost of ECGD premiums which has raised most recent objections by
exporters.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Public sector pay feels
squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the first time in 13 years the government yesterday set an explicit
target for pay rises for all public sector workers over the next 12 months
of 0 to 1.5 per cent. The chancellor said the pay squeeze would save about
Pounds 1.5bn.
The target will not be legally binding but the government will be able to
impose it directly on about 3m of the 5m public sector employees. For other
groups, primarily local government, central government grants will assume
pay awards within the 0 to 1.5 per cent range.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, accepted that the
announcement represented an 'evolution of policy' but also emphasised that
governments had always made assumptions about public sector pay.
He stressed that the pay limit, which also applies to MPs, had been
introduced to free resources for the provision of services and to help
'suppress pay expectations' throughout the economy.
Although the pay limit only lasts 12 months, Mr Dorrell said that the
'catch-up argument' would not be accepted next year.
He said it was important the pay limit should not interfere with the longer
term movement towards more localised and performance related pay in the
public sector.
The government has set aside all the pay formulae for civil servants,
policemen and firemen and bypassed the pay review bodies, while stressing
their value and insisting they will continue to operate.
The groups covered by review bodies - teachers, doctors and dentists, nurses
and the armed forces - will all receive the maximum rises of 1.5 per cent
from April next year. That is when the next public sector pay round begins
in earnest and when the restrictions will start to bite.
Settlements already agreed this year will be honoured. Coal miners, the only
large group not to have settled this year, may be the first group to be hit
by the limit.
One group escaping the squeeze is people covered by the Top Salaries Review
Body. The government intends to honour the second stage of the 1992 award,
giving them an increase of 2.9 per cent.
Local government employers wrote to the government asking for a pay squeeze
to apply across the private sector. The government has rejected that
suggestion but the local authorities are likely to welcome the fact that the
squeeze at least applies evenly across the public sector, defined widely to
include bodies that are largely public funded such as universities and
non-departmental bodies.
It appears that the pay commitments already accepted which run over into the
1993-1994 budgets will be treated separately and not eat into the extra
money for the 0 to 1.5 per cent settlement.
Several union leaders warned that the decision would build up big problems
of comparability with the private sector for the future.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Concern in gilts market on
PSBR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GILTS market took the Autumn Statement in its stride yesterday, but the
market's current bullish tone may prove difficult to sustain, as the
longer-term implications for supply sink in.
The surge in the public sector borrowing requirement, now estimated at
Pounds 37bn for this financial year and Pounds 44bn for next year, means
that supply in the gilts market could reach Pounds 50bn next year, taking
into account the need to refinance maturing government debt. This translates
into about Pounds 1bn of gilt issues every week.
The immediate impact on the gilts market has been cushioned because, with
less than Pounds 4bn still to borrow, the government has already completed
most of its funding for this financial year.
'I don't think the real problem is for this year and it might not even be
for next year, but it is the prospect of several years of PSBR between
Pounds 40bn and Pounds 50bn that causes concern,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK
economist at Greenwell Montagu.
The government has some additional flexibility, because the inclusion in the
funding arithmetic of the Pounds 15bn raised through purchases of sterling
during foreign exchange intervention in September could be delayed, allowing
some pre-funding in the gilts market before the start of the next financial
year.
There are some fears that even the latest PSBR estimates may be
conservative. 'The key is going to be whether (Mr Lamont) will succeed in
keeping to his public sector pay policy,' said Mr John Kendal, an economist
at Baring Brothers.
If the 1 1/2 per cent limit on public sector pay rises was exceeded, the
government's funding needs could rise further, he warned.
But the background of low inflation and low growth, and the prospect of
further cuts in interest rates, will continue to provide support for the
gilts market.
Concern about inflation, even in the medium-term, appears to have faded.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement: Mixed response from markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OUR MARKETS STAFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REACTION in financial markets last night was divided over the Autumn
Statement, with some dealers claiming it contained several ingenious
measures and others fearing it would not do enough to stimulate economic
growth.
The announcement of a 1 percentage point cut in base rates, from today, had
been accurately priced into foreign exchange dealing earlier in the week,
and the pound barely moved against either the D-Mark or the US dollar in its
wake.
Traders in UK stocks showed some pleasure with the cut in base rates and
share prices rose before and after the chancellor spoke to the Commons.
Several stock market analysts warned the statement may not be enough to push
the stock market significantly further.
Gilt prices were depressed because of the chancellor's forecast that the
public sector borrowing requirement would rise to Pounds 44bn in 1993-94.
According to analysts at S. G. Warburg Securities, this implies that gilts
will have to be issued next year at a rate of Pounds 1bn a week, a prospect
they described as 'daunting'.
The currency markets' immediate reaction was muted. Sterling stood at
DM2.4105 at the start of Mr Lamont's speech, rose to DM2.4150 and later
closed at DM2.4200, more than a quarter of a pfennig up on the day. Against
the dollar, the pound closed weaker on the day at Dollars 1.5240.
The FT-SE 100 Index of leading shares closed at 2,726.4, showing a net gain
of 29.6. The projected figures for the PSBR caused a drop in gilt prices,
which ended the day as much as a quarter of a percentage point lower at the
long end.
Mr Nigel Richardson, a UK economist at S. G. Warburg Securities in London,
said the overall nature of the package was encouraging and it was even
'ingenious in places'. He said the proposals to stimulate the housing market
and abolish the car tax would help boost consumer confidence.
Mr Ian Beauchamp, chief economist at Hambros Bank in London, said the
chancellor's proposals were simply 'tinkering at the edges rather than
getting to the heart of the problem of stimulating economic growth'.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement: Treasury says PSBR will reach Pounds
37bn this year - The main points of the chancellor's Autumn Statement to The
House of Commons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Base rates: The chancellor announced a 1 point cut in base rates to 7 per
cent, the lowest level since 1978.
Fiscal stance: The Treasury expects the public sector borrowing requirement
to rise to Pounds 37bn this financial year, a significant increase on the
Budget forecast of Pounds 28bn and higher than most independent forecasts.
In 1993-94 the PSBR is expected to rise to 7 per cent of GDP, about Pounds
44bn.
No change in government spending levels: There will be no effective change
in the level of public spending planned for this year and next year. This
implies a planning total of Pounds 226.1bn this financial year in line with
figures set out in last year's Autumn Statement. (The figure allows for
classification changes and a new Pounds 750m package to boost the housing
market).
New planning totals: The new control total - which takes over from the
planning total in the next financial year - has been set at Pounds 243.8bn
for 1993-94, Pounds 253.6bn for 1994-95 and Pounds 263.3bn for 1995-96. This
represents average growth of 1.4 per cent in public sector spending over the
next three years, half the average growth rate of the past three years.
General government expenditure is likely to rise to 44.75 per cent as a
share of national income this year 'mainly as a result of the recession'. It
is projected to rise to 45.5 per cent in 1993-94, before dropping to 45 per
cent the following year and 44.25 per cent in 1995-96.
Privatisation proceeds and the reserves: The new control totals include
reserves of Pounds 4bn in the next financial year, rising to Pounds 7bn in
1994-95, and Pounds 10bn in 1995-96. Privatisation proceeds will not be part
of the new control total and will therefore not affect expenditure. They are
anyway projected at Pounds 5.5bn in both 1993-94 and 1994-95.
Package of temporary fiscal measures designed to give immediate boost to
confidence:
Motor industry: Car tax abolished from midnight last night. This should
provide a saving of about Pounds 400 on a Pounds 10,000 car.
Capital allowances: First year capital allowances for plant and machinery
increased from 25 per cent to 40 per cent for one year. Initial tax
allowance of 20 per cent for new industrial and agricultural buildings
introduced for a year.
Local authorities: Temporary relaxation of local authority receipts realised
between today and the end of next year, including receipts from council
house sales. The measure is expected to stimulate extra capital spending of
Pounds 1.8bn.
Housing: The government will use an extra Pounds 750m this year mainly to
buy empty properties for use as low rent housing.
Exporters: The government will provide a further Pounds 700m of ECGD cover
to 'ease some of the constraints on cover for individual countries'.
Private finance for infrastructure projects:
The statement included a new initiative on private finance to enable public
and private sectors to work more effectively together, particularly on
infrastructure projects. Privately financed projects which can be operated
profitably will be allowed to proceed. No comparison with a theoretical
public sector alternative will be required.
Departmental spending: New public spending plans give priority to capital
programmes.
Roads: The overall transport budget has been cut but cash plans for the
national roads programme will be maintained. Because of the fall in
construction prices, the number of new schemes next year should be double
this year's
levels.
Public transport: British Rail will be allowed to lease about Pounds 150m of
new rolling stock orders over the next three years.
Jubilee Line extension: Funds for completion - Pounds 1.2bn over three years
 -will be available, provided negotiations are completed.
Public sector: Pay settlements in the public sector will be restricted this
year to a maximum increase of 1.5 per cent.
National insurance: Contributions will not be raised. Upper and lower
earnings limits will be indexed as usual.
Education: Spending on education will be Pounds 9.5bn next year - a real
rise of 3 per cent. This is designed to fund an 8 per cent increase in the
number of students expected to enroll at further education and sixth form
colleges next year.
Social security: The real value of unemployment benefits and pensions will
be maintained. Most social security benefits will increase by 3.6 per cent
in April.
Local Government: Central government support for local government spending
will rise by 3.7 per cent in England next year.
Defence: Spending will fall sharply in real terms.
Health Spending in real terms will increase by 1 per cent next year.
Employment: A real spending growth of 1 per cent next year,
will allow for 500,000 new places on government employment schemes.
Cautious economic forecast: The chancellor offered a muted view of the
economy expressing particular concern over the lack of confidence among
consumers and businesses.
GDP: The economy is forecast to contract by 1 per cent this year, followed
by growth of around 1 per cent next year.
Inflation: Retail price inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments, is
forecast to drop to 3.75 per cent by the end of this year and to rise at the
same average rate next year. The chancellor said he would use the M4 broad
measure of the money supply to monitor the money growth. The target range
for the second half of this financial year will be 4-8 per cent.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement: Measures aim to help construction
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PACKAGE of measures was announced to boost the construction and transport
industries.
The chancellor said the Pounds 1.6bn extension of the Jubilee Line to
London's Docklands would go ahead if final agreement on a Pounds 400m
private-sector contribution was reached with a consortium of banks.
But other government funding for London Transport next year will be 30 per
cent less than it had been expecting, prompting furious criticism from Mr
Wilfred Newton, London Transport's chairman.
Mr Newton said: 'We now face the real prospect of . . . the loss of 7,000
jobs in supply industries.'
A separate series of measures should help the construction industry. These
include the temporary suspension of restrictions on local authorities'
ability to spend receipts from the sale of capital assets.
From today until the end of 1993, all the proceeds from sales of assets such
as council houses will be available for spending on housing, schools, roads
and other projects. Previously, councils could spend only 25 per cent of
these proceeds. The newly available funds, which the Treasury estimates will
total Pounds 1.75bn, must be spent in the coming three years.
In addition, a special tax allowance is being introduced for a year to
encourage the construction of new industrial and agricultural buildings,
including hotels. Twenty per cent of the buildings' costs will be tax
deductible, if contracts for their construction are signed in the coming
year and they are brought into use by the end of 1994.
The construction industry will also be helped by a decision not to cut the
national road-building programme. In the longer term, the government hopes
to boost construction activity further by allowing private companies to form
joint ventures with the public sector to invest in roads, railways and other
infrastructure projects. It also held out the possibility of more motorway
toll roads.
The government also loosened restrictions on private-sector financing of
public-sector projects. Mr Lamont said privately financed schemes would now
be permitted so long as they were profitable.
The construction industry welcomed the package, including funds made
available to help the housing industry. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of
Wimpey, a leading construction company, said: 'I am encouraged by what I
have heard.' Mr Neville Simms, chief executive of Tarmac, gave the changes
qualified approval.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement: National Savings to cut its returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL SAVINGS cut returns on its products in response to the 1 percentage
point fall in base rates yesterday and withdrew its controversial First
Option Bond.
The bond, which was first issued in the summer, was specifically aimed at
basic rate taxpayers and offered attractive fixed rates for a year. It had
provoked complaints from building societies that depositors were withdrawing
savings to invest in the bond, putting pressure on society finances.
The government also withdrew its long-running 5th issue of index-linked
certificates, which offered a tax-free return of 4.5 per cent over inflation
if held for five years.
The new 6th issue will offer a return of 3.25 per cent above inflation.
Rates on other products were cut by between 1 and 1.5 percentage points.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement: Decision to scrap special car tax wins
approval - Warning that cost of abolition may be recouped in next year's
Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECIAL car tax was abolished with effect from midnight last night, in
effect cutting new car prices immediately by around 4 per cent. The price of
a typical family saloon costing Pounds 10,000 should fall by about Pounds
400.
The UK motor industry last night warmly welcomed the removal of the tax, for
which it has campaigned for more than a decade. But the government warned
that taxes on motoring would be raised next year to pay for the abolition.
The removal of the car tax will cost around Pounds 100m in the remainder of
this financial year and Pounds 750m in 1993-94, Customs and Excise said
yesterday.
'This should be recouped within the 1993 spring Budget by raising taxes on
motoring,' it said, which suggests higher fuel duty and a possible increase
in road-fund licences.
The move, which surprised the industry by its timing, completed the process
begun in the Budget in March, when car tax was initially cut from 10 per
cent to 5 per cent.
While the removal of car tax will cut list prices for new cars by about 4
per cent, the fall in 'transaction' prices - the price which is actually
paid by the customer - could be less.
Dealers may seek to improve their margins which have been squeezed by the
recession and the impact of heavy discounting. Sales of new cars have fallen
by around a third in the last three years.
Ford, the leader of the UK new car market, said last night: 'The car tax was
having a very negative effect on car sales, and taken together the
chancellor's proposals could have a positive impact on consumer confidence.
'It is a very encouraging set of measures even if it lacks the boldness some
had hoped for.'
Ford said that the price of its 1.1 litre Fiesta LX small car would be
reduced by Pounds 348 to Pounds 8,357 and the price of a 1.8 litre Sierra LX
would fall by Pounds 525 to Pounds 12,605.
Sir Trevor Chinn, chairman of Lex Service, one of the biggest UK dealer
groups, said the abolition of special car tax would 'reinforce the
improvement' that had already been seen in the new-car market in recent
months.
New car sales had been higher year-on-year in five of the last seven months.
'If this trend is maintained new car registrations next year could well
exceed the current industry forecast of 1.6m,' he said.
'There is clearly an unfulfilled demand for new cars and the reduction in
car tax and interest rates will make it easier for both the company buyer
and private buyers to replace their cars.'
Carmakers had feared that the chancellor would wait until next year's Budget
to abolish car tax, thus depressing sales during the winter.
'There was a real risk that some buyers, aware that special car tax was
halved in the last Budget, would hold off and wait for the other shoe to
drop', said Mr Peter Batchelor, Vauxhall sales and marketing director.
He said the overall package was likely to have a significant impact in
restoring consumer confidence.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Royal Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by the near doubling of its share price in the last two months, the
market clearly believes Royal is out of intensive care. Yesterday's news
that it almost broke even in the three months to September - and managed its
first quarterly UK profit since early 1990 - underpins this view. But it
would also be foolish to underestimate the task Royal still faces in
returning to anything like rude health.
Like General Accident earlier in the week, Royal is conspicuously riding the
turn of the cycle. It was only a matter of time, of course, before the
impact of higher premiums would be felt. What is more encouraging is the
evidence of fewer claims, notably for subsidence and personal motor.
Continuing anxieties, though, are the medium-term damage which mortgage
guarantee losses could yet inflict, and the state of the balance sheet. The
two, of course, are connected. Today's solvency margin is closer to 30 per
cent than the stated 45 per cent if the life business is excluded, which
leaves Royal vulnerable to another unexpected wave of repossessions if the
economy again fails to respond to Mr Lamont.
In the short term at least Royal deserves the benefit of the doubt. There is
a real management story, while its operational and balance sheet gearing are
obvious attractions at this stage in the game. Further upside in the share
price, though, must be limited by the 3 per cent yield.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Boots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market has a habit of treating Boots uncharitably. Yesterday's 2 per
cent fall in the shares in response to a 15 per cent rise in interim profits
was less dramatic than what followed the full year results in June. But
Boots could be forgiven for feeling hard done by, given its progress in
tackling some of the poorer performing parts of the retail empire.
Halfords' return to profit against the background of a depressed car market
is particularly encouraging. Yet without a recovery in the housing market,
Boots will need all its retail skills to stem the losses at Do It All which
is fighting from a weak third place in a market shredded by discounting.
Even on the assumption that conditions get no worse, Boots will do well to
break even this year on non-chemist retail sales approaching Pounds 1bn. On
the upside, though, this implies plenty of scope for recovery when
conditions in the high street improve.
Boots continues to defy gravity by squeezing higher margins from the
chemists' business. Pharmaceuticals should return to profit growth next year
once the launch costs for Manoplax, its new heart drug, are out of the way.
Admittedly, Manoplax has yet to win approval from the US authorities, let
alone demonstrate a track record. But even a qualified approval should be
enough to offset lower growth from the rest of the drugs portfolio. It would
be a shame if Boots were weighed down too much by its defensive credentials
in a rising market.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BT ought to be moderately satisfied with second quarter profits of Pounds
431m. They were at the top end of expectations even after a Pounds 386m
redundancy charge. Better still, there was a faint hint of volume recovery
which appears to be continuing. Add that to an 8 per cent interim dividend
increase, and a 4 per cent jump in its shares looks a natural response.
The longer term, though, offers less ground for excitement. Yesterday also
saw the management trotting out a long list of reasons for not addressing
the strategic questions raised by its looming cash surplus and setbacks
overseas. Not only is there regulatory uncertainty; BT also faces some large
calls on its cash. Changes to the VAT rules mean a Pounds 900m tax payment
in the second half. Pension fund contributions may have to resume at a rate
of Pounds 200m next year.
It is much too early for management to take seriously the more extreme City
suggestions like a mega-dividend or share buy-back scheme. For the time
being the prospect of generous real dividend growth ought to underpin the
shares. This attraction is offset by worry that BT's fascination with North
America will prompt a third unlucky attempt to strike it rich there.
Besides, a 10 per cent yield premium to the market is on the low side for
BT. And if its business really is reviving, so is the economy as a whole.
Defensive stocks like BT would find it hard to outperform in a recovery.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So much for the government's growth rhetoric. The demise of the car tax, and
increased capital allowances sounded flashy but it is not as if Pounds 400
off a Ford Escort will cause a stampede in the showroom. Capital allowances
are not much use unless companies have the cash to invest and profits
against which to claim relief. The chancellor's recovery package yesterday
involved extra borrowing of only about 0.6 per cent of GDP over the next
three years. At least he was refreshingly candid about what it will achieve.
Growth will be no more than 1 per cent next year.
What financial markets have been seeking since Black Wednesday is a
purposeful and predictable strategy with a sensible mix between fiscal and
monetary policy. Instead, what they got yesterday still looks like a muddled
and piecemeal attempt to please everyone. Mr Lamont is at pains to appear
cautious on the fiscal front, but just in case that does not convince, he is
full of rectitude on the monetary front too - at least by the standards of
those who were looking for a 2 point cut in base rates.
Perhaps the truth is that the government is still boxed in. On the fiscal
side it is hobbled by the sheer size of social security payments and, now
additionally, debt interest. Even so the background does not leave much room
for growth. The underlying inflation rate next year is expected to be 3.75
per cent, and the current account deficit to rise to Pounds 15.5bn from
Pounds 12bn.
The stock market may have been rash to flirt with record levels yesterday.
The gilt market will have to contend with a PSBR of at least Pounds 44bn
next year - more if the attempt at pay restraint fails. The chances are that
a weak government will face some ugly confrontations in the labour market.
Hardly what the prospective buyer of gilts on Zurich's Bahnhofstrasse likes
to see.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Clinton pledges to include more women in his cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT-ELECT Bill Clinton promised yesterday that his cabinet would 'look
more like America than previous administrations' by including more women and
members of ethnic minorities, and repeated his pledge to look beyond the
Democratic party in naming his administration.
But Mr Clinton said he was not yet ready to make cabinet appointments, and
was still discussing what he wanted the different government departments to
do.
The Clinton transition team showed the importance the new administration
will attach to the problem of controlling spiralling US medical costs by
naming a separate transition policy director for healthcare, alongside
directors for economic, domestic and foreign policy.
The transition team will oversee the formation of the administration which
takes office in January, under the chairmanship of Mr Vernon Jordan, a
Washington lawyer and civil rights leader. Mr Warren Christopher, a former
deputy secretary of state in the Carter administration, is in day-to-day
charge of the operation. Ms Judy Feder, who directed a recent study of the
US healthcare system, was named to lead the healthcare team.
Mr Al From, head of the Democratic Leadership Council, a grouping of
centrist Democrats which Mr Clinton helped found and which has worked hard
to elaborate a moderate policy for their party, will head the domestic
policy team. Mr Samuel Berger, deputy director of the State Department
policy planning staff in the Carter administration, was named as head of the
foreign policy team, and Mr Robert Reich, a Harvard economist and prolific
author, will direct the economic policy team.
Since winning last week's presidential election, Mr Clinton has appeared to
wind down after the gruelling pace of a year-long campaign, apparently
spending much of his time jogging, lifting weights or playing golf.
He has now picked up the pace, inserting substantive comments on defence
policy into a speech delivered on Wednesday at a Veterans Day commemoration
and accelerating the formation of his transition team with the string of
appointments announced yesterday at his first news conference since the
election.
Mr Clinton is due to meet Speaker Thomas Foley, Senate majority leader
George Mitchell and House majority leader Richard Gephardt on Sunday for
preliminary talks on the agenda that will await Congress in the new year. He
will have talks in Washington on Wednesday with President George Bush and
meet congressional leaders of both political parties.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Opposition presses PM on Iraqi exports issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major was thrown on to the defensive yesterday as opposition leaders
pressed him to reveal how much he knew of arms-related machinery sales to
Iraq and when he first became aware of them.
His claim at question time that the 1985 government guidelines may not have
been breached by UK exporters provoked gasps of disbelief in the Commons.
Under persistent questioning from Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, the
prime minister conceded that he had met Mr Alan Clark in 1990 with Sir Robin
Butler, the cabinet secretary, to discuss newspaper reports that
arms-related exports to Iraq were taking place. But, he insisted that Mr
Clark, then defence minister, had dismissed as 'totally false' reports
alleging he had advised companies to conceal arms-related equipment sales.
Mr Major said Mr Clark had taken a similar position in his written testimony
to the Matrix Churchill trial. It was only when the former minister gave
oral evidence he had had 'any reason to believe' otherwise, he added.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said Mr Major had substituted an
explanation 'with a smokescreen and scapegoat'. Referring to a letter he
received from Mr Major on December 6 1990, Mr Ashdown last night said the
documents revealed in the trial included one, dated June 1990, which
discussed machine tools being 'used for munitions manufacture'.
The memo, from Lord Ridley, then trade and industry secretary, to Baroness
Thatcher, then prime minister, was copied to a key cabinet committee on
which Mr Major sat as chancellor.
One seasoned Whitehall observer said it was more than possible that, when
chancellor, Mr Major's private office did not draw his attention to the
memo.
But he added that, given the 500 pages of civil service and ministerial
discussion of the issue released by the court, it is less likely that Mr
Major was kept 'out of the loop' when he became prime minister.
In a written reply to Mr Ashdown on this point, Mr Major yesterday insisted
that his December 1990 letter stated the Matrix Churchill case was sub
judice and he could not comment on it.
Mr Ashdown has since pointed out that breaches of the guidelines by other
companies were covered in the memo. 'The clear message of the prime
minister's letter to me of 6 December 1990 was that the rules were being
observed and that, with the possible exception of the firm under Customs and
Excise investigation, no machine tools were exported from Britain to Iraq
and subsequently used to produce lethal defence equipment,' he said. 'This
is now known to be incorrect and it seems clear that the government and the
prime minister knew so at the time.'

FT  13 NOV 92 / Japanese managers to be paid in product vouchers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 6,500 managers at NEC, the Japanese electronics company, are to make
an important contribution to its sagging sales figures by taking part of
their pay in vouchers which can be swapped for an NEC home computer or
television set.
There is an honourable tradition of Japanese workers taking pay in corporate
kind. Staff at Matsushita Electric set the standard in prewar days by
accepting light bulbs instead of yen when times were tough.
With times tough again, NEC and Sanyo Electric, another electronics
manufacturer, are asking managers to take part of their year-end bonuses, an
important component of the Japanese salary, in product vouchers worth
between Y100,000 (Pounds 530) and Y300,000.
When such vouchers were last issued, by Matsushita and Mitsubishi Electric
in the middle of the yen appreciation crisis six years ago, a small
secondary market quickly developed.
Matsushita managers generally have a home already well stocked with their
employer's products, so the vouchers were sold at a discount to friends or
given to relatives.
This year, NEC employees at or above the level of section chief must take at
least part of their bonus in vouchers. Ordinary workers will receive a 0.03
per cent increase on last year's final bonus, which was equivalent to about
2 1/2 months' salary.
'The idea of the 0.03 per cent increase was to improve morale among the
workers. If bonuses were to fall, it would seem that we have real problems,
but things are not that serious,' an NEC official said.
Sanyo has asked senior managers to take a 10 per cent bonus cut and accept
another 10 per cent in kind. Other companies, including Hitachi, have cut
executive pay by between 10 and 20 per cent and curbed the corporate
contribution to their karaoke and golf habits.
Electronics manufacturers are having a difficult year. First half profits
were down by 73 per cent at Mitsubishi Electric, 71 per cent at NEC and 51
per cent at Matsushita. Sanyo is expected to report a loss in its financial
year which ends on November 30.
The Ministry of Finance made another gesture this week to enable employees
to make a humble contribution to the corporate good by relaxing controls on
share ownership programmes, usually 'clubs' with compulsory membership.
It is common for companies to expect workers to devote 5 per cent or more of
their salaries to stock purchases. Under the new law, companies can raise
the percentage to prop up prices in a still ailing Tokyo stock market.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Letter: Investment in equity at heart of industrial
regeneration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEOFFREY MADDRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We read with interest your brief report ('Call to double share sales
duty', November 10) that the National Association of Estate Agents is
recommending the doubling of stamp duty on the transfer of shares on the
basis that 'share ownership is a luxury, not a necessity'.
It seems that the association has totally failed to understand the
fundamental issue facing Britain and the economy, namely industrial
regeneration through investment in productive industry to lead the way out
of recession and to ensure we have companies able to compete effectively
with the best in world markets.
Such investment has to be funded; we have learned from hard experience of
the dangers of relying totally on bank debt.
Accordingly, what the National Association of Estate Agents fails to
understand is that investment in equity, and thereby share ownership, lies
at the heart of out industrial regeneration.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Bitter enemies become grudging partners: Despite continuing
animosity between China and Taiwan, bilateral economic ties have grown
rapidly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eight years ago, when political tensions were high and China's economic
reforms scarcely under way, the special economic zone of Xiamen booked 10
telephone calls a month to Taiwan, 200km away. Today, calls are averaging
60,000 a month and rising.
In 1987, when Taiwan lifted martial law and eased some restrictions on
dealings with China, fewer than 7,000 Taiwanese visited the mainland.
Bilateral trade, which can legally be conducted only through third
countries, was about USDollars 1.5bn (Pounds 877m). This year, with rules on
investment in China slowly being relaxed, more than 1m Taiwanese are
expected to visit. Bilateral trade through Hong Kong alone is likely to
exceed Dollars 6bn, while the total, including smuggling, will be closer to
Dollars 10bn.
Taiwanese light industrial and processing companies, faced with rising wages
and costs at home, have probably invested more than Dollars 3bn in China in
the last five years. About a third has gone into the city of Xiamen and
Fujian province and about the same is invested in Guangdong and Shenzhen,
China's most advanced special economic zone, across Kowloon Bay from Hong
Kong.
This explosion of economic activity has helped lift average wages in Xiamen
10 per cent per year since 1987. Taiwanese electronics, toy and garment
factories are springing up in and around Xiamen and along the Fujian coast.
In some areas, more than a quarter of workers are employed by Taiwan
companies.
Xiamen now resembles Shenzhen five years ago. Similar problems, such as
gambling, prostitution and corruption, are also emerging. But most Xiamen
residents seem to welcome home their Taiwanese tongbao, or compatriots, who
share language and often kinship ties.
Each morning Chinese peasants, often brought to Xiamen from poorer inland
provinces, file through the gates of the Xinglin Taiwanese investors zone.
Takamisawa Electric (Taiwan), which started trial production of magnetic
components earlier this year, employs about 70 young Chinese women on a
production line with machinery mostly imported from Japan.
Mr Lay Chuanlin, who moved to Xiamen from Taiwan to manage the factory, says
labour costs are about a tenth of those in Taiwan and productivity is
surprisingly high. By next year the company intends to add another three
production lines and employ 1,000 workers.
Although Taiwan's growing involvement in Fujian mirrors Hong Kong's
development of Guangdong since the early 1980s, Taiwanese companies face
different problems. China still regards Taiwan as a renegade province. It
refuses to recognise Taiwan's government and has not renounced its threat to
use military force to reunify Taiwan, especially if the island declares
independence.
These political concerns pose a host of problems and suggest moves towards
closer economic integration will be erratic at best. For example, neither
side recognises the other's legal system so no investment protection
guarantees are in place. Bans on direct shipping and air links and
restrictions on direct investment and banking also add to businesses' costs.
These are acceptable risks for low-cost manufacturers. who may face going
out of business if they stay in Taiwan. Their average investment is less
than Dollars 10m and some are also speculating on rising land prices.
Machinery, which has sometimes already been fully depreciated, can be moved
to China, where low wage and land costs allow healthy margins even after the
extra costs of political restrictions.
But for capital intensive industries the risks of investing in China are
significant. Investment guarantees can be secured via overseas subsidiaries,
but companies face legal and political problems. While Hong Kong companies
rush to build power stations and roads in Guangdong, Taiwanese investors
have so far shunned long-term infrastructure projects. Some heavy industries
such as petrochemicals will invest if offered sufficient incentives by
China, but progress is likely to be slow.
China's renewed commitment to coastal economic reform this year means it has
become even keener on attracting Taiwanese investment to provide jobs and
technology. Defence experts in Hong Kong and Taiwan suspect China's policy
of attacking the US while largely ignoring Taiwan over the recent F-16
fighter jet sale shows Beijing does not want to risk upseting Taiwanese
investors at this stage.
But growing Chinese links are worrying Taiwan's government. With 7 per cent
of the island's exports now officially destined for the mainland, the
government fears China is gaining a significant indirect influence over its
economy. Changes in China's economic policies, and its trade disputes with
the US, will now affect Taiwan for the first time.
Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang party has tried to stop large-scale investments
in China by reviewing them on a case by case basis. Defence industries will
not be allowed to leave, and strategic industries such as petrochemicals and
cement are being encouraged to invest in special preferential zones in
Taiwan. 'Whatever our businessmen do on the mainland, their roots should
remain in Taiwan,' said Kuomintang spokesman Mr James Chu.
So far the government has had mixed success. It claims it persuaded Formosa
Plastics, Taiwan's largest private company, to cancel plans to invest in
Xiamen. In fact Formosa probably delayed because China had not agreed to its
conditions. Other large companies, such as food manufacturer President, are
investing throughout China, and government officials admit privately they
cannot stop businessmen for long. 'Taiwan is meant to be a free country,'
one said.
The Taiwanese government therefore seems to have decided its ban on direct
shipping, air and postal links is its best chance of limiting investment.
China wants the ban lifted to increase investment and push reunification one
step closer. But Taiwan wants to keep maintain the ban, which is perhaps its
only hope of squeezing concessions from China in the future.
Meanwhile, China seems unwilling to play its own trump card - removing the
threat of force. Mr Chen Kongli, director of Taiwan research at Xiamen
University, said Taiwan had to make concessions before the threat would be
lifted. 'China's government also sees the threat as a way to suppress
Taiwan's independence movement,' he said.
Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, set up to discuss issues such as
document verification and trade disputes with the Chinese, complains that
each time progress on improving the relationship between the two sides has
been close, China has raised unacceptable demands on sovereignty by claiming
there is only one China, thereby negating Taiwan's existence.
The problem became urgent earlier this year when three Taiwanese managers
were arrested by Chinese police following a fight at their factory. They
were later released without charge. 'Legal protection of Taiwanese people
and property remains very tenuous,' said Mr Chen Rong-jye, secretary-general
of the SEF.

Sir, E N Addison's summary (Letters, November 12) - 'put your country first
and forget your high principles' - of your November 10 leader ('The Matrix

trade-at-any-price conservative politicians, of whom Alan Clark, former

Mr Addison is clearly a member of the club: '. . . things have come out
which would have been better left unsaid.' Would he make the same assertion
to the Matrix Churchill defendants?

<BYLINE>
   From Mr DOUG HENWOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In one of your articles on this stupid US-EC trade war ('Wine importers
see risk of going into the red', November 7), your correspondents Alan
Friedman and Louise Kehoe declare that 'US white wine is a more palatable
alternative to European whites than is US red wine'. If this represents
official Bush administration reasoning, then it's yet another reason to
cheer its forced retirement come January. If it represents your
correspondents' opinion, then I can only assume that deadline pressures
prevented them from researching the matter adequately. The pain of living in
a weak-currency country would be even more intense than it is already if the
US didn't produce excellent red wines.
My own guess is that the Bushites consider white wine ideologically suspect,
the preferred beverage of intellectuals, aesthetes, vegetarians, women and
liberal democrats. By contrast, real Republicans drink manly reds with their
blood-rare steaks.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The apparent approval of the government for the construction of the
Jubilee Line extension reminded me of Adam Smith's wise words: 'The proud
minister of an ostentatious court may frequently take pleasure in executing
a work of splendour and magnificence such as a great highway. . .But to
execute a great number of little works (that) have little to recommend them
but their extreme utility, is a business which appears too mean and paltry
to merit the attention of so great a magistrate. Such works are almost
always entirely neglected.' (An Enquiry into the Nature and Causes of the
Wealth of Nations, Book V Chapter I, Everyman edition p217).
Meanwhile the excellent comprehensive school (listed by you last week) where
my wife works is falling down and in urgent need of rebuilding while the
wretched Conservative council is at its wits' end for money.
It seems such a pity that, as with the poll tax fiasco, those shallow
politicians who proclaim their devotion to the master do not actually bother
to read his works.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Letter: Property right for pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PATRICK J BUSHNELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lex ('Dividend deficit', November 9) may have missed a point when it
suggested that in a weak dividend environment mature pension funds might
switch from equities to bonds. In recent years property has been either
overlooked or treated with suspicion by the pension fund industry.
Current property yields are at an all-time high, at 9.9 per cent as measured
by Investment Property Databank. Property now offers higher income returns
than long-dated gilts (8.7 per cent), UK base rates (8 per cent) and very
substantially higher-than-average dividend yield (4.6 per cent).
There are, of course, the justifiable arguments of oversupply in some
instances and that much of the property market is overrented - that is, let
on rents that are higher than current rental value - and that values are
still falling. This may well be true in some parts of the market, most
notably London offices. However, there are significant proportions of the
property market away from London where property is not substantially overlet
and still offers strong income returns.
In due course there will be prospects for rental and capital growth
re-emerging as the economy recovers to add to the attractions of this
market.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD R DOLPHIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I run my own business. If a decision is required, I have to make it.
Unless the matter is problematical, I make it there and then.
I have come to the conclusion that British business employs people who,
however estimable their business administration degrees and all the rest,
lack any ability to make decisions at all.
We have a new hypermarket which just been opened here by one of our premier
companies. Three weeks ago I called and asked if it could let me have some
empty boxes. The perfectly polite middle management member to whom I spoke
was quite unable to make a decision.
In the end I wrote to the company chairman - a decision was made.
A few days ago I called a big international brewer in the Midlands and asked
a question. The person to whom I spoke was quite unable to decide to whom I
should address it.
Shortly after, I called at the Courage Berkshire Brewery and asked if it
could supply me with something I wanted for a charitable purpose. The person
to whom I spoke (who displayed an interest in the matter which could not
have been measured on any known scale) was quite unable to make a decision
and made the absurd suggestion that I wrote to him about it.
As William Brown said, 'strordinary.'
So, I decided to write to you about the apparent inability of British
business people to make decisions about anything. They should be taught how
to do so.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Letter: A medium-sized answer to costly legal fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J GOULDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There was a phrase concerning the computer industry to the effect that
nobody had ever lost their job by buying IBM. I was reminded of it when
reading your article concerning London lawyers' fees ('Business and the
Law', November 10). I think it is accepted that for many years lawyers in
the big City firms have enjoyed substantial incomes and charged large fees.
The fault does not lie with the lawyers but with clients who have used their
services, whether or not they were the right legal animal for that
particular company or task.
As a partner in a medium-sized commercial practice, I am delighted to say
that our experience is that more and more businesses are appreciating that a
good quality legal service can be provided without going to a big City firm.
While there is no doubt that some legal tasks should be done by such
organisations, it is also clear that there is a whole range of legal
problems and needs which can be served both more efficiently and cheaply by
other legal practices.
Those that are currently moaning as to the cost of lawyers in the big City
practices should consider whether it is in the interest of themselves and
their shareholders to use the range of legal services open to them and vote
with their feet.

Thriller writer Ken Follett is a master of surprise. He may be a staunch
supporter of Britain's Labour party, but he was also a big fan of maverick
Texan Ross Perot's presidential ambitions.
It has to be remembered that Follett wrote On the Wings of Eagles, the true
story of how two employees of Perot were rescued from Iran during the 1979
revolution. During the campaign Perot was handing the book out like a
calling card.
Follett was also in the vanguard of the opposition to Rupert Murdoch's
takeover of his publisher Collins. But now he has changed his tune and
signed up to make a multi-million mini-series, Spread Eagle, for Sky
Television which is half-owned by his old enemy Rupert Murdoch.
'If you can't beat them, join them,' trilled Follett, adding that, 'Murdoch
doesn't own a majority of Sky. That's important.'

The South African Parliamentary XV versus a combined House of Lords and
Commons XV - kick-off 10.30 at Richmond College - should be an entertaining
curtain-raiser before tomorrow's Anglo-Boer clash at Twickenham.
Of course, there won't be any blacks in the South African squad - they still
aren't represented in parliament - but it is otherwise a commendably
catholic affair. Even the ANC, through Rob Haswell, MP for Pietermaritzburg
South, is represented. Nic Koornhoff, MP for Swellendam, says the spirit in
the team is good - better than in parliament.
'The only area in which we might have a few problems is on the right wing.
There were no volunteers from the Conservative Party,' quips Koornhoff.
As with the Twickenham battle, the South Africans face an uphill struggle.
Their best hope would seem to lie in spiriting coach Theuns Stoffberg, a
formidable Springbok loose forward of recent years, onto the pitch.

The final hours of poor old Dan-Air were not as trouble free as first
thought. Observer hears that it was touch and go right up to the end whether
Dan Dare, as it was affectionately known, would arrive safely inside the
British Airways corporate hangar.
Admittedly, it would have been out of character if there had not been some
last-minute delays. The deal was supposed to have been signed off on Friday
November 6. By 3.30 the next morning, the signs on the Gatwick check-in
desks were being changed from Dan-Air to British Airways. However, the deal
had still not been signed and the nervous lawyers ordered the Dan-Air staff
to put back their signs and return to work.
It turned out that the last piece in the deal's jigsaw lay in the hands of a
Californian bank, which had to agree to the transfer of an aircraft lease.
Trouble was, the bank's executives were communing with nature and each
other, but not the outside world, in tents in the Sierra Nevada mountains. A
fax machine was back-packed into the wilderness and the deal was concluded
at 12.21 pm on Sunday.

A German diplomat describes how, in a conversation with one of his French

negotiations - where Gallic intransigence has been stiffened by the
Socialist government's worries about the March general elections.
'Why are you so worried about the elections?' the German asked. 'You've lost
them anyway.' To which came the reply, with appropriate hauteur: 'France
never loses elections.'

Which is worse, being mugged on Rio's Copacabana beach or sailing the next
8,800 mile leg of the British Steel round-the-world yacht race?
At least Adrian Donovan, the 34-year-old skipper of Heath Insured, has had
first-hand experience of the first. Four local lads carrying knives
attempted to relieve the gentle giant of the sea of his wallet while he was
out training the other day. Fortunately the six foot three Donovan, who
shouts like Hornblower, did not have to make a claim on his C E Heath

Let's hope that Donovan and his crew, who are definitely first division

to sail it.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Observer: Nuclear affront
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A particularly dirty little fight is going on in one corner of the great
battle to save the UK coal industry. The combatants are Nuclear Electric,
the state-owned utility which operates 12 nuclear stations in England and
Wales, and PowerGen, one of the two big privatised generation companies.
It started when Ed Wallis, PowerGen's hard-knuckle chief executive,
suggested that the best way to boost demand for coal-fired power was by
shutting down NE's ageing Magnox reactors.
Outraged noises emanated from NE's headquarters in Gloucester as Bob Hawley,
the newly appointed chief executive, roared into action. He fired off a
letter to Wallis, pointing out that he had got all his sums wrong. 'We
believe this is a time for a balanced and statesmanlike approach, not for
mischievous proposals and statements without a basis in fact,' he boomed.
But there was nothing very statesmanlike about NE's subsequent tactics.
Discreet notes were circulated to the press pointing out that PowerGen was
importing coal, burning the 'dirty fuel' orimulsion, and had been censured
by the electricity regulator for 'abusing' its dominant market position.
NE even dug up a 1979 note in which Wallis, then manager of Oldbury nuclear
power station, 'emphasised the future benefits of nuclear power and also the
possible consequences (eg the cost of alternatives) if nuclear power were
not developed in future years'.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Personal View: An American parallel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAY CALAMARO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'It's remarkably brief and simple,' a senior European Community official
told me. He was talking about the 10th amendment to the US constitution, one
of the reference sources consulted by the European Commission as it tries to
frame a workable doctrine of subsidiarity. 'Perhaps,' mused the official,
'life was simpler then too.' Perhaps, but no one should think that the US
had an easier time agreeing its constitution than Europe seems to be having
with the Maastricht treaty.
The similarities between 1992 and 1789 are striking: individual states are
loosely bound together but recognise they must forge a stronger union,
especially for commerce and security; representatives of the 12 states
(Rhode Island did not send a delegate to Philadelphia in 1787) meet and sign
a historic document which, if ratified, will create a new union; under that
union each state remains sovereign except for those specific powers given to
the union, and in those instances the union's authority is supreme; the new
document requires ratification by the states; a raging debate ensues where a
central issue, sometimes clearly stated but as often not, is local control
versus central authority.
The American experience seems to be relevant in many ways. We too found the
process of creating a union difficult and painful. The Constitutional
Convention worked from February to May 1787 to produce a document that was
argued over and modified during that hot summer. In September the
constitution was sent to the 13 states, only nine of which were required to
ratify. Eight months and three weeks passed before the ninth state, New
Hampshire, ratified, and eventually the other four came along as well. The
smallest, Rhode Island, displaying the spirit of today's Denmark, was last
to approve.
During those tense months, the outcome was far from certain. And even then,
10 new amendments to the constitution - known collectively as the Bill of
Rights and intended to clarify and establish the right of individuals
vis-a-vis the state - were adopted two years later. A charter with 10 new
amendments may seem soft concrete for a foundation, but there have only been
16 more amendments during the two centuries that followed.
Like the EC in 1992, the US in 1789 was divided into large, powerful states
and smaller ones which feared being dominated. In 1789 it was four large and
nine small; in 1992 it is five large and seven small. The US constitution is
filled with devices sought by the smaller states to provide protection from
the power of larger ones. Likewise, the question of big-versus-small states
has arisen at important moments during the debate on Maastricht. The young
US faced immediate growth, as the EC does now. Vermont was the first of the
37 new states to join after the original 13. The EC has applications for
membership from Finland, Sweden, Austria and others, and it may quickly grow
from 12 to 16, with more later.
The most important parallel with today's Europe is that Americans who
favoured union had some very powerful opponents within the 13 states.
Alexander Hamilton knew that if he lost one of the big four, the
constitution could fail to serve its purpose of unifying the young nation.
New York (with the then capital of the US, New York City) was uncertain at
best. The governor of New York, whose name happened to be Clinton, was a
powerful and wily opponent.
As an American who imported his US-made car to Brussels, eats his salad
first and prefers dry martinis to dry Sancerre, I have been accused of
excessive patriotism. But though I am as proud as a Little League father of
my country's birth in 1776 under the Articles of Confederation and 'rebirth'
in 1789 under our constitution, I must admit that what Europe is now doing
is perhaps, given the centuries of history with which Europe must contend,
even more impressive.
There are many other comparisons that might be drawn, and history can be
retold to prove almost anything. The point, however, is that the hardest
work is not in drafting a constitution but in getting it approved. No
American knew if the constitution would be ratified, and many doubted it.
Indeed, one retrospective measure of greatness among our founding fathers is
the skill they showed in arguing for ratification and winning over those who
threatened to oppose.
This is why the great American historian Clinton Rossiter called the
Federalist Papers - a series of essays published in 1787 and 1788 by
Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay, which forcefully advocated
the case for ratification and drove much of the debate - 'the most important
work in political science that has ever been written, or is likely ever to
be written, in the US'.
History suggests the game in Europe, far from being over, may just have
begun. Those who ask where are the heroes who will unify Europe should wait
a while; their question may soon be answered.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Public pay feels the squeeze: The prospects for UK wages
after the government's adoption of a more stringent approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK earnings are rising more slowly than at any time over the past 25 years;
average settlements in the private sector are starting to fall to less than
4 per cent; and labour militancy is virtually non-existent. So it may seem
odd that public attention is now focused on Britain's 'pay problem'.
But there are several grounds for concern, in both the public and private
sectors. For a government determined to hold down public expenditure without
hitting services or jobs too hard, the squeeze on the public sector's Pounds
80bn pay bill, announced yesterday, was probably unavoidable.
The decision to restrict all public sector pay awards to an upper limit of
1.5 per cent is not legally binding but the government can impose it
directly on 3m of the 5m public sector workers and most of the rest are
expected to follow suit.
There will, however, be serious reservations about brushing aside the
labyrinth of systems for determining pay in the public sector, and fears
that, after several years of peace, public sector pay tensions are being
stored up for the future. As one local government negotiator said yesterday:
'The problem is not going into squeezes; it's coming out of them.'
It was precisely to avoid disruptive lags and surges in public sector pay
that so many groups - including civil servants, nurses and teachers - were
granted special pay-setting arrangements which connect their wage rises to
pay trends in the private sector.
Some Whitehall officials are also worried that the government's
interventionism may be undermining its own drive to introduce more
decentralised, performance-related, methods of pay setting, similar to those
used in the private sector.
It is not clear what will now happen to pay in National Health Service trust
hospitals or opted-out schools, but it is almost certain that the
performance-related pay schemes accepted reluctantly earlier this year by
teachers and civil servants will become more difficult to apply.
Yet if the public sector squeeze does have the added effect, as the
government hopes, of further restraining private sector pay awards, it will
have achieved something important.
For, despite decentralised and performance-related pay, the private sector
has not yet delivered the wages discipline that was hoped for by the
government. Moreover, Britain's withdrawal from the European exchange rate
mechanism on September 16 has raised fears of further backsliding.
In the short term, so long as economic recovery remains sluggish and
inflation does not take off, that is unlikely. But it is vital that the
fruits of the devaluation which has occurred since Black Wednesday should
fall to profits, investment and thus job creation, and not to wage increases
for those already in jobs.
Since the pay boom of the late 1980s, led by the better paid, wage rises
have been falling. But it is difficult to identify how much of the credit
lies with ERM membership and how much with recession.
Although, crucially, the effects of ERM membership on pay bargaining were
never tested in an upturn, ERM supporters argue that, by locking in low
inflation and preventing employers being bailed out by devaluation, the
psychology of wage inflation was being broken.
But the Confederation of British Industry's excited claims over the last few
months about breaking the 'inflation-plus' mentality - in or out of the ERM
 -is premature. About three-quarters of all pay settlements in the three
months to September provided for increases above inflation - currently 3.6
per cent.
The CBI's own figures for manufacturing wage increases show a rise of 4.2
per cent for the third quarter of 1992, virtually the same as for the last
quarter of 1991. Productivity increased during that period by 2 per cent,
but this was almost entirely owing to job cuts. Moreover, the average
earnings figures for the whole economy, announced yesterday, showed a rise
of 5.5 per cent over a 12-month period in which inflation has averaged just
less than 4 per cent.
In recent years the lowest growth in real wages came in 1989 and 1990 when
inflation took off, briefly, catching many pay bargainers by surprise.
Conversely, the strongest real earnings growth came in the mid-1980s, when
inflation was relatively low. Real earnings growth in the past year was
lower than it was then, but is still nearly 50 per cent above inflation.
So, should there have been a squeeze or freeze on pay in both the public and
private sectors, as suggested by local government employers and some
speakers at this week's CBI conference?
Mr David Layton, an expert on wage bargaining and founder of Incomes Data
Services, the pay research group, suggests that, as it is easier to get
agreement on the timing of pay increases than on their size, all employers
should postpone pay increases by three months whenever they arise over the
next year. This would have the effect of implementing a pay freeze for three
months.
A government which has always set its face against repeating the incomes
policy experiments of the 1970s was unlikely to find that an attractive
option. In any case Britain no longer has the institutions to enforce such a
solution, even for the sake of investment-led growth and job creation.
Coming a week after the 20th anniversary of Sir Edward Heath's failed freeze
on pay and prices, yesterday's overt pay squeeze in the public sector is
clearly embarrassing enough for the government.
Apart from its clear need to control public sector spending, it justifies
its targeting of the public sector by arguing that job security, despite
recent shake-ups, is still far greater than in the private sector. More
important, public sector pay has recently been increasing at a much faster
rate than in the private sector.
Between April 1990 and April 1992, public sector pay rose 21 per cent, while
private sector pay rose 14 per cent and inflation rose 11 per cent.
But comparing public and private sector pay is a complex matter. As Mr Bill
Brett, general secretary of IPMS, the civil service union, says: 'Public
sector pay follows a similar cycle to that of the private sector but with a
lag. By suppressing the second part of the pay cycle where public sector
workers catch up, the government will create disparities in pay which will
require resolution at a later date.'
According to Mr Chris Trinder, of the Public Finance Foundation, pay rises
in the public and private sector have roughly matched each other over the
past 20 years. But he points out that within that span it is very easy to
'prove' that private has outstripped public, or vice-versa, by careful
selection of the year taken as the starting point.
Comparing actual pay, as opposed to pay rises, in the public and private
sectors is even more messy. According to official statistics average pay in
the public sector is again higher than that in the private sector, as it
was, surprisingly, every year from 1973 to 1986.
Pay analysts are quick to argue that adjusting for the structure of
employment - which means allowing for the fact that there are
proportionately more white-collar workers in the public sector - the private
sector does better, at least for men.
Average gross weekly pay for male manual workers in the public sector in
1991-92 was Pounds 259.70 compared with Pounds 270.50 in the private sector.
For male white-collar workers the gap is slightly greater, Pounds 388.10 in
the public sector and Pounds 405.40 in the private sector.
On the other hand women workers and the low paid generally do better in the
public sector, especially now that some of the lowest-paying jobs have been
contracted out, and particular groups like nurses have shot up the pay
league.
Whatever the overall justice of temporarily suppressing public sector pay,
the way the government proposes to do it is bound to be seen as unfair by
those in the public sector who have been doing less well. In the current
year, for example, local government manual workers received a rise of 4.1
per cent compared with 9.5 per cent for teachers.
The local government employers, worried that a two-tier public service pay
league has emerged, with their own manual workers at the bottom, will at
least be relieved that the government is excluding no special groups, like
firemen and policeman, from the squeeze.
When the squeeze begins in earnest next April, with the next public sector
pay round, local authorities are likely to follow the government's
guidelines and cut pay rises rather than services and jobs.
The greatest protests yesterday came from the de facto suspension of the pay
review bodies, especially that for the nurses, and the special pay formula
for firemen. But despite public sympathy towards nurses, it is unlikely that
the trade union movement will be able to put itself at the head of another
spasm of protest, similar to that over pit closures. As one senior union
official admitted yesterday: 'With anxiety over job security as bad as it is
I doubt we will see much protest.'
The government also emphasises with some justice, that restraint on pay
feeds directly into preserving or creating jobs, especially in local
government and the NHS. However, the IPMS argues that a shift to capital
spending, which is less labour intensive than current spending, could have a
negative effect on total employment. Assuming a saving of Pounds 1.8bn on
the public sector pay bill, it estimates that more than 200,000 jobs could
be threatened.
Pay freezes in the private sector have never covered more than about 10 per
cent of settlements but a few high-profile freezes now would certainly help
the government's cause - and they may be coming. Workers at Rover and many
GEC plants have accepted freezes with little complaint, and at Rolls-Royce
the unions agreed to extend a freeze from six to nine months in exchange for
no redundancies.
The Trades Union Congress is unlikely to make a similar offer at national
level, partly because it is formally committed to free collective bargaining
but also because it does not trust the government to deliver its side of a
bargain on jobs or helping the low paid.
Yet no formal pay squeeze has ever worked without union support, and the TUC
will certainly be doing its best to make sure that public service workers
claw back as much as they can in 1994-95. That pent-up wage pressure could
coincide with a strongly recovering economy and rising inflation to produce
a dangerous cocktail by that time.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Leading Article: France dreams of Emu
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRUISED but not beaten, the French franc has survived the currency
turbulence of recent weeks. Yet while French authorities' commitment to
maintaining the franc's parity with the D-Mark may be strengthened, it is
still far from secure. With luck and co-operation from its partners, France
can avoid a devaluation and progress towards its favoured goal of a European
monetary union. But getting from here to there will be a hazardous trip.
The franc looks to be out of the woods, at least for the moment. Having
depreciated to a low of DM3.426 in the week after the French referendum, the
recent weakness of the D-Mark has allowed the franc to climb back towards
the centre of its band while the Bank of France has recovered the reserves
it sold to defend the parity.
Yesterday's decision by the Bank of France to cut its intervention rates by
a further quarter of a percentage point reflects this recovery. Short-term
money market interest rates have already fallen by more than 5 percentage
points since their September high, easing the pressure on the French banking
sector. Long-term interest rates have also fallen sharply, reducing the
yield difference with Germany back to the levels before the Danish
referendum.
Yet the French economy still has the growth cards stacked against it. At 9.4
per cent, French short-term interest rates remain painfully high. Low French
consumer price inflation means that in real terms these interest rates
represent a vice-like grip for consumers and industrialists. Moreover, this
fall in short-term interest rates - by more than a percentage point since
the summer - masks the tightening in the overall monetary stance that has
occurred as a result of the depreciation of the lira and sterling. The
franc, despite the dollar's recent strength, has still appreciated on a
trade weighted basis by 5 per cent since the first half of the year.
German interest rates still hold the key to French monetary policy. The
likely tardy easing from the Bundesbank, in the face of persistent German
government inertia, will hold French interest rates high, while deepening
Germany's impending recession. The resulting slow growth, rising
unemployment and political discontent in France remain the biggest threat to
the franc fort policy. Consumer and business confidence have sunk over the
summer as growth has dwindled. Finance minister Mr Michel Sapin remains
emphatically committed to the policy. But as next spring's election looms,
the pressure for lower French interest rates will grow.
Little wonder that Mr Francois Mitterrand is annoyed at Britain's go-slow
policy on Maastricht. A shift to narrower currency bands within ERM might
reduce French room for manoeuvre, as would confirmation of the independence
of the Bank of France. But neither is likely to allow French interest rates
to fall below Germany's. A single currency is the best answer to France's
current monetary powerlessness. A northern currency area, including the Efta
countries but without southern Europe, looks the likeliest route. Britain
may well choose to exercise its opt-out on Emu. But first, the UK must opt
in to Maastricht.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Trial in Berlin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER state of East Germany was a sham. In 1990 this apparent bulwark
of Euro-Stalinism collapsed, as its people discovered they could have
democracy (and D-Marks) without Soviet intervention. Yet it was a sham in
which West Germany, and the western community, acquiesced. Mr Erich
Honecker, the former East German leader, believed that Germany would have to
remain divided, at least for a couple of generations, in the interest of
European and world security. This was not a particularly edifying view. But
it was, in a curious sense, a comforting one - to many Germans, as well as
to the world outside.
Mr Honecker, though rigid, was a man with whom one could do business.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl demonstrated this when he welcomed the communist
leader to Bonn in 1987. Transcripts released since show that, after
lecturing Mr Honecker about the shooting of Germans killed attempting to
flee westwards, Mr Kohl discussed with his guest improvements in tourism and
town twinning.
Mr Honecker is now an 80-year-old pensioner dying of cancer. His trial, on
charges of ordering the manslaughter of some of these unfortunate would-be
escapees, started yesterday in Berlin. The proceedings serve several
different purposes. As Germany struggles to heal the wounds of the past and
meet the challenges of the future, it is necessary that desire for justice
should not become entangled with a search for scapegoats and revenge.
The outcome of the trial will presumably not be influenced by political
pressures. Yet the circumstances under which it is held can hardly be
divorced from current politics. Following the conviction of guards found
guilty of border killings, Mr Honecker is being brought to book partly to
correct the popular conception that the 'small fish' in the former hierarchy
are being punished, while those giving the orders go free. His trial aims to
show that the Germans can deal humanely and properly with a difficult
legacy. It may, in a laudable way, throw fresh light on that history. But it
may also give Mr Honecker the opportunity - the last he will get, before
being summoned to a still worthier celestial tribunal - to deliver his own
version of events. Mr Honecker's defence is not simply that he himself was
carrying out orders (in this case, from Moscow). Rather it is that, by
'defending' - albeit in an unpleasant way - the borders of the late German
Democratic Republic, he was also defending a postwar order which most of the
world found convenient, if not palatable.
To prove his guilt, the prosecutors will have to show that Mr Honecker
specifically broke laws then on the East German statute book by infringing
the wider judicial standards of a civilised society. It will be a demanding
task. The intention is to apportion guilt and responsibility for the past.
The danger is that, if too many uncomfortable questions are left hanging,
the process could poison rather than cleanse the air over reunified Germany.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Overloaded Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITHIN THE Group of Seven industrialised countries, the Bank of England is
sui generis. Perhaps surprisingly, in the light of its historical role in
the development of central banking practice, it enjoys less formal power and
influence in the conduct of monetary policy than most of its peers. Yet its
activities over the past decade have extended way beyond monetary policy and
banking supervision to such diversions as coaxing the Stock Exchange into
the modern world and helping rescue industrial companies from oblivion.
Against the background of Britain's ignominious departure from the ERM and
the Bingham report's criticisms on BCCI, the Bank's unusual combination of
interests looks striking. Could Britain's postwar failures of monetary
policy and banking supervision owe something to a conflict between these
diverse roles?
The range of the Bank of England's activities lay outside Bingham's scope,
which no doubt explains why there is no more than a passing reference to
such conflicts in the report. Yet it is hard to believe that the culture of
the institution could be unaffected by its top executives' preoccupation
with the competitiveness of the City of London. Much of London's competitive
edge in the European time zone derives from the Bank of England's open-door
policy to foreign banks and, in earlier decades, its light regulatory touch.
Yet BCCI cried out for just the opposite treatment. To expect central
bankers to wear kid-gloves in one department, while turning abruptly
adversarial in another, looks an admirable recipe for supervisory failure.
The question of whether monetary policy and banking supervision should be
combined in the same institution is more difficult. Some central bankers
argue that if they are required to act as lenders of last resort, they must
be allowed to play a part in supervising the banks. Others claim that the
lender of last resort function is incompatible with their anti-inflationary
mandate. The noteworthy point is that the US Federal Reserve and the
Bundesbank, which are not directly responsible for supervision, have much
better records on inflation than central banks with a wider remit. All of
which underlines the case for a far deeper review of the roles of the
Treasury and the Bank.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Arts: Gateway to the Orient - The new Hotung Gallery at the
British Museum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The story of the Joseph E. Hotung Gallery of Oriental Antiquities, unveiled
this week at the British Museum, has already entered museum folklore.
Hotung, an international businessman from Hongkong, collects Chinese
antiquities, particularly jades. On every trip to London Hotung would go to
peer at the BM's exceptional collection of oriental antiquities on the first
floor gallery of the King Edward VII wing.
In this vast, gloomy space, following the path of stray sunbeams used to be
the only way to get a good view of the objects. Finally, Hotung told Jessica
Rawson, Keeper of Oriental Antiquities, he would like to pay for new
lighting. Rawson's opportunistic reply was, why not a total face-lift?
Thanks to Hotung's gift of Pounds 2m, the process is complete whereby the
unfrequented north entrance to the Museum has become a true gateway to the
East. On the ground floor, Islamic art occupies the intimate, ravishing John
Addis Gallery; two floors up is the sparsely elegant Japanese gallery. In
between is the Joseph E. Hotung Gallery of Oriental Antiquities, a survey of
the arts of China, South and Southeastern Asia from Neolithic times to the
modern day.
Few galleries in the world can hold a candle to the new Hotung gallery for
visual impact - quite apart from the inexhaustible fascination of its
contents. Sir John James Burnet's original design, completed in 1914, was
very grand although savaged by decades of vandalism. Now again visitors see
a clear vista down the centre of this immense pillared room, 110 metres
long. Natural light enters each side through tall windows of frosted glass.
A colour scheme of white and gold may sound rather de trop, but the Japanese
trick of not burnishing the squares of gold leaf means the walls provide a
discreetly shimmering background for the gold and brass treasures from a
thousand temples. The original mahogany cases still frame each bay, only now
they are superbly lit so that one sees from one case through to another, the
objects seeming to float in space.
There are even more objects on view than before. Around 30 per cent of the
display comes out of storage. For curators of earlier generations (and in
some museums the attitude still prevails) gaudily jewelled trumpets from
Tibet would seem out of place beside the classically construed excellences
of oriental art.
Labelling in the Hotung Gallery is enormously kind to beginners, yet not
condescending. The logic of the arrangement is strong, otherwise such
quantities of stuff, ranging from jade hair-pins to temple doors, could only
give the most infernal indigestion. Extending through the eastern half is
China, presided over by the famous glazed statues of temple guardians and
virtuous monks. Around the walls, a chronological display emphasises the
immense antiquity of Chinese civilisation and the sophistication of its
artifacts, but also points to the underlying philosophical and religious
ideas. In an inspired stroke, we are given extracts from love poems and
laws. In 1050 BC, a Zhou emperor is reminded that 'being king, he must not
use extermination as a punishment to control the people.'
In the second half of the gallery the single greatest theme must, of course,
be the exploration of Buddhism and Hinduism. A sense of order and
intellectual rigour is abruptly displaced by the swaying forms of incredibly
sensual beings, those 'much maligned monsters' who so shocked and baffled
Europeans in their early encounters with the temple art of Southern Asia.
And that leads to the extraordinary finale. Through glass doors, we glimpse
great carved rosettes, the stylised lotus-flowers so ubiquitous in oriental
art from India to China. These once stood as railings to a vast, now
devastated Buddhist stupa (a monumental shrine housing relics of the Buddha)
in Andrha Pradesh which was embellished with the most elaborate and
accomplished sculpture of its age.
For the first time in 40 years, the sculptures of Amaravati can be seen.
Pollution was eating into these extraordinary limestone carved slabs, 100 of
them which were brought to this country in the last century. A gift from the
Asahi Shimbun newspaper, already a generous benefactor to the BM, has paid
for an air-conditioned room so that these massive reliefs could be raised
from the basement - no small feat.
We now discover Indian sculpture from the 1st and 2nd centuries AD so
powerfully inventive that these carvings must rank beside the Assyrian
reliefs and even the Parthenon frieze, as one of the British Museum's
greatest possessions. Of course, one visit will not be enough to work out
what is going on in these scenes. Yet even one visit is enough to reveal the
skill of these sculptors, above all, their ability to convey a narrative of
the life of Buddha even in the most crowded scenes.
In languid courtly entertainments, large-breasted women strike postures
which to this day are learnt by Indian classical dancers. What pleasure
Ingres would have derived from the half-naked female musicians who, seated
cross-legged with their lutes, are straight out of his harem fantasies. The
opening of the Hotung gallery is an event truly worth trumpetting. Nothing
less than a new vision of the arts of the Orient awaits the British Museum's
admiring public.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
With royalty and prime ministers in attendance, and the trumpeters of the
Welsh Guard sounding the opening fanfares, the Barbican festival devoted to
the arts of the Nordic countries received on Tuesday its grand ceremonial
launching. It continues until mid-December, and shows a boldness of
imagination in the planning that makes event after event a mouthwatering
enticement. The umbrella title - 'Tender is the North', a Tennyson quotation
that sounds like a play of words on Scott Fitzgerald - is a misjudgment, and
its subtitular reference to Scandinavian arts has caused irritation to those
countries (Finland, Iceland) not part of Scandinavia; but in general the
series deserves to win the warmest of welcomes.
Whether the first two concerts, by the Oslo Philharmonic, offered the most
substantial way of launching the series is an awkward question. The
orchestra, under its conductor Mariss Jansons, has developed into an
ensemble of first-rate quality: that much had become clear in its previous
visits and was amply confirmed. But the programmes, whose high points were
fresh, impassioned, alertly balanced and often thrilling performances of a
Russian symphony (the Rakhmaninov Second, on Tuesday ) and a Russian ballet
score (The Rite of Spring, on Wednesday), can hardly be said to have made an
unimpeachably powerful statement of the Nordic musical aesthetic.
The problem was, alas, the contemporary Norwegian works chosen - in
principle, absolutely correctly - to fill out the programmes. Nothing is
flatter, staler and less profitable than the modern-music fashions of
yesterday; and both Arne Nordheim's Tenebrae (1982) for cello (the excellent
young Norwegian Truls Mork) and Olav Anton Thommessen's 1986 Concerto for
synthesiser and orchestra seemed on this evidence to contain no more than
their debts to international musical fashion.
The cello essay, written for Rostropovich, meanders on in elegantly
etiolated style, contemplating a handful of 'frozen North' musical cliches a
good deal more seriously, and lengthily, than one felt they deserved. The
synthesiser concerto, for twiddly soloist and thump-thump accompaniment,
merits a kindly veil of obscurity drawn over its state-of-the-art
banalities; in comparison the Grieg piano concerto (with Leif Ove Andsnes
its exquisitely poetic soloist), sounded positively Biblical in profundity.
On now to the Nielsen and Sibelius cycles, the complete Peer Gynt and Saul
and David in concert, and all the other genuine Nordic riches.

I very much admire Phoenix Dance Company. The troupe emerged a decade ago
from the inspiring dance teaching offered by two schools in Leeds, Harehills
and Intake - have other educational authorities absorbed the message about
serious training in an art as a way of realising youthful potential? - and
its original complement of five young black men soon won public and critical
acclaim. The company expanded, acquiring five women, official subvention,
and the appurtenances of success. It retains, though, the freshness and
vigour, and the physical distinction, which it had from the very first.
As an ensemble of dancers it must be ranked very high for the rhythmic
alertness, the fine flash of step and limb, the clarity of its dancing.
Though the repertory has, from the first, been uneven - and sometimes dire -
Phoenix style has come to the rescue. Returned for a brief season to
Sadler's Wells this week the company is in magnificent form, albeit its
repertory has a somewhat reach-me-down air.
The best piece is Aletta Collins' Gang of Five, made for the men of the
ensemble. The chaps look very natty in suits and the right trimmings for a
business interview, even down to gold-rimmed spectacles. There seems a
double theme: about conformity - the gang will not tolerate deviation from
the sartorial code - and (with the appearance of a man dressed in rather
more hip gear, with dreadlocks) about what young black men are expected to
wear. I don't think either of these ideas matters much. What holds us
enthralled is superb physical statement by the cast: hair-trigger reactions;
lithe, brilliant steps; and a subtle expression of feeling. They are all
fine actors as well as fine dancers.
The company's dramatic powers rescue an entirely vapid work, Family by
Danial Shapiro and Joanie Smith, where the dancers perform acrobatics on,
over, around an armchair. The playing is warm, funny, ebullient; the piece
is none of these. Nor is there much to commend in Bebe Miller's Spartan
Reels save the fact that its brings Phoenix dancers on stage. Its manner is
bland, but Phoenix's artists pan for gold, and find some nuggets. I was
bewitched by one girl in the troupe - the programme was absolutely no help
in identifying the dancers - who just had to dance, and did so with the most
enchanting humour.
The programme is completed by Philip Taylor's Sacred Space, which was on
view in last year's Wells season, when it boasted a handsome back drop by
Norman Perryman. It has an air of faintly dubious religiosity - a seance
where the medium has been at rather different spirits than those coming
through from 'the beyond' - but it gets heart-whole performance from its
cast.
The evening suggests how expert the company is at making dance bricks with
very little creative straw. As an ensemble it is most gifted. Its repertory,
as I noted last year, needs to rise to the level of the dancers' artistry. I
would love to see them challenged by great choreography, by revivals of
major dance pieces. They merit nothing less than the best.
Phoenix Dance is at Sadler's Wells until November 14. The company is

FT  13 NOV 92 / Arts: An Ideal Husband - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is not one cabinet minister's wife that should not rush along to see
this play. It would be better yet if their husbands would accompany them -
but are they men enough to take it? Oscar Wilde's 1895 treatment of
political corruption and cover-up - as exposed and handled at home - returns
to the London stage at so ripe a moment that its audience gasps at the
nerves it touches. Not that An Ideal Husband is scathing. On the contrary,
it is so morally pellucid, and so witty, generous and humane, that it might
well reduce our political masters to embarrassed tears.
Sir Robert, the blackmailed hero of the piece, is, in fact, placed by Wilde
under a light less searching than is his wife. Lady Chiltern is an idealist,
who thinks her husband ideal, then rejects him bitterly when she finds he is
not. A character closer to Ibsen than any of Shaw's heroines - close to
Trollope, too - she has to learn to live in a world that is not ideal but
real. It is Wilde's genius that he sets the problems of this basically
serious, seldom humorous, couple amid all the glittering repartee and banter
of high society. An Ideal Husband is a brilliant comedy, and it keeps
revealing the deep seriousness on which high comedy is constructed.
Peter Hall's staging is excellent, alert to the full dimensions of the play,
and and with unostentatious but elegant designs by Carl Toms. There are
flaws, and no wonder: An Ideal Husband keeps up so perpetual a juggling-act
between frivolity and profundity that even its smaller roles are exquisitely
difficult to play.
Take Martin Shaw, who plays Lord Goring, the endlessly amusing aesthete who
saves the Chilterns' marriage - surely the play's hardest role. He has the
authority to convey the moral seriousness behind the dandy's facade. Yet he
radiates not only self-satisfaction but also affectation. It is a pity that,
in his effort to resemble Wilde himself, Shaw demonstrates a hitherto
unsuspected likeness to Ken Dodd.
The great performance in this staging comes from David Yelland as Sir
Robert, who shows all the role's ambition, gravitas, and torment to
perfection. His wordless gasps are as memorable as his deep-baritone voice.
There is a frigidity in his wife that Hannah Gordon misses. Her Lady
Chiltern is handsome, rigorous, self-assured and surprisingly forceful. She
is at her best in the final act, when her reconciliation with her husband is
movingly and delicately negotiated.
Though Anna Carteret could be more dangerous and more natural as the
anti-heroine Mrs Cheveley, she wields every scrap of sensual elegance in her
armoury to fine effect. Dulcie Gray plays Lady Markby with hilarious
brusqueness. Unfortunately, Michael Dennison - never a convincing actor -
dreadfully overdoes Lord Caversham's bluff-but-charming-old-codger
humourlessness.
Victoria Hasted brings off Lady Mabel, Sir Robert's sister, very well; but
to play this role as a bespectacled, nasal, energetic hoyden is an amusing
mistake. Wilde's stage directions compare her to both a flower and a Tanagra
statuette. But nothing in this production, thanks to Peter Hall's grasp,
diminishes the scope of this enthralling play.

The British tabloid press is accused of treating the royal family
destructively. But is television's attitude really healthier? You certainly
know what to expect: sycophancy first, last and always is the TV rule
because television needs co-operation from the royals to get access for its
equipment. Hence years of bowing and scraping whatever the royal subject.
Royal Gardens continues the tradition; the only hints of criticism are
directed at the dead. The final episode (8.30 BBC2) features Prince Charles'
garden at Highgrove, 'One of the most important gardens laid out in the
1980s in this country'. Well of course, bow, scrape, bow.
Alison Steadman stars in a second series under the title Gone To Seed (8.00
ITV). However, while title, stars, and social setting - parvenu Londoners -
remain, the characters and their relationships have been changed. Warren
Clarke, Jim Broadbent and Steadman now play triplets.
Those who have never seen Renoir's classic 1937 war movie La Grande Illusion
should watch it for the first time (11.20 BBC2). Everyone else should watch
it again.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Arts: Ivo Pogorelich - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Tuesday the Croatian pianist Ivo Pogorelich donated his services for a
benefit recital 'in aid of Historic Sites of Dubrovnik, under the auspices
of the International Monuments Trust, Croatia Appeal, and supported by the
International Council on Monuments and Sites UK'. Gratifyingly, the Royal
Festival Hall was packed out.
A brilliant but wilful artist, Pogorelich was on his best behaviour -
granted that the first half of his announced programme was replaced by
completely different music: one had been looking forward to his Skryabin op.
32. Best behaviour, however, is not the same thing as best form. Though I
last heard him banging away unmercifully at Schumann in the Barbican, he has
since then recorded Chopin's Preludes with astonishing imagination and
extreme technical finesse. Here, his Chopin (replacing Skryabin, Mozart and
Brahms) was immaculate in its way, but distinctly tame.
The opening of the big C minor Nocturne was superb and unexpected: a
suspended hush, with beautifully liquid basses under a poignant singing
line. For the 'poco piu lento' middle, Pogorelich chose to move much faster,
and the grand reprise was decorative rather than cathartic. The late
Nocturne in E was similarly gracious, content to display a fastidious
surface, and much the same could be said of his B minor Sonata - plenty of
genteel feeling, little dramatic stress or electricity, even in the harried
Finale.
After the interval he addressed himself to Ravel's Valses nobles et
sentimentales, with intriguing results. There was a plethora of swooning
rubati, of spikey staccato when the music predicates the opposite, of shy
counter-melodies so spotlit as to hide the main tunes. It was for just such
idiosyncrasies that Ravel denied his old friend and champion Ricardo Vines
the premieres of everything he wrote for the piano after Gaspard de la nuit,
from the Valses onward. Yet Pogorelich administered so much character of his
own, consistent and vivid, that it would have been pedantic to repine.
He played Rakhmaninov's rhapsodic B-flat minor Sonata in the familiar,
pointlessly truncated version. (Not by a long way the best of Rakhmaninov,
the piece nonetheless deserves to keep its original proportions.) As sheer
piano-playing it was constantly fascinating, but no larger vision imposed
itself. So too with his encore, Balakirev's Islamey: it was sensationally
swift, accurate and quite without physical thrills. At the inspired
modulation at the start of the reprise, which is arguably the master-stroke
of the piece, Pogorelich clattered heedlessly straight through.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Technology: Firing shots at the influenza virus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A shot in the arm could prevent a week in bed according to the proponents of
influenza vaccinations. But in the UK, this particular dose of preventive
medicine has found few takers in the corporate world.
Of the 4m to 4.5m doses of 'flu vaccines administered in the UK this year,
most will be to elderly people or others at high risk - those with breathing
difficulties, for example.
Yet vaccination at Pounds 5 a dose could, in many cases, save a company
major disruption and a temporary staff bill of hundreds of pounds, should
the virus strike.
One theory as to why 'flu vaccinations have been overlooked in corporate
Britain is that the drug companies are geared up to selling to family
doctors or hospitals, not corporate medical departments.
But companies that do offer vaccination have often found little interest
from employees. Individuals are often sceptical about whether vaccinations
work and many have painful memories of 'flu jabs in the past.
As to the latter, manufacturers scoff. Gone are the days when the vaccine
was given on a Friday afternoon so that employees could recover over the
weekend - outside office hours, says Tom Dick, marketing director at Merieux
UK.
The latest vaccines are surface antigens where the parts of the virus that
promote the immune response are extracted for use. Whole cell vaccines,
where virus cells are killed to produce the vaccine, are also used.
As to the efficacy of the vaccines there is widespread debate. The
Department of Health claims that 70 per cent of people who have the vaccine
will be able to shrug off the virus. More important, the vaccines are more
than 90 per cent effective in preventing the life-threatening complications
associated with 'flu, such as pneumonia.
The problem, says Douglas Fleming, director of the Birmingham Research Unit
of Royal College of General Practitioners, is that people want complete
immunity following vaccination. 'Because 'flu is such a common disease a lot
of people who have been vaccinated will still get the illness,' he says.
One reason for this failure is that the virus changes as it spreads. As a
result, says Mike Herrity, medical affairs manager at Evans Medical, part of
Medeva, manufacturers are always chasing the disease. The vaccine to be
administered in the autumn has to be prepared over the summer months
following recommendations by the World Health Organisation in February.
The WHO tracks the spread of viruses from the Far East through Australia and
the US, in order to guess which vaccine strains will give best protection
against the illness in western Europe. This year the three strains
recommended are the same as last year - A Singapore, A Beijing and B
Yamagata.
The chances of catching 'flu if not inoculated are impossible to calculate.
The WHO and the drug makers admit themselves at a loss when predicting
severe 'flu attacks, although the A strains are more serious than the B
strains.
One reason for this difficulty is that once every 10 to 20 years the virus,
instead of altering character as it spreads, changes its character quite
radically. This altered strain of virus catches the medical world unprepared
and can result in thousands of lost working hours and even deaths. That
said, even in winters where the incidence of the virus is low, between
3,000-4,000 deaths are attributed to 'flu in the UK alone.

innovation is put on ice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Karl Krapek apologises for the noisy air conditioning in the office in
Connecticut from where he runs Carrier, the Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn)
heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment subsidiary of
United Technologies (UTC).
'It's not one of our systems,' the chairman, president and chief executive
of the world's largest HVAC company hastens to add. But Krapek, who displays
a daunting grasp of all the issues and statistics in a complex,
fast-changing industry, will not let it distract him from his task - nothing
less than beating the Japanese.
'This is one of the last planned experiments to see if a US company with a
global product can maintain leadership against the Japanese,' he says
ambitiously. 'We're sitting here 42 per cent bigger than Matsushita (in
HVAC), and my job is to ensure that 20 years from now - whoever's sitting in
my chair - we're still there.'
After Carrier, which has 11 per cent of the world HVAC market and accounted
for about one fifth of UTC's Dollars 20.8bn sales last year, Japanese
companies rank second to eighth with a combined 45 per cent share. And while
HVAC may not be able to match UTC's Pratt &amp; Whitney jet engines and Sikorsky
helicopters for glamour, there is plenty at stake.
Carrier expects the world HVAC market to grow by more than 65 per cent to
Dollars 40bn by the end of the century, paced by growth in the Pacific Rim
but also by expansion in Europe - which is emerging as the key global
battleground. The prices are higher and the market is far less mature than
North America. On top of that are the untapped opportunities in eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union.
At the same time, the industry - one of the world's big users of
ozone-damaging refrigerants - is having to face the cost of responding to
environmental pressures by adapting or even redesigning its product ranges.
For all these reasons, Krapek wants Carrier to be financially stronger. 'Our
profits have been too low over the past couple of years to even threaten the
survivability of the company,' he says, 'and I don't want to go to UTC for
investment dollars.'
Up until 1988, it looked as if Carrier, whose founder Willis Carrier gave
birth to the air conditioning industry, was playing right into the hands of
its newer Japanese competitors. Carrier made his first sale of 'Apparatus
for Treating Air' in 1904, and the company has by far the broadest product
range in the business, from small window-mounted room-conditioners to huge
chillers for office blocks and shopping malls.
But in the mid-1980s, it was underspending on technology, under-using the
potentially significant benefits of learning from its UTC sister companies,
and - by viewing air conditioning as a commodity product - had lost its
focus on customer service.
As a result, Carrier let its Japanese rivals steal a march on product
features and innovation at the smaller end of the market. The venerable US
company lost eight points of North American market share from 1985 to 1991.
The fight back began in 1988, when George David, the senior UTC executive
who had oversight of both Carrier and Otis Elevator, decided that technology
in the air conditioning industry did matter.
William Wilson, Krapek's predecessor at Carrier, set in train a recovery
strategy, while Krapek joined Carrier from Otis in September 1990 and has
had the difficult task of implementing the strategy.
He established six core technologies - heat transfer, compression, air
management, refrigerants, indoor air quality and variable speed electronics.
In compression technology - a key area as the compressor can account for
one-third of the cost of smaller units - Carrier has leaned heavily on
Pratt's expertise in the development of a new range of efficient 'scroll'
compressors, which have hitherto defied attempts to manufacture them
economically.
Elsewhere, manufacturing techniques are being modernised, reducing
floorspace and raising productivity. In Europe, Carrier's three main
factories in France, Spain and Italy are taking responsibility for different
product lines, and the Italian plant near Milan is half way through a
Dollars 60m programme to reduce manufacturing costs.
To help catch up with the electronics expertise of Japanese rivals such as
Toshiba, Krapek has hired Gerald Wilson, former dean of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, to be Carrier's head of engineering. Overall,
Carrier's annual research and development spending has risen from 1.6 per
cent of sales in 1989 to 3 per cent.
The results are beginning to come through, but it will be a long process.
'You don't take big companies like these and fix them in two years,' says
Krapek.
Last year, Carrier's pre-tax return on sales was a meagre 1 per cent, but,
says Krapek, Carrier ought to be up to around 8 per cent by the end of the
decade, and in any case needs to get up into the 4-5 per cent range quickly.
Looking ahead, one analyst says, 'raising margins to 5-6 per cent ought to
be achievable,' and Krapek himself feels comfortable with his targets. 'I
know where the waste is, where the inventory is, where the lead times are
still too long, and where we still have the wrong products.'

THE flashing yellow Belisha beacon introduced by UK transport minister
Leslie Hore-Belisha in the 1930s has become camouflaged in the high street
by improved street lighting, brighter shop fronts and a multitude of
advertising hoardings.
To help drivers spot the beacons more easily, Geo Safety Products, of
Wokingham, together with ICI Acrylics, of Darwin, Lancashire, have developed
a more visible yellow dome to sit on top of the installed poles and bulbs.
The dome uses a luminous pigment which converts the light produced from the
60-watt bulb from the red end of the spectrum to the yellow/green end,
making it more visible to the human eye. In addition, the plastic dome
reflects the sun's ultra-violet light back as visible light during the
daytime, while at night a diamond pattern inside the dome refracts the light
for increased visibility. Geo Safety Products: UK, 0734 770473.

Companies interested in touch-screen technology but reticent to throw away
existing personal computers could find the answer in TouchMate, a two-inch
high, pressure-sensitive platform which sits beneath the PC monitor and
converts the ordinary PC into a touch-screen model. Developed in the US by
Visage, and sold in Europe by Ellinor Technology, TouchMate costs Pounds
650.
When the screen is touched, plates in the platform sense the pressure; from
that, TouchMate calculates the location of the pressure. The PC, running
Windows software, then carries out the task as instructed.
To install the system the user sits the monitor on the platform and then
connects the two via the PC's serial port.
To calibrate the system, the user touches the four corners of the screen.
The TouchMate software adjusts constantly to allow for background noise or
wobble. Ellinor Technology: UK, 0734 311066; Visage: US, 508 620 7100.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Memo card that takes dictation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why do the best ideas always emerge when you're in the bath or driving along
the motorway, with no scrap of paper at hand to jot them down?
With this in mind, Creative Technologies Marketing, of Douglas, Isle of Man,
has developed a voice memo card, the size of a credit card, which can be
used for recording phone numbers, messages or simply transient thoughts.
Four buttons on the surface enable the owner to record, stop, erase or play
back the messages.
The card, which can be kept in a pocket or on the dashboard of a car, uses
chip from Texas Instruments to record up to 24 seconds of personal memos,
which should hold up to about six messages. The voice memo card will retail
at Pounds 24.95 from December. Creative Technologies Marketing: UK, 071 266

FT  13 NOV 92 / People: Aiming to 'gain traction' at P-E
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A slimmer, more efficient main board is George Cox's aim at P-E
International, and the principal reason behind a management reshuffle which
gives new responsibilities to Peter Smith, appointed managing director of
the group's management consulting business, and to Michael Wale, who will
combine the roles of company secretary and finance director.
Cox took over as executive chairman of the UK-based consulting group last
May and has been seeking ways of sharp-ening P-E's competitive edge. At the
interim stage the group reported profits of only Pounds 514,000 on fees of
Pounds 35.5m. The board changes, he says, are a way of combating a tendency
to 'expend too much energy running the engine rather than gaining traction'.
Smith (left), aged 45, was chairman and chief executive of the management
consultancy Handley-Walker, acquired by P-E in 1991. He takes over from
David Blore who will take up a new appointment within the group, focusing on
major consulting projects and key clients.
Wale, 56, replaces John Platt who is leaving the group. Cox says his
intention is to reduce the number of non-executive directors from four to
three, leaving a seven-strong main board. He says trading conditions remain
tough and that performance over the next six months is hard to predict;
order intake, however, has been strong.

FT  13 NOV 92 / People: Sherlock joins Allied Leisure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Sherlock, whose abrupt departure as an executive director of Bass last
month surprised the stock market, is returning to an industry he knows well,
as a non-executive director of Allied Leisure.
Sherlock, 47, played a key role in building up Bass's leisure division,
before moving over to the company's Holiday Inns hotel operations in
Atlanta. There has been little comment on Sherlock's reasons for quitting
Bass, where he was regarded as one of the young high fliers, but analysts
have speculated that whereas he was running Bass's leisure business, he was
only one of several executives on the hotel side.
Allied Leisure, which came to the stock market in 1987, is one of the
smallest companies in its sector but is one of the more profitable. It is
third biggest in ten-pin bowling where Bass has a big presence and also owns
night clubs.
Richard Carr, the 34-year-old founder of the company, says that he hopes
Sherlock's experience will help the company add a third leg to its business.
He is selling 600,000 of his own shares to Sherlock but refuses to comment
on speculation that Sherlock may be groomed to become chairman. However,
Carr says that he intends to split his role as chairman and chief executive
before next July so that he can concentrate on being chief executive.

<TEXT>
Charles Lousada, who runs his own Bedford-based property company, has
stepped in to rescue the Invest in Britain Campaign, by temporarily
financing it and taking over as chairman. He replaces broadcaster David
Jacobs, who has been made vice-president.
The campaign, started in a bid by the current director Margaret Charrington
and her apple-growing husband to stem the flow of French Golden Delicious
into British supermarkets, is ten years old but had exhausted its voluntary
funding sources of donations from companies and individuals.
So Lousada, who is incensed at such things as the British propensity to
import bottled water, stepped in. He says he has for years been 'preaching
the gospel' of buying British, particularly as regards cars, to
acquaintances in Bedford; he himself drives a Range Rover and a Jaguar,
though confesses that he breaks the rules when indulging his passion for
flying small helicopters because of the plain lack of a suitably-sized
British product.
One of his first initiatives is to start a chain letter requesting donations
of Pounds 10 towards refloating the campaign. A chain letter? 'Yes, it is
slightly embarrassing,' he agrees. (Instructions to the sender include
telephoning an apology to the prospective recipient for making the contact
in the first place.) 'But we had to do something quite dramatic. And it is
working; total strangers are sending in money.'
Lousada, 54, founded his eponymous property company in 1969; he is also
non-executive chairman of The Imperial Bathroom Company, a manufacturer of
upmarket bathroom equipment, in which he controls 25 per cent of the shares.

Once Lost City is open, Kerzner intends to focus on Europe where he has said
he wants to build an attraction to rival Euro Disney. To strengthen its

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Property Market: Under fire from both sides - Landowners
and environmentalists object to new rules on contaminated land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Back in 1989, when concern about the environment began to gain a firmer grip
on the UK, there was widespread support for new government proposals to
identify contaminated land. This was seen as an important step towards
protecting future generations from the legacy of the country's industrial
past.
But the Department of Environment's first set of proposals, issued in May
1991, were withdrawn after a barrage of complaints from landowners. Now the
DoE is fleshing out a second set, and it is once again coming under fire.
One one side, the environmental lobby believes the proposed regulations are
ineffectual. On the other, the business lobby believes they will depress
property values, trigger a flood of legal claims and set back efforts to
regenerate derelict land.
The thinking behind the proposals is that landowners should be held
responsible for pollution on their land (even if they did not cause the
contamination or if it took place before they owned the land) because the
owners would benefit from any increase in land values when it was cleaned
up. But in the interest of fairness, prospective buyers of land should be
protected by the provision of information about any contamination.
So far, so fair. But working out the details of implementing these proposals
has proved unexpectedly difficult for the DoE (which ironically would see
its own headquarters, on the site of a former gas works in Marsham Street,
caught in the net of the new proposals).
The problem is that drawing up a precise register of contaminated land, and
of what is required to clean it up, would involve extensive testing which
would be too expensive and time-consuming. Instead, local authorities are
expected to consult old maps and documents to identify areas where there was
a possibility of past pollution - a process that will take about 15 months.
The DoE's first set of proposals set out more than 40 contaminative uses
that should be registered, including the obvious polluting industries, such
as oil refineries and gas works, as well as less obvious candidates, such as
dry cleaners and demolition sites. Landowners feared that these proposals
would result in registering whole swathes of the country. It was, they said,
a case of taking a sledge-hammer to crack a nut.
The revised proposals, circulated this summer, made significant concessions
to landowners. They required local authorities to notify owners of the
intention to register land and gave owners the right to challenge intended
entries. The register will be split into two parts: one to record land which
has not been investigated or treated and the second to record land where
remedial works have been undertaken.
Most important, the revised scheme reduced the area of land covered by the
register to 10-15 per cent of that envisaged by the previous proposals. The
list of contaminative uses - which may be extended in the light of
experience - is confined to those 'where there is a very high probability
that all land subject to those uses is contaminated unless treated'.
But these revised proposals triggered just as much complaint as the earlier
version. The only consolation for the DoE is that opposition to the
proposals has come from both sides of the environmental debate.
Environmentalists think the scope of the new proposals is far too narrow. It
highlights the government's 'out of sight, out of mind' approach to
contaminated land, says Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure
group.
The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution says the restricted scope of
the proposals will be 'an obstacle to the difficult task of carrying out
remedial work needed to protect water resources from contamination'.
But the proposals have come under just as much fire from industry,
particularly landowners. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce
wants the government to cancel plans for the register, which it says has
'serious implications for the economy' because of its likely impact on land
values.
The property industry was not impressed by the government's proposal to
split the register into two parts. 'A two-tier system will be not be
understood by the public and will simply add to the confusion,' says Mr
Christopher Jonas, president of the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors.
Nor did the industry relish the prospect of applying to the local ombudsman
or seeking judicial review to challenge the inclusion of their land on the
register. 'We believe that there should be a suitably qualified inspectorate
appointed to deal with such cases and whose powers should be extended to
deal with sites included on the register unjustifiably,' says Grimley JR
Eve, a London-based firm of chartered surveyors.
But the most serious problem for landowners is that contaminated land cannot
be removed from the register after it has been treated. The government's
logic is, first, that information on the site's history will be necessary
when any future change of use is proposed. Second, contamination from the
site may have migrated to adjacent sites. Third, treatment rarely removes
all contamination, while new hazards may be discovered over time.
The new proposals will affect houses and commercial property alike. Already,
the prospect of the new registers has scuppered deals. The collapse of an
agreement to sell the Merry Hill shopping centre in Dudley in the West
Midlands earlier this year was partly blamed on its likely appearance on a
contaminated register.
The Merry Hill centre is just one of numerous sites in the Black Country, a
heavily industrialised area, which will be affected by the new regulations.
The Black Country Development Corporation, which is responsible for 10 sq
miles between Birmingham and Wolverhampton, admits to 'a catalogue of
stability and contamination problems, which can have few rivals in the UK
and probably further afield'.
However, the corporation insists that all these sites can be reclaimed. 'It
is physically possible to deal with these sites,' says Mr John Nicholls, its
development director. 'The concern is not whether the sites can be
physically repaired but the perception of the property industry and the
banks.'
Indeed, it remains to be seen whether lenders and investors will take a
flexible attitude to financing deals on contaminated land. A straw poll
conducted by Drivers Jonas, the chartered surveyor in London, found that
banks and financial institutions would need a considerable amount of
persuasion to fund projects on land appearing on the register. The
respondents feared that contamination would spread beyond the site and that
the clean-up requirements for land on the register would increase.
If investors and lenders do react in this fashion, it will damage land
values and blight land, particularly in the inner cities. Critics, such as
the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, detect a certain irony in the
publication of the revised proposals on contaminated land in the same month
as the Urban Regeneration Agency was launched with a brief to bring
development to 150,000 acres of vacant land in towns and cities.
'The recent hard-won success in bringing back some development to cleared
urban sites will be reversed,' says Mr Michael Pattison, chief executive of
the Royal Institution.
The controversy generated by these proposals shows that there are no quick
fixes when it comes to cleaning up the country's industrial heritage. Unless
the proposals for a contaminated land register are substantially amended, it
seems that a heavy price will be paid in an effort to improve environmental
standards.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Management: Building networks - Chip makers are placing
greater emphasis on winning customer approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Texas Instruments decided it needed to improve its services to
customers, it sent teams of managers, design engineers and even accountants,
to talk to personnel of all ranks within its customers' companies.
Service improvement, it was found, could be made at any level. For example,
at ICL, the UK-based computer manufacturer which is one of Texas
Instruments' important customers, discussions led to a new system of
managing supplies.
In the past, ICL staff receiving goods from Texas Instruments had to open
each package - which could contain up to 10,000 components - confirm the
contents listed on the packing note and computerise the data. Now, the data
provided in bar-code by Texas Instruments is read by ICL's bar-code system
and goes automatically into its computer system.
Texas Instruments' efforts in paying greater attention to its prospective
customers' needs paid off when it became one of eight semiconductor
suppliers to win 'accredited vendor status' from ICL last year, allowing the
closest relationship between supplier and customer. Texas has also won, for
the second year running, the chip users' top customer satisfaction award.
Texas is not alone in placing a high degree of emphasis on winning customer
approval for its work: customer satisfaction is becoming as crucial to
success as technological skills or manufacturing capabilities.
Some manufacturers have established 'cost of ownership' programmes.
Customers are asked to log the hidden costs - including, for example,
availability of hardware and software support, delivery times, excess
inventory and the need to inspect products - connected with buying and
owning products from rivals, compared with themselves.
If, for example, it takes a chip user a long time to procure a particular
product, or there are delivery problems and product defects upon arrival, it
will cost the user that much more to 'own' the product.
Contact between suppliers and customers has commonly become more frequent
and may embrace discussions of industry-wide issues, rather than just
focusing on sales. Says Ken Sanders, general manager of Texas Instruments in
the UK: 'In the past we would go to see the customer only when we were
trying to sell him a product or when something went wrong.'
The new-found enthusiasm for listening to customers reflects significant
changes in the industry:
Competition has become so intense that leading companies have been turning
to improving customer relationships as an important way of distinguishing
themselves from their competitors.
Greater global competition has made it difficult for any one company to
maintain a dominant position in a particular field for long. While
leading-edge technologies and a strategic product range are crucial to
success, increasingly they are no longer enough on their own.
According to George Fisher, chairman and chief executive of Motorola, the US
communications and electronics group: 'In the US for a long time we let
technology be the differentiator and forgot the fact that customer
satisfaction and quality were equally important.'
Chip users increasingly insist that their suppliers meet rigorous demands.
Many users, such as computer and consumer electronics manufacturers, are
locked in fierce competition and need to respond rapidly to changing
markets. For that, they must be sure that their suppliers can provide them
with what they need, when they need it.
Emphasis on delivery times and product quality has become greater than ever
before. While in the past a customer may have expected delivery in a
particular week, today the amount of leeway given is limited to one or two
days, if not hours.
As a result of the important role their suppliers play in their own success,
a growing number of chip users have taken to making stringent monthly
assessments of their suppliers on factors ranging from product quality to
cost and delivery time, and letting them know how they score on each point.
Semiconductor users also need to have up-to-date information on which
suppliers are the most reliable. This is because they want to restrict their
dealings to a small group of the best performers, since it is costly and
time-consuming to assess a large number of suppliers for each particular
project.
Because of the need to disclose sensitive product plans to chosen suppliers
from an early stage in the development cycle, users want to know which
suppliers are reliable. There is some evidence to suggest that working
closely with customers leads to greater success and speed in product
development.
Some years ago, Motorola, the US semiconductor and communications group,
commissioned a study by Jagdish Sheth, a management consultant, who reported
that the chances of a product succeeding can be much higher when a customer
is involved in the development process. According to Sheth, 65 per cent of
products developed with no input from customers fail.
Motorola was encouraged by the study to enter a number of collaborative
projects which it believes has enabled it to develop more innovative
products and to do so faster than would have been possible on its own.
It has a joint design team with Philips in Eindhoven that has been working
on CD-I, the Dutch consumer electronics group's new compact disc-based
entertainment system, since it was in the concept stage. Similarly, Motorola
has a design team working with British Telecommunications on video
conferencing and multi-media.
Says Mike McCourt, Motorola's director of sales and marketing in the UK and
Ireland: 'In the past we would not have had a dedicated team working for one
customer but would have worked to develop a generic product.'
The old way of doing things was more time consuming and would have meant
taking longer to get the product to market. As time to market may mean the
difference between winning and losing the product war, customer satisfaction
is becoming less an issue of rhetoric and more a matter of survival.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Management: Juggling careers in the jobs circus - Why
skilled 'knowledge' workers are best placed to succeed in the 1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Highly skilled 'knowledge' workers will be well-placed to win the small
number of new jobs with prospects in the UK during the rest of this decade.
They will be the survivors as people struggle to avoid seeping into the pool
of temporary and less-skilled workers in the labour market of the 1990s.
The research, conducted by Professor Amin Rajan and published by the
Institute of Careers Guidance and the Create employment consultancy,
concludes that the scale of new job creation after the recession will be
small. About 1.9m new jobs will be created in value-added service
occupations, at a time when 1.2m blue-collar jobs will go.
The report* suggests the trend for employers to retain a small core
workforce complemented by a temporary periphery staff with limited prospects
will become even more pronounced.
Skilled knowledge workers at all levels in workplace hierarchies will
benefit from this shift at the expense of the less-well trained.
But knowledge workers, the product of the second industrial revolution, are
far from ideal employees. Their typically attractive higher-level
qualifications and impressive work experience will be frequently offset by
'a high sense of self-worth, individualism, autonomy and enterprise - almost
prima donnas - that make them difficult to manage'.
Worse still for employers, these people are unlikely to consider loyalty to
an organisation as important as loyalty to their 'craft' and will move jobs
without compunction in search of greater job satisfaction or more money.
Even the most skilled worker is, however, unlikely to survive in the
workplace of the 1990s without a talent for juggling 'multiple careers' and
a commitment to continuous training.
This is because of the link between flexible working and competitiveness.
The trend towards teams providing customised services for particular markets
will mean those who cannot offer multiple skills will be marginalised in the
labour market.
The new jobs are expected to be created in four groups of service
industries: more than 240,000 will come from hotel and catering; 400,000
from business services; 650,000 from other services and 670,000-plus from
health, education and other public services.
About 200,000 jobs are likely to be shed in primary industries and utilities
(for example, agriculture, oil and gas) and about 1m across manufacturing,
except motor vehicles. Engineering is expected to lose about 250,000 jobs
from a base of 2.4m in 1990.
The shift towards white-collar work will favour women in particular, as will
the increase expected in part-time working. Self-employment among both sexes
is expected to increase slightly. But the report says: 'This does not
necessarily imply that the constraints that have hitherto hindered the
upward mobility of women in managerial and professional work will weaken.'
The research suggests employers will keep alive gender stereotypes which
have contributed to the segregation of women into jobs with relatively low
pay and status, at least in industries providing 'personal services' such as
hairdressing and hotels.
The report says that five broad occupational groups will grow: technicians,
multi-skilled craftworkers, secretarial (part-time), junior clericals
(part-time) as well as health and welfare professionals.
Above all, success means staying one step ahead of the market because 'the
expanding occupations in this decade may well be the contracting ones in the
next: who knows]'

FT  13 NOV 92 / Feltrim Names vote for action on losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 1,000 Names yesterday voted to take legal action in a bid to
recover insurance losses.
The Names, individuals whose assets support underwriting at Lloyd's, are
members of Feltrim syndicates 540/542 and 847, which were overwhelmed by
claims from catastrophes between 1987 and 1990.
The Feltrim Names Association is still examining the possibility of taking
action against Arthur Andersen, auditors of Feltrim's accounts; Walsham
Brothers, a reinsurance broker which placed some business with Feltrim
syndicates; and Lloyd's of London itself.
The Names agreed to raise Pounds 6.4m to finance action against syndicate
managers Feltrim Underwriting Agencies, and 59 members' agents, which
channelled them on to the syndicates. Calling for the action, Mr Colin Hook,
chairman of the association, said: 'We have to assume that talks (designed
to obtain an out-of-court settlement) will fail.'
Mr Hook added: 'If we don't litigate we won't get anything. We are going to
build our atomic bomb and the other side must be clear we will use it.'
In a note contrasting with the conciliatory mood at the Lloyd's market in
recent weeks, Mr Hook said Names be under no illusion. 'Nothing has changed;
it is just the climate.' A Lloyd's investigation into the Feltrim losses was
sharply critical of the quality of the Feltrim syndicates' underwriting. Mr
Anthony Boswood QC, who has presented a legal opinion to the association,
said that Mr Patrick Fagan, the underwriter of syndicate 540/542, 'did not
understand the market in which he was operating'.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Output of cars increases by 22%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK CAR production last month was 22.2 per cent higher than a year before,
according to figures released yesterday - in spite of short-time working at
Ford's UK car plants and at Rover's car-assembly plant at Longbridge,
Birmingham.
Output increased to 117,674 from 97,130, helped by rising output by Nissan,
the Japanese carmaker, and Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of
the US.
Nissan production last month was 64 per cent higher than a year ago while
Vauxhall's output rose by 15 per cent.
According to the figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
and the Central Statistical Office, UK car production in the first 10 months
of the year at 1,079,807 was 3.7 per cent higher than in the same period
last year.
Output has performed relatively well during the recession with much higher
production for export markets largely making up for lower output for the
home market.
Nissan began production of its new-generation Micra small car in August and
is due to reach a full production rate of 130,000 cars a year this month.
Vauxhall, which has maintained full-time working during the recession -
helped by rising exports and an improved UK market share - expects to boost
output by 14 per cent this year to a record 300,000.
Output at its Ellesmere Port plant last month was 66 per cent higher than a
year before, when it was depressed by the start of production of the new
Vauxhall/Opel Astra.
New commercial vehicle production last month at 19,486 was 2.9 per cent
lower than a year before, while output for the first 10 months of the year
rose by 24.1 per cent to 214,220.

BRITISH Telecommunications has been forced to amend one of its tariffs
offering bulk discounts to business customers following pressure from Oftel,
the industry watchdog.
The tariff would have allowed customers to pool traffic from sites across

FT  13 NOV 92 / Docklands move is abandoned
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of the Environment yesterday said it had abandoned plans to
move 2,000 civil servants to London's Docklands.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said he could not justify the move
in the light of falling rents in central London and the costs of the move at
a time of constraints on public spending.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Final Iraq export case dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CUSTOMS and Excise Department yesterday abandoned its final Iraq-export
prosecution in the wake of the Matrix Churchill affair - dropping its case
against Mr Keith Bailey, chairman of BSA Tools of Birmingham.
Mr Bailey had been facing a single charge of evading export controls in
selling machine tools to Iraq between September 1988 and March 1989.
Mr Allan Moses QC, who also prosecuted in the Matrix Churchill case, told an
Old Bailey judge that after considering the evidence from that trial he was
of the firm view that the only proper course was to abandon proceedings
against Mr Bailey. A formal Not Guilty verdict was returned by the judge, Mr
Justice Garland. Mr Bailey's costs were awarded from public funds.
Mr Bailey, as chairman of the Machine Tools Trade Association, attended the
meeting at which Mr Alan Clark, then trade minister, advised Mr Paul
Henderson, one of the Matrix Churchill defendants, to stress the peaceful
applications of machine tools when applying for export licences.
Mr Clark later admitted to the Matrix Churchill trial that this involved
being 'economical with the actualite'. Mr Bailey confirmed that, if his
trial had gone ahead, he would have called Mr Clark as a witness.
Mr Bailey said afterwards that the prosecution had damaged his business. He
also defended the government's role in the affair. 'I think they wanted to
be in Iraq at the start of reconstruction following the war with Iran,' he
explained.
'Like every other country they had to be there at the beginning if they were
to be there at all. Iraq . . . was obviously going to be a major trading
partner.'
Mr Bailey said the issue of compensation would be difficult because BSA
Tools had to work closely with the government regularly.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Car production jumps 22%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK CAR production last month was 22.2 per cent higher than a year before,
according to figures released yesterday - in spite of short-time working at
Ford's UK car plants and at Rover's car-assembly plant at Longbridge,
Birmingham.
Output increased to 117,674 from 97,130, helped by rising output by Nissan,
the Japanese carmaker, and Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of
the US.
Nissan production last month was 64 per cent higher than a year ago, while
Vauxhall's output rose by 15 per cent.
According to the figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
and the Central Statistical Office, UK car production in the first 10 months
of the year at 1,079,807 was 3.7 per cent higher than in the same period
last year.
Output has performed relatively well during the recession, with much higher
production for export markets largely making up for lower output for the
home market.
Nissan began production of its new-generation Micra small car in August and
is due to reach a full production rate of 130,000 cars a year this month.
Vauxhall, which has maintained full-time working during the recession -
helped by rising exports and an improved UK market share - expects to boost
output by 14 per cent this year to a record 300,000.
Output at its Ellesmere Port plant last month was 66 per cent higher than a
year before, when it was depressed by the start of production of the new
Vauxhall/Opel Astra.
UK car output will be boosted further with Honda and Toyota beginning
production at their first European car plants, both in the UK.
Honda began production of the Honda Accord at its Pounds 370m plant in
Swindon last month, and Toyota will start production of the Toyota Carina at
its Pounds 700m plant at Burnaston, near Derby, next month. New commercial
vehicle production last month at 19,486 was 2.9 per cent lower than a year
before, while output for the first 10 months of the year rose by 24.1 per
cent to 214,220.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Judges condemn editors' contempt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ASSOCIATED Newspapers, publisher of the Mail on Sunday newspaper, and two
journalists were yesterday fined a total of Pounds 60,000 after being
convicted of contempt of court in publishing interviews with jurors from the
Blue Arrow fraud trial.
The company was fined Pounds 30,000 for committing what two High Court
judges called 'a deliberate and most serious breach of the law'.
Mr Stewart Steven, who was editor at the time, was fined Pounds 20,000 and
Mr Clive Wolman, City editor, Pounds 10,000 for what the judges called a
'serious and dangerous encroachment' on the functions of a jury. Lord
Justice Beldam and Mr Justice Tudor-Evans rejected the defence argument that
the article made a valid contribution to the debate on fraud trials.
The case is now set to go to the European Court. The journalists say the
European Convention on Human Rights gave them the legal right to publish the
article.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Unemployment rises to 2.87m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT rose by less than expected last month, but the number of people
out of work and claiming benefit reached its highest level for 5 1/2 years.
The government will have been heartened, however, by another fall in average
earnings growth to its lowest level since 1967.
The seasonally adjusted rise of 24,200 in unemployment last month took the
total to 2.87m, a level last seen in May 1987.
Although the rise was the smallest since June, another drop in vacancies
suggested that further big losses are likely before the end of the year.
Vacancies at Jobcentres, which account for about a third of all vacancies,
fell by 2,500 last month to 97,600, the lowest level for 11 years.
The number of people without work has risen by more than 1.2m in the 30
months since unemployment started to rise. The number is estimated to be
growing at a rate of between 30,000 and 35,000 a month with the latest
increase leaving the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate at 10.1 per cent.
Unadjusted, the employment figures fell by 32,954 to just over 2.8m.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said: 'Britain has now
suffered 2 1/2 years of unrelenting job losses, and up to now the government
hasn't raised a finger to help.'
Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, predicted that more jobs would be
created when businesses were able to take advantage of the lower interest
rates, and denied that general election pledges on improving the economy
were being broken.
One explanation for the lower-than-expected rise in October was that people
unable to find jobs enrolled on further education courses. This would
disqualify them from the official figures which count only those who are
claiming benefit as unemployed.
In the year to September, average earnings grew by 5.5 per cent, a fall of
0.25 per cent on the August figure. This compares with growth in average
earnings of 7.75 per cent a year ago.
Employment in manufacturing continued to fall. In September it dropped by a
seasonally adjusted 32,000, a smaller fall than in August. However, 128,000
manufacturing jobs were lost in the third quarter compared with losses of
only 50,000 and 18,000 in the first and second quarters respectively. There
are now 4.4m people employed in manufacturing in the UK compared with a peak
of 7.9m in June 1971.
Both male and female unemployment rose in October. The annual rate for men
was 13.6 per cent compared with 13.4 per cent in September. For women the
rate rose to 5.5 per cent, unchanged on the previous month.
Unemployment rose in every region except Northern Ireland. The biggest rise
was in the south-east including greater London. The rise of 6,100 took the
rate of unemployment in the south-east to 11.2 per cent, the third-highest
rate in the country after Northern Ireland (14.7 per cent) and the north
(11.6 per cent).
According to the latest international comparisons of unemployment compiled
by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the
unemployment rate in the UK was 10.2 per cent in September, equal to the
rate in France, but lower than that in the Republic of Ireland, Spain,
Finland, Canada and Australia. In all the other main industrialised nations
unemployment rate is lower than the UK's.

FT  13 NOV 92 / More than 1,000 jobs to go at naval bases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 1,000 jobs are to be shed at the Portsmouth and Portland naval
bases, the government announced yesterday.
Ship refitting at Portsmouth will cease by next summer, Mr Archie Hamilton,
armed forces minister, said in a written Commons reply. The work will be
done instead at the naval dockyards at Devonport near Plymouth and Rosyth,
Fife.
Mr Hamilton said 400 civilian jobs would be lost and some redundancies would
be 'unavoidable'.
The operational sea training base at Portland, Dorset, will close by April
1996 and its activities will move to Devonport. All 475 civilian jobs at
Portland will go, as will 130 of the 550 service jobs. The remaining service
personnel will be transferred.
The Ministry of Defence said many of the 605 staff who were to lose their
jobs at Portland would leave through natural wastage. The 130 service staff
cuts would be spread across all the services.
'It is similar to the closure of a coal mine,' said Mr Brian Ellis, chairman
of Weymouth and Portland Borough Council's policy and resources committee.
'The people of this community will be equally devastated.'
The defence industry and tourism have traditionally been the biggest local
employers. Mr Ellis said local unemployment had been below the national
average, but could now be expected to rise to about 16 per cent.
Mr Richard Trist, Portsmouth City Council chief executive, said: 'The whole
economy in the Portsmouth locality is very largely based on the defence of
the realm. We are suffering quite badly from the peace dividend at the
moment.'

FT  13 NOV 92 / Families curb spending on food
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITONS are spending proportionally less on food and clothing and more on
their homes, transport and leisure according to government statistics
published today.
There are also indications that the country is saving more in spite of hopes
that a rise in consumer spending would help pull the economy out of
recession.
The wealth of statistics in the annual report on family spending compiled by
the Central Statistical Office shows that average weekly household
expenditure last year was Pounds 259, an increase of 4.8 per cent on 1990.
But with inflation running at 5.8 per cent over the same period, the figures
represent a decline in spending in real terms.
At the same time, average gross weekly income rose by 8 per cent to Pounds
363, giving support to the belief that more people were putting their money
in savings accounts rather than spending it.
The statistics, gathered from a representative sample of 7,000 households
across the country with each adult keeping a detailed diary of all
expenditure, give a definitive glimpse of how people spend their money.
They also highlight the great differences that remain in income and spending
patterns between the wealthier and poorer sections of society.
The average gross weekly income of households in the top fifth of the income
range, for example, was Pounds 825 compared with an average Pounds 76 for
the lowest fifth. Households in the lowest fifth received three quarters of
income on average from social security benefits.
The survey found that the number of people earning money from investments
has almost doubled in the last 20 years, from 3.6 per cent in 1971 to 6.5
per cent last year, while income from wages and salaries over the same
period dropped from 73.9 per cent to 61.2 per cent. There were also big
differences in the money families set aside for various items, with
high-income homes spending Pounds 21.53 a week on alcohol and Pounds 73.63
on food compared with Pounds 2.91 and Pounds 21.07 respectively for the
lowest earners.
In general, high-income families spent relatively more on clothing,
footwear, motoring and leisure services while low earners spent more on
housing, fuel, light, power and food.
Food and housing continued to be the two largest items of expenditure, and
together made up nearly 40 per cent of all spending. However, money spent on
food has dropped from 33 per cent of the total weekly budget in 1957 to just
under 18 per cent last year.
Expenditure on clothing and footwear also dropped, from about 10 per cent in
1957 to slightly over 6 per cent last year, while the amount spent on both
housing and motoring doubled over the same period. The amount spent on fuel,
light and power has remained steady.
The survey found that people in Northern Ireland spent most on fuel, light
and power bills with an average weekly expenditure of Pounds 14.81 per
household.
Households paid an average Pounds 24.96 last year in interest on credit
cards, and average weekly betting payments were Pounds 1.44. However,
average winnings were only 81p.
Households in the UK have been getting smaller, and now only a tenth conform
to the popular image of the average family of two adults and two children.
The average last year was 2.42 people per household, the lowest figure
recorded since the survey started in 1957.
Nearly one in three households consist of single people, twice as many as 30
years ago, and just over two thirds of householders are owner-occupiers.
Scotland has the lowest proportion of owner-occupiers at just under 50 per
cent.

MORE fish and chips are consumed in Yorkshire and East Anglia than anywhere
else in the country, the Welsh drink the most tea and the Scots smoke the
most cigarettes, according to comparisons of regional spending.
Average weekly household expenditure throughout the country was Pounds
253.10, but it ranged from Pounds 210.52 in the north to Pounds 292.06 in
greater London. Spending on food was highest in London at Pounds 51 a week
and lowest in the north at Pounds 41.
Households in East Anglia and Yorkshire and Humberside set aside an average
71p a week for their cod and chips, but the people of Northern Ireland spent
only 29p.
The biggest drinkers were in the north west, where households spent Pounds
12.45 a week on alcohol. This compared with Pounds 7.99 in greater London
and a sober Pounds 7.55 in Ulster. However, Londoners easily beat rivals in
drinking wines and spirits, spending Pounds 5.20 per household.
The heaviest smokers were in Scotland, where weekly household expenditure on
tobacco averaged Pounds 6.14, compared with Pounds 4.11 in the south-west
and Pounds 3.90 in East Anglia. There was a different pattern for cigars and
snuff where the biggest fans were the Welsh.
The Welsh also topped the league for tea-drinking, spending 63p a week on
the national brew. The Scots spent least on tea at 47p a week, while East
Anglians and northerners spent the most on coffee - 55p - compared with only
33p in Northern Ireland.
Households throughout the country spent an average of Pounds 1.76 a week on
hairdressing, beauty treatment and manicures. Spending was Pounds 1.97 a
week in the south-east compared with Pounds 1.34 in Wales and the north.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Consumer durables up in spite of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSEHOLD ownership of consumer durables continued to increase last year in
spite of the deepening recession, although there was growing evidence that
saturation point is approaching for some goods.
The sharpest rise was in ownership of video recorders, which increased from
61 per cent to 64.6 per cent of households over the previous year. This
compares with 36 per cent five years ago. More than four out of five
families with children own a video recorder.
If the rapid increase in ownership since the mid-1980s continues over the
next few years, the machines will become as commonplace as refrigerators and
televisions.
In contrast, the expected boom in home computers has failed to materialise.
Only 18 per cent of homes had one, compared with 17 per cent the previous
year and 15 per cent back in 1986.
The high proportion of homes with consumer durables such as fridges, washing
machines and telephones, and the impact of the recession, made the further
increase in ownership surprising.
Households owning refrigerators or fridge/freezers, the most popular of all
consumer durables, rose from 98.1 to 98.2 per cent, and the popularity of
telephones rose from 87.4 to 88 per cent, compared with 38 per cent 20 years
ago. Telephones were least predominant in the north of England, where just
over one in five homes was still without one.
Washing machines have become universally popular, with average ownership
around 87 per cent, although in greater London a surprising figure of only
77 per cent of homes had one.
The only year-on-year fall in ownership was for television sets, which
slipped a fraction from 98.1 per cent to 97.9 per cent of households. Wales
and the east Midlands were the most avid followers of cable television with
7 per cent ownership compared with a national average of 6 per cent.
More than 80 per cent of households now have full or partial central heating
compared with 60 per cent a decade ago and 32 per cent 20 years ago.
Regionally, Yorkshire and Humberside had the fewest homes with central
heating at 71 per cent, while the south-east and the east Midlands had the
most at 87 per cent and 86 per cent respectively.
There was a surprising jump in the number of second homes acquired last year
up from 2.9 per cent of households to 3.4 per cent.
In general, the lower a household's income the greater the percentage spent
on housing and fuel and the less on leisure goods and motoring. In the
higher income groups, motoring and fares accounted for more than 15 per cent
of total expenditure, in the poorest groups less than 5 per cent.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Asia warned of high costs of Aids: UN report calls for
efforts to stop virus spreading so fast

<TEXT>
THE Aids epidemic sweeping Asia will wreak social and economic devastation
if left unchecked, the United Nations Development Programme warned
yesterday.
In a report released at an international conference in New Delhi on Aids in
the Asia-Pacific region, it urged efforts at prevention to reduce the rate
of spread of the HIV virus, which can lead to the disease, and resultant
costs for society.
The seminar, sponsored by the UNDP, the World Health Organisation and the
Indian government, concluded that Aids could seriously threaten the economic
well-being of Asian nations, which by the year 2000 would account for 42 per
cent of the world's projected 100m cases.
The UNDP urged policy-makers in Asia to focus on broader social, economic
and political factors, such as endemic poverty, which contribute to the
spread of the virus.
The UNDP forecast Aids would soon have a big impact on the work-place,
especially in India and Thailand, where cases are growing very fast.
Productivity in transport, tourism, entertainment, mining and fishing are
likely to be affected, as well as the armed forces and farming. Companies
would suffer heavy losses in days worked.
A separate economic study on Aids to be released by the UNDP next month
shows that lost income because of people dying of Aids ranges from Dollars
10,000 per case in India to over Dollars 240,000 per case in South Korea.
Medical care costs associated with detection and treatment of Aids range
from Dollars 1,100 per case in India to over Dollars 4,000 per case in South
Korea.
The study projects the cost of the epidemic in India, where 1m cases are
projected by the year 2000, at Dollars 11bn. Some sectors are particularly
vulnerable, such as the agricultural sector in Laos and the long-haul
truckers in India and Thailand.
The reports conclude that financial and economic costs will be difficult for
developing countries to bear unless they develop a fuller understanding of
the costs and consequences and allocate resources wisely.

KENYA'S electoral timetable was thrown into confusion yesterday after the
High Court granted an opposition request for more time for nominating
parliamentary candidates and criticised the government's attempt to curtail
the process.
The main opposition party, Ford-Kenya, which made the request, immediately
seized on the court ruling as a victory for the opposition in attempts to
ensure that Kenya's first multi-party elections in 26 years, due on December
7, are not hurried or manipulated by the government.
The opposition has consistently maintained that the government of President
Daniel arap Moi is trying to sway the electoral process in its favour and
exploit a divided and ill-prepared opposition.
The High court's decision overturned the government's attempt to shorten the
legal period for nomination of candidates from 21 days to 10 days from the
date of the announcement of the polls, which was to have expired today.
Attempts by the opposition to meet the 10-day deadline have been
disorganised and marred by violence.
Justice Thomas Mbaluto said that Mr Amos Wako, the attorney-general, had
acted illegally in amending the constitutional provisions for nomination of
candidates without parliamentary approval.
Diplomats and political analysts in Nairobi said that in the light of the
ruling it was now unclear if the December 7 date for the polls could be
observed.
Mr Wako said the government would not appeal against the decision and Mr
Justice Chesoni, the chairman of the National Electoral Commission, said he
would announce a new timetable for nomination of parliamentary and
presidential candidates.
Since Mr Moi legalised multi-party politics a year ago he has continued to
keep the opposition and the country in the dark about the government's
electoral plans. Before last week's announcement of the polls he described
the revelation of the date as his 'secret weapon'.
Mr Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, presidential candidate of Ford-Kenya, said
yesterday the High Court decision had exposed the government's 'mischief'
and destroyed Mr Moi's secret weapon. Mr Odinga called on Mr Chesoni
immediately to gazette the polling stations, publish the names of all
returning officers and their deputies and consult the opposition further on
the organisation of the elections.

EC and US negotiators are expected to try to settle their differences over
farm trade and the Uruguay Round world trade reforms next Wednesday and
Thursday in Washington.
Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, and Mr Ed Madigan, US
secretary for agriculture, will resume the farm subsidy negotiations that
came tantalisingly close to success in Chicago 10 days ago, while Mr Frans
Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, and Mrs Carla Hills, US
special trade representative, will try to tie up an agreement on other
sectors covered by the round, ranging from intellectual property to
financial services.
Hopes are high on both sides that this meeting will get the breakthrough on
the EC-US oilseeds dispute needed to conclude the six-year round, and avert
the threat of a transatlantic trade war.
'We want to be flexible. We can do a deal within CAP (Common Agricultural
Policy) reform,' said Ms Carol Brookins, a Washington agriculture consultant
familiar with the negotiations.
'But we didn't spend more than five years of money, time and energy to cut a
deal for one year and then see what happens in the future.'
The US intends to levy 200 per cent tariffs on Dollars 300m of EC food
exports from December 5, as sanctions for Community oilseeds subsidies which
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) has twice ruled against.
The EC has chosen to emphasise continuing the negotiations but foreign
ministers of the 12, meeting in Brussels on Monday, left little doubt the
Community would retaliate if the US sanctions went ahead.
Gatt director-general Arthur Dunkel met Mr MacSharry and Mr Andriessen in
Brussels yesterday, and is due to meet their US counterparts in Washington
on Monday. Mr Dunkel warned that the row could sink any hope of the
extension of world-wide free trade promised by the Uruguay Round.
The Commission, which negotiates for the EC, assured Mr Dunkel it intended
to make every effort to secure a deal. Evidence of Brussels' intent - after
this week's conclusion of the bitter row between Mr MacSharry and Commission
president Jacques Delors - is that the Commission has laid plans for a
special session to examine any deal for as early as next Friday.
Mr Steve Yoder, president of the American Soyabean Association, said a deal
which set the limit for EC oilseeds production at 10m tonnes would be
'totally unacceptable' to the House and Senate.
He said the 9.5m tonne limit the EC had offered was 'extremely soft.' It is
based on an estimate that yields will drop from 2.6 tonnes per hectare to
1.9. Instead, he said, yields are likely to rise.
Besides agreeing to a satisfactory output level, Mr Yoder said the
enforcement mechanism to guarantee it must be 'severe enough' to ensure that
farmers will be discouraged for growing oilseeds.

Germany will pay Bulgaria to repatriate thousands of its nationals refused
political asylum by the Germans, Reuter reports from Bonn. The two countries
signed an agreement committing Sofia to take back disqualified
asylum-seekers with German financial aid of DM28m (Pounds 11.5m) over the
next five years.
Similar agreements with Poland and Romania have been criticised for
appearing to legitimise demands of right-wing groups for mass deportations
of asylum-seekers, the target of almost daily attacks by xenophobic gangs.
About 25,000 Bulgarians have applied for asylum this year but have little
chance of getting it as Bonn feels political persecution has virtually ended
in Bulgaria with the demise of communism.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Australia unveils programme to create more jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S Labor government early today unveiled a jobs creation programme,
after a bigger-than-expected rise in unemployment to a post-war record of
11.3 per cent.
Mr John Dawkins, federal treasurer, said the bulk of the jobs programme
involved reallocating funding already announced for other projects. But
there would be additional total spending of ADollars 39m (Pounds 17.7m)  -
ADollars 8m in the current financial year to next June 30 and ADollars 31m
in the 1993-94 financial year.
The jobs plan was outlined after Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, asked
the federal cabinet to raise spending on training and bring forward
infrastructure projects.
Mr Keating said yesterday the economy was recovering slowly from recession,
but the government would 'press on with an expansionary fiscal policy to
deal with unemployment'.
Economists said the government's room for manoeuvre was limited by its need
to restrain growth in the forecast budget deficit of ADollars 13.4bn (Pounds
6bn), compared with ADollars 9.3bn in 1991-92.
Easier monetary policy was thought unlikely because of the weakness of the
Australian dollar, which has fallen about 13 per cent against the US dollar
since November 1991.
Most commentators expected unemployment to increase in October from the
September level of 10.8 per cent. But none forecast that the rate would
exceed the previous post-war record of 11.1 per cent in June.
The government said the increase was due to a change in the statistical
method used to calculate the figures and a rise in the participation rate,
which measures the proportion of the workforce seeking work.
The size of the jobless rise put an end to speculation that Mr Keating might
call a federal election before Christmas to capitalise on recent improvement
in Labor's popularity.

TROOPS belonging to Mr Jonas Savimbi, leader of the opposition Unita

reports from Luanda.
Government military officials said the soldiers of the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (Unita) were marching on the port of
Benguela, some 500km south of Luanda.
Government military officials fear Mr Savimbi's strategy is to cut Angola
along the 1,350km Benguela railroad and take the southern half. The railroad
starts at Benguela harbour and passes through Huambo, Angola's second city
and the Unita leader's stronghold, Cuito and Luena.
Unita forces were also reported to be pressing in on the north around the
oil-producing town of Soyo. One of the captured provincial capitals is
Caxito, only 60km northeast of Luanda.
Mr Savimbi told Portugal's Radio Nova. 'I guarantee to the United Nations my
will that there should be no more war. But if I am provoked, I have the
capacity to fight for 10 more years.'
Mr Savimbi's fighting comments came as Mr Marrack Goulding the UN
peacekeeping chief, prepared to leave Angola after a mission to preserve
accords that ended 16 years of civil war which shattered this
once-prosperous former Portuguese colony.

efforts to stop virus spreading so fast

THE Aids epidemic sweeping Asia will wreak social and economic devastation
if left unchecked, the United Nations Development Programme warned
yesterday.
In a report released at an international conference in New Delhi on Aids in
the Asia/Pacific region, it urged efforts at prevention to reduce the rate
of spread of the HIV virus, which causes the disease, and the costs of the
condition on society.
The seminar, sponsored by the UNDP, the World Health Organisation and the
Indian government, concluded that Aids could seriously threaten the economic
well-being of Asian nations, which by the year 2000 would account for 42 per
cent of the world's projected 100m cases.
The UNDP urged policy-makers in Asia to focus on broader social, economic
and political factors, such as endemic poverty, which contribute to the
spread of the virus.
Endemic poverty facilitates the spread of the virus, and is often a cause
for migration and family fragmentation. Current research demonstrates that
the epidemic appears to be a regressive disease, imposing relatively larger
costs upon the poor than on the rich.
The UNDP forecast that Aids would soon have a big impact on the work-place,
especially in India and Thailand, where cases are growing at an alarming
rate.
Productivity in transport, tourism, entertainment, mining and fishing are
likely to be affected, as well as the armed forces and agriculture.
Companies would suffer heavy losses in work days, trained manpower,
recruitment costs, and burdens on benefit schemes.
A separate economic study on Aids to be released by the UNDP next month
shows that lost income because of people dying of Aids ranges from Dollars
10,000 per case in India to over Dollars 240,000 per case in South Korea.
Medical care costs associated with detection and treatment of Aids range
from Dollars 1,100 per case in India to over Dollars 4,000 per case in South
Korea.
The study projects the cost of the epidemic in India, where 1m cases are
projected by the year 2000, at Dollars 11bn. Some sectors are particularly
vulnerable, such agricultural sector in Laos, the long-haul truckers in
India and Thailand, and migrant contract workers in the Philippines.
The reports conclude that financial and economic costs will be difficult for
developing countries to bear unless they develop a fuller understanding of
the costs and consequences and allocate resources wisely to counter the
epidemic.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Japan's trade surplus rises to record Dollars 10.9bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SURGE in Japanese car exports to Europe was one of the main forces behind
a 51 per cent increase in Japan's custom cleared trade surplus in October to
a record Dollars 10.9bn (Pounds 7.17bn), according to figures published
yesterday by the finance ministry.
The higher-than-expected growth in the surplus was due to continued growth
in exports, which were 9.2 per cent up on last year at Dollars 31bn and a
5.1 per cent fall in imports to Dollars 20.1bn, reflecting the slowdown in
the Japanese economy.
The growth in the surplus to Dollars 88bn for the first ten months of the
year, already Dollars 6bn more than the 1991 surplus, is likely to add to
international pressure on the Japanese government to stimulate the economy
to revive imports.
The surge in car exports to Europe, which was one of the main factors behind
a Dollars 2.8bn surplus with the EC, is likely to fuel protectionism among
Europe's hard-pressed car producers, which are facing serious problems of
over-capacity.
While Japanese car exports to Europe and Asia are rising rapidly, export
growth to the US is minimal.
Vehicle exports to the EC were 25.6 per cent up on October last year at
Dollars 753m, while exports of car parts were 43 per cent higher at Dollars
166m. Vehicle exports to Asia were 50.7 per cent up at Dollars 640m, with
exports of motor-cycles up 107 per cent at Dollars 91m.
In contrast automobile exports to the US rose by just 1.8 per cent to
Dollars 2.2bn.
Finance ministry officials believe most of the growth in the value of the
overall surplus can be explained by a fall in import prices for commodities
and a rise in export prices, in part reflecting the appreciation of the yen
over the past year. However, they are braced for the surplus to generate
political pressure in the US for the incoming Clinton administration to take
a tough line on trade.
The surplus with the US stood at Dollars 4.9bn, with exports up 8.2 per cent
from last year at Dollars 9.3bn and imports down 8.1 per cent at Dollars
4.37bn. Exports to the EC were 5.5 per cent up at Dollars 5.3bn, with
imports 9.8 per cent down at Dollars 2.5bn.
China is one of the few countries to be increasing its imports into the
depressed Japanese market. Imports from China rose by 10.7 per cent to
Dollars 1.7bn, while Japanese exports to China were 44 per cent up at
Dollars 1.16bn.
Raw material imports fell by 4.5 per cent to Dollars 2.1bn, machinery and
equipment imports were 13.2 per cent down at Dollars 3.45bn and mineral fuel
imports rose by just 0.2 per cent to Dollars 4.42bn.

FT  13 NOV 92 / S Korea poll may break political mould: Industry may replace
the military as the institutional power in politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE South Korean presidential election campaign, formally launched yesterday
with the setting of December 18 as the poll date, is the first in more than
30 years not to have a single candidate who has a military background.
Mr Kim Young-sam, the nominee of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP),
is leading in the polls with 30 per cent, five to 10 percentage points ahead
of Mr Kim Dae-jung of the main opposition Democratic Party.
Both men stood as opposition candidates in the 1987 election, the first
after 16 years of military dictatorship, but lost to President Mr Roh Tae
Woo, a former general who is constitutionally barred from serving again.
The candidacy of Mr Chung Ju-yung, the founder of the Hyundai business
group, is another significant departure from past practice, since it is the
first time that a businessman has stood for president.
Mr Chung formed the United People's Party (UPP) to oppose bureaucratic
controls on industry and the associated political corruption.
Mr Chung's challenge is unprecedented. Business has traditionally been
subservient to the state, receiving corporate favours in return for
political contributions to those in power.
The government initially responded harshly to Mr Chung, who threatened to
attract conservative middle-class voters from the DLP.
It launched a campaign of harassment involving credit squeezes and tax
penalties, against Hyundai and the Chung family, but declared a truce in
August. One reason is that support for the UPP has recently declined from
the 17 per cent vote share the party gained in last March's parliamentary
elections.
Mr Chung's standing is now put at 10 per cent, the same level as two other
minor parties, the Party for New Political Reform and the New Korea Party
(NPK). This reflects public distrust of the Korean conglomerates, perceived
to have benefited from their close ties with the former military rulers over
the last three decades.
Nonetheless, the presence of Mr Chung in the election has prompted
speculation that industry will eventually become the new institutional power
in Korean politics, replacing the military. That theory appeared to gain
credence last month when two other prominent industrialists considered
presidential bids.
Mr Park Tae-joon, former chairman of the country's main steelmaker Pohang
Iron and Steel (Posco), and Mr Kim Woo-choong, founder and chairman of the
Daewoo business group, were both asked to head the NPK, a conservative
breakaway faction from the DLP. Both men, political allies of Mr Roh,
refused the offer after bowing to pressure from the president, who feared
the NPK would split the DLP and deliver the election to the Democratic
Party's Mr Kim.
But Mr Park and Daewoo's Mr Kim are still believed to harbour ambitions for
the next presidential election in 1997.
Having failed to attract a candidate, the NPK is now holding merger talks
with the UPP. If it fails to conclude a joint campaign pact, the NPK is
likely to collapse.
The election will mainly be conducted on personalities since there is little
ideological difference among the three candidates, who would be considered
centre-right by European standards.
Mr Kim Young-sam is in the lead because he represents continuity in
government policy, reflecting Koreans' conservative preference for
stability.
He argues that his government would be more effective than his opponents'
because the DLP has a slim parliamentary majority with 161 seats in the
299-chamber.
There is strong regional opposition against the Democratic Party's Mr Kim,
who comes from the south-western Cholla area, traditionally the most
underdeveloped and consequently the most politically rebellious part of the
country. Many Koreans consider Mr Kim 'radical' because of his geographical
origins.

CHINA yesterday hit out at Hong Kong's local politicians for supporting
proposals made by Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, for more democracy
 -but won little favour for itself in the process.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing's unofficial embassy in Hong Kong, said the
Legislative Council (LegCo) had no right to approve a resolution which ran
counter to agreements and understandings reached between China and Britain.
LegCo was a 'consultative body' only, it said.
Xinhua further alleged that the vote in LegCo on Wednesday was carried out
under pressure from the Hong Kong government - a charge strenuously denied
by the government.
On Wednesday night, legislators voted 32 to 21 in favour of a motion
supporting Mr Patten's proposals for more democracy in elections due in
1995. They also called on Britain and China to resume talks.
But China won few friends in Hong Kong with its claims. Representatives of
groups that had voted for and against the motion criticised Beijing's
intervention.
Mr Ronald Arculli, a conservative politician who was in the minority,
defended LegCo's right to debate Mr Patten's proposals and express a view.
He pointed out that LegCo was a law-making institution and not a
consultative body to the government.
Mr Patten, who was in Vancouver yesterday, said he thought Hong Kong people
wanted a rational discussion rather than empty threats.
He said the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and the 1990 Basic Law -
Beijing's constitution for the colony after it reverts to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997 - refer to the executive branch of government being
accountable to the legis-lature.

ISOLATED outbreaks of fighting were reported yesterday in Bosnia on the
first day of the latest ceasefire agreed earlier this week between Serb,
Croat and Moslem military representatives in Sarajevo. UN officers, however,
reported that up to nightfall the ceasefire appeared to be generally
holding.
Shelling was reported at Travnik, 65 miles west of Sarajevo, which is
crammed with thousands of refugees, and at Bihac in northwest Bosnia, where
French troops in the UN's convoy protection operation are based.
Meanwhile, UN plans for escorting relief convoys in Bosnia risk being
seriously set back by delays in deploying Canadian troops to the Serb
stronghold of Banja Luka. It is feared that because of difficulties with
local authorities, deployment may not be possible until February.
The mission is politically crucial since it is the only one of the UN
operations in Bosnia specifically aimed at a Serb area. 'We have got to be
seen to be impartial,' said Brig Roddy Cordy-Simpson, chief of staff at the
UN's Bosnia-Hercegovina command at Kiseljak near Sarajevo. The Canadian
mission is also crucial to opening up the route from Zagreb to the centre of
Bosnia-Hercegovina for humanitarian aid.
UK military planners are meanwhile switching their attention to securing
passage through battle lines on main roads. Lt Col Bob Stewart, the British
battalion commander, said the army had reached the conclusion that it would
be nearly impossible to send sufficiently large amounts of aid along
mountain roads.

towards Macedonia by winning support from other Balkan countries for a
declaration that the former Yugoslav republic's borders are inviolable.
Separately worded announcements by Serbia, Bulgaria and Albania backed a
declaration by Greece designed to rebuff Macedonia's claims that its
territory is under threat from its neighbours.
Athens is refusing to recognise Macedonia under that name, but it has
distanced itself from its traditional ally, Serbia, since Mr Constantine
Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, rejected a proposal last spring from
President Slobodan Milosevic that their countries divide Macedonia.
Mr Mitsotakis stresses that once the problem of the name is resolved, Greece
will promote investment and economic co-operation with the republic.
Greece appears torn between wanting to live up to its responsibilities as
the only member of the EC and Nato in the Balkans, by playing a
peacekeeper's role, and its fears of being out-manoeuvred by one of its
neighbours.
The government is well aware that any Greek military initiative in the
region would open the way for Turkey to intervene on behalf of the ethnic
Turkish minority living in northeastern Greece.
The most persistent Greek worry is that if conflict broke out in Kosovo or
Macedonia, it would be impossible to prevent several hundred thousand
refugees flooding across the border into northern Greece.
However, the government shows no sign of yielding to pressure from other EC
members to drop its objections to recognising Macedonia. Mr Mitsotakis
appears ready to compromise but is under pressure from both his conservative
New Democracy party and the opposition Socialists.
Germany and Britain are trying to seek a compromise between Skopje, the
Macedonian capital, and Athens in the run-up to the EC's Edinburgh summit
next month. Government officials in Bonn said yesterday that Skopje should
amend its constitution to stress that it had no territorial ambitions:
Greece has consistently argued that Macedonia has claims on parts of its
northern territory where a Slav-speaking minority lives. The Bonn officials
said Athens should accept that the word Macedonia should be used in the new
name, but as an adjective not a noun.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Germany will help Croatia house refugees

GERMANY is to help build houses for some of the half a million Yugoslav
refugees waiting in Croatia, foreign ministry officials said yesterday.
Bonn's action has been prompted by its increasing frustration at the
unwillingness of its European Community partners to take more refugees from
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
At the same time, Germany will ask EC countries to take part of another
group, some 7,500 Bosnian refugees who are either being held in detention
camps in Bosnia-Hercegovina, or who have been given temporary, but poor,
shelter in Croatia.
In what appears to be a dual strategy aimed at relieving the burden on
Croatia, which is refusing to accept any more refugees from Bosnia, and at
slowing the influx into Germany, Bonn will spend DM70m (Pounds 29m) on
building homes in Croatia. It will also send 300 train wagons to Croatia, to
act as temporary shelter for the refugees. 'We will provide the heating and
all the running costs,' an official said.
Germany has been at the forefront of EC countries in accepting refugees
fleeing the war in the former Yugoslavia. Since last January, nearly 100,000
people from the region have settled in Germany, bringing the total to
200,000 since the war started in June 1991.
But the additional influx of would-be asylum seekers from Romania, Bulgaria,
and from some of the republics of the former Soviet Union means that Germany
will be hard-pressed to take any greater numbers from Bosnia.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, earlier this week asked the British
government to take Bosnian refugees, but officials said the response from EC
states had been very slow.
'We have to step up the process in allowing the refugees fleeing the war in
Bosnia-Hercegovina to settle in other countries,' one official said.
'We have held talks with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
and we know that the situation is becoming really desperate, especially now
that the winter is coming,' he added.
Of the group of 7,500 Bosnian refugees, about 6,000 are still detained in
Serb-controlled camps in Bosnia.
Although they are free to move out, they cannot return to Bosnia because
their homes have been destroyed, and they cannot travel abroad because
Croatia is no longer taking refugees, and EC countries have been unwilling
to open their doors to them.
A further 1,500 are living in poor conditions in Croatia.
German officials yesterday said these people would die of cold and
starvation, pointing out that Bonn had agreed to take at least 1,000 of
them. This may swell to 3,000 when families are taken into account.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Three big Russian plants to be sold in next two weeks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government is to auction off three large industrial plants,
among them a large tractor factory near Moscow, in the next two weeks in
order to raise the profile of the privatisation programme before the opening
of the Congress of People's Deputies on December 1.
The Congress is expected to be highly critical of the government's economic
programme, and to demand its resignation. However, Mr Anatoly Chubais,
deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation, believes that both
managers and the public support the privatisation and that a successful
public offering of shares in big enterprises will deflect expected attacks
from both moderate and hard-line opponents of the programme.
The three enterprises are being readied for privatisation by their managers,
by officials from the state privatisation committee, and by foreign experts.
They will be the first parts of Russia's industrial sector to pass from
state to private ownership.
The auctions, which have been the subject of intense discussion and debate
over the past few weeks, will be limited to Russians.
The government has raised to 80 per cent the percentage of the enterprises
which must be sold for privatisation vouchers which are being issued to the
whole population. Cash will account for the remainder. The decree will
encourage citizens to retain their vouchers, each of which has a face value
of Rbs10,000. President Boris Yeltsin ordered the percentage increase in
order to endow the vouchers with greater value.
One effect of this is that foreigners wishing to take part in later
privatisations will have to acquire large numbers of vouchers, in which a
secondary market has already developed.
Russia yesterday froze its decision to pull out troops from around the
southern rebel republic of Chechnya, saying the region had broken an
agreement on their withdrawal, Reuter reports.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Ukraine coupon replaces rouble
</HEADLINE>

   KIEV, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE said yesterday it was abandoning the rouble at midnight last night,
replacing it with coupons as a stepping stone to introducing a new currency.
Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the republic's president, announced that 'the rouble
should cease to circulate in Ukraine' from midnight and that it would cease
to be legal tender in Ukraine. A new currency coupon, called the
karbovanets, will be introduced for all transactions from today.
A government order said accounts in Ukrainian banks would be transferred
from roubles to karbovanets coupons.
Holders of roubles were ordered to exchange them for karbovanets within
three days in unlimited quantities at an exchange rate of one karbovanets
coupon per rouble.
Ukraine announced soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union last year that
it would leave the 'rouble zone.' It introduced coupons early this year, but
the rouble stayed legal tender for accounting.
The move to the karbovanets appears to be a half-way house between the
rouble and a new Ukrainian currency, to be called the grivna. Mr Leonid
Kuchma, the new Ukrainian prime minister, said on television this week that
introduction of the grivna would have to wait for the establishment of a
stabilisation fund, and for economic reform.
The karbovanets represents a step back for the Ukrainian leadership, which
had until recently talked of the imminent introduction of a full-blooded
independent currency. Since his appointment Mr Kuchma has taken a sharply
different line from Mr Kravchuk in calling for closer co-operation with
Russia and has repeatedly called attention to Ukraine's weakening economy.

FT  13 NOV 92 / OECD attacks Swiss policy
</HEADLINE>

   By IAN RODGER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS monetary policy has been sharply criticised by the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development.
The OECD suggests in its annual examination of Switzerland that the current
policy of the Swiss National Bank (SNB) leads to confusion in financial
markets about exchange rate and monetary policy objectives and may be an
unreliable way of achieving the central bank's economic objectives.
'It would therefore seem desirable to enhance the transparency of monetary
policy in the short run, beyond the current practice of announcing quarterly
projections of the monetary base (notes in circulation and sight deposits
held at the central bank),' the OECD says.
It recalls that the monetary base became a misleading indicator in the late
1980s after Switzerland had introduced an electronic clearing system. The
SNB then abandoned annual targeting in favour of medium term targeting.
The new system has severe drawbacks, according to the OECD. 'One problem is
the absence of reliable evidence that the envisaged expansion of base money
over the medium term will be compatible with sustained growth of output
under conditions of stable prices. Moreover, it is unclear to what extent
there is scope for the SNB's intention to take exchange rate considerations
into account.'
The OECD says M1 might be a more satisfactory intermediate monetary
aggregate to use as a target. It also appears to favour the controversial
idea of pegging the Swiss franc to the Ecu or the D-Mark. It acknowledges
that this would entail the loss of monetary policy autonomy which in the
past may have allowed Swiss interest rates to be lower than those elsewhere.
'But, given the prospects of greater integration with the rest of Europe, it
is uncertain whether this interest differential can be safeguarded in the
future.'
The OECD also attacks government tolerance of widespread cartels and other
practices that restrain free competition. It suggests that these practices
are largely responsible for the excessively high prices of almost everything
in the country. 'According to purchasing power parity calculations, the
overall domestic price level in Switzerland is 40 per cent higher than the
average for the whole OECD area for private consumption,' it states.
The report acknowledges that Swiss competition policy is becoming tougher,
and that it will become tougher still if the Swiss ratify the European
Economic Area (EEA) treaty in a referendum next month. The country would
then be obliged to take on European Community competition law in most
business activities.
However, a comprehensive reform of Swiss law and policy is still needed to
enshrine the notion that collusive agreements should be banned in principle
and to insist on transparency in the execution of competition policy.
The report says that the prospects for improvement of the Swiss economy,
which has suffered recession, high inflation and deteriorating public
finances for nearly two years, are now good.

FT  13 NOV 92 / New twist in EC saga on tobacco adverts
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC countries which have a national ban on tobacco advertising could block
imports from other EC members of magazines and newspapers carrying such
advertisements, the European Commission said yesterday.
The warning came ahead of today's meeting of health ministers at which
Commission proposals for an EC-wide ban on tobacco advertising will be
discussed for the first time since May.
But a spokesman for Ms Vasso Papandreou, the EC health commissioner,
conceded yesterday that Britain, the Netherlands and Germany had not relaxed
their opposition to a ban since May. Together, the trio can block approval
of the Commission's proposal and no vote is expected today.
The draft directive, which covers advertising, except at point of sale, and
sponsorship, is partly intended to prevent national restrictions from
hampering the free movement of magazines and journals after January 1, 1993.
But advertising agencies, publishers, cigarette manufacturers and the three
member states dispute the value and legality of a ban. Denmark and Greece
also have reservations about the measure.
In a legal opinion for the German Associations of Newspaper and Magazine
Publishers, two senior European lawyers this week said the draft directive
proposing a ban was 'masquerading as a measure designed to ensure the
completion of the internal market' and represented 'a blatant invasion of
the Community into the public health sector (in relation to which the
Community has extremely limited jurisdiction if at all)'.
Yet cigarette manufacturers are still concerned if they relax their
vociferous campaign against the proposals, the opposition to a ban might
crumble.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Clinton aides in defence review
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AIDES to Governor Bill Clinton are considering ways of restructuring the US
defence establishment to make it readier to engage in multilateral military
action.
Defence analysts close to the president-elect and his advisers say they are
concerned about the current Pentagon stance on the use of military force in
conflicts around the world.
Most senior officers basically seek to rule out US military intervention
except in the rarest of cases where they can see an immediate military goal
that can be quickly achieved by the use of overwhelming force.
Democrats in Congress, led by Congressman Les Aspin, chairman of the House
of Representatives armed services committee, have already opened a debate
over the use of force.
Mr Aspin argues that what he calls the 'all-or-nothing school,' which fears
a repetition of the US's unhappy experiences in Vietnam and Beirut if US
forces are used in all but the most carefully defined of circumstances, has
been weakened because the collapse of the Soviet Union removes some of the
threat that small conflicts could escalate into greater wars.
He also warns that the American people may not be willing to pay Dollars
250bn or Dollars 200bn a year for a military that is not very useful.
'It may be that to maintain a military for the extreme contingencies it will
be necessary to show that it is useful in lesser contingencies, too,' he
said in a recent speech.
Governor Clinton promised, in a Veterans Day speech on Wednesday, to
maintain 'the strongest and most appropriate defence forces' with advanced
technology emphasising air and sea mobility.
But the US media's attention is currently focused on an aspect of Mr
Clinton's defence policy that is of less than burning interest to the US's
allies: the question of whether homosexual men and women may be allowed to
remain in the armed services.
Mr Clinton repeated on Wednesday his pledge to lift the current ban - which
has recently been successfully challenged in federal court - after
discussions with senior military officers who are unhappy at the proposed
policy change.
'I think there are ways we can deal with this that will increase the comfort
level of a lot of the military folks here,' he said.

It forecasts 1.1 per cent real growth for the economy next year after a

foreign demand. Private consumption will also benefit from the adjustment of
contractual wages to past price inflation, it says.

FT  13 NOV 92 / OECD blames cartels for high prices: There is no free market
in nearly half Swiss goods and services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY visitor to Switzerland winces at its extraordinarily high prices for
everything from a cup of coffee to a hotel room to a train ride.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has confirmed
that prices of goods and services for private consumption in Switzerland are
40 per cent higher than the OECD average, on a purchasing power parity
basis. Prices of goods and services for capital investment are 30 per cent
higher.
In a special study in its annual examination of the Swiss economy, the OECD
attributes these huge discrepancies to the pervasive presence of cartels and
other curbs on free competition in Swiss markets.
Cartels are said to exist in 90 per cent of 72 industrial activities,
usually involving price-fixing and/or market sharing agreements.
Concentration is also high in several segments of the wholesale trade, and
the market share of the five largest retail traders is nearly 80 per cent,
'more than in any other European country'.
The study suggests that high prices cause 'high economy-wide static welfare
losses' as well as 'significant dynamic efficiency losses'. The rigidity of
prices may contribute to the persistence of inflation over a long period.
Although most Swiss companies tend to be small to medium-sized,
concentration is high in most business sectors. 'Oligopolistic structures
have been established in several industries, like tobacco, leather and
footwear, chemicals, electricaland electronic equipment, food processing,
textile, paper, machines and vehicles.'
The strength and persistence of collusive practices may seem paradoxical,
given the openness of the country's trade. By 1985, the share of
manufactured imports in the domestic market was 42 per cent, well above the
OECD average. But the role of imports in enforcing competitive discipline is
undermined because most importers participate in the highly lucrative
domestic distribution cartels.
Other factors are the highly protected status of food products and the fact
that non-tradeable services represent a predominant share in the Swiss
economy, 48 per cent of private sector GDP, if construction is included.
Many Swiss laws and regulations contribute to restraint of trade. Laws
permit Swiss companies to protect themselves from takeovers by hostile or
foreign interests, and the report shows that Swiss firms tend to maintain
their market positions for an extraordinarily long time.
Arcane norms and technical standards, business regulations and blatantly
protectionist procurement policies, especially by cantonal governments, all
keep out competitors. Swiss authorities charge twice as much as those in
neighbouring countries to approve imported telephone sets. Swiss retailers
are prohibited from using many sales promotion tactics that are common
elsewhere.
As a result, the OECD estimates that the prices of goods and services
accounting for nearly 45 per cent of the weighting in the consumer price
index are 'administered or more or less strongly regulated at at least one
stage of the way to the consumer'.
It also observes that while Swiss inflation is not high, it is relatively
persistent, suggesting that 'inflationary shocks in Swiss consumer prices
peter out very slowly'. This persistence stems mainly from domestically
produced items.
Swiss competition law is 'probably among the most permissive of collusive
behaviour and restrictive practices.' the OECD says. It accepts that private
interests may exert an influence on third parties through the concerted
acquisition of economic power, but as long as there is no abuse, private
market order may be as good as, or better than, a free market.
Thus, the original law calls on the authorities only to counteract the
harmful economic effects of cartels. Revisions in the 1980s clarified that
cartels were harmful if they eliminated 'effective competition' or if their
negative effects outweighed positive ones. They also were accompanied by a
marked strengthening in enforcement, leading notably to the dismantling of
cartels in banking and brewing.
However, the OECD claims that Swiss rules remain 'in stark contrast' with
common practices in other OECD countries and particularly in the EC.
Moreover, the number of enforcement staff is 'very low by international
standards'.
It is sceptical of the view among some Swiss that most cartels will
spontaneously collapse as domestic markets are subjected to more import
competition. 'The collapse of cartels does not necessarily lead to more
competitive markets. Indeed, increased concentration is an often observed
outcome.'
It argues that only further toughening of competition law and its
enforcement will lead to greater competition.
If Swiss voters ratify the European Economic Area (EEA) treaty in a
referendum next month, then Switzerland will take on EC competition rules.
These prohibit cartels, the abuse of dominant positions and provide for
examination of proposed mergers. Other EC rules will force Switzerland to
align its norms and technical requirements, migration policy and public
procurement practices up to a point.
However, the OECD calls for a fundamentally revised Swiss competition law in
which 'the protection of the competition process per se should be
established as an overriding objective'.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Cavallo refuses to be blown off reform path: John Barham
interviews the Argentine economy minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S financial markets have been beset by an atmosphere of crisis
this week. Persistent rumours of the impending resignation of Mr Domingo
Cavallo, the economy minister, have combined with a widespread belief that
the government's commitment to economic reform is wavering and a growing
unease over the worsening balance of trade.
For the first time since March 1991, the foreign exchange markets pushed the
US dollar above its maximum official rate of one peso to close at 1.004
pesos on Wednesday. This week the Central Bank had to sell Dollars 108.4m in
hard currency, equivalent to 1.6 per cent of its reserves, to support the
peso. Argentina has seen a Dollars 111.2m net capital outflow so this far
this month, while prices on the stock exchange have fallen 13.2 per cent.
Yesterday, markets were calmer, with share prices rising 1 per cent at
lunchtime. But sustained demand kept the dollar slightly above its parity
with the peso, despite a 5 percentage point rise in interest rates to 28-30
per cent a year.
In the midst of these anxieties, Mr Cavallo reaffirmed in an interview with
the Financial Times his unswerving commitment to economic orthodoxy, saying
he had 'the full support of President Carlos Menem and of the people.'
He dismissed fears that Mr Menem's political agenda was interfering with the
advance of reform: 'President Menem knows that the first sign of populism
will lead to a reversion of expectations, capital outflows and inflation, at
a phenomenal political cost.' Mr Menem wants to amend the constitution in
order to run for re-election in 1995.
Mr Cavallo said that while the economy was unlikely to be a winning factor
in the 1993 mid-term congressional elections, as it was in 1991, 'we will
lose the elections totally if we weaken and respond to demands of populism.'
He recognised that the elections, scheduled for next September, required him
to win Congressional approval for two key reform laws by May, after which
'the electoral climate will make it difficult' for the laws to clear
Congress.
Union pressure has blocked passage of bills reforming the social security
system and the labour market, both of which are seen as necessary to improve
the economy's efficiency. Mr Cavallo said the government was 'working hard'
to win approval for these bills, and the stalled 1993 budget.
Unease that his reforms are unravelling became acute after Mr Cavallo raised
import barriers last month and admitted that Argentina would have a trade
deficit in 1992 for the first time in 11 years. But he insisted that the
protectionist measures were temporary, while permanent reforms of the tax
and tariff structure, announced at the same time, would increase exports and
investment.
A key objective, he admitted, was to slow imports from Brazil - Argentina's
partner in the nascent Mercosur common market - which were rising 5-6 per
cent a month. This was an 'external shock' that had to be neutralised, he
said. Argentina's trade deficit with Brazil hit Dollars 900m in August.
Mr Cavallo said that while he maintains his original 'political enthusiasm'
for integration with Brazil, instability there meant the pace of integration
had to slow. This did not mean 'that I am thinking of leaving Mercosur and
applying to join Nafta: what I say is that all countries must have their
options open.'

FT  13 NOV 92 / Government hopes recovery package may end turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COLLECTIVE cheer from Tory MPs for Mr Norman Lamont's economic recovery
package last night raised the government's hopes that it may at last have a
chance to draw a line under the political turmoil of the past two months.
As the Conservative backbenches focused on lower interest rates and the
financial help for the housing market, industry and construction, the
instant judgment was that Mr Lamont had strengthened his precarious hold on
the chancellorship.
Mr John Major sought to capitalise on the favourable reaction by telling
restless MPs on the right of his party that he was determined to focus the
government's efforts on boosting economic growth.
At a dinner held by the 92 group of MPs, which in recent weeks has led
backbench criticism of his strategy, the prime minister said that achieving
recovery was now 'number one priority'.
Opposition parties, however, dismissed the Autumn Statement as a timid
response to the recession and warned that the promised squeeze on public
spending was likely to drive the economy further into slump. There was
private acknowledgment among ministers that the success of the package - and
the government's political fortunes - now depended critically on the
reaction of business and consumers over the next few weeks and months. The
government, one cabinet minister said, had bought itself a breathing space.
The consensus was that Mr Lamont's future also would hinge on whether the
measures proved bold enough to stabilise the housing market and boost
confidence among consumers. One colleague commented laconically that last
night the chancellor was 'as safe as houses'.
The government's decision to load most of the pain of the spending squeeze
on to public sector pay won warm applause from Tory MPs - as did the
chancellor's promise that ministers would receive no increase at all.
Provision for private sector finance for transport and other infrastructure
projects and increased capital allowances for business also went down well
among the government's supporters.
There was relief that the Treasury had been thwarted in its attempts to
freeze or tax some social security benefits.
Ministers said that fear of further backbench revolts had persuaded the
cabinet against taking any measures requiring legislation.
Among Whitehall departments, the main loser from the squeeze was judged to
be the Ministry of Defence. But the health, transport and environment
departments were among others forced to accept cash reductions in their
previously agreed budgets.
There was also concern over an acknowledged clampdown on next year's
financing for local authorities. Tory MPs fear that the average household
bill in the south of the country when the council tax is introduced next
April could soar to over Pounds 600.
Ministers acknowledged that the government might yet face a rebellion when
MPs vote on the revenue support grant settlement early in the new year.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Industry and City express some doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRY and the City welcomed the chancellor's package yesterday but
withheld unqualified approval.
The measures were widely seen as a starting point for economic recovery for
industry, which is reeling from the effects of the longest recession since
the 1930s. But there were doubts over whether the measures would do enough
to boost confidence significantly.
Industrialists who had called for a big cut in interest rates were
disappointed by the 1 percentage point cut.
Some industry leaders wondered if the measures provided a coherent strategy
for long-term investment and recovery.
Others argued that the cheapest borrowing rates for 15 years, combined with
an effective 14 per cent devaluation of sterling, would provide a badly
needed boost to the economy.
Mrs Ann Robinson, head of policy at the Institute of Directors, said she was
'partially satisfied' with the package.
The Forum of Private Business - representing 20,000 smaller businesses  -
said the chancellor had offered 'only crumbs of comfort'.
Some dealers in the City claimed the package contained ingenious measures.
Others wondered whether it would do enough to stimulate growth.
The chancellor's forecast that the public sector borrowing requirement would
rise to Pounds 44bn in 1993-94 depressed gilt prices.
Sterling closed in London at DM2.42, a  1/4 of a pfennig up on the day, but
eased in New York to DM2.4156. Against the dollar, the pound closed in
London fractionally weaker at Dollars 1.524, but firmed in New York to
Dollars 1.5285.
The FT-SE 100 Index of leading shares closed at 2,726.4, showing a net gain
of 29.6.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Lamont unveils growth plan: Interest rates cut - Housing
boost / Car sales tax scrapped / Aid for industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, yesterday unveiled plans to pull the
economy out of recession with a 1 percentage point cut in interest rates,
measures to boost housing, investment and construction, and the surprise
abolition of the tax on new car sales.
At the centre of a 'strategy for growth' was a package of time-limited
measures to boost business confidence and activity that should inject an
estimated Pounds 1bn into the economy over the rest of this financial year.
Mr Lamont's keenly awaited measures raised the spirits of a government
demoralised by a series of setbacks and received the qualified approval of
industry and the City. However, the Treasury is forecasting only a very
modest recovery next year.
Delivering an Autumn Statement that brought rousing cheers from Tory
backbenchers in the House of Commons, Mr Lamont fulfilled the government's
promise of keeping public spending within the preset planning total of
Pounds 244.5bn for 1993-94, largely through limiting pay settlements in the
public sector to a maximum of 1.5 per cent.
To aid hard-hit sectors, the government will:
Spend Pounds 750m mainly to buy 20,000 empty houses by the end of this
financial year to reduce the overhang of unsold properties on the housing
market and house families in need.
Allow local authorities to use all capital receipts from council house sales
between today and the end of next year on capital programmes, triggering an
estimated Pounds 1.75bn of capital spending in the next 3 1/2 years.
Provide an extra Pounds 700m of export credit cover for exporters.
Raise for 12 months only the allowances for investment in plant and
machinery, excluding cars, to 40 per cent from 25 per cent. The government
will also introduce a 20 per cent allowance for spending on industrial and
agricultural buildings ordered before October 31 1993.
Abolish the car tax from today, cutting the cost of an average family car by
about Pounds 400. The measure, which will cost about Pounds 100m this year
and Pounds 750m in 1993-94, will be financed by higher motoring taxes next
year.
Due to the recession, government borrowing is now expected to total Pounds
37bn in 1992-93, against Pounds 28bn estimated at the time of the March
Budget. Treasury figures suggest the public sector borrowing requirement
could rise to about Pounds 44bn in 1993-94.
With the Treasury forecasting a 1 per cent contraction in gross domestic
product this year, Mr Lamont announced that the Bank of England would set a
minimum lending rate of 7 per cent today, cutting base rates by 1 point from
8 per cent and lopping 'a further Pounds 1bn off industry's costs'.
The public pay freeze will allow the government to shift an estimated Pounds
1.5bn from current to capital spending projects next year. Mr Lamont
announced that London Underground's Jubilee Line extension would go ahead,
subject to completion of negotiations with the administrators of the Canary
Wharf development, its bankers and London Transport.
The chancellor also announced a relaxation of Treasury rules that could
allow private finance to play a bigger part in infrastructure projects such
as London's east-west Cross Rail project and the Channel tunnel rail link.
The government would 'actively encourage' joint ventures with the private
sector and allow greater use of leasing where it offered good value for
money, the chancellor said. British Rail, for example, will be allowed to
lease Pounds 150m of new rolling stock in the next three years in a move
that will develop the leasing market for rolling stock and so aid plans for
privatisation.
The government's spending plans were held within the targeted total only
after weeks of difficult negotiations between senior cabinet ministers,
headed by Mr Lamont and Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, and the
spending departments.
From 1993-94 onwards, most public spending will be expressed in terms of a
new 'control total' that excludes cyclical expenditures such as unemployment
benefit and income support. Under the new definition, departmental
expenditure will total Pounds 243.8bn in the next financial year, rising to
Pounds 253.6bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 263.3bn in 1995-96. These increases
will represent annual average growth of 1.4 per cent in real terms, compared
with 3.2 per cent a year in the three years to 1992-93.
Mr Lamont said that the government had met in full its commitment to index
pensions and other benefits. Contrary to some expectations, he announced no
increase in National Insurance contributions beyond the usual indexation of
the various bands for employers and employees. However, he said MPs' pay
increases would be brought into line with the rest of the public sector
while ministers will receive no pay rise in the year ahead.
Recession-linked social security costs of nearly Pounds 4bn have left their
mark on departmental spending plans. Defence spending will be Pounds 570m
less in 1993-94 than budgeted a year ago and is set to fall steadily in real
terms in each of the coming financial years. Local government will receive
Pounds 520m less next year. The government's finances in 1993-94 will be
helped by an expected drop of Pounds 1.16bn in payments to the European
Community budget.
Transport Department spending will be cut by Pounds 270m against original
plans. But this largely reflects the switch to leasing finance for rail. The
road programme will be maintained.
In spite of the measures to boost confidence and stimulate economic growth,
the Treasury is taking a cautious view. Its latest forecast, also released
yesterday, projects 1 per cent real growth for the economy next year,
compared with the 1.25 per cent consensus of independent forecasters. The
government expects to have only limited success reversing the decline of
fixed investment in recent years: a sluggish upturn in consumer spending
will be the main spur to growth.
It is expected that inflation, as measured by the retail prices index less
mortgage interest payments, will just hold within the government's 1 to 4
per cent target this year and next. The Treasury forecast expects this
so-called underlying inflation rate will be 3.75 per cent in 12 months to
the end of 1993.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Pounds 750m allocated to revive housing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANCELLOR yesterday injected Pounds 750m into the housing market in an
effort to check sharply falling prices. The move marks the first time the
government has intervened directly to reduce empty housing stock.
Combined with a cut in base rates to 7 per cent, the move is an effort to
restore confidence in the housing market. But banks and building societies
said the change was unlikely to act as an immediate stimulus to house
buying.
The aim is to cut by 20,000 the estimated stock of 200,000 empty properties.
Housing associations are being given Pounds 700m to buy empty homes, and
another Pounds 50m is being allocated to subsidise local authority tenants
to buy privately.
Building societies reacted quickly to the base rate cut by reducing mortgage
rates. But Abbey National bank and three societies widened lending margins
by cutting mortgage rates by only 0.75 percentage point.
The chancellor increased short-term spending on housing in England without
raising the overall subsidy to the Housing Corporation. He brought forward
Pounds 577m of a three-year Pounds 6bn expenditure plan, marking it out for
house purchases.
Mr Geoff Ellerton, Midland's product director for branch banking, said
neither the base rate cut nor the reduction in empty housing stock would act
as an immediate stimulus, but would merely accelerate a future recovery.
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing market analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said
the market was so depressed that the measures would not have a strong
effect. Associations might not spend money on repossessed homes.
The Building Societies Association said it expected the measure to ease the
oversupply of housing and to help the social rental sector. The Pounds 700m
works out at an average of Pounds 35,000 per property bought by housing
associations.
West Bromwich, Newcastle and Yorkshire building societies announced a 0.75
percentage point cut in rates. Woolwich and Alliance &amp; Leicester building
societies said they would announce a 0.75 point cut, while Halifax,
Nationwide and Leeds promised a cut soon.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Industry backs Russian reforms: Leading industrialist says
he supports moves towards a market economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE leader of Russia's industrialists yesterday angrily hit out at critics
who had accused him and his members of threatening economic reform.
'Unlike some people in the government, the Russian Union of Industrialists
is doing its best to create the infrastructure for a market economy,' Mr
Arkady Volsky told a Financial Times conference in Moscow.
Mr Volsky, president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and
Entrepreneurs, said his members, drawn from both the state and the fledgling
private sector, were neither 'fat cats' nor 'enemies of reform'.
He was responding to charges made the previous day by Prof Anders Aslund, a
senior adviser to the Russian government, that Mr Volsky and the Civic
Union, a centrist political group of which he was a founding member, were
the 'most serious threat' to Russian economic reform.
Later, talking to Russian deputies in the parliament, Mr Volsky said that in
recent meetings with Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, the two men
had substantially agreed on a number of basic economic issues.
But Mr Gaidar, also addressing the deputies, said the government would not
return to 'the nostalgic central direction of the economy' which Civic Union
proposed in its recently completed programme.
Civic Union will put its programme, which it is pressing President Boris
Yeltsin to use as the basis for policies in a revamped cabinet, to a
congress of industrialists to be held tomorrow in Moscow.
The congress, at which Mr Yeltsin has been invited to speak, will be a
sounding board both for opposition to the government and, the government
hopes, for industrialists who support the policies of economic liberalism
and privatisation.
Mr Volsky's outburst at the FT conference, entitled Doing Business in
Russia, was designed to prove to the audience of business people that he was
no friend to the old centrally planned economy, favouring instead a coherent
and planned transition to a market economy.
He said he backed bankruptcies, privatisations, strict control of credit and
individual initiative.
Later speakers, however, emphasised the need for tight control of the money
supply and faster liberalisation of a still state-controlled economy.
Mr William Crowley, leader of the team from Goldman Sachs, the US investment
bank which is advising the Russian government, said western investment in
large industrial companies would be slow and limited for the foreseeable
future. But he expected a lot of interest in the energy field and in the
creation of plants manufacturing food and other consumer products.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Puerto Rico sees gains in Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUERTO RICAN concerns that the island's export markets in the US could be
endangered by Mexico's participation in the North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta) have eased with indications that the island could gain
from the trade pact.
Puerto Rico's exports to the US last year were valued at about Dollars 17bn,
accounting for 85 per cent of all the island's exports. But government
officials and economists had feared that earnings from exports would be
reduced because of direct competition from a more cost-efficient Mexico.
A study commissioned by the island's development bank, however, has
concluded that, if Nafta were to be implemented, Puerto Rico would have a
clear advantage over Mexico in the US and Canadian markets in
pharmaceuticals, electronic components and accessories, professional
instruments, electronic computing and rum distilling.
This conclusion, said the study done by KPMG Peat Marwick of the US, is
based on comparisons of the return on investments in Mexico and Puerto Rico.
'In pharmaceuticals, the estimated rate of return to a Puerto Rican
investment. . . is about 65 per cent, whereas after Nafta the rate of return
to an investment in Mexico making the same product for the US market is
about 32 per cent,' said the study.
It suggested, however, that Puerto Rico will find it hard to compete
successfully with Mexico in other sectors. In the clothing sector, for
example, the rate of return on investments in Mexico will be 50 per cent
with the implementation of Nafta, while the rate in Puerto Rico will be 30
per cent.
There will be similar disadvantages for Puerto Rico's textile, tuna and
leather footwear industries, the report concluded.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Thessaloniki invests in future as a transit centre for
Balkans: Greece's largest cargo-handling terminal is taking a long-term view
in undertaking a big development programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BULLDOZERS are churning up quaysides at the port of Thessaloniki,
manoeuvring around steel plates bound for the former Yugoslav republic of
Macedonia and containers from Bulgaria. A Dr30bn (Dollars 144m) development
programme, the largest infrastructure project in northern Greece, is under
way to make the port a transit centre for the Balkans.
However, Thessaloniki accepts that it must take a long-term view of the
region's prospects. UN sanctions against trade with Serbia have wiped out a
sizeable amount of business since July, while the former communist Balkan
countries are trading less as they apply market reforms.
'It could take till the end of the 1990s for this area to recover. But by
then, Thessaloniki will be in a position to handle a large percentage of
transit trade in south-east Europe,' says Mr John Maronidis, the director of
port operations.
Thessaloniki, Greece's largest cargo-handling terminal, lies at the centre
of the Thermaic Gulf in the north Aegean. Only a few hours' drive from
Bulgaria and Macedonia, it is a more convenient outlet for both countries
than ports on the Black Sea.
Last year, Thessaloniki handled 13.9m tonnes of dry and liquid cargo. For
the first seven months of 1992, dry cargo volume increased by 15 per cent
and and liquid cargo, mostly oil, by 11 per cent.
Despite a sharp fall in Bulgaria's foreign trade, with exports down last
year by 70 per cent and imports by 40 per cent, Thessaloniki's free zone is
handling an increasing amount of Bulgarian cargo in transit. Last year's
total of 57,000 tonnes was matched in the first eight months of 1992.
Yugoslav goods - mainly Macedonian - totalled 698,138 tonnes last year,
compared with 677,837 tonnes for the first eight months of this year.
Trade with Macedonia is not affected by Greece's refusal to recognise its
northern neighbour under that name, though oil shipments have been held up
since August following accusations that oil was reaching Serbia from Greece
through Macedonia. Greek sensitivities over nomenclature are assuaged by
stamping transport documents from Macedonia as 'unrecognised' by Greek
authorities.
Thessaloniki has benefited from the lifting of transport restrictions in
Yugoslavia and Bulgaria in the past two years. The obligation on exporters
to use state-owned enterprises meant goods followed round-about itineraries
imposed by the government.
Although Bulgarian and Romanian ports are now trying to attract more trade
by offering tariff discounts, they suffer from labour problems and severe
shortages of equipment.
However, Thessaloniki, a state-controlled port, is not without labour
difficulties of its own. The 1,000 stevedores still work only one daily
shift, although the container terminal operates on a 24-hour basis.
This will change as the development programme advances. As one of the few
profitable state enterprises, with annual earnings of some Dr1bn,
Thessaloniki port is scheduled for privatisation by 1995.
By that time, the harbour will be two metres deeper and the main quay will
have been extended by 500 metres. A Dr5.2bn landfill project will expand
warehouse space in the free zone, and a new railhead, the overland link with
western Europe, is being built within the port precinct.

MR Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, has suffered a new blow to his
re-election hopes with the publication of the latest nationwide opinion poll
showing a sharp drop in support for his Fianna Fail party and his own
personal popularity hitting a new low.
The poll published yesterday in the Irish Times, carried out by the Market
Research Bureau of Ireland, shows support for Fianna Fail down from 49 per
cent to 40 per cent over the past six weeks, and Mr Reynolds' leadership
rating down from 60 per cent of voters satisfied to 31 per cent.
The poll was conducted last Monday. It remains to be seen whether a IPounds
1bn (Dollars 1.6bn) spending package announced by Fianna Fail this week, as
part of its manifesto, will enable it to turn the tide.
Mr Reynolds has staked his political future on winning an absolute majority
in the November 25 general election, but will require at least 47 per cent
of the vote to do so.
The poll also indicates that the majority of the electorate did not think a
general election was necessary, and that most believe Mr Reynolds was
responsible for precipitating it, in the 'feud of honour' with his coalition
partners.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Sweden erects banking defences: A look at a package of
support measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN has reacted to its banking crisis in a similar fashion to September's
currency crisis. Last week's package of support measures for its ailing
financial sector indicate that it will defend the banking system whatever
the size of the bill.
Two months ago, in a similar display of resolution, Sweden made it clear
that it would defend the krona against currency speculators at any cost -
even 500 per cent overnight interest rates.
The promise of unlimited assistance is meant to send a clear signal to the
international banking community that Sweden will do whatever it takes to
ensure the obligations of its financial sector are met. It has not
quantified the amounts, but the cost will certainly run to billions of
kronor.
Credit losses across the financial sector have already reached SKr100bn for
1990-1992 and could well total as much again over the next few years.
The assistance package will inevitably worsen the budget deficit, increasing
the likelihood of further government austerity measures, in addition to the
two crisis packages announced in September.
It is, of course, something of an embarrassment for the country's
centre-right coalition, which has espoused free-market principles, to have
to mount such a bail-out. Sweden, with its broadly-based economy and
conservatively managed banking sector, had expected to avoid the sort of
bank rescue packages that the governments in both Norway and Finland have
been forced to undertake.
Events this year have proved otherwise. Sweden has already had to come to
the aid of three of its beleagured financial institutions, including
Nordbanken and Gota Bank, two of the country's largest banks.
Such developments have clearly shaken confidence in the system, prompting
the government to make its support more explicit. Hence, the hurried fashion
in which it has put together its support programme over the last two months.
The result is that from early next year a special authority, directly
answerable to the government, will be set up to administer assistance to
both banks and state-affiliated credit institutions.
Generally, the support will be in the form of loans and guarantees, but a
key aim is to have flexibility and the government does not rule out taking
over bad debts and making direct equity injections in specific instances.
Essentially, the authority's role will be to nurse back to health
institutions capable of survival and to arrange an orderly liquidation of
those too weak to make it in the longer term.
The authority can thus be expected to play an important part in the
near-term restructuring of the Swedish financial sector, by forcibly
linking, for example, parts of one bank with those of another as part of a
rescue package.
Critics say the scheme may result in good money being thrown after bad, and
that it may stimulate bad lending practices. It may also place a strong bank
like Handelsbanken at a competitive disadvantage if some of its rivals are
able to gain assistance on favourable terms.
The only safeguard here is the provision that viable banks which obtain
state loans will be compelled to repay them on commercial terms, once they
are in a financially strong enough position.
Handelsbanken acknowledges that it may be disadvantaged, but says there was
no alternative to the plan as a whole.
The key consideration was to soothe the fears of the international financial
community about the solidity of the Swedish banking system - and in that at
least, the unveiling of the scheme appears to have been successful.
That is the positive aspect. The negative aspect is that, as yet, there is
still no sign that the worst of the problems in the banking sector are
over.'1993 will be another very difficult year for the banking system,' says
Mr Christer Bergquist, who will be the new authority's director general.
There may be an improvement in some areas, such as real estate next year,
but as the economy will still be mired in recession, bankruptcies and
problems in the household sector mean credit losses will continue at high
levels.
It is as well that the government has put no time limit on its assistance
package for the signs are that it will need to be in place for quite a few
years to come. The Swedish economy should start picking up in the middle of
next year, although the recovery will be slow and sluggish, according to a
new analysis from Gota Bank, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm.
The bank says the turnaround will be lead by exports, spreading to other
parts of the economy during 1994. The pace of recovery will not be enough to
prevent a third successive year of falling GNP and Gota Bank warns that GNP
will fall by 2.1 per cent next year, compared with a decline of just 0.8 per
cent this year. There will also be a sharp increase in unemployment in the
next two years, according to the bank. It believes the unemployment level
next year will increase to 7 per cent from 5 per cent in 1992, before
increasing further to 7.5 per cent in 1994.

<TEXT>
THE European Community's Monetary Committee will vet the terms of an Ecu8bn
(Dollars 9.9bn) loan to Italy when it meets next week, Reuter reports from
Brussels.
The Committee will examine a proposal from the European Commission that the
balance of payments loan to prop up Italy's economy should be split into
four equal parts spread over three years, EC sources said.
At present the conditions attached to the loan concentrate mainly on
periodic reviews of the progress of Italy's budgetary programme, but the
Monetary Committee can suggest further conditions if it deems it necessary.
If, as expected, the Monetary Committee approves the loan, it will go to the
November 23 meeting of EC finance ministers for their final decision.
When Italy applied for the loan in early October it implied that approval
would help speed re-entry of the lira to the exchange rate mechanism which
it left under intense speculative pressure in mid-September.
At the time Prime Minister Giuliano Amato said approval of the loan was
likely to be conditional on the government pushing through a 1993 budget
which sets a target of L93,000bn (Dollars 68.5bn) in savings.

scheme

<TEXT>
A proposal to award Mr Leonard Licht, Jupiter Tyndall's new deputy chairman,
options over 1.8m of the fund management group's shares was approved by
two-thirds of shareholders yesterday, with Mercury Asset Management voting
against the proposal.
Mr John Duffield, Jupiter Tyndall's chairman, acknowledged that the scheme
was unusual in that the terms under which the options might be exercised
were undisclosed. 'We haven't disclosed them for commercial reasons,' he
said, but insisted they were 'very stringent'.
The Association of British Insurers has set guidelines for the exercise of
executive share options and urges that they should only be exercisable on
demonstration of improvements in company performance.
MAM, Mr Licht's former employer and holder of 24 per cent of Jupiter's
shares, had been joined in its opposition by an insurance company
shareholder. The vote occurred at an extraordinary meeting to approve Mr
Licht's share options along with three other schemes intended to award share
options to employees.
The options, exercisable in three years, entitle Mr Licht to purchase shares
at 108p.

<TEXT>
THE Norwegian government is finalising far-reaching measures to support the
country's three biggest banks, which are in danger of failing to meet
capital adequacy regulations unless they receive further state cash.
By the end of this year, the banks must have a capital adequacy of at least
8 per cent of risk-weighted assets. Den norske Bank, Christiania Bank and
Fokus Bank are negotiating with the state-backed bank insurance fund to
obtain further capital support.
All three have this year failed to improve their financial positions, in
spite of state cash transfers in 1991 of nearly NKr25bn (Dollars 3.87bn)
which saved them from insolvency.
As a result of last year's actions, the state became sole owner of both
Christiania and Fokus and owns more than 85 per cent of DnB.
Next Thursday, parliament is expected to approve a request by the bank
insurance fund for additional state cash. Local analysts estimate the fund
will call on the government for between NKr5bn and NKr8bn.
Mr Tormod Hermansen, the head of the fund, said he was surprised and deeply
disappointed by the banks' recent nine-month figures - DnB losses, for
example, rose to NKr2.46bn from NKr2.3bn - and was not satisfied with their
efforts to take tougher steps to reduce operating costs.
Mr Hermansen said the banks were not, in general, earning enough to cover
operating costs and were supporting too high a level of service for which
customers were unwilling to pay.
He has called on the banks to cuts costs by 15 per cent, and hopes to
conclude negotiations at the weekend.
The bank employees' association is resisting further staff reductions and
has scheduled a one-hour strike for today.
The association claims a 15 per cent cost-cut would mean the loss of 2,000
jobs. The Norwegian banking industry has already shed more than 8,000 jobs
in the last five years.
The insurance fund may also establish a property company to which the banks
can transfer part of their property holdings. Bank property asset values
have fallen sharply in recent years. DnB has property assets of NKr17bn,
Christiania has NKr2.3bn and Fokus NKr2.8bn. Mr Hermansen said the state,
the banks and private investors would own the new company.
The negotiations will also centre on the commercial banks selling parts of
their distribution networks to savings banks in an effort to consolidate
operations to specific regions.

<TEXT>
ATLAS Copco, Europe's largest air compressor manufacturer, lifted profits,
after financial items, to SKr751m (Dollars 125.9m) for the first nine months
of 1992, up 22 per cent on the same 1991 period.
Operating profit after depreciation rose 24 per cent to SKr914m. Sales rose
a more modest 6 per cent to SKr11.65bn, largely reflecting the acquisition
of AEG's electrical power tool operations at the start of the year.
Atlas Copco said it continued to suffer from recession in many of its main
markets and currency movements had also had a negative impact. But it noted
that it was now reaping the benefit of restructuring and investment carried
out in 1990 and 1991, which had enabled it to offset some of the effects of
the downturn.
The biggest turnround came in the construction and mining technique business
area, which posted a SKr128m profit in the nine months, compared with a
SKr47m loss.
Last year this division was responsible for the biggest share of an overall
SKr166m restructuring charge.
The Industrial Technique division, which now includes the AEG power tool
activities, saw earnings fall to SKr112m from SKr192m. The third major area
of operation, Compressor Technique, boosted earnings to SKr755m from
SKr749m.
The group expects its operations to be effected by continued weak demand for
the rest of the year, with recent currency movements having an additional
adverse impact.
Nevertheless, it still expects a better result than in 1991, when profits
after financial items amounted to SKr910m.
Stora Kopparbergs, the forest products group, has accepted a new offer from
holding company Industriforvaltnings AB Kinnevik for its shares in Korsnas.
Stora owns 15 per cent of the voting rights and 13 per cent of Korsnas'
capital.

HENRI Matisse's 'Harmony in Yellow', a domestic interior, showing his model
Zita asleep at a table, sold for Dollars 14.52m. (Pounds 9.6m) at Christie's
in New York on Wednesday night.
The price was an auction record for the artist, exceeding the Dollars 12.4m
paid in 1989 at the height of the art-market boom.
Matisse painted the work in Nice in 1928 and it has been in a private
collection since the early 1930s. It was modestly estimated at up to Dollars
7m and proved the highlight of an exceptional auction.
The sale totalled Dollars 70.6m with 59 of the 76 lots sold. Just 9 per cent
by value was unsold. The total was within Christie's expectations and
suggested that its policy of modest estimates and selective choice of art
tempted US private buyers. The auction was the best in the market for
Impressionist and Modern paintings for more than two years and did much
better than Sotheby's sale on Tuesday which was 38 per cent unsold. One of
Monet's few fully completed versions of water lilies, painted when he was
78, sold for Dollars 12.1m - comfortably above estimate. 'Two Dancers in
Green Dresses' by Degas also sold well, at Dollars 7.156m, to a private
European collector. Another Monet, a view of Venice, made just over Dollars
3m.
All 24 pictures from the collection of the late Dorothy Rodgers, widow of
the composer Richard Rodgers, were sold, confirming the appeal of paintings
fresh to the market. The top price in this group was the Dollars 2.2m paid
for 'Guitar and Newspaper' by Picasso, although this was below estimate.
In London yesterday 'The Antique Juggling Girl', one of the few full-length
nudes painted by Lord Leighton, sold at Sotheby's for Pounds 440,000, at its
low estimate. It was the top lot in an auction of Victorian pictures which
made Pounds 1.7m but was 30 per cent unsold.

PROF Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, yesterday rejected
accusations that he had been slow to react to the mounting coal crisis,
David Lascelles writes.
Prof Littlechild is studying electricity companies' purchasing decisions to
see whether they have been unfairly favouring gas over coal. Critics say he
should have had such a review long ago.
Prof Littlechild said an earlier review 'would have found lower gas prices
than now and higher prices offered for electricity from coal-fired plant'.
He said that on other counts 'it simply cannot be assumed that an earlier
review would have avoided pit closures and, in any case, the government has
declared a moratorium'.

on British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS is supplying gas to four more gas-fired power stations than it
wanted to because it was forced to by Ofgas, the industry regulator, MPs
heard yesterday.
Mr Robert Evans, British Gas chairman, told the Commons trade and industry
committee that Sir James MacKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, had
encouraged the 'dash for gas' by forcing BG to sell gas to generators
according to fixed schedules.
British Gas had demanded the right to negotiate freely on prices so that it
could control the amount of gas it contracted to supply.
British Gas signed its first Combined Cycle Gas Turbine plant contract in
1990, but when further orders were slow to arrive it reduced its prices to
secure a second contract. Early in 1991 it experienced a surge in demand for
generation, so that demand temporarily outstripped the projected
availability of supplies.
Mr Evans told MPs that when British Gas raised prices to try to discourage
generators and restore the supply/demand balance, Ofgas forced it to lower
prices and sell more gas than it wanted to.
Britsh Gas is contracted to supply nine generating projects. But Mr Evans
said it was providing only 30 per cent of the total volume of gas going to
the generating market, with the remainder coming from competing suppliers.
Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, told the
committee a temporary transport subsidy of Pounds 512m over five years would
allow British Coal to sell 20m tonnes of coal into the European Community.
This would save all 30,000 miners' jobs under threat.
In other evidence, the Trades Union Congress called for an energy commission
to oversee an integrated energy strategy, including representatives from
consumer groups and unions.

SIR PATRICK Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday that the UK
government would continue to look to dialogue - not an imposed solution - to
end the province's political problems.
In spite of the failure of the latest set of 'round-table' talks, which
collapsed on Tuesday, Sir Patrick said the government would 'steadily
persevere'. He said the six months taken up by the talks, 'is but a evening
gone,' in Northern Ireland's history.
Sir Patrick said the participants, including nationalists, Unionists and the
Irish government, had shown a 'marked increase in the understanding of the
position taken by others and respect for them'.
Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist party leader, called for more informal
links between the province's political parties to discuss social and
economic issues. Sir Patrick backed any discussions but warned that sight
should not be lost of the 'objective' of addressing the 'totality of
relationships'. Both the British and Irish governments are hopeful that a
fresh set of 'round table' talks could start early next year. Ministers from
the two governments meet on Monday.
Sir Patrick believed that a comprehensive solution could yet be found and
hinted strongly that he would not set out his own proposals for how direct
rule could be ended.
'There is no question of an imposed solution. What the British government is
about is doing all in its power to seek a settlement of this deeply rooted,
historic problem which is arrived at by agreement with all those who are
concerned with it,' he said.
The Rev Ian Paisley, Democratic Unionist leader, said there would be no
progress until Dublin gave up its 'illegal, immoral and criminal claim over
the territory of Northern Ireland'.

BRITISH videophones are to be sold in Japan under an agreement reached
yesterday between GEC-Marconi, the defence electronics manufacturer, and
Mitsui, the Japanese trading company. Only rarely do UK-made consumer
electronics products enter the Japanese market.
GEC-Marconi, which is making videophones for BT in Britain, has been working
to sell its product in other markets in order to establish its technology as
a de facto international standard for analogue videophones. No such standard
yet exists.
Mitsui will also market in Japan GEC-Marconi's video compression technology.
This makes it possible to send moving video pictures down the telephone
line.
The videophones can be plugged into a normal socket and will act like an
ordinary telephone if the person being called does not have a videophone.
GEC-Marconi has won agreements to market its phones in the US, Hong Kong and
possibly Singapore.

ONE IN FIVE homes bought in the past five years is now worth less than the
mortgage on it, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research body,
says in a survey today.
The survey, based on 1m homeowners, estimates that the total value of
negative equity in Britain is Pounds 2.68bn, compared with Pounds 1.2bn in
October last year. Of this, 99 per cent is held by people who have bought
homes since 1987.
The south-east has the highest proportion of negative equity, with greater
London the worst affected. Forty-one per cent of those who bought in the
London area between 1988 and 1991 had negative equity last month, the report
says, with an average deficit of Pounds 5,500 per household.
The rises for the north and north-west are comparatively low, while the rest
of the south-east and the east Midlands have the highest negative equity
outside London.
Mr Daniel Dorling, one of the report's authors, said: 'Almost no one who
bought before 1987 has negative equity.'

<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will tomorrow announce the loss of about 2,000 Naval support
jobs and the closure of Portland Naval training base, unions said last
night.
Mr Jack Dromey, general secretary of the TGWU general union, warned that the
unions would resist any attempt to close the base and would call for an
independent inquiry if the government tried to implement the cuts.
The Ministry of Defence last night confirmed an announcement was expected
today about the Dorset base and the future location of operational sea
training.
According to the unions about 1,400 civilian jobs are at risk at Portland
and between 300 and 500 at the Portsmouth Naval Base, with others under
threat elsewhere.
The threat to Portland comes less than two years after it gained a reprieve
from closure.
The base had been in line for closure under the Options for Change review of
the armed forces but it was saved when it was found that the cost of

law, under draft legislation issued by the government's insolvency service
yesterday.
The proposed insolvency partnership order would allow greater opportunities

It follows lobbying to the service, part of the Department of Trade and

Voluntary arrangements and administration orders were introduced by the 1986
Insolvency Act to provide simpler or cheaper alternatives to formal court

FT  12 NOV 92 / The Matrix Churchill Scandal: Henderson given immunity in US
 -Machine tool company pinpointed as part of Iraqi 'procurement network'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAUL HENDERSON, the businessman at the centre of the uproar over the
government's involvement in the sale of defence-related equipment to Iraq,
was secretly granted immunity from prosecution in the US by the Bush
administration.
Immunity was granted in January 1991, in spite of the fact that the White
House had, 14 months earlier, received a detailed Central Intelligence
Agency report identifying Mr Henderson's machine tools company, Matrix
Churchill, as part of an extensive Iraqi arms procurement network.
The CIA report, a copy of which has been obtained by the Financial Times,
was sent on November 6 1989 to the White House and the State Department.
The report pinpointed Matrix Churchill as part of Iraq's 'complex
procurement networks of holding companies in western Europe to acquire
technology for its chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile
development programmes'.
The CIA report outlined how Iraq had used the Atlanta branch of Italy's
Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) to finance the purchase of arms.
Entitled 'Iraq-Italy: Repercussions of the BNL-Atlanta Scandal', the report
said Matrix Churchill was acquired in 1987 by a Baghdad-based network that
controlled TMG Engineering of London, a company that had among its
affiliates a partner of Space Research Corporation, the Brussels-based
company run by the late Dr Gerald Bull, who worked on Iraq's 'supergun'
project.
Matrix Churchill was identified by the CIA as 'the United Kingdom's leading
producer of computer-controlled machine tools that can be used in the
production of sophisticated armaments'.
The immunity granted to Mr Henderson concerned 'violations, if any, arising
from association with the Iraqi procurement network' run through Matrix
Churchill's US and British operations as well as TMG and other companies.
According to a letter to Mr Henderson's Atlanta-based lawyer, the former
Matrix Churchill chief obtained immunity from prosecution on January 22
1991.
In exchange for his being debriefed by US prosecutors and other
investigators Mr Henderson would also be immune from prosecution in
connection with the scheme by which Matrix Churchill obtained BNL-Atlanta
financing for the network.
Mr Kenneth Millwood, the Atlanta lawyer who represented Mr Henderson, said
yesterday he negotiated the immunity deal with Ms Gale McKenzie, the chief
US prosecutor on the BNL case.
The granting of immunity to Mr Henderson has until now effectively blocked
any Atlanta trial involving Matrix Churchill.
US Customs officials are still investigating Matrix-Churchill in Ohio.
Yesterday in Atlanta, Judge Marvin Shoob - the federal judge who presided
over BNL Atlanta hearings and claimed last month that senior officials of
the Bush administration helped to shape the case - yesterday said he was not
aware until last week of the immunity agreements.
Judge Shoob demanded repeatedly in the BNL hearings to know why why no one
from Matrix-Churchill was prosecuted.
In Washington, the Department of Justice could not be reached for comment
yesterday because it was closed in observance of the federal Veterans Day
holiday.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Officials suspected chemical weapons link with Matrix
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH government officials suspected in 1988 that equipment being exported
by Matrix Churchill, the company at the centre of a growing political uproar
over defence-related sales to Baghdad, was destined for chemicals weapons
factories in Iraq.
Precision machine tools went to Iraq through Industrias Cardoen of Chile,
one of Baghdad's leading arms suppliers in the run up to the invasion of
Kuwait in August 1990.
The suspicion that these were 'apparently destined to be incorporated into a
chemicals weapons factory' was voiced by officials of the Export Credits
Guarantee Department (ECGD) in confidential Whitehall documents submitted
during the unsuccessful prosecution of three former directors of Matrix
Churchill, the Midlands based machine tool company
The ECGD, which underwrites loans for export contracts, was then
government-owned. It has since been partly privatised.
The emergence of a possible contribution by Matrix Churchill to Iraq's
chemical weapons effort is particularly controversial given the uses to
which the regime of Saddam Hussein put such weapons during its campaign
against Kurdish rebels.
The disclosure of the ministers' decision came as opposition parties
unleashed fresh allegations over the government's role in the Iraqi arms
build-up and subsequent attempts at cover-ups. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal
Democrat leader, accused Mr John Major of having 'personal and specific
knowledge' that machine tools had been exported by Matrix Churchill to Iraq
for munitions manufacture.
Labour accused the government of lying over the use of 'public interest
immunity' procedures signed by ministers to try to prevent the release of
sensitive documents which were being sought for use in the trial of the
former Matrix Churchill directors.
The fears that British machine tools were destined for Saddam's chemical
weapons programme emerge in a series of exchanges between the Cardiff
headquarters of the ECGD branch which deals with short-term loans and the
regional office in Birmingham.
According to the documents, the British company initially approached the
ECGD in August 1988 for export credits 'on this arms/chemical manufacturer'.
Export cover for about Pounds 6.5m was approved, according to one internal
ECGD note.
The note goes on to say that the ECGD later learnt that Cardoen was 'a chief
supplier to the Iraqi air force', adding: 'It seems they are involved in
chemicals weapons manufacture.'
In the same note, Mr Robert Lemin, an associate director of Sedgwicks, the
insurance broker to Matrix Churchill, also voiced concerns to the ECGD that
sales to Cardoen 'would be used to manufacture munitions'.
This view was repeated almost two years later in Cardiff in a letter from Mr
Paul St John Miller, director of the ECGD's Birmingham regional office.
He wrote: 'Goods were apparently destined for Iraq to be incorporated into a
chemicals weapons factory.'
Industrias Cardoen was one of the leading suppliers of arms to Baghdad
during the 1980s. It is estimated to have sold nearly Pounds 330m worth of
cluster bombs to Baghdad as well as plans for a turnkey bomb factory that
was built in Iraq.
There is no evidence in the documents that Department of Trade and Industry
approved the sale of this equipment knowing it would be used in Iraq's
chemical weapons programme.
Nor is there any evidence that ministers were informed of the suspicions
concerning these deals.
The documents explain that, one of the reasons that Matrix used Cardoen to
export to Iraq was that the Chilean company provided a means for the Iraqis
to pay their suppliers.
Mr Miller wrote in November 1990: 'Cardoen would be paid by the Iraqis in
local currency and then use that currency with Iraqi government authority,
to purchase crude oil from . . . Iraq. That crude oil to be on-sold
immediately.'
This allowed Iraq to avoid using hard currency while Cardoen would receive
dollars at the end of the deal.
Another document, drawn up in October 1990, describes how a Ministry of
Defence working group drew parallels between the British contribution to
Iraqi arms manufacturing capabilities and the 1989 scandal over a German
project to build a chemicals weapons plant in Libya.
The working group singled out 'our machinery manufacturers' as helping 'Iraq
towards the setting up of a major arms R&amp;D and production industry'.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Rules switch on Iraq arms sales kept secret
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH government ministers agreed in 1989 to withhold from parliament
details of a decision to reinterpret the rules banning the sale of
defence-related equipment to Iraq.
The agreement, revealed in previously-classified Whitehall documents, is
likely to add fuel to the political furore over the illicit defence trade
with Iraq.
The documents were made available to the court during the unsuccessful
prosecution of three former directors of Matrix Churchill, the
Midlands-based machine tool company.
The 500 pages of documents reveal consistent efforts by ministers at the
Department of Trade and Industry to weaken or remove the official
guidelines.
The policy was opposed, with only limited success, by Mr William Waldegrave,
then a Foreign Office minister and now a member of Mr Major's cabinet.
The papers include several specific references to a decision in 1989 to
withhold from MPs details of the relaxation in interpretation of the rules
which had been set out in 1985 by Sir Geoffrey Howe, then foreign secretary.
They show that while the government was committed publicly to an even-handed
approach as regards defence-related exports to Iran and Iraq, in practice
the regime applied to Baghdad was significantly more liberal than that
imposed on Tehran.
The relaxation for exports to Iraq was agreed in December 1988 - some 5
months after a ceasefire agreement had ended the Iran-Iraq war. The shift in
policy was subsequently used by the DTI to justify its backing for the
export of the machine tools at the heart of the failed prosecution of Matrix
Churchill.
In April 1989, ministers decided on a form of words to be used in parliament
which was broad enough to encompass the shift but would not signal to MPs
that their approach had changed.
The phrasing was settled on in a meeting between Mr Waldegrave, Lord
Trefgarne, then defence procurement minister, and Mr Alan Clark, the then
trade minister.
Mr Waldegrave successfully resisted pressure from his colleagues for
abolition of the Howe guidelines. But his private secretary's summary of the
meeting's conclusions, set out in a letter to Mr Clark dated April 27 1989,
recorded: 'We agreed that we should continue to interpret the guidelines
more flexibly in respect of Iraq, as we have done in practice since the end
of last year; but that we should revert to a stricter interpretation for
Iran, along the lines which operated before the ceasefire.'
The document adds: 'It was preferable not to have to announce publicly any
change in them (the guidelines).' The form of words to be used if ministers
were 'pressed' on the issue in parliament was: 'The guidelines on the export
of defence equipment to Iran and Iraq are kept under constant review, and
are applied in the light of prevailing circumstances, including the
ceasefire and developments in the peace negotiations.'
It is understood that the ministers decided that as the guidelines were
being re-interpreted rather than abolished, there was no formal obligation
to tell MPs.
A few days earlier Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the then prime minister, had told
the House of Commons: 'The government have not changed their policy on
defence sales to Iraq.'
Other documents reveal Whitehall's sensitivity over the new formulation
agreed for use in parliament. The minute of a meeting of officials belonging
to the Interdepartmental Committee on defence sales to Iraq and Iran says
because of the different treatment of the two countries it was 'essential'
that departments 'consulted closely' before answering questions from MPs.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Bank chief calls for end to UK boom-bust cycle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, yesterday
committed the Bank to do all it could to achieve price stability and
'demolish the UK's image as a second-rate, inflation-prone economy'.
In the Bank of England lecture at the London School of Economics, Mr
Leigh-Pemberton said Britain must never again experience the boom-bust
cycle. He called for a national consensus in favour of stable prices.
The governor said recent successes in reducing inflation justified easing UK
monetary policy since sterling's departure from the European exchange rate
mechanism eight weeks ago.
But, speaking on the eve of today's announcement by Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, of public spending plans for the next three years and special
measures to revive confidence in the economy, he warned that if the policy
easing began to fuel inflation, 'we would have no hesitation in reversing
it'.
He added: 'No one should believe that easier policy now necessarily means
easier policy for ever.' Mr Leigh-Pemberton said he was not advocating a
target of zero inflation. Instead he backed Mr Lamont's long-term goal of '2
per cent a year or less' in the rate of retail price inflation excluding
mortgage interest payments.
But his speech was a stiff warning to the government not to succumb to
inflationary pressures. He said governments had a moral duty to achieve
price stability.
The governor said the Bank would publish the first of its quarterly reports
on inflation in February, alongside its regular quarterly bulletin. These
reports, foreshadowed by the chancellor some weeks ago, would 'put the
Bank's professional competence on the line', he said.
They would not be restricted to a discussion of the past but would cover
likely future developments in the short-term and medium-term to produce a
'wholly objective and comprehensive analysis of inflationary trends and
pressures'.
Today's Autumn Statement will echo the governor's strong anti-inflation
stance by reaffirming the government's commitment to keeping underlying
inflation in a 1 to 4 per cent band over the life of this parliament.
The chancellor will unveil economies in a number of important spending
departments that have enabled the government to keep its spending plans
within the preset 'planning total' of Pounds 244.5bn for 1993-94.
Mr Lamont's package will also provide for an immediate boost to the economy
through a number of time-limited measures to boost confidence, activity and
investment in industry and housing.
The government is widely expected to approve a further cut of perhaps 1
percentage point in bank base rates from 8 per cent, either today or in the
near future.

FT  12 NOV 92 / New EC-US trade talks spark optimism on Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community and US plan to resume talks early next week on their
oilseeds dispute and the Uruguay Round farm chapter, in conditions both
sides say could yield a deal.
Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner who has resumed his trade
negotiations role after resigning last week amid a bitter Commission row
over the line to pursue, was yesterday confident agreement could be reached.
'We are very, very close to finding a deal and the Commission and the
Council (of EC member states) have given it much more pronounced support,'
Mr MacSharry said last night.
The US is also optimistic that progress can be made from the point
negotiations were left last week after three days of abortive negotiations
in Chicago, according to senior American officials.
Mr MacSharry is returning to the talks after a showdown meeting on Tuesday
night with European Commission president Jacques Delors, whom he had accused
of undermining his efforts. US officials and farm groups welcomed the news
of Mr MacSharry's reinstatement.
After discussions with farm lobbyists, Mr Ed Madigan, the US agriculture
secretary, concluded that Mr MacSharry had obtained the negotiating
authority needed to get a deal done.
There was strong backing inside the Commission yesterday for Mr MacSharry,
as well as relief that the internal confrontation - which some senior
officials feel could have led to Mr Delors' resignation - had ended.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, summed up the mood by saying
that 'when they come back with a deal, that deal will get our support'.
Mr Frans Andriessen, chief European Community negotiator, said he was
confident the EC and the US would strike a broad deal to clear the way for a
worldwide agreement under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr John Major, prime minister, and German chancellor Helmut Kohl issued a
joint public welcome to the resumption of talks, insisting that a rapid
conclusion to the Gatt would help ward off an international recession. At a
news conference concluding the annual Anglo-German summit, in Oxfordshire,
Mr Major said 'calm discussion, not sabre-rattling' was the way to reach an
accord to finalise the Uruguay Round. 'I have no doubt that a Gatt
settlement is within our grasp.'
In a similarly conciliatory mood, Mr Kohl dismissed as 'ridiculous'
suggestions that he had been urged by Mr Major to press France to agree to a
resumption of the EC-US talks.
Mr Arthur Dunkel, director general of Gatt, was due in Brussels for talks
with Mr Andriessen and Mr MacSharry today. He is set to travel to Washington
this weekend to hold discussions with Mr Madigan and Ms Carla Hills, US
trade representative.
France, meanwhile, will be waiting to pounce on evidence that of any deal
being is incompatible with reform of the Common Agriculture Policy.
Since this is a matter of judgment about future farm output and prices,
there is still plenty of scope for confrontation.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Honecker's 'Nuremberg trial': The key question will be who
gave the orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE trial of Mr Erich Honecker, the former East German hardline leader,
begins today in Berlin. He and his close aides are charged with the border
killings of citizens who attempted to flee the German Democratic Republic.
It will mark the first, and probably last, prosecution of an important
deposed Warsaw Pact leader.
Germany has not witnessed a similar trial of political leaders since the
Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal of the Nazi leadership in 1946.
Just as at Nuremberg, the question of who gave the orders to kill will play
a key role in the proceedings.
Sharing the courtroom with Mr Honecker and his fellow defendants will be the
relatives of 13 men killed by bullets, land mines or automatic firing
devices at the Berlin Wall and the inner-German border.
The mother of one of those killed, 20-year-old Mr Chris Guffroy, is among
the co-plaintiffs.
Her son was riddled with bullets at the Berlin Wall in October, 1989, only
eight months before Mr Honecker was deposed and nine months before the Wall
was breached.
The 80-year-old Mr Honecker is terminally-ill with advanced cancer of the
liver and may not survive the trial.
However, defence applications to have the trial cancelled because of his
illness were rejected by the justice authorities.
Also on trial are five senior officials: Mr Willy Stoph, 78, the former
prime minister; Mr Erich Mielke, 84, head of the state security police
(Stasi); Mr Heinz Kessler, 72, former defence minister; Mr Fritz Streletz,
66, former deputy defence minister and Mr Hans Albrecht, 72, Communist party
chief of Suhl district.
The prosecution charges that Mr Honecker, as chairman of the National
Defence Council, and the others as members were responsible for the border
killings.
The council is said to have issued orders to the border troops stipulating
that citizens fleeing to the West were to be stopped using 'all means' at
their disposal.
Mr Honecker and his lawyers have indicated they will argue that it was the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact which approved the building of the Wall in 1961 and
that every Soviet leader since then bore responsibility for the
consequences.
Mr Klaus Feske, head of a solidarity committee for Mr Honecker, said after
visiting the ex-leader in Moabit prison hospital yesterday that he was in a
fighting spirit and would defend his 'socialist ideals' at the trial.
Pressure to hold the trial mounted when several former border guards put on
trial and found guilty last January of fatally wounding would-be escapees.
'The small fish are caught but the big ones get away' was a complaint
commonly heard among ordinary east Germans.
The fact that the court will seek to convict Mr Honecker and his
co-defendants on charges of violating the constitution and laws of the
former German Democratic Republic has no precedent in legal history.
But embarrassing questions are being posed.
Why, it is asked, if Mr Honecker is being tried as a common criminal today,
was he welcomed in 1987 with full honours on his state visit to Bonn?
Many east Germans would have preferred to see Mr Honecker brought to justice
by an east German tribunal instead of what is, for all practical purposes, a
west German one.
Others remark bitterly that west Germans, who failed to bring to justice
Nazi officials and judges after the Second World War, were scarcely
qualified to tell east Germans to come to terms with their own recent
history.
A small but vocal minority, consisting largely of Mr Honecker's hardline
supporters, dismiss the trial as a political sham designed to wipe out the
last vestiges of socialism in Germany.

One ethnic Albanian was killed and two Serbian soldiers were wounded
yesterday outside the Yugoslav army headquarters in Pristina, capital of the
mainly Albanian province of Kosovo, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. An
eyewitness said the shootings occurred after three men approached a guard,
stabbed him and shot another soldier in the stomach. Other soldiers returned
fire, killing a 26-year-old ethnic Albanian. The other two assailants, one
of them wounded, escaped.
A conflicting statement from the Democratic League of Kosovo, the main
Albanian party, said the sentries had provoked the three passers-by. Mr
Saqir Saqiri, a leader of the DLK, said: 'We are used to such daily
provocations, Serbia wants provocations.' The incident comes amid growing
concern that Kosovo could be the next region of former Yugoslavia to erupt
in ethnic war.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Germany to boost aid for shipbuilders

GERMANY'S governing coalition parties yesterday agreed on sharply increased
subsidies for the country's shipbuilders, in spite of drastic efforts to
curb next year's spending and reduce state aids to industry.
The move, which would virtually double the amount spent on directly
subsidising orders, from DM67m (Pounds 27.6m) to DM126.4m next year,
coincided with a new report highlighting the failure of the government to
cut subsidies to industry, agriculture and mining in the past decade.
The report by the DIW economics research institute in Berlin shows the
combined total of state aids and tax allowances to enterprises in west
Germany rose from DM61bn in 1980 to DM88.4bn in 1991, with a slight
reduction expected this year to DM86.4bn.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl came to office with the 'urgent aim' of curbing state
aids, the report says. 'Its implementation ran into considerable resistance.
Hardly any concrete savings were achieved.'
In spite of the dramatic increase in demands for subsidies to eastern
Germany, and the ever more urgent need to reduce subsidies in the west,
'there is still no concept for a systematic dismantling of subsidies,' it
says.
In 1990, the per capita level of subsidies in the coal industry reached
DM52,753, in aerospace DM22,383, on the railways DM35,344, and in
shipbuilding DM16,800, the report shows. Agriculture, which enjoys subsidies
both from the German national budget, and from the European Community, was
next highest with DM14,879 per head.
The DIW suggests that the per capita subsidy in coal mining is now so high
that it would be cheaper to promote alternative jobs in other sectors for
coal miners.
EC commissioners yesterday debated plans to scale back European coal
subsidies and adjust state aid to German mines. A decision could be taken
before the end of the month, but member states are unlikely to be able to
approve the new subsidy system before next year. The existing framework for
aid to coal producers expires at the end of 1993. Germany's DAG white-collar
union yesterday rejected a 3.4 per cent pay offer to 230,000 insurance
workers, and threatened employers with 'spontaneous' warning strikes later
this month, Christopher Parkes writes from Frankfurt.
The first signs of strife in the latest pay round emerged after insurance
companies presented a proposal for a 16-month deal which the union claimed
was worth 2.7 per cent a year at best. The DAG had asked for 7.5 per cent
across-the-board.
IG Metall, the country's biggest union has started negotiations on a similar
demand on behalf of steelworkers.

FT  12 NOV 92 / UK-German initiative on Bosnians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and Germany yesterday announced joint action to ease the plight of
Bosnian refugees trapped after fleeing fighting in the former Yugoslavia.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, said after bilateral talks
near Oxford, England, that his country was ready to take 1,000 of the
roughly 6,000 people marooned in camps on the border with Croatia. Mr
Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, said Britain would take 150 heads
of families from the camps, making, with dependents, a total of around 400.
Mr Hurd said the EC foreign ministers discussed the refugees' predicament at
their meeting on Monday, and expressed 'willingness to do more'.
Mr Kinkel pointed out that Germany was already bearing the main burden of
dealing with refugees trying to escape the fighting by fleeing outside the
borders of former Yugoslavia. But he said Bonn was determined that the camps
should be cleared before winter set in.
In Sarajevo, the planned evacuation of thousands of people from the besieged
Bosnian capital appeared to be ready to resume yesterday after it was halted
by the local military commander on security grounds.
The Bosnian military, citing security concerns, ordered a halt to convoys
leaving Sarajevo on Tuesday after 1,500 Moslems and Croats had left for the
Croatian Adriatic port town of Split and a bus-load of Serbs had headed
north for Belgrade.
Hundreds of other people wanting to go to Belgrade were left milling around
the city centre after the Red Cross, which is organising the exodus, failed
to provide any more buses or drivers. After spending the night in freezing
cold outside the main railway station one bus and six cars left for Belgrade
after midday yesterday, and the Red Cross assured the waiting crowd other
buses were on the way and they would all get out. Red Cross officials said
they had been assured by the UN forces that they would keep open the airport
road, a notoriously dangerous stretch known as 'Sniper Alley', until last
night for the convoy to pass.
As was the case on Tuesday, most of the evacuees were elderly who said they
were as much concerned about surviving the winter as the war.
The Bosnian Red Cross expects to remove 6,000 people altogether, but not
able-bodied men of fighting age, 18 to 60, who have been banned from
leaving. Rival Moslem, Croat and Serb forces refrained from serious military
action ahead of a ceasefire due to come into force at midnight last night,
Bosnian radio reported.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Gillette receives Brussels ultimatum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday gave Gillette, the US shaving products and
toiletries group, six months to shed its financial interests in Wilkinson
Sword, its main competitor, and hand back Wilkinson's former businesses in
several non-EC countries.
The order follows broadly similar actions by competition bodies in Britain
and Germany. Gillette's links with Wilkinson are also being investigated by
authorities in other countries, including France and Australia. Gillette
owns 22 per cent of Eemland, Wilkinson's Dutch-registered parent company, to
which it has also made a sizable loan. The Commission said these
arrangements, along with pre-emption and conversion rights and options in
Eemland, enabled Gillette to influence the latter's commercial policy.
This constituted an abuse of a dominant position by Gillette, which has an
estimated 70 per cent of the world market for wet shaving products.
Wilkinson, which had a turnover last year of DM316m (Pounds 130.5m), makes
most of its sales in Britain and Germany.
The Commission has ordered Gillette to dispose of its equity interest in
Eemland and the loan. The six-month deadline was not announced officially
but was confirmed by industry sources.
Gillette must also hand back to Eemland former Wilkinson operations in the
countries of the European Free Trade Area (Efta), eastern Europe, eastern
Germany and Turkey.
The Commission said agreements between Gillette and Eemland to split the
Wilkinson trademark between the EC, where it is controlled by Eemland, and
other European countries, where Gillette operates both brands, necessitated
co-operation between the two companies.
Gillette yesterday denied influencing Eemland and said it would consider
launching a court appeal against the Commission order, as it has done
against the British and German decisions.
Gillette said it did not expect Brussels' action to affect a decision by
Eemland last month to seek a buyer for Wilkinson. Eemland has denied that
the planned sale was influenced by mounting international anti-trust
pressure on Gillette.
Mr Mike Dowdall, Eemland's chairman, said the Commission order was 'a damp
squib'. He expected to have sold Wilkinson before Gillette was obliged to
sever its links with Eemland.
Gillette's involvement in Eemland began three years ago when the latter was
formed to buy the former Swedish Match consumer products business, including
Wilkinson, from Stora Kopparbergs, Sweden's leading paper and forest
products company.
As well as taking a 22 per cent non-voting stake in Eemland, Gillette lent
the company Dollars 69m (Pounds 45.6m) at a high rate of interest. The value
of the loan is believed to be much greater today, since the interest on it
is being capitalised over its lifetime.
Gillette also purchased all Wilkinson's non-EC operations. However, it was
later compelled by the US Justice Department to sell the US business back to
Eemland.
The Commission said any buyer of Gillette's equity stake in Eemland would be
required to assume responsibility for the loan by the US company. If a buyer
could not be found, Gillette might have to write off the loan.

MR Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, has promised to create a
IPounds 750m fund for road and rail investment if his Fianna Fail party is
returned to power in the election to be held on November 25.
He also said he would reform taxation, meet IPounds 350m in promised public
sector pay awards and maintain current levels of spending on health, social
welfare and education
In launching the party manifesto yesterday, Mr Reynolds stressed the
importance of infrastructure investment to counteract the effects of the
recession. He said priority investment projects include improvements to the
national road and rail network and a light rail transport system for the
capital, Dublin.
Mr Reynolds was emphatic, however, that it would not involve additional
borrowing costs for the government. 'We will be maintaining borrowing at the
present level or below and the overall targets for European Monetary Union
will be met,' he said.
The IPounds 750m capital fund is to be created by borrowing IPounds 370m
from the National Treasury Management Agency, which in turn will borrow
money abroad. The other half is to come from EC Cohesion Funds (the
availability of which will depend on full ratification of Maastricht).
As collateral, the NTMA will be given the government's holdings in two
semi-privatised companies, Irish Life and Greencore, as well as two
government investment banks - ACC Bank and ICC - which are due to be sold
off. These will be placed into a holding company, and sold off 'when market
conditions improve', said Mr Reynolds. According to Mr John Hogan, head of
research at Riada stockbrokers, the government's shares in Greencore and
Irish Life are currently worth IPounds 60m and IPounds 100m respectively,
while the two banks are together worth 'around IPounds 60-70m'.
The European Commission yesterday approved a scheme to help Ireland's small
and medium-sized companies suffering from the recent exchange rate turmoil,
but laid out strict conditions for its application, writes Andrew Hill in
Brussels.
The Commission said it had approved the IPounds 50m scheme only 'in view of
the unique and exceptional circumstances', and because the Irish authorities
had made it clear that it was of 'a strictly temporary nature'.
The Commission said companies operating in the steel and synthetic fibre
sectors would not be eligible for the scheme and there would be special
restrictions for the agriculture and fisheries sector. The scheme runs until
the end of March 1993, and will be reviewed at the end of this year.
Small companies in Ireland have been hit by the appreciation of the Irish
pound against sterling and the lira in the aftermath of the ERM crisis and
the increases in Irish interest rates.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Italy to reopen BNL Iraq loans case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian Senate has decided to reopen an investigation into the case of
the Atlanta branch of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the state-owned commercial
bank, which made almost Dollars 5bn worth of illegal loans to Iraq during
the 1980s.
The Senate's decision follows concern in parliament about the growing body
of evidence indicating that BNL's Atlanta branch could not have acted on its
own in providing the large amounts of credit that helped finance Iraq's war
machine.
On Monday in London, court proceedings collapsed against three executives of
Matrix Churchill, the UK engineering group, for illegally supplying
equipment to Iraq which had military uses after British government documents
showed that several ministries were aware of the true nature of the deal.
The aborted trial also heard evidence that Britain had shared its knowledge
about Matrix-Churchill exports to Iraq with other friendly governments.
Italian parliamentarians familiar with the BNL-Atlanta affair are convinced
such intelligence was passed on at least to 'sectors' of the Italian
government.
Matrix-Churchill's Ohio affiliate in the US is named in recent US court
documents as having had its Iraqi exports funded by BNL-Atlanta letters of
credit.
The terms of reference of the new Senate commission will be the same as
those of its predecessor; that is, to ascertain the extent to which Italian
companies had received finance and guarantees from BNL-Atlanta to fund Iraqi
weapon's purchases and the latter's illicit armaments programme.
The previous commission, wound up in April, reported that it had received
scant cooperation from the Italian and US authorities. It was also sceptical
about the US official view that the Atlanta branch, headed by Mr Christopher
Drogoul, was solely responsible for the loans.

<TEXT>
HUNGARY has agreed to take military equipment and spares worth Dollars 800m
in part settlement of Russia's Dollars 1.7bn debt to the former Warsaw Pact
country.
The Budapest government is also considering buying Russian fighter aircraft
to shore up air defences whose vulnerability has been exposed by frequent
violations of its airspace by the Yugoslav air force.
The decision was announced during the first official visit to Hungary by Mr
Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president.
Russia and Hungary also settled another contentious issue by agreeing to
drop claims against each other dating back to the stationing of Soviet
troops in Hungary.
Mr Yeltsin renounced Russian demands for compensation for its investments in
the military bases vacated by the Soviet army when it left in June 1991. In
return Mr Jozsef Antall, the Hungarian prime minister dropped demands that
Russia should pay for the environmental damage caused by Soviet forces.
Budapest also promised to send medical supplies worth Dollars 10m to the
Russian army and examine ways of helping Russia to house troops previously
stationed in Hungary.
Both sides have moved quickly to settle their financial disputes, which are
a legacy of their communist past, in order to put future commercial
relations on a fresh footing.
They are keen to stimulate bilateral trade, which grew by 28.8 per cent to
Dollars 2.28bn in the first three quarters of this year after falling by
more than 50 per cent in 1991.
Mr Yeltsin, who visited Budapest on his way back to Moscow from his visit to
London, drew another line under the past by condemning the Soviet
suppression of Hungary's 1956 uprising.
The Russian president underlined the apology by visiting the grave of Mr
Imre Nagy, the executed leader of the short-lived revolutionary government.
He also handed over classified KGB documents about the events of 1956.
Mr Yeltsin said he hoped that Russia and Hungary could put their 'mutual
bitter past' behind them and begin relations on a 'fresh sheet'.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Georgians look to Shevardnadzeto save them: The former
Soviet foreign minister now has the authority to rescue his nation from
chaos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the volatile republic of Georgia, where almost every man carries a gun,
Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the newly confirmed leader, is about as democratic
in the western sense as one can find. Simply put, everyone has a say, but in
the end Mr Shevardnadze's decisions prevail.
The former Soviet foreign minister is consolidating power in his native
land. After winning a popular mandate in October, he was declared head of
state by parliament last week and given presential-style powers. He retains
his formal title of chairman of the parliament. He has since hand-picked a
speaker and a prime minister.
For the last eight months, Mr Shevardnadze had chaired a four-man ruling
presidium created in the wake of the civil unrest which wrested power from
Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's first democratically-elected president. Mr
Shevardnadze had operated largely under the steam of his international
prestige. Georgians listened to him, but he possessed little actual
authority.
The legitimisation of his power comes at a crucial time. Georgia's internal
troubles are spreading beyond its borders. It is caught up in numerous small
wars that have broken out throughout the Caucasus region, including southern
Russia.
Now that he is in charge, Mr Shevardnadze will have to answer for problems
that have gone unaddressed. First, the republic's economy is collapsing: 700
out of 1,200 factories employing more than 100 workers have closed. Hopes
for economic recovery have been dashed by the growing civil unrest which has
pitted the republic's ethnic minorities against its government.
The war with separatists in the breakaway Black Sea region of Abkhazia has
stopped the flow of industrial supplies and food along the main rail line
from Ukraine and Russia. The key natural gas line from Russia, which runs
through the warring republics of North and South Ossetia, at the northern
edges of Georgia, has been blown up repeatedly.
Because of this, the government expects state revenues to reach only half
the Rbs26bn budget this year. Many state employees have not been paid for
months because the government cannot afford to buy enough rouble notes from
the sole printing plant in Russia. The government has no money to buy
natural gas or petrol for the winter, and Georgia's Orby airline operates
only when it can find fuel.
For ordinary Georgians, the crisis is acute. While Tbilisi residents stand
in late-night bread lines, 125,000 tonnes of US and European wheat are held
up in Georgia's main sea ports because of inadequate unloading equipment.
The situation will only improve when Georgia's military conflicts are
resolved. Its attempts to crush Abkhazian separatists damaged the republic's
relations with Russia after the Georgian government accused Russian troops
stationed there of supporting the separatists.
The deterioration in Abhkazia has marred Mr Shevardnadze's image as
peace-maker. But the former Communist Party chief of Georgia has also had to
deal with the strong-willed nationalism of Mr Tengiz Kitovani, the defence
minister. The two men have often been at odds over how much force to use to
quell the separatist aspirations of the republic's minorities.
Mr Shevardnadze, with his newly-acquired status, should be able to stem the
influence of his overly nationalist colleagues.
He will also have to control the armed civilian groups that roam the
capital, Tbilisi, and the countryside. Most of these groups grew out of the
movement that removed Mr Gamsakhurdia. In the western city of Zugdidi,
robbery is so common that even police race through treacherous sections of
highway to avoid bandits.
The fighting and criminality have kept away the foreign investment that
Georgian economists say the republic needs to survive. 'Western businessmen
were waiting for the election. Now they're waiting for peace,' said Mr Gia
Tsagareli, deputy chairman of the state committee on foreign relations.
Discussions with the International Monetary Fund have produced no results
yet as the government is unable to define a sound economic programme.
Georgians do not underestimate their problems. If anything, they engage in
endless self-criticism and in-fighting. Most seem to agree, though, that Mr
Shevardnadze is the only way out of their seemingly intractable morass.

FT  12 NOV 92 / West accused of failure to support Yeltsin's reforms: FT
Conference (Doing business in Russia)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR western adviser to the Russian government yesterday accused the
west of hypocrisy and indecision in failing to provide funds to stabilise
the economy or a policy of support President Boris Yeltsin's market reforms.
Addressing an FT conference in Moscow, Prof Anders Aslund, director of the
Stockholm Institute of East European Economics, warned the west that its
refusal to back Russian economic reforms could lead to chaos similar to that
which brought Hitler to power in Weimar Germany.
'The west is purportedly supporting President Yeltsin, democracy and a
market economy in Russia, but it stopped supporting this country after it
had ceased to be a communist, totalitarian, aggressive centrally planned
economy,' he said.
Having provided financing of just Dollars 8bn this year, the west revealed a
'prejudice that Russia can only be ruled by a Stalin in the Kremlin', Prof
Aslund told an audience of western and Russian businessmen at the
conference, entitled 'Doing Business in Russia'.
To fend off the danger of hyperinflation which could 'happen any day', he
also called for an immediate tightening of monetary policy and accused Mr
Viktor Gerashchenko, central bank chairman, of failing even to try to
stabilise the rouble.
He also called for fresh elections and a new constitution to provide the
legitimacy for painful reforms. He said the main danger to Russia was not
the extreme nationalists and Communists but the main opposition Civic Union
which wants reforms slowed.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister, admitted that the government had
been guilty of 'too many unacceptable compromises' with advocates of a
looser monetary and credit policy. He said the priority was to fight
inflation.
Partly to make reforms irreversible, he would hold the first auctions in his
mass privatisation programme before the Russian Congress of People's
Deputies tries to unseat the government on December 1. He also urged foreign
investors to buy up privatisation vouchers being distributed to the
population in order to take part in the sale of medium and large-scale
enterprises.
Mr Gerashchenko, who also spoke at the conference, rejected attacks on his
policy of supporting Russian enterprises with central bank credits: the
country had no alternative source of financing. He announced that central
bank credit to enterprises and the government was likely to be about
Rbs4,000bn this year.
He agreed there was a need to tighten monetary and credit policy but said
this should be combined with a selective industrial policy to stimulate
production of food and consumer goods.
Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, prominent economist and former Soviet deputy prime
minister, suggested it was unfair to lay the blame for the failure of the
government's financial stabilisation policy entirely at the central bank's
door. Calling for a banking union which he had tried and failed to build
before the Soviet Union's collapse, he said financial stabilisation had been
doomed from the start in the absence of co-ordinated economic policies among
Soviet republics which continued to use the rouble.
Demonstrating the increasing assertiveness of Russia's regions, Mr Yuri
Shafranik, governor of the oil and gas producing region of Tyumen, urged
foreigners to do business directly at local level rather than look to
Moscow. 'You are more used to the centralised system than we are. This was
very convenient for you. Now this system no longer exists.'
Russia's parliament yesterday drew up measures curtailing the president's
powers to appoint a cabinet, making both ministerial posts and the cabinet
structure subject to parliamentary approval, writes John Lloyd in Moscow.
Many of the measures require constitutional changes, which can only be done
by the full Congress of People's Deputies.

A clash between Moscow and the breakaway southern Russian republic of
Chechnya was averted yesterday when Russian troops withdrew from a disputed
area on Chechnya's borders, writes Our Foreign Staff.
The troops, sent into neighbouring Ingushetia to quell a fierce outbreak of
ethnic violence, had occupied three regions claimed by the Chechen republic,
which declared independence from Russia last year.
They were withdrawn following all-night negotiations between the two sides
and Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting Russian prime minister.
More than 200 people have died in fighting between Ingush and Ossetians from
the neighbouring Russian republic of North Ossetia over the past week,
according to Russian television.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Tokyo ready to boost economy further

THE Japanese authorities stand ready to provide a further boost to the
flagging economy, Mr Akira Nambara, the executive director of the Bank of
Japan, said yesterday.
Mr Nambara said the bank and the Ministry of Finance would use fiscal
policy, lower taxes or higher public spending to stimulate the economy if it
did not show signs of recovering.
His comments are the furthest a senior Japanese official has gone towards
acknowledging that the Y10,700bn (Pounds 54bn) emergency spending package
announced in August may not be enough on its own to prevent the economy
slipping into recession.
Mr Nambara told the annual meeting of the Institute of Foreign Bankers in
Japan that, although a further stimulus was not yet justified, the
authorities would act when they judged the time was ripe.
The supplementary budget needed to implement a large part of the Y10,700bn
package is stalled in the Japanese parliament which is consumed by power
struggle sparked by the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal. Some analysts believe
another supplementary budget may be needed because tax revenues for 1992 may
be even lower than originally forecast. A heated debate is under way over
whether the budget for next year should include an income tax cut.
Mr Nambara said the pressures on the Japanese banking system were bad and
getting worse with non-performing loans still growing. The top 21 banks'
non-performing loans rose from Y8,000bn at the end of March to Y12,000bn at
the end of September. The Japanese banks' profits would be reduced for
several years as they devoted their earnings to writing off bad debts, he
said.
He predicted that no big Japanese bank would face a severe crisis as a
result of mounting bad loans but cautioned that the outlook was less
reassuring for smaller institutions.
He said it was likely that the authorities would have to orchestrate rescue
operations among the smaller banks, some of which may have to merge with
larger institutions.
Land prices continued to fall in the three months to October, according to a
report published yesterday by the National Land Agency.
The report based on a survey of 804 sites around Japan found that
residential land prices around Osaka were 30 per cent below the same period
last year, while in Tokyo and its environs prices at more than 60 per cent
of sites fell by 3 per cent or more.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Hizbollah strikes raise stakes for Israel-Syria talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE most significant exchanges this week in the Middle East peace talks have
taken place not in the cerebral chambers of the US State Department, where
Arab and Israeli delegations are meeting, but in the dangerous hills of
south Lebanon.
Guerrillas of the Hizbollah Islamic fundamentalist militia have once again
kicked the shins of the mighty Israeli military by firing volleys of
Katyusha rockets across the border into Israeli territory. Israel,
frustrated that its frequent punitive air raids and occupation of a
'security zone' inside Lebanon have failed to prevent such attacks, has
moved tanks and extra troops into the area and protested furiously in
Washington.
In its latest retaliatory move, Israeli aircraft last night attacked a
Hizbollah target in a village south-east of Tyre in south Lebanon.
As an implacable foe of the peace talks, the Iranian-backed Hizbollah must
be delighted that its raids have had the desired effect of souring the
negotiations between Israel and Lebanon. But, in Israeli eyes, the events on
the border have much more to do with the Israeli-Syrian talks than those
with Lebanon.
Syria is the predominant power in Lebanon. Some 40,000 Syrian troops are
deployed in the country. Although not in areas directly abutting the
Israel-occupied zone, they control large areas where Hizbollah is active.
Israel believes that Syria is deliberately allowing Hizbollah to attack it
to increase pressure on the Israeli government to give back the Golan
Heights, the occupied Syrian territory that is Damascus's chief concern in
the peace talks.
'The Syrians are exploiting Hizbollah to deliver the following message to
Israel: Only we can liquidate Hizbollah - on condition that you pay a price.
And the price is the Golan,' said Prof Moshe Maoz of Hebrew University on
Israel Radio yesterday.
Israel's problem is that it does not know how to respond. It can hardly pull
out of the peace talks. As Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, remarked,
Israel will not let Hizbollah bring the process to a halt. The government
has said it is ready for a partial withdrawal from the Golan, but not the
Syrian demand for full withdrawal. Nor could it make such a dramatic
concession under duress.
Militarily, there is also a dilemma. The Hizbollah rocket attacks into
Israel, both in recent weeks and during the summer, ended a seven-year
period during which such cross-border strikes (as distinct from regular
clashes within the security zone) had virtually halted. But yet another
round of air raids, or even a large-scale ground attack north of the
security zone, is unlikely to have much effect against Hizbollah's small and
mobile groups of fighters.
Much of this week's carefully orchestrated publicity about Israeli
reinforcements - the normally assiduous military censor was strangely silent
 -appears to have been intended mainly as a warning to Hizbollah and Syria
to back off.
But Damascus and the militants will continue to hold a potent card against
Israel as long as Israeli forces remain in Lebanon. In a new blow to Middle
East peace, Israel on yesterday walked out of an international conference on
Palestinian refugees because it refused to sit in the same room as the head
of the Palestinian delegation, Reuter reports from Ottawa.
AP adds: Israeli troops shot and killed four Palestinians and wounded 21 in
clashes in the occupied lands yesterday, the army and Israeli radio said. It
was the highest one-day casualty toll since April. One soldier was seriously
wounded in a Palestinian ambush.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Hong Kong's legislature backs Patten reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA WAS last night dealt a significant rebuff when Hong Kong's local
legislature gave Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, solid backing for
his proposals to increase democratic representation in Hong Kong.
The endorsement from the colony's political leaders - which is bound to
anger China - follows opposition to the governor's plans from the colony's
influential business community earlier this week.
Before leaving for Canada and the UK yesterday, Mr Patten reaffirmed his
willingness to discuss with China alternative proposals to those he unveiled
a month ago.
To date, Beijing has refused to discuss alternatives and instead has
reasserted its determination to revoke any changes which are introduced
without prior agreement.
But, by a margin of 32 to 21, the members of the Legislative Council (Legco)
voted to give the governor 'general support' for his blueprint for electoral
reform. The strength of Legco support for Mr Patten - though never in doubt
 -was much greater than expected.
The council's highly charged debate lasted six hours.
Ms Christine Loh, a recently appointed member, gained much support for her
opposition to Britain agreeing a deal with China simply to achieve
'convergence' with Beijing's plans for Hong Kong after the colony reverts to
Chinese sovereignty in mid-1997. She said that convergence was a false
doctrine and 'is a device introduced by China to serve China's ends'.
She was opposed by Mrs Selina Chow, a senior member of the Co-operative
Resources Centre, Legco's main conservative grouping, who again called for a
referendum if Britain and China fail to agree terms. She said it was not in
Hong Kong's interest to adopt a package of reforms which had no hope of
surviving the change of sovereignty.
Legco members from both camps expressed their dismay at the way in which
Britain and China had, in the past, gone behind the people's back to strike
secret deals.
Last night's vote, however, is just the beginning of a process. Mr Michael
Sze, secretary for constitutional affairs, said that legislation would have
to be presented to LegCo early in the New Year and voted on in the spring.
Although Beijing has given no indication that it is prepared to discuss the
governor's ideas, some in Hong Kong hope that a breakthrough can be achieved
when Zhu Rongji, a senior Chinese politician, visits Britain next week.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Burmese junta sports reformist robes: Victor Mallet examines
the military's commitment to political and economic change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURMA'S ruling military junta has wrong-footed some of its fiercest critics
with a steady stream of announcements on political and economic reform over
the past six months. .
The State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc) has released hundreds of
political prisoners, lifted a night curfew, re-opened universities, eased
restrictions on foreign tourists and journalists, and reached a tentative
agreement with Dhaka on the return of thousands of persecuted Burmese
Moslems who sought refuge in Bangladesh.
The generals have also promised to hold a convention on a new constitution
in January, sought to accelerate a four-year-old economic liberalisation
programme and announced the partial privatisation of state factories.
The changes have sparked agonised debate among diplomats in Rangoon who were
once united in outrage at Burmese human rights abuses. There is division
between those who favour renewing foreign aid to Burma - suspended after
army suppression of the pro-democracy uprising in 1988 - and advocates of
continued isolation.
The isolationists contend that international pressure, and Burma's shortage
of cash, is partly responsible for the Slorc's reforms; They say pressure
should be maintained to secure the release of Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the
detained opposition leader.
The advocates of renewed foreign aid argue that another uprising would lead
to another military crackdown. They argue it is better to foster economic
growth and encourage the creation of a middle class which could gradually
use the political institutions established by the Slorc  - and eventually
challenge the power of the military establishment.
The Burmese people themselves appear resigned, and they say the Slorc is
able to loosen its grip because it has stamped out opposition in central
Burma.
No-one believes that the Slorc, which ignored the results of a 1990 election
in which the opposition National League for Democracy won more than 80 per
cent of the seats, has any intention of yielding power.
Most Burmese wishing to share their political views live in terror of
informers. Opposition politicians who have not fled have been jailed or
frightened into silence. Participants at the convention will be vetted by
the Slorc, which is thought to have its own draft constitution ready for
rubber stamping. 'Without the participation of Aung San Suu Kyi, the
national convention will be regarded as a hoax by the majority of the
Burmese people,' says one Burmese doctor in Rangoon.
Senior officials acknowledge their distrust of democracy and all but admit
that the whole process is window-dressing.
'We are moving towards true democracy, democracy in which there will be
party pluralism,' declared Col Ye Htut, a de facto government spokesman, at
a recent meeting with foreign journalists. But a moment later he added: 'The
solution to problems in this country is not democracy. It is national unity.
However, since the general public desire a multi-party democratic system,
then this must be done by us.'
As if it to underline its determination not to relinquish political control,
the Slorc in October issued six 'objectives' for the national convention.
One of these stated that the army would have 'the leading role' in future
national politics.
The Slorc's economic reforms, however, have started to take root. For the
past four years, the government has nurtured the private sector and accepted
the failure of state-controlled enterprises under the previous military
government's 'Burmese Way to Socialism'.
Mandalay, straddling the main trade route from China, is booming. In the
capital Rangoon, newly-opened private restaurants are thriving, and the
first private bank has opened its doors.
Local businessmen are already drawing parallels between Burma and China,
where the unchanging nature of the political system has not stopped economic
reform or rapid growth. 'More or less they are following the Chinese model,'
says one Burmese banker. 'The ruling party is still in control but in the
economic sphere they are adopting gradual reforms.'
Foreign investors are vying to take over and refurbish the country's
state-owned hotels, the new Pepsi-Cola joint venture is planning to increase
production. Thai and Australian entrepreneurs are setting up businesses.
South Korean, Singaporean and Hong Kong companies have already established
factories to make textiles and electrical goods.
However, formidable obstacles still block the path to Burma's international
rehabilitation. The generals, for all their rhetoric, are wary of the free
market and point fearfully at the destabilising effects of economic reforms
in the former communist states of eastern Europe.
Potential investors in Burma are still deterred by corruption, bureaucracy,
the poor state of transport and communications and the Slorc's reluctance to
devalue the kyat, the local currency which trades on the black market at a
twentieth of its official value.
In addition, the Slorc does not know what to do about Ms Aung San Suu Kyi,
who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. She has refused to leave the country
and remains under house arrest. The soldiers standing guard in full public
view outside her home on Rangoon's University Avenue are a continuous
reminder that, although there has been some change, there is scope for much
more.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNIDENTIFIED youths yesterday stoned and fired shots at Mr John Keen, one of
Kenya's leading opposition politicians, as he toured the constituency he
intended to fight in next month's multi-party elections.
The attack on Mr Keen, secretary-general of the Democratic Party and one of
the key agitators for political pluralism in Kenya, marks a dramatic
increase in pre-electoral violence across the country and is bound to
exacerbate tension further.
A police spokesman said yesterday five people had been shot dead and six
injured on Tuesday at a demonstration in Meru District, eastern Kenya,
against a member of the ruling Kanu party.
The assault on Mr Keen, who received minor injuries, occurred 24 hours after
Mr Keen had declared that he wanted to contest the Kaijiado North
constituency, held by Prof George Saitoti, vice-president and minister of
finance. At a press conference on Tuesday Mr Keen said he was deeply
critical of both Prof Saitoti He and President Daniel arap Moi.
Since President Moi announced the December 7 date for the elections last
week, Kenya has suffered increasing violence and chaos. In addition,
allegations of ballot-rigging and manipulation have been levelled within all
political parties during the nomination of parliamentary candidates - which
has seen some former Kanu members defeated.
The opposition has also said that the government is preparing to steal the
elections by manipulation of the National Electoral Commission. On Tuesday,
Ambassador Smith Hempstone, US envoy to Kenya, said the government was not
playing fair and urged it to stop restricting opposition political activity.
'Many donors will not accept the legitimacy of an election which is seen to
be flawed,' he said.

<TEXT>
TAIWAN'S finance ministry announced a long-awaited package of 18 measures to
rescue the country's slumping stock market late on Tuesday, in an attempt to
lure money back to the market and to encourage investment by foreigners,
Reuter reports from Taipei.
The ministry said that it would ask the government's postal savings system
and labour pension funds to buy shares. That would provide up to TDollars
20bn (Dollars 513m) of new money for stock investment, newspapers said.
Restrictions on remittances of funds by foreign investors will be eased, the
ministry said. Foreign fund managers have long complained that curbs on
remittances of capital and profits to their home countries deter investment.
The ministry said it would relax rules to let securities firms provide more
margin loans to investors. Government shares in privatisation exercises
would be auctioned rather than offered at a fixed price. Mr Lai In-jaw,
depity finance minister, said: 'We believe the measures will have a positive
effect on liquidity in the market.'
Disillusioned investors, their confidence shattered by a serious share
scandal and a series of stock payment defaults totalling TDollars 9bn
(Pounds 230m) in September, were in no mood to buy strongly yesterday.
The weighted index closed only 36.36 points or 1 per cent higher at
3,570.89, compared to a 20-month low of 3,351.63which was attained on
September 26.

FT  12 NOV 92 / World Trade News: US plans to push ahead export drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WASHINGTON will over the next five years aim to boost exports from 10 per
cent to 15 per cent of GNP, a leap of Dollars 250bn (Pounds 165bn) at
current prices, according to Mr John Macomber, retiring chairman of the US
Export-Import Bank.
After three years as chairman, during which Eximbank has more than doubled
the exports it backs, from Dollars 8bn in 1989 to Dollars 17bn this year, he
says the bank's role has been transformed 'in terms of scope, size,
programmes and influence on US trade policy.'
He has seen export credit cover for projects in India rise from Dollars 100m
in 1990 to Dollars 1.1bn today, with Dollars 2.5bn working through the
system. Cover for projects in Mexico has risen from Dollars 2bn to Dollars
7bn in three years.
He concedes a cheap dollar has helped boost recent export gains, but does
not feel a stronger dollar will slow headway: 'The dollar is too cheap; even
if it were to strengthen as much as 20 per cent, I still don't think it will
effect our competitive position. Amer-icans really are for the first time in
a very good trading position.'
Mr Macomber is shy about his Eximbank achievements. But he may take much of
the credit for tightening disciplines in the bank that have forced greater
budgetary transparency. He has begun to coax back US private bankers after a
decade in which the Latin American debt debacle made them allergic to trade
finance. Even today, he says overseas banks account for 40 per cent of
Eximbank's business.
He appears unruffled to leave the bank amid controversy over its admission
of export credit subsidies: 'Export credit agencies will lose their
credibility unless they are really up-front about their costs. We wouldn't
have export credit agencies in a perfect world, But there are always areas
where commercial finance is not available, but should be.'

FT  12 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Delors in Maastricht-Gatt trade-off -
David Gardner reviews an extraordinary week of manoeuvres in Brussels and
abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major, the UK prime minister, is not the only European leader
performing U-turns. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission,
has just done a volte-face on the Uruguay Round in what one of his main
opponents was gracious enough to describe as a 'statesmanlike' way.
Three weeks ago Mr Delors reckoned there was no chance of concluding the
world trade reform talks this year, echoing the government of his native
France which overtly opposed a settlement.
One week ago he was accused by Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture
commissioner, of deliberately undermining a real chance of settling the
EC-US food export battles on which the Uruguay Round hangs, and to which the
alternative is transatlantic trade war.
Yet on Tuesday in the Hague, Mr Delors said an understanding with the US on
the Uruguay Round must be reached by the summit of EC leaders in Edinburgh
on December 11-12. And yesterday in Brussels, the Commission formally
announced Mr MacSharry would be resuming talks with the US next week, a role
he angrily relinquished to Mr Delors last Wednesday. So what has happened in
the interim?
In summary:
France is having its bluff called on how far it will go in opposing a Gatt
deal;
Germany, strongly backed by the UK, at last is coming out in favour of a
deal; and
Mr Delors appears to have concluded that there was no better deal available
than the one Mr MacSharry was close to in Chicago last Tuesday night and
that intra-Community blood-letting over trade risked spilling into the row
over ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
When EC foreign ministers met in Brussels on Monday, France was not
isolated, but it was politically bereaved. Even before the meeting,
ministers were openly nervous about where Germany would line up on Gatt.
The Bonn-Paris alliance is the EC motor, and France had pulled out every
stop to get Germany to back delay on Gatt, arguing that the government would
fall and rioting by French farmers would ensue if the agriculture subsidy
cuts in the Uruguay Round were agreed. France obtained the support of Spain,
Belgium, Portugal and Greece, and had resorted to desperate tactics.
According to a senior Spanish official, Paris reminded Madrid that France
had been co-operating in rounding up Basque terrorists on its side of the
border, and that the future of French farming was an equivalent matter of
national security.
Yet some French officials admit Paris would not in the end carry out its
threat to 'veto' a Uruguay Round deal, citing 'overwhelming national
interest' to block agreement.
Moreover, there appears to have been a shift in the hitherto unshakeable
Bonn-Paris axis. Although opinion inside the German coalition government has
hardened on the need for a Uruguay Round conclusion, the assumption until
now was that Germany would never risk its all-important relationship with
France by pushing it into a Gatt corner.
German and French officials now concur that a more updated bet is that it is
Paris which is unwilling to risk a breach with Bonn - at a time when the
overriding priority of both Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois
Mitterrand is to salvage the European Union treaty agreed at Maastricht.
Mr Delors shares the Maastricht priority, the vital next stage in his
enormously successful drive for European integration. Yet he can rarely have
been more under siege in his eight years as president; in the Gatt row he
risked opening a second front while his main (Maastricht) defences were
crumbling.
Mr MacSharry put Mr Delors on the spot, partly, it seems, to flush out the
Anglo-German alliance which defeated the French on Monday, and partly to
erase all doubt about his mandate to negotiate - which Mr Delors accused him
of overstepping in the terms being discussed with the Americans.
The two men met, along with external affairs commissioner Frans Andriessen,
on Tuesday night. It was a close-run thing. Mr MacSharry had prepared a
dossier on his allegations that Mr Delors had undermined him. 'If Delors so
much as lights a match, I'll have the gunpowder,' he told one official.
The combative Irish commissioner also extracted a letter from Mr Delors
which at least acknowledged Mr MacSharry's own letter of last Wednesday
resigning because of 'betrayal of trust.'
Mr MacSharry now has a free hand to reach a deal. Success depends on whether
any package he brings back can be demonstrated to be compatible with the
reform of the Common Agricultural Policy agreed in May - including by
France.
It clearly also hinges on the outgoing US administration, which has twice in
the last month backed away from almost done deals under pressure from its
powerful farm lobbies. As of yesterday, however, senior US officials were
saying they thought they could reach an understanding with Mr MacSharry as
soon as next week.

CANADA has joined Mexico in opposing any effort by President-elect Clinton
or the US Congress to alter the environmental and labour provisions of the
North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). A Canadian official indicated
Ottawa would prefer the incoming Democratic administration in Washington to
resolve its objections to Nafta in the framework of supplementary and
parallel agreements, including existing bilateral 'memoranda of
understanding' rather than by re-opening the Nafta deal.
Mr Clinton has expressed general support for the deal agreed by US, Canadian
and Mexican negotiators last August, but with the condition it includes
tighter rules on environment, workers' rights and health and safety
standards. President Bush gave the required 90 days' notice in early
September that he plans to sign the Nafta deal and submit it for
Congressional approval. The Democrat-controlled Congress is expected to
press the Clinton administration to obtain pledges from Mexico and Canada
that his concerns will be met.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Brazil remains mystified by its 'ordinary' man: Christina
Lamb looks at the problems facing Itamar Franco's presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE weeks into its new government, Brazil is still mystified by President
Itamar Franco. Faxes continue to fly between investors trying to decipher
the direction of the administration and to pick their way through the
contradictory statements from ministers which have left the stock market
reeling.
Unlike his dynamic predecessor, Mr Franco is untroubled by any great
mission, and does not feel the need to give nationwide addresses. Alarming
security staff by entering the presidential palace through the public door,
he says he wants to be thought of as 'an ordinary man' and publicly rebukes
ministers when they do 'sneaky' things like putting up fuel prices at night.
Mr Franco's nonchalant attitude contrasts with the dire straits of Latin
America's largest economy. The country is in its third year of recession,
annualised inflation is around 1,500 per cent, an accord with the
International Monetary Fund has collapsed, and falling tax receipts have
left a Dollars 20bn hole in the budget. There are also increasing signs of
social unrest such as armed raids on the beaches of Rio.
Despite the gravity of the problems, it is enough for many Brazilians -
still shocked after the traumatic process of Mr Fernando Collor's
impeachment and volatile presidency - that Mr Franco is offering no
surprises. And while the rhetoric and background of some of his ministers
may be nationalistic, in practice Mr Collor's strict monetary policy and
modernisation programme has not been tampered with.
Moreover, Mr Franco has managed to cobble together the most remarkable
coalition in recent Brazilian history. His cabinet contains members of all
leading political parties from left to right and his impressive
Congressional majority of 441 out of 503 is led by the former head of the
Communist party.
Last Friday, the government announced a Dollars 16bn fiscal reform package,
based largely on a tax on cheques. Mr Paulo Haddad, the Planning Minister
and the President's right-hand man, says: 'In five weeks we've done
something Collor didn't dare in two years.' The reform is, he says, part of
a plan to scrap all indirect taxes by 1994, and should allow reduced
interest rates by next April.
However, the package involves constitutional amendments needing
Congressional approval and few believe it can pass this year as it must in
order to come into effect next.
Aware of the urgency, Congress does not have a good record on approving
legislation - a crucial port reform project has lingered almost a year  -
and Mr Franco's theoretical majority is yet to be tested. Mr Benito Gama who
heads the fiscal reform commission in Congress, says: 'I think it will be
very difficult'.
Moreover, businessmen warn that increasing tax revenues is not easy when 46
per cent of the top 300 public listed companies are in the red and retail
sales are 12 per cent down.
But Mr Franco also wants them to increase salaries from the current Dollars
60 a month minimum to which most Brazilian wages are pegged. According to Mr
Haddad, the President's main preoccupation is the country's 50m living in
absolute poverty and his slogan is 'tudo pelo social' - anything to improve
welfare.
To this end Mr Franco has refused to sanction a 23 per cent increase in
medicine prices, even though pharmaceutical companies point out that
inflation is 26 per cent a month and that it is impossible to produce drugs
cheap enough for families living on Dollars 60 a month.
He has also seized on public sector tariffs as way of supressing inflation.
Telephone charges are to be frozen until next March and Mr Franco wants a
similar deal with fuel prices although Petrobras, the state oil monopoly, is
warning that it is already losing Dollars 10m a day.
Such populist moves are unlikely to go down well with the IMF when Mr Haddad
presents his case next month for a new agreement. They are also provoking
fears that the next step might be a price freeze.
The other major uncertainty is the fate of the privatisation programme. Mr
Franco is a past critic of privatisation and many ministers adhere to the
nationalist line. Although Mr Haddad says that by next March he wants to
start tackling the energy and infrastructure sectors, it seems likely that
future sales beyond those already scheduled by Mr Collor will be left to
Congress.
Next Wednesday Mr Franco will address Congress to outline his policies.
There seems little reason for optimism on the economic front but Mr Franco
should have a breathing space over the next few months. The media focus is
still on the impeachment trial of Mr Collor and the politicians are busy
planning for next April's referendum on the political system. Businessmen
are holding their fire, at least until they know more.

ARGENTINA'S debt reduction plan will be ready for signing in the first week
of December, according to Mr Domingo Cavallo, Economy Minister. The
programme was restructured after banks opted for only one of the two debt
reduction instruments, delaying the signing by three months.
Argentina originally offered to convert Dollars 23bn in commercial bank debt
into two types of bond, underpinned by US Treasury zero coupon bonds. One of
the bonds reduces debt principal by 35 per cent, but pays floating interest
rates. The other bond pays lower, fixed interest rates while preserving the
full value of the original debt.
The steep fall in US interest rates has made the fixed interest par bonds
more attractive than floating rate discount bonds. Banks opted
overwhelmingly for fixed interest bonds, forcing international lending
agencies to demand a rebalancing.
The banks have now agreed to convert 65 per cent of their loans into par
bonds and raise to 35 per cent the share of discount bonds.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Big shake-up urged on Clinton: Commission wants three White
House policy-making agencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT-ELECT Bill Clinton should create new White House agencies to
oversee economic and domestic policy as part of the biggest shake-up of US
government since the Truman administration, a bipartisan commission of
former officials said yesterday.
It urged Mr Clinton to place responsibility for policy formulation and
co-ordination in three councils of equal standing: the existing National
Security Council; an Economic Council, which would handle domestic and
international economic issues; and a Domestic Council, which would handle
all other domestic issues.
Each council would be modelled on the National Security Council and would be
comprised of the relevant cabinet officials.
Reflecting this new tripartite policy-making structure, the president should
appoint three co-equal assistants to the President - for national security,
economic affairs and domestic affairs. Each would be supported by a lean
staff within the White House.
The changes were recommended in a memorandum delivered to Mr Clinton on
November 4 by the Commission on Government Renewal, a committee of 30 senior
officials drawn from the past eight US administrations and sponsored by the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Institute for
International Economics, two Washington think-tanks.
The commission said an overhaul of White House policy-making machinery was
overdue following the end of the Cold War and the increased priority now
attached to economic and social policy.
The creation of the new White House agencies was the only way to ensure that
economic and social policy in future received as much presidential attention
as foreign affairs and defence policy.
Mr Clinton, however, would still need a chief of staff, senior to the three
assistants, to serve as an overall co-ordinator of policy and 'honest
broker' within the White House.
The commission also called for clarification of policy-making machinery
outside the White House, especially in trade, competitiveness and the
environment. In each case a single government department should be made
responsible for policy.
The US Trade Representative should become the president's sole trade
negotiator and the administration's sole spokesperson on trade.
The Commerce Department should give up trade functions and concentrate on
promoting US economic competitiveness.
A new Department of the Environment should assume the responsibilities of
the Environmental Protection Agency and other scattered environmental
duties.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Top officials will face tougher ethics curbs
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton is expected to require members of his new
administration to sign some of the most exacting ethical restrictions yet
imposed on US government officials.
The president-elect could announce the ethical guidelines, which will
include tough constraints on the kinds of lobbying activities political
appointees may engage in after they leave office, in the Arkansas state
capital of Little Rock, today.
The announcement of the ethics rules would be the first substantial act Mr
Clinton has taken since he won the presidential election last week, and
would precede the announcement of any of the nominations to serve in his
cabinet.
Mr Warren Christopher, director of the Clinton transition team, said last
week that the ethics rules would be the strictest yet seen; the Washington
Post reported yesterday that top administration officials would be
prohibited from lobbying their former agencies for five years after they
left office, and would be banned for life from representing foreign
governments.
Cabinet officials are at the moment prohibited from representing foreign
governments or lobbying their former department for one year after leaving
office.
Irritation at the influence of Washington lobbyists over the campaigns of
both President George Bush and Governor Clinton was a prominent and popular
theme in the campaign of Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire whose
independent candidacy won 19 per cent of the votes in the election. Mr Perot
himself has been a frequent and successful user of the services of the same
Washington lobbyists.
Incoming US presidents oversee sweeping personnel changes in the federal
government. Over 1,700 jobs are listed in federal rule books as subject to
presidential appointment, and overall some 3,000 political appointments are
made. Mr Clinton's new ethics rules, are expected to apply only to the top
tier of these appointees.

FT  12 NOV 92 / The Matrix Churchill Scandal: Guidelines over sales to Iraq
founded on shifting sands - David Owen and Ralph Atkins on contrasts between
the public and private faces of policy on equipment exports to Saddam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, RALPH ATKINS and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PREVIOUSLY classified government documents released during the Matrix
Churchill trial reveal a stark contrast between the public and private
utterances of ministers and civil servants regarding the export to Iraq of
equipment with possible military applications.
In public, Mr John Major and other ministers were conveying the impression
that policy, since the formulation of the guidelines for exports to Iraq in
December 1984, had remained unchanged and that defence equipment was being
rigorously screened out.
On January 31 last year, for example, Mr Major, said at prime minister's
question time: 'There is a considerable degree of sensitivity about the
supply of arms and equipment. As the Rt Hon gentleman (Sir David Steel) will
know, for some considerable time we have not supplied arms to Iraq for
precisely that reason.'
Two weeks earlier Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, told the Commons: 'We
have not been arming Iraq. We have been applying, at some cost to our
manufacturers, an embar-go against it since the beginning of the Iran-Iraq
war.'
Behind the scenes, ministers and officials spent a great deal of time
debating how the guidelines could be manipulated and later modified.
They were certainly changed once - in December 1988. They may have been
amended again - or even done away with altogether - at a meeting chaired by
Mr Hurd on July 19 1990, two weeks before Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.
The removal of the guidelines was being advocated by some as early as
October 1989. A 'secret' memo addressed to Mr William Waldegrave, then a
foreign office minister, urges: 'We should. . . continue to resist the
proposal to abolish the guidelines on arms sales to Iran and Iraq.'
Throughout 1989 and until last year the standard public response to
questions about defence-related exports remained more or less consistent.
But, with hindsight, the answers had the sufficient element of vagueness to
accommodate the changes that were being made in private without appearing to
mislead MPs.
Typical of the answers given in this vein was one on April 20 1989 by Mr
Alan Clark, then a trade minister, to Mr Chris Mullin, Labour MP for
Sunderland South.
Mr Clark wrote: 'There are no plans to change the current restrictions on
the export of arms to Iraq which impose an embargo on the export of lethal
equipment. A licence is required for the export to Iraq of goods which are
subject to control under the Export of Goods (Control) Order.'
He added: 'Applications for such licences are examined in particular against
the guidelines on the export of defence equipment to Iran and Iraq announced
to the House . . . on October 29 1985. The guidelines are kept under review
in the light of developments in the situation there.'
Mr Clark's wording is strikingly similar to that suggested by Mr Waldegrave
in a letter to him dated April 27 1989.
This stated that the form of words to be used if ministers were 'pressed' on
the issue in parliament was: 'The guidelines . . . are kept under constant
review, and are applied in the light of prevailing circumstances, including
the ceasefire and developments in the peace negotiations.'
On April 21 1989 Lady Thatcher, then prime minister, told Mr Harry Cohen,
Labour MP for Leyton: 'The government have not changed their policy on
defence sales to Iraq.
'Applications for export licences continue to be considered on a
case-by-case basis, according to the guidelines as announced in the House by
the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary on October 29 1985, and in the light
of developments in the peace negotiations with Iran.'
As summary records of regular inter-departmental committee (IDC) meetings
make clear, the guidelines were open to being interpreted surprisingly
laxly.
The IDC was a body comprising Department of Trade and Industry, Ministry of
Defence, and Foreign Office officials charged with scrutinising
export-licence applications to Iran and Iraq.
A summary of a meeting on September 22 1988 records that MoD representatives
maintained that supply of mortar-locating radar 'would not enhance Iraq's
military capability.
'Iraq already had large numbers of such equipment supplied from the UK.'
Less than a month later, the IDC recommended approval of an application for
spare parts for armoured recovery vehicles.
On December 1 1988 it approved 'for demonstration' the export of a Marconi
Quickfire artillery fire control system, as well as six shotguns and shotgun
cartridges. The IDC felt 'that they could be allowed to fall outside the
scope of the guidelines, particularly now that the secretary of state had
spoken of a more flexible interpretation of the guidelines'.
Its meeting on April 28 1989 - the day the Baghdad international arms fair
opened - it refused licence applications for the supply of military aircraft
spares and radar but approved one for a Racal Interferometer SSL system.
The record of the meeting noted: 'This application had originally been
refused on grounds that it was to be used to jam radio signals. In fact it
was needed by the Iraqi ministry of the interior to monitor radio
frequencies as part of an international exercise.'
As late as April 23 1990, Mr Waldegrave was continuing to insist (to Mr Bob
Cryer, Labour MP for Bradford South): 'Exports of defence-related material
to both Iran and Iraq are governed by the guidelines announced by the then
secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs in the House on
October 29 1985.
'They are applied on a case-by-case basis in the light of prevailing
circumstances, including the ceasefire and developments in the peace
negotiations.'
Less than two months later, on June 14 1990, a letter from Mr Michael
Coolican, a DTI official described in the Supergun report compiled by the
Commons trade and industry select committee as the head of its export
control organisation, to his secretary of state says: 'Customs have prima
facie evidence that current machine tools exports from Matrix Churchill and
other UK companies under licence are being routed via Chile to Iraq for arms
manufacture.
'Evidence was available in 1987 to the same effect but to protect sources
ministers took a decision to let the particular exports by Matrix Churchill
go ahead.'
Within a week, Mr Nicholas Ridley, then trade and industry secretary, had
written to Mrs Thatcher arguing: 'We need to reconsider the rationale of the
Guidelines for defence sales to Iraq (and Iran) in the light of evidence of
moves on each side towards peace negotiations and in the light of impending
liberalisation of export controls agreed with Cocom partners and the trading
practices of our competitors.'
Briefing notes that appear to have been prepared for the minister of defence
procurement, dated two days before the meeting chaired by Mr Hurd on July 19
1990, recommend that the minister 'press for acceptance that machine tools
be allowed as exports to Iraq and Iran'.
The MoD's preferred option - two weeks before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait -
would be for 'no special export controls' on either Iraq or Iran. It notes:
'HMG guidelines have lost whatever relevance they might have had now that
there has been a ceasefire for over two years. If we do not sell
defence-related equipment other countries will.'
The second MoD preferred option would be to revert to a prohibition on
export of 'lethal' equipment. The MoD was to press for weapon platforms
(including aircraft, communications equipment and spares, eg tank spares) to
be excluded from definition of lethal.
On October 29 1990 with Iraqi troops in Kuwait City, Mr Clark, then a
defence minister, wrote: 'The Defence Export Services Organisation, in all
its assistance to industry, has scrupulously followed government policy as
it has developed in relation to military sales to Iraq.'
On December 3 1990 - less than two months before Mr Major's remarks at
question time and with the allies preparing their air offensive - an MoD
document entitled 'British Assistance to the emerging Iraqi arms industry'
and appearing to date from early 1990 was reclassified as 'restricted'.
Cataloguing items supplied by British manufacturers to Iraq, the document
states that the list represented 'a very significant enhancement of the
ability of Iraq to manufacture its own arms thus to resume war with Iran'
and 'an accumulation of technical know-how and machinery which will be
harmful if passed to its close ally, the Soviet Union'.
THE British Government intervened in October 1989 when a US senator was
planning to include Matrix Churchill on a blacklist of companies which had
exported restricted items to Iraq. Richard Donkin writes.
Senator Jessie Helms was forced to back down when one of his staff received
a sharp rebuttal from Whitehall officials to suggestions that Matrix might
have been involved in breaches of the Missile Technology Control Regime.
In the document (left) the official said that 'if Matrix Churchill or any
other British company appeared on his (Helms) list he could expect a sharp
reaction from HMG.'

FT  12 NOV 92 / The Matrix Churchill Scandal: Officials probably knew of BSA
contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MATRIX Churchill documents appear to indicate that Whitehall officials
had detailed knowledge of export contracts agreed with Iraqi interests by
other UK machine-tool manufacturers, including BSA Machine Tools.
The case, which is due to come before the Old Bailey today, was referred to
in the Commons this week by Mr Geoffrey Robinson, Labour MP for Coventry
North West. Questioning Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, Mr
Robinson asked: 'What will happen to the case that apparently continues
against BSA and its chairman and owner, Mr Keith Bailey? Does that go on?'
Mr Bailey, chairman of BSA's holding company, was arrested by Customs and
Excise last year. The documents - released in the course of the Matrix
Churchill case - date from early 1988 and relate to export licences granted
to BSA the previous year.
The first - a letter from an official based at the DTI - refers to a report
'claiming that the machine tools are being used for the manufacture of
munitions'.
The letter continues: 'There seems to be considerable merit in keeping as
quiet as possible about this politically sensitive issue. However, we should
be very careful about the validity of the claims on munitions manufacture
since there may be an element of mischief-making . . . while at the same
time be aware that almost any machine tool supplied to a country at war will
eventually be used to support the war effort in some form or other.
'If the licences are withdrawn then the consequences for the sector and the
companies will be severe, particularly for BSA Machine Tools because the
order is large relative to the company size, so they may seek redress
through the courts. Although keeping quiet seems the sensible option at this
time, we should be aware that news of this kind is likely to leak and
ministers should therefore be forewarned.'
A letter sent by another DTI official refers to a meeting concerning 'the
report that the Nassr Establishment for Mechanical Industries and the Hateen
Establishment for Technical Industries in Iraq were heavily engaged in a
munitions production programme'.
A later letter from a Ministry of Defence official stated: 'There are good
reasons for letting the licences stand. The intelligence community
recommends against revoking the licences as they fear for the safety of
their source and they believe that far more important information could
cease to become available as a result.'

FT  12 NOV 92 / The Matrix Churchill Scandal: Major challenged over personal
knowledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major was challenged last night over documents which it was claimed
showed the prime minister had 'personal and specific' knowledge that Matrix
Churchill exported machine tools to Iraq for munitions manufacture.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, escalated the political row over
the sale of defence-related equipment to Iraq by writing to the prime
minister saying that the 'veracity' of his past assurances could be in
doubt.
The letter came amid fresh allegations by Labour that ministers had covered
up the extent to which they helped an Iraqi arms build-up.
The party accused the government of lying over the reasons why four
ministers signed 'public interest immunity' orders trying to stop the
release of hundreds of documents setting out apparent attempts by the
government to reinterpret the arms embargo imposed on Iraq since 1980.
Mr Ashdown said that in December 1990 Mr Major told him in a letter that the
guidelines on arms to Iraq had been observed. But he said a document dated
June 21 1990, released in the Matrix Churchill trial, 'contains clear and
explicit indications that the government knew that Matrix Churchill and
other companies had exported machine tools to Iraq and that these were to be
'used for munitions manufacture'.'
Mr Ashdown said the letter from Mr Nicholas Ridley, then trade and industry
secretary, indicated that copies had been sent to the Cabinet's Over seas
and Defence Committee, of which Mr Major was a member.
His letter to the prime minister said: 'It is clear from this that you would
have had personal and specific knowledge that Matrix Churchill has exported
machine tools to Iraq and that these were to be used for munitions
manufacture . . . I hope there is a rational explanation for this.'
It was the second letter Mr Ashdown had sent to the prime minister yesterday
about the affair. Earlier Downing Street said officials were 'trawling'
files to allow a substantial answer to his points.
Separately, Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said a
public interest immunity certificate signed by Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, a
foreign office minister, showed that the government was wrong to claim
ministers had no alternative to signing the orders.
Mr Garel-Jones wrote: 'It has been arranged that where a document has
originated from a department it will be for a minister of that department to
consider whether a claim for public interest immunity should be made for
such a document.' He argued that it would be against the public interest to
release documents revealing the identity of informants whose security might
be jeopardised, intelligence material, or the process of providing ministers
with advice.
But Mr Cook said: 'Citizens should not have their liberty put at risk
because the government claims immunity for documents vital to their
defence.'
The row descended into angry clashes over the legal precedent for using
public interest immunity in a criminal case. Mr Cook quoted remarks by Lord
Kilmuir, who was lord chancellor in 1956, saying that in the case of
documents 'relevant to the defence in criminal proceedings, crown privilege
should not be claimed'.
Downing Street retaliated by releasing selections from judicial rulings
dating from 1846 to back up its case. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary and another signatory of the orders, said on BBC
television that he was 'merely carrying out my duty'.
Mr Heseltine added: 'In so doing I was asking the judge to make a decision
as to whether these documents should be used in the course of justice.'
Asked about the words used by Mr Garel-Jones, he replied: 'He is doing the
same thing.'
Meanwhile Sir David Steel, the Liberal Democrat MP, called on Lady Thatcher
to say whether she will give evidence to the inquiry.

FT  12 NOV 92 / The Matrix Churchill Scandal: Legal position of three
cabinet ministers still in question
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE legal position of the three cabinet ministers who signed public interest
immunity (PII) certificates to prevent confidential government documents
being used as evidence in the Matrix Churchill trial was still being
questioned yesterday, John Mason writes.
This was despite the assurance by Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the
attorney-general, on Tuesday that the ministers had a duty to try to stop
the documents being used in court.
Sir Nicholas told the Commons that when publication of official documents
was against the public interest, ministers had no discretion and had to ask
the courts for their publication to be prevented.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday justified
his signing of the PII certificates by saying he had consulted the
attorney-general beforehand who gave him the same advice.
However, one leading QC with considerable experience of PII cases maintained
that ministers would always have some discretion. This would apply in
deciding whether publication would be against the public interest. 'That
initial value judgment always has to be made,' he said.
A leading criminal solicitor was concerned that in cases such as Matrix
Churchill such decisions about public interest would be taken in practice by
civil servants.
However, lawyers agreed that it was incorrect to suggest that PII could not
be used in criminal cases. In a recent Court of Appeal ruling, Lord Justice
Mann made it plain that it could and that it was for the trial judge to
balance the conflicting claims of interest.

Customs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMS MAY be sued for malicious prosecution following the collapse of the
Matrix Churchill trial. Mr Trevor Abraham, former Matrix commercial director
and one of three men cleared of illegally exporting machine tools to Iraq,
is considering bringing a prosecution, his solicitor Mr Nicholas Devine of
Blythe Liggins, said yesterday.
Mr Devine claimed that the trial had been brought by Customs in an attempt
to embarrass the Department of Trade.
It would be necessary to establish negligence or fraud to prove the
prosecution had been malicious, he said. 'It has been suggested from an
early stage that the whole thing was prompted by internecine strife between
Customs and the Department of Trade and Industry.
'A former DTI minister and three civil servants in his department were put
up on a stand to be shot at, embarrassed by cross-examination and made to
look foolish.'
He claimed Customs should have abandoned the case long before it went to
trial.
'There is certainly evidence which would suggest it should never have been
begun. Someone somewhere in Customs was in possession of all the facts, all
the details, all the evidence and must have known the case was ill-founded
and yet allowed it to proceed.'
Mr Devine said documents detailing the government's 'hidden agenda' of arms
sales to Iraq and awareness of the nature of Matrix Churchill lathes
contracts had been available to prosecutors at an early stage.
'These men were accused of misleading the DTI by prosecutors who must have
known there hadn't been any misleading,' he said.

FT  12 NOV 92 / The Matrix Churchill Scandal: Whitehall knew of chemical
weapons link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT knew in 1988 that Matrix Churchill was selling precision
engineering equipment to a chemicals weapons manufacturer, Industrias
Cardoen of Chile, which was also the main arms supplier to Iraq.
Matrix applied for export credits on behalf of that manufacturer to the
Export Credit Guarantee Department (ECGD), the then government-owned body
which underwrites loans for export contracts.
Previously secret Whitehall documents also note that such equipment was
'essential to the manufacture of nuclear weapons'.
The Department of Trade and Industry nevertheless approved the equipment for
export, saying there was no evidence that the tools were being put to
military use.
But the Foreign Office, objecting to the granting of a licence, said the DTI
arguments were 'to say the least, disingenuous'.
Documents on Industrias Cardoen circulated in January 1989 in the ECGD said:
'Matrix Churchill initially came in for (insurance) cover on (an)
arms/chemical manufacturer in August 1988. It seems they (the arms
manufacturer) are involved in chemicals weapons manufacture.'
Mr Robert Lemin, an associate director of Sedgwicks, the insurance broker to
Matrix Churchill, also voiced concerns to the ECGD that sales to Cardoen
'would be used to manufacture munitions'.
This view was repeated almost two years later at the ECGD's short-term
export credit headquarters in Cardiff in a letter from Mr Paul St John
Miller, regional director of the ECGD's Birmingham regional office.
He wrote: 'Goods were apparently destined for Iraq to be incorporated into a
chemicals weapons factory.'
Industrias Cardoen was one of the leading suppliers of arms to Baghdad
during the 1980s. It is estimated to have sold nearly Dollars 500m worth of
cluster bombs to Baghdad as well as plans for a turnkey bomb factory that
was built in Iraq.
Cardoen has also been rumoured to have had links to a chemical weapons plant
in Paraguay that was assisting Iraq, but has denied such links.
Apart from the logistical reasons for Matrix Churchill's sales to Iraq
through Cardoen, the Chilean company provided a means for the Iraqis to pay
their suppliers.
Mr Miller wrote in November 1990: 'Cardoen would be paid by the Iraqis in
local currency and then use that currency with Iraqi government authority,
to purchase crude oil from . . . Iraq. That crude oil to be on-sold
immediately.'
This allowed Iraq to avoid using hard currency while allowing Cardoen to
receive dollars from a barter deal.
A few weeks earlier a Ministry of Defence working group was drawing
parallels between the British contribution to Iraqi arms manufacturing
capabilities and the 1989 scandal over a German project to build a chemicals
weapons plant in Libya.
The working group singled out 'our machinery manufacturers' as helping 'Iraq
towards the setting up of a major arms R&amp;D and production industry'.
It said that this contribution to an indigenous arms industry was 'often
unwilling, but sometimes not'. It compiled a list of export licences that it
said could have contributed to the setting up of Iraq's arms industry. They
included:
Vacuum precision furnaces for making aircraft components.
Ingot moulds 'to make gun barrels and tank parts'.
An application from Racal to work on a factory producing military radars.
An application from MSA (Britain) of Reading, Berkshire, to make batteries
'used chiefly in missiles and shells'.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Dialogue sought after Ulster talks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR PATRICK Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday that the UK
government would continue to look to dialogue - not an imposed solution - to
end the province's political problems.
In spite of the failure of the latest set of 'round-table' talks, which
collapsed on Tuesday, Sir Patrick said the government would 'steadily
persevere'. He said the participants had shown a 'marked increase in the
understanding of the position taken by others and respect for them'.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Industry plea rejected over
business rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has rejected pleas from industry organisations to keep down
the annual increase in the business rate, and will announce today that it
will rise by the maximum allowed under the legislation.
The move follows a direct appeal last week by industry to Mr Michael Howard,
the environment secretary. A letter jointly from the British Chambers of
Commerce and other organisations including those for small businesses,
called for a freeze in the business rate.
Today, however, Mr Howard will say that the rate poundage for 1993-94 will
rise by 3.6 per cent, the annual rate of inflation in September.
This aspect of the plans for business will be overshadowed today by the
autumn statement announcement and the package of measures to help industry
which Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will announce with the public
spending decisions.
This 'package for growth' will be seen by the cabinet for the first time
this morning, as it has been kept closely within Treasury control and has
been discussed only with ministers directly involved.
The business organisations complain that when the government introduced the
business rate with the poll tax the impression was that the annual inflation
rate was the ceiling for any increase rather than the inevitable rise.
Since then, however, the government has raised it in line with inflation
every year.
Ministers say that business is still protected from excessive increases. The
government estimates that businesses are having to pay Pounds 1bn less in
rates than they would have done had the previous system still applied.
The 'charm offensive' to win support of the spending decisions will broaden
after the statement, as Mr Lamont holds a further meeting with Tory
backbenchers and gives a series of interviews.
Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, will use opportunities
in the next few weeks to highlight the importance of improving performance
in public services especially when spending is tight. That message will be
underlined in the Citizen's Charter white paper to be published late this
month.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Wandering in the long grass -
Political Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a new golden rule of politics at Westminster. The government's
response to each new explosion is to delay, defer and, if necessary, to
prevaricate. Until, that is, the economy comes right.
Mr John Major's decision this week to announce a judicial inquiry into the
tawdry political backcloth to the sales of defence-related equipment to Iraq
fits neatly into this damage-limitation strategy.
The hope is that for a few months at least the affair will join in the
political long grass the row over coal industry closures, the Tory civil war
over Europe, and half-a-dozen other potentially damaging issues.
The logic is simple. When the economy is in recession, MPs and voters will
pick up everything and anything to throw at the government. Give them
economic recovery, job security and cash in their pockets and arguments over
sales of lathes to Saddam Hussein, redundancies in the coal industry, even
the implications of Maastricht, will take on a more rational perspective.
Maybe. But first the government has to get from here to there. And Mr Major
was wrong this week when he forecast that the outcome of the inquiry by Lord
Justice Scott into the Iraqi sales, like that of Lord Justice Bingham into
BCCI, would leave his government unscathed.
The documents which surfaced from the collapse of the prosecution of three
directors of Matrix Churchill do not in themselves provide evidence of a
conspiracy to subvert the restrictions on defence-related sales to Iraq.
It may be that such a conspiracy does emerge - none of the papers so far
released indicate just how much the cabinet of the day knew about what was
going on. Maybe not. No-one knows yet what if anything Mr Major - foreign
secretary and chancellor during crucial periods - was or was not told. The
answer offered yesterday by one of the key participants was encouraging for
the prime minister: 'probably not very much'.
But what has emerged so far will give Lord Justice Scott plenty of
ammunition to castigate ministers past and present for setting out one
policy in public and then systematically flouting it in private.
The picture which emerges is one of ministers and officials so accustomed to
power that they had become indifferent to any constraints on its exercise.
There are exceptions. Though one or two of the most embarrassing documents
emanated from his office, Mr William Waldegrave, minister at the Foreign
Office, appears for the most part to have been on the side of the angels.
His argument that the government should seek to abide by its own rules were
consistently beaten back by ministers and officials at the DTI and,
latterly, the MoD. The flamboyant Mr Alan Clark was far from alone in his
indifference to official policy. In the climate of the times the Foreign
Office knew that taking the battle to No 10 Downing Street would do it no
good.
All this, and presumably much more, will be digested by Lord Justice Scott.
Today, though, it will be back to the economy - and an Autumn Statement
designed to deliver the recovery which will put all these things in
perspective. After the Treasury's exhaustive briefings in recent days
everyone knows the bad news in the statement. The level of public borrowing
will be horrendous, there will be deep cuts in most Whitehall programmes,
council tax bills will soar and public-sector workers will face real wage
cuts.
Some of the better news also has been fed out. Capital projects have been
protected, the private sector will be freed from some red tape which
prevents it building roads and bridges, and councils will be able to spend
more of the receipts from asset sales. Assuming the markets behave, Mr
Norman Lamont will deliver another interest rate cut.
But what else? The government's supporters at Westminster are desperate for
a trick, a white rabbit to show that the government still has the
imagination needed to deliver recovery. If Mr Lamont does not produce one,
they may well decide to wander again in the long grass of Europe, coal mines
and arms sales.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Howard 'confident' that council tax
will be seen as fair replacement for poll tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Howard told MPs he was 'confident' the council tax would be seen as a
fair replacement for the poll tax when it was introduced next April, Ivor
Owen writes.
He brushed aside a prediction by Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment
secretary, that the government would be 'profoundly embarrassed' when it
became known that the average charge would be far in excess of the Pounds
400 the public had been led to expect.
Labour MPs disputed Mr Howard's assertion that the government had never
forecast the likely level of the new tax.
Mr Straw brandished a sheaf of papers containing figures he claimed had been
produced on the instructions of Mr Michael Heseltine, the former environment
secretary, for use in the approach to last April's general election.
These had been 'entirely bogus' and were intended to deceive the electorate,
Mr Straw said.
Mr Howard accused Mr Straw of 'cheap misrepresentation' and insisted 'no
predictions were made'.
Labour MPs jeered when Mr Howard said the figure referred to by Mr Straw
were subject to caveats 'clearly spelled out at the time'.
They were not forecasts, and had never been represented as such.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Checklist for the Autumn Statement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The table summarises the main figures Mr Lamont is expected to present today
in his Autumn Statement, with other measures he may take to stimulate the
economy. The main thrust of the statement is to provide a new set of numbers
for public spending in the three financial years from 1993-94, with the
Treasury's latest spending projections for 1992-93. The chancellor will also
reveal the Treasury's new forecasts for the economy for 1992 and 1993,
updating those made in the March Budget. The figures for expected public
spending totals are illustrative, based on FT estimates. The concensus of
City forecasts is from figures collected this month by Concensus Economics,
and economics consultancy.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Insurers may cut cover for terrorist damage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURERS ARE expected to reduce cover for damage caused by terrorists on the
British mainland after heavy losses from two IRA bomb explosions in London
in April.
The Association of British Insurers, the industry's trade association,
confirmed yesterday that its members 'were giving serious consideration' to
the introduction of an exclusion clause in commercial property policies for
damage and business interruption.
The move comes in the wake of the IRA's current bombing campaign and the
April attacks, which included serious damage to the Commercial Union
building in the City and are estimated to have cost Pounds 800m.
It also follows discussions between UK insurers and their influential
European reinsurers, who are concerned about their own potential exposure to
terrorism.
As discussions at the association continued yesterday, it was unclear
whether the exclusion would affect domestic household policies. Further
details will be announced later this week.
The association stressed that policyholders may still be able to obtain
cover by 'buying back' the exclusion clause, but companies seeking insurance
are concerned about the potential impact on British business.
It has already led to fresh demands from insurance buyers for the government
to extend to the mainland the Northern Ireland scheme which compensates for
damage caused by terrorists.
The Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce
(Airmic), which represents insurance buyers at more than 300 British
companies, criticised the potential withdrawal of the exclusion clause.
'(This will) leave British industry in a grievously exposed position,' it
said. 'It will be impossible to protect assets and earnings against a real
hazard exposure.'
Airmic urged the Confederation of British Industry to start discussions 'at
the highest levels' with both government and insurers to ensure 'terrorist
activity does not achieve a major success in its campaign to undermine the
British economy'.
Under the Northern Ireland scheme, introduced in 1977, the government meets
most of the cost of terrorism or riot damage. Claims under the scheme
amounted to Pounds 33m in the 1991-92 financial year.
Airmic said it believed the exclusion 'is being promoted by the influential
continental reinsurance market'. Companies such as Munich Re of Germany, the
world's biggest reinsurer, provide extensive reinsurance coverage to British
companies.
In a letter last month to UK insurers, Munich Re said: 'We would prefer to
exclude terrorism from our reinsurance treaties.' The company said talks
among UK insurers had been based on 'the consensus that the insurance and
reinsurance industry cannot continue to pay for IRA terrorist attacks on
mainland Britain'.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Bank urges stable prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATION WAS put back on the UK economic policy agenda yesterday by Mr
Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, in a powerfully
argued speech in support of stable prices.
In his Bank of England lecture at the London School of Economics, he
emphasised that inflation, rather than encouraging economic activity,
involved serious economic costs.
Some problems were familiar. Merchants were forced constantly to revise
their price lists, while index-linked tax systems were less than perfect.
But the governor said there were other more significant costs that arose
when inflation could not be anticipated.
Rising prices distorted the signals needed for an efficient allocation of
resources in the economy. In particular, inflation made it difficult to work
out the real rate of interest.
This could lead to inappropriate investment decisions and have significantly
adverse consequences for growth.
Societies could suffer loss of output and welfare through unexpected changes
in inflation.
Sharp variations in the price level could have a big impact on the
distribution of income and wealth, notably between debtors and creditors.
Variable inflation could make companies keener to invest in projects with a
short-term pay-off.
Initiative and ability became channelled into activities to avoid the cost
of inflation or to seek to exploit it, rather than being channeled into more
productive uses. Savers could demand a risk premium, raising the cost of
borrowing.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton added that it was wrong to settle for an inflation rate
of, say, 5 per cent.
'Whenever inflation is viewed as acceptable,' he said, 'it is possible to
settle for an alternative rate which is just a little higher.
The end result is an inflation rate that is high and rising, and which is
costly to reduce.'
He said that in the long run there was no evidence that the UK was more
inflation-prone than other industrialised societies.
Britain's record had been bad in the post-war period, and especially in the
1970s and 1980s.
But for many hundreds of years, apart from the great Tudor inflation, price
levels had been stable in the sense that they tended to return to their
original level after periods in which prices rose and fell.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton said: 'Even in the inflationary sixteenth century, prices
rose by a factor of just under four, whereas since 1900 prices have risen
over 40-fold.'

FT  12 NOV 92 / Synod backs ordination of women
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGLAND IS set to have women priests within two years, following a close
vote in the Church of England's general synod yesterday.
A passionate debate ended with a measure making it lawful for women to be
ordained to the priesthood being carried in all three houses of the synod -
bishops, clergy and laity. The measure required a two thirds majority in
each house.
The vote among the laity was expected to be close, and the result was 169
votes to 82. Had only two lay members voted the other way, the ordination of
women would have been blocked. The bishops voted in favour by 39 votes to 13
and the clergy by 176 votes to 74.
Legislation now has to pass through parliament and, although there are more
than 1,000 women deacons waiting to become priests, the first ordinations
are not likely before late 1994.
While parliament usually accepts decisions of the Church, there may be
opposition to a proposed scheme of financial compensation for male priests
who resign when women are ordained.
The historic decision was greeted by potential women priests singing by
candlelight outside the synod meeting at Church House, London.
Some opponents spoke against the ordination of women on theological grounds.
Others opposed the nature of the legislation which will enable individual
parishes to decide whether they want the ministry of a woman.
But many of the Church's most senior figures strongly supported the
proposals. Dr George Carey, archbishop of Canterbury, argued that the
Church's voice was in danger of not being heard in 'an increasingly confused
and lost world' if women were 'exercising leadership in every area of our
society's life save the ordained priesthood'.
The Rt Rev Robert Williamson, bishop of Southwark, said that in his south
London diocese he had to confront some of the chronic injustices in society.
He said he could not do this with integrity in the face of the apparent
injustice of the church denying women the opportunity to test their vocation
to become priests.
The Church faced divisions whichever way the vote went. A hint of the
potential difficulties surfaced in the debate when the Rt Rev David Lunn,
bishop of Sheffield, said that if the changes took place he did not see how
it would make sense for a diocese to have a bishop who, like himself, could
not wholeheartedly support the new arrangements.
The Rev June Osborne, a woman deacon in east London, pleaded with the synod
to allow her to carry out her ministry as a priest.
But Mr John Selwyn Gummer, agriculture minister and a member of the synod,
responded that the only way in which Ms Osborne could test her vocation to
the priesthood would be by removing the vocation from a number of male
priests who felt they could not remain in the church if women were ordained.
Mr Gummer had suggested that he might leave the Church of England over
women's ordination, and last night Ms Ann Widdecombe, a parliamentary
colleague and social security minister, said that she intended to leave.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Public spending system set to change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY is to include an important area of cash spent by local
authorities in its new system for controlling public spending, due to be
unveiled in today's Autumn Statement.
The move indicates a new determination by Whitehall to impose financial
constraints on local government.
In another change, the Treasury is to exclude privatisation revenues, which
are expected to fall off rapidly over the next few years, from its new
control system, which may dilute its efforts to damp overall spending
growth.
This new control total will take over from the so-called planning total from
1993-94 as the main figure used by the Treasury in to project public
spending.
The Treasury aims to limit rises in the control total to about 3 per cent in
cash terms in both 1994-95 and 1995-96, as part of a Whitehall initiative to
limit rises in public spending.
The Treasury will have a notional planning total of Pounds 244.5bn in
1993-94 and will indicate today how this translates into the new control
total, which seems likely to be set at around Pounds 240bn.
The planning total accounts for about 90 per cent of all government spending
and excludes local authorities' spending which they finance themselves.
A breakdown of how this will be split between the different areas of
government spending will be issued later today.
In a break with the past, the control total will include local authorities'
self-financed spending, which includes cash raised from local taxation.
In the past the Treasury argued that to frame the planning total in this way
made sense as it was not always easy to control the spending of councils.
The change indicates that the Treasury is keen to bear down heavily on all
elements of local-authority spending, via measures such as capping.
In 1992-93 local authorities' self-financed spending is projected at Pounds
9.5bn, a figure due to increase to Pounds 10bn in 1993-94.
In the past the planning total has included privatisation revenues, which
count under Treasury convention as negative spending or saving.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNSEL for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, has asked the High Court
to end the five-year legal battle of Mr Lorrain Osman to avoid extradition
to Hong Kong.
Mr Osman, 60, Britain's longest-serving unconvicted prisoner, faces theft
and fraud charges. He is making his ninth application for a writ of habeas
corpus, freeing him from custody at Brixton prison in south London.
Mr Stephen Richards, for the home secretary, said Mr Osman's attempt to
avoid his removal by repeatedly applying for writs of habeas corpus and
judicial review should now end.
He said the court should allow extradition to go ahead, even if Mr Osman
launched a 10th application for a writ. Judgment was reserved.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Clearers accused of cover-up over loan write-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH STREET banks were yesterday accused of covering up alleged
mismanagement of small-business accounts by writing off loans on condition
that customers sign agreements not to disclose details of their cases.
The accusation was made by Struggle Against Financial Exploitation (Safe), a
new pressure group founded by two owners of small businesses who are locked
in long-running disputes with Barclays Bank.
Safe is the latest of a number of groups formed by business people to
campaign against the practices of the big banks.
A separate group known as the Bank Action Group (Bag) has been formed by
dis-gruntled clients of Lloyds Bank.
Mr Brian Jones, one of Safe's founding members, has gained notoriety by
letting off 400 stink bombs in 67 Barclays' branches and parking a van
towing an advertising hoarding with details of his case outside its head
office.
He claims Barclays has offered to write off all but Pounds 35,000 of a
Pounds 393,000 overdraft in exchange for an end to his campaign. He said
high street banks were secretly offering thousands of such 'settlement
agreements'.
Barclays said yesterday that settlement agreements of the kind Safe was
complaining about were standard commercial practice.
It said it had offered to sign a deal with Mr Jones that removed the
confidentiality clause.
Mr Chris Joseph, the group's other founder, is embroiled in a row with
Barclays over his former advertising agency, Hook Advertising.
Safe said it had details of many cases in which banks had withdrawn
overdraft facilities from small-business customers with little or no notice.
It said the banks had unfairly turned on their vulnerable small-business
customers.
The group, which claims 2,000 members, is establishing clubs of 200 members
with shares in each of the four large clearing banks.
These will try to force inquiries into the settlement agreements under the
1989 Companies Act.
Mr Joseph said the group also intended to call a 'day of solvency' on which
it would ask customers to withdraw their money from high street banks to
test their solvency. This would turn the banks' own tactics against them.
The group argues that banks have acted wrongly by asking small-business
customers who are potentially in default of loans to sign settlement
agreements, and subsequently listing them as bad risks on credit control
networks.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Prospects for Lloyd's of London improving says report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS for Lloyd's of London are improving, but opportunities for
investors will remain limited, a report published this week by Salomon
Brothers concludes, Richard Lapper writes.
The report, The London Insurance Market - a Leaner, More Focused Lloyd's,
which is available to clients of the US securities house, says there are
signs that many insurance companies and syndicates are withdrawing from the
market following a run of heavy losses since 1987, but the market is still
troubled by overcapacity. Profitability levels will thus stay depressed.
It says underwriters will continue to struggle for returns 'that compare
favourably on a risk-adjusted basis with more traditional investment
opportunities.'

FT  12 NOV 92 / Partnership law to change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARTNERSHIPS WILL be able to take advantage of the company voluntary
arrangements and administration procedures available under UK insolvency
law, under draft legislation issued by the government's insolvency service
yesterday.
The proposed insolvency partnership order would allow greater opportunities
to assist or rescue partnerships - such as accountancy and law firms - which
run into difficulty.
It follows lobbying to the service, which is part of the Department and
Trade and Industry, by the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, the
leading professional body.
Voluntary arrangements and administration orders were introduced by the 1986
Insolvency Act to provide simpler or cheaper alternatives to formal court
winding-up orders for companies.
Partners currently seek individual interlocking voluntary arrangements when
they run into financial difficulties. This requires approval by all partners
on similar terms and includes provisions for partnership as well as
individual property and creditors.
This option, which will remain open, has been criticised by both insolvency
practitioners and the courts.
There were many difficulties such as anomalies in partnership law, problems
in selling partnership property and unnecessary meetings.
Comments should be received by March 12. Legislation would be put into
effect with a statutory instrument.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Manchester gets green summit
</HEADLINE>

   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT YEAR'S world environment summit will be in Manchester in September to
tackle implementation of plans agreed at this year's summit in Rio de
Janeiro. It will probably be attended by many heads of government.
Britain offered to host the summit after Mr John Major's visit to Rio.
Manchester beat rival bids from London, Edinburgh, Brighton, Reading and
Norwich.
The timing of the summit could help Manchester's bid to stage the 2000
Olympic games. The International Olympic Committee will meet in September,
when it will have to choose between the main contenders of Manchester,
Berlin, Beijing and Sydney.
Summit supporters include Central Manchester Development Corporation, the
British Council - a government agency - Manchester Metropolitan University,
the United Nations Association, Manchester Airport, the north-west business
leadership team and Granada Television.
The summit will be run by the government, with a core conference of about
500 delegates, but about 2,000 people are expected for two weeks of
environment-related fringe events.
Mr Graham Stringer, leader of Manchester City Council, said the city would
use the summit to stress the green elements of its bid for the 2000 Olympic
games. Urban regeneration is one of the criteria the International Olympic
Committee will use.
Land reclamation, clean technology policies, tree planting and recycling of
waste materials are all part of the city's attempt to impress IOC delegates.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Sharp rise in negative equity in homes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE IN FIVE homes bought in the past five years is now worth less than the
mortgage on it, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research body,
says in a survey today.
The survey, based on a sample of 1m homeowners, estimates that the total
value of negative equity in Britain is Pounds 2.68bn, compared with Pounds
1.2bn in October last year. Of this total negative equity 99 per cent is
held by people who have bought homes since 1987.
The south-east has the highest proportion of negative equity, with greater
London the worst affected. Forty-one per cent of people who bought in the
London area between 1988 and 1991 had negative equity last month, according
to the report, with an average deficit of Pounds 5,500 per household.
Only 1 per cent of buyers in Scotland are affected. The rises for the north
and north-west are comparatively low, while the rest of the south-east and
the east Midlands have the highest negative equity rates outside London.
More than half of homeowners who bought their property since 1987 with 95
per cent mortgages have negative equity, compared with less than 1 per cent
of those with mortgages of 80 per cent.
The position is different for homeowners who bought before the steep
increases in prices. Mr Daniel Dorling, one of the report's authors, said:
'Almost no one who bought before 1987 has negative equity.'
He added: 'Our research shows clearly that those who have been worst
affected are people with high percentage mortgages in the south-east who
have struggled to enter the property market at the bottom end. They are
likely to be the least well-placed to escape from the negative equity trap.'

FT  12 NOV 92 / Accountancy Column: Court case gives unique insight into an
auditor's work - Andrew Jack on the lessons to be learned from the
spiralling costs of an unfortunate acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Walker Greenbank, the wall-coverings group, sold one of its
subsidiaries in September 1990, the directors were hardly concerned that
they were paid just Pounds 1 on the deal.
Nearly four years after its acquisition, Greenbank's board was glad to see
the back of Alkar, a supermarket and warehouse shelving company that had
cost the group up to Pounds 15m.
The first sign of trouble came in October 1988. Mr Alan Carr, Alkar's
managing director and the man who had sold his company to Greenbank at the
start of 1987, made his normal monthly presentation to the board.
After nearly two years' of monthly written and oral management reports, and
the launch of an ambitious expansion programme, he told the directors that
there might be a shortfall in anticipated profits in his subsidiary.
The next month, these doubts re-surfaced in discussions Greenbank was having
with a potential takeover candidate. As a result, Sir Anthony Jolliffe, the
company's chairman at the time, suggested that Mr Carr might want to buy
back Alkar.
Mr Carr sought professional advice, and suggested a figure. This number
suggested his advisers had been given different information on Alkar's
performance to that previously presented to Greenbank's board.
The next day, on a Friday in mid-November 1988, Mr Carr called Greenbank's
finance director. He said Alkar's stated figures were incorrect, with stocks
over-valued by Pounds 2m-Pounds 4m and debtors over-valued by up to Pounds
4m. He tendered his resignation.
By Sunday, Greenbank had obtained an injunction to prevent Mr Carr and his
father - who had received Greenbank shares in payment for the acquisition of
Alkar - from selling these shares. Investigating accountants and senior
Greenbank management moved in to Alkar.
The final chapter of Greenbank's involvement with Alkar took place just a
few weeks ago, when Arthur Young, Greenbank's auditors, and Mr Carr and his
father - Alkar's previous owners - agreed to an out-of-court settlement
totalling Pounds 4.6m including costs.
The story of the Alkar acquisition is a valuable case-study, not least
because rarely do such intimate financial details make it as far as open
court. The details of the case are based on court documents presented by
Greenbank's lawyers during the trial. The case was settled before evidence
was heard from the Carrs or Arthur Young.
Walker Greenbank - previously known as C &amp; W Walker Holdings - was the
holding company for a group of engineering businesses growing by
acquisition, based in Lancashire. In December 1986 it considered buying a
new business. That company was Alkar - originally called WH Carr &amp; Sons -
based near Newcastle upon Tyne, which made and installed supermarket
shelving systems and warehouse racking.
Alkar was owned by Mr Alan Carr, the managing director, and Mr William Carr,
his father and a former director. Alan Carr wanted to expand the business,
and decided that finding a purchaser which would inject more money would be
the best option.
Alan Carr negotiated with Greenbank, and told the company that Alkar would
make a profit of at least Pounds 900,000 for the year to December 31 1986.
He supplied audited accounts for 1984 and 1985, and management accounts up
to October 1986.
Greenbank asked Arthur Young, its auditor, to investigate Alkar. It says
that nothing untoward emerged, and it purchased the company by the end of
January 1987. Alan Carr joined Greenbank's board, and Greenbank's deputy
chief executive joined Alkar's.
Payment was Pounds 2.2m in shares initially, with a series of further
amounts on later dates related to Alkar's profits for 1986 and 1987. What
emerged many months later was the inaccuracy of both the profit forecasts
and of the financial information fed to Greenbank's board after acquisition.
Greenbank alleges that the information was far too reliant on Alan Carr. It
says he decided what transactions should be recognised as sales, he
anticipated sales and he decided what the company's stock was worth. It also
highlights the role of Arthur Young, saying the firm should have raised
questions over Alkar's accounting practices and profit forecasts.
The 1986 accounts showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.1m. They were
over-stated by Pounds 240,000 of overvalued stock, and by Pounds 271,000 not
properly attributable to that year. According to Greenbank, the real net
profit should have been just Pounds 784,000 - well below the Pounds 900,000
forecast level.
After acquisition, Greenbank alleges fraud on the part of Mr Alan Carr and
negligence against Arthur Young, as auditor to Alkar once it had become part
of the group. The Carrs and Arthur Young deny these allegations.
During this period, Alkar made monthly written reports of its trading
figures and oral progress reports to Greenbank's board. In February 1988,
for instance, Alan Carr said sales to January of that year were Pounds 10.4m
and pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.7m. In fact, sales were no more than
Pounds 8.5m, and Alkar had made a loss, says Greenbank.
What Arthur Young allegedly failed to detect was an over-valuation of stock
totalling Pounds 4m - with a corresponding increase in profit. That included
Pounds 500,000 over-stated as a result of double-counting stock and
miscalculating overheads.
In late December 1987, there was a stock-take at Alkar's factory and
warehouse attended by auditors from Arthur Young. The count was apparently
carried out properly, using stock tickets stuck to the items being counted.
Carbon duplicates were taken to the office for computer entry.
But the audit senior carrying out the work was accompanied by Alkar's
in-house accountant as he went round. On the instructions of Alan Carr, this
accountant then altered figures on the computer to inflate the amount of
stock, being careful to only inflate items that he knew were not being
tested by the auditors. He added digits to the beginning of the figures or
noughts to the end, and altered the figures shown on the duplicate tickets
by inking over the carbon figures.
Arthur Young also failed to highlight inflated sales figures. Alkar included
in the accounts two sales not attributable to the financial period under
examination, which inflated sales by Pounds 2.5m and profits by Pounds
400,000.
The first was a Pounds 2.2m order from the Gateway supermarket chain,
Alkar's principal customer. There was no such order, but simply an
arrangement that sales made after February 1988 up to Pounds 2.2m would
receive a discount by the company.
Greenbank alleges that the auditors were talked round into accepting this
sale and told Alkar staff what documentation would be required to confirm it
had taken place. These sales figures were also to be included in the
accounts for the following financial year.
The second sale was a Pounds 306,000 order to equip 17 supermarkets. Only
two, in fact, had been equipped during the accounting period. Finally, Alkar
included Pounds 300,000 in income from a grant from the Department of Trade
and Industry, even though the conditions for payment were not met until long
after the end of the accounting period.
Greenbank argues that based on these accounts, which were finally published
in June 1988, and the continued healthly progress reports from Mr Carr, it
extended new loans to Alkar to help fund its expansion.
Fuller details of the Alkar acquisition - contained in 2,000 files in the
High Court in London last month - would no doubt have emerged during a trial
expected to last at least until next January. But after two weeks' of
opening arguments, the Carrs and Arthur Young, now part of accountants Ernst
&amp; Young, agreed to settle without any admission of liability. They denied
Greenbank's allegations.

FT  12 NOV 92 / People: Alexander White joins Invesco MIM as a non-executive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alexander White, formerly a senior investment banker with New York-based
James D Wolf-ensohn, has been made a non-executive director of Invesco MIM,
in a move that further underscores the investment group's American
orientation.
'From their (Invesco MIM's) point of view, the majority of the funds under
management come from the US and there had not been an American on the board,
so it seemed appropriate to restore the balance,' says White. Invesco MIM
manages around Pounds 34bn worldwide, but about two thirds of that is
managed from the US.
The latest recruit to the board knows Invesco MIM and its new chief
executive Charles Brady well, having been involved in an advisory role when
Britannia Arrow purchased the US fund manager in two stages in 1986 and
1988. He had been proposed as a director well before Hong Kong securities
house Peregrine Investments recently lifted its stake in Invesco to 24 per
cent. Peregrine has not yet appointed any representatives to the board.
Because of Invesco MIM's well-publicised problems in the UK, including the
Drayton Consolidated debacle as a result of which the group agreed to pay
investors Pounds 9.5m in compensation, there has been speculation that the
group might wish to spin off its European and possibly Far Eastern business.
However, White, who says he has only attended 'one meeting', says it would
be 'premature' to comment on a possible reorganisation.
Brady, who works from Atlanta, Georgia, took over from Lord Stevens as group
chief executive in August, and is deploying a notably different, more
risk-averse strategy.
Much of the rest of the board reflects Invesco's past connections rather
than its current business, and White is not expected to be the last of the
new faces appointed to the boardroom.
Living in New York and involving himself in a variety of not-for-profit
endeavours together with some 'private' consultancy, White, 59, who had
previously worked for Merrill Lynch, retired from Wolfensohn two years ago.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A 39-year-old British banker has been given the job of running the London
operations of JP Morgan, the US bank, as part of a management shake-up
intended to give the bank a stronger focus in its European businesses.
Adam Wethered, who has been with the bank for 16 years, takes over a
1,700-strong office, one of the biggest of any foreign financial institution
in London.
A corporate financier at the start of his career, Wethered followed a
circuitous route through project financing and shipping finance, with a
brief spell in New York involved in the securities and trust businesses,
before returning to London as co-head of Morgan's European corporate finance
business last year.
Unlike many other US banks, JP Morgan's operations in continental Europe -
where it employs 2,500 people - exceed its operations in London.
To get these businesses working more effectively together, Morgan has set up
a European management committee, one of whose first chairmen is Wethered's
predecessor in London, Walter Gubert. Marcus Meier has been sent from New
York as a second co-chairman.
The new committee will stand outside the bank's formal reporting lines and
organisational structure, and instead will act as a forum for senior
executives from across the continent to swap ideas.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): An escape from
Chateau Chunder - Australian vintners are poised to compete with Europe at
the premium end of the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's winemakers have enjoyed phenomenal export success over the last
decade, mainly by producing good-quality wines at prices which often make
competing French, German and Italian wines look like poor value for money.
Export sales are up by nearly 800 per cent to 77.5m litres since 1984, and
the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation (AWBC) is forecasting overseas
sales of 400m litres by 2000.
Growth on that scale would increase Australia's share of the world export
market from about 1.5 per cent to 5 per cent, worth about ADollars 1bn
(Pounds 400m) in export revenue at current prices. But while there is almost
unanimous agreement among winemakers that Australia is producing the
products required to achieve these targets, some disagreement is emerging
about the marketing strategy required.
The wine houses do not put it this way, but much of the 1980s' growth was
almost accidental. Large-scale exporting began for the most part as a way of
disposing of a surplus which was depressing prices in the domestic market.
It was only when the trade was well under way that the bigger companies
began to realise the opportunities it offered. 'Twenty years ago, no one in
Australia thought that we could compete with the French in Europe on quality
and price,' says Perry Gunner, chief executive of Adelaide-based wine
company Orlando Wyndham.
'But when we started looking closely at the market, we were astonished at
the prices that people were prepared to pay for mediocre French wines, and
we quickly realised that quality was not a problem.'
Nevertheless, Australian producers had to start at the bottom of the market,
and have had to work hard to overcome what Brenton Roneberg, AWBC marketing
manager, describes as the 'Chateau Chunder' image.
The perception has changed over the last five years, mainly as a result of
glowing reviews by wine writers. According to the AWBC, about 80 per cent of
the wine exported to the UK now sells for more than Pounds 3, accounting for
about 12 per cent of sales above that price. Some wines, notably Orlando
Wyndham's Jacob's Creek range, have higher sales overseas than at home.
But success is rarely problem free, and alarm bells are beginning to ring in
some wineries as winemakers wonder how long the industry can sustain growth
rates of more than 70 per cent a year.
Ray King, chief executive of Mildara Blass, points out that Australia would
have to double its share of the UK mid-price market to achieve the
industry's targets for the next eight years. That is unlikely to be an easy
task, given that the overall UK market is unlikely to grow much because of
lifestyle pressures on alcohol products, which are common to most western
markets.
King also claims that many Australian companies are earning a return on
investment which is less than a third of the average for other industries,
mainly because prices have been set too low in the pursuit of volume sales.
'There are too many people who are waxing lyrical about the marvellous
success of the Australian wine industry overseas,' he says. 'There is no way
that the guys who are selling their stuff at these prices are going to come
out in front. 'There is no question that Australia produces the best value
for money wine in the world. But we could do almost as well in volume terms
and be profitable at the same time by raising our prices.'
Ross Wilson, chief executive of SA Brewing, which owns the big-selling
Penfolds label, says a unilateral price rise is impossible because Australia
does not have the marketing clout to dictate prices in international
markets. But, like most winemakers, he agrees with King that Australian
producers 'have got to be there in that higher price sector of the market,
or they are not going to survive'.
According to Robin Day, technical director of Orlando Wyndham, the solution
is likely to be a growing emphasis on premium products, sold through hotels
and restaurants, as well as the off-licences and supermarket chains which
have been the main growth areas in the past.
Penfolds and Orlando, the two biggest companies, are both putting increasing
effort into producing high-quality brands capable of competing with
higher-priced continental European wines.
'In general, the Australian wine industry is a price taker in the overseas
market because we are largely in the commercial (down-market) category. The
challenge for us is to build products that will take us into the premium end
of the market,' says Gunner.
That means a much higher profile for higher-priced wines such as Orlando's
new Saint range, its fruity Montrose wines from western New South Wales, and
the Hunter Valley chardonnays produced under the Wyndham label.
But moving up-market is a long-term project which depends on the slow
business of winning credibility and changing market perceptions. In the
meantime, the industry has to protect the market for its existing products.
'There are still a lot of shelves around the world without any Jacob's Creek
on them. We know we can sell more, and we would be silly to take our eye off
that ball before we have really rammed it home,' says Gunner.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Conga drums to
Christmas trees - Nikki Tait on the proliferation of US mail-order
catalogues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fancy sending your in-laws a glockenspiel for Christmas? Or a glow-in-rain
umbrella? Or perhaps some 'dream-catcher' earrings? Then heaven forbid that
you should trudge the high streets and shopping centres in search of such
perfect presents. The US catalogue industry, reaching new heights of
inventiveness, would be happy to oblige.
The outpouring of glossy retail catalogues ahead of the holiday season in
the US is hard for non-residents to visualise. Officially, the industry
calculates that around 8,000-10,000 catalogues are in circulation, but the
unsolicited pile amassed by one Manhattanite over the past two months makes
the point more vividly. It is nine inches high, weighs 15 pounds and is
still growing.
In part, the popularity of mail order reflects North America's multitudinous
geography, with the result that postal shopping has long been more deeply
engrained in a US consumer's psyche than a European counterpart's.
Nevertheless, the industry's dimensions are still sometimes overlooked.
Today, around 96m people - almost half the nation's population - are
reckoned to do some shopping by catalogue and, according to the Direct
Marketing Association, they spent around Dollars 48.8bn (Pounds 32.3bn) in
the process last year, up from Dollars 35.7bn in 1987. But even catalogue
retailers are battling against a tougher economic climate. Consultants at
Deloitte &amp; Touche, for example, calculate that total catalogue sales were
increasing, year-on-year, at double-digit rates during the late-1980s. In
1990 and 1991, the annual growth rate suddenly plunged to around 6 per cent,
where it is forecast to remain for the rest of the 1990s.
Admittedly, this means that the catalogue sector is still faring better than
the retail sector overall, where turnover was essentially flat last year.
But it has come down to earth with a bump.
For consumers, this tougher trading environment has been largely beneficial.
As the battle for shoppers' dollars has intensified, retailers have stepped
up their marketing efforts, particularly in the holiday season when some
catalogue operators can land up to two-thirds of their annual sales.
Price-based promotional activity is an important element in this new game.
Last year, for example, a number of catalogue retailers offered discounts
ranging between 15 and 40 per cent if goods were ordered within a specific
period or before a certain date.
This year, even the classy Neiman Marcus 'Christmas Book' - as integral to
the holiday season as the Macy's Thanksgiving parade - makes concessions to
the recessionary climate. Four pages at the front of the catalogue are
devoted to gifts costing less than Dollars 25 and there are another four
pages of presents for less than Dollars 100.
But industry-watchers say that attention to price, while important, is only
part of the picture. 'Retailers are still hitting quite hard on price,'
comments Ginny Daly, at Daly Direct Marketing in Maryland. 'But what I've
really noticed this year is more emphasis on niche areas.'
There is no want of variation in the catalogues landing through US shoppers'
mail boxes. For example, a 'personics catalogue' - which allows customers to
make up personalised tapes from the wide selection of songs - jostles
alongside offerings from The Nature Company, where 'ultra-green' products
range from a seed-saving bird-feeder to fuzzy dinosaur Christmas tree
ornaments.
In the very best cases, these niche sales efforts gets combined with more
innovative sales techniques. For the past couple of years, 'Anyone can
Whistle', a small catalogue operation in upstate New York, has followed a
similar tack with tape cassettes. This operation is the brainchild of a
Woodstock-based manufacturer of wind-chimes, run by a trained percussionist.
The catalogue sells anything from conga drums to harmonica-filled Christmas
crackers - but the prize sales point is a free tape of the various
instruments in operation, neatly following the catalogue sequence.
Distribution is another area where improvements are coming thick and fast.
Already, rapid distribution services have transformed the sales
possibilities in certain markets.
Take flowers, for example - the most conventional of gifts, but usually
rendered unpredictable on delivery by the vagaries of a local florist. Now
Caylx and Corolla, a San Francisco-based catalogue operation born less than
four years ago, offers to ship direct from a couple of dozen growers to the
recipient's front-door.
The company's founder, Ruth Owades, admits that Federal Express, the largest
US express delivery company and responsible for nearly all the distribution,
is a key element to the formula.
Owades also acknowledges that ironing out packaging standards, delivery
constraints and acceptable pricing strategies was not easy. But today, for
under Dollars 40, you can have anything from nine stems of Christmas orchids
to a rosemary topiary tree.
Whether marketing wheezes turn into actual sales is another matter. Even the
hard-headed Owades, who sends out around 8m catalogues a year and claims to
implement the Christmas shopping for celebrities like David Frost, admits
that impressing the would-be shopper does not quite equate to securing his
or her custom. The art, she says wisely, is not how many catalogues
circulate, but how many orders they generate.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Technology: Moving pictures on the office PC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft and Intel, the software and semiconductor champions of the
personal computer industry, aim to bring moving pictures into the mainstream
of personal computing with technology that enables most PCs to display video
images.
'Video for Windows', a Microsoft program launched this week, will allow any
PC with a 386 or 486 microprocessor 'brain' running the popular Microsoft
Windows operating system to display digitised video images along with text,
graphics and still pictures. Apple Computer already offers such 'multimedia'
capabilities on its Macintosh computers.
Until now, however, putting moving images on the screen of an IBM-compatible
PC has been expensive and complicated, requiring add-on circuit boards and
specialised software that have severely limited its use.
'For years, the necessary ingredients for digital video computing have been
coming together like elements in a chemical reaction,' says Andrew Grove,
Intel president and chief executive. 'Now we have added technology to ignite
a reaction that will turn a standard PC into a digital video computer. The
best news about it is that it's available to anyone who already owns a 386-
or 486-based PC.'
Intel's 'Indeo' video compression technology, which is incorporated in Video
for Windows, squeezes the huge amount of data required to record or display
a video sequence down to a manageable size, allowing users to integrate
video information in existing applications such as wordprocessors or
electronic mail.
Thanks also to Intel technology, Video for Windows will automatically adjust
the size and quality of video images according to the power of the PC it is
running on.
A standard 386 PC, for example, will provide a small image one-tenth the
size of the PC screen, at a slightly jerky 15 frames per second, whereas a
486 PC can display a quarter screen-sized image at 24 frames per second.
With the addition of a video enhancement circuit board, either machine will
provide full-screen, full-motion video images. 'Multimedia technology will
become important across a wide range of PC applications,' predicts Bill
Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief executive.
Business applications of digital video might include the enhancement of a
sales presentations or training materials with video clips; incorporating
video in electronic messages or using the PC as a display for desktop video
conferencing.
A sales report, for example, might have built-in video product
demonstrations or a training manual could incorporate 'how to' video
sequences. The boss might want to emphasise the importance of his message by
delivering it in a digitised video, while product development groups may
need to share pictures of the latest updates of their design work to
colleagues at a distant manufacturing site.
The portions of Video for Windows that enable PC users to 'play' video clips
will be free to current Windows users. The complete program, which includes
functions needed to create digital video, will sell in the US for Dollars
199.
Although the new Microsoft program provides video display capabilities on
most PCs, it is expected to whet the appetites of many PC users for add-on
products that improve PC video performance.
These may include video processing circuit boards and audio enhancement
devices, as well as memory upgrades and high capacity compact disk
read-only-memory (CD-Rom) data storage devices.
Eventually, multimedia display capabilities are expected to create increased
consumer interest in PCs by spawning new entertainment and educational
applications.
For these first-time PC purchasers, video display capabilities may provide
the first meaningful demonstration of the value of increased processing
power, tempting some to buy higher-performance PCs rather than the cheapest
models.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Technology: Pigs hold the cure - Transfusions using
artificial blood may not be far off, write Jennie Lynch and Clive Cookson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNIE LYNCH and CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Incredible as it may seem - and no doubt disconcerting to some - animals'
blood transformed by biotechnology could soon be coursing through human
veins.
Spurred by the growing fear of blood-transmitted diseases like Aids and
hepatitis and by a shortage of donated human blood, research companies are
in a race to develop blood substitutes. These would carry oxygen around the
body like the real thing but be free of unwanted contaminants.
Pigs are a promising non-human source. A US company aims to extract
haemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells, from herds that have been
genetically engineered for the purpose. Another firm is developing a
substitute based on cows' blood.
These and other efforts are aimed at serving a market which is potentially
huge. Already, hospitals and health services around the world spend an
estimated Dollars 5bn a year on blood for transfusions - if safe substitutes
become widely available, the market could double to Dollars 10bn a year.
A dozen companies are seeking to develop blood substitutes. Their first
products are beginning clinical trials, but none is likely to be in
commercial use before 1995.
Producing 'artificial blood' is a complex task, not without potential risk.
So what criteria should it satisfy? First and most obviously, it must be
safe. It should not be inherently toxic or made from anything liable to be a
source of disease. Nor should it contain any fragments of cell membranes
likely to cause reactions due to cross-matching incompatibilities.
Next, it should be stable - preferably more stable than human blood, which
has a shelf life of only three weeks and has to be kept chilled.
Finally, it should easy to make in vast quantities. In the US, 4m people a
year receive 12m pints of blood. If substitutes are to replace even a small
fraction of this, they will have to be produced in greater volume than any
other drugs emerging from the biotech industry.
Haemoglobin is the key to the problem. It is responsible for transporting
and delivering oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.
Researchers have followed two main approaches so far: to use purified and
modified forms of haemoglobin, extracted from various sources; or make an
inorganic chemical to take on the oxygen-carrying role of haemoglobin.
Several companies have investigated the use of purified haemoglobin as a
substitute for red blood cells. Baxter, based in Deerfield, Illinois,
extracts haemoglobin from human blood which has passed its expiry date; DNX
of Princeton has developed a genetically engineered pig with the ability to
make human haemoglobin; and Biopure of Boston is purifying natural
haemoglobin from slaughtered cows' blood.
Yet all of these developments suffer from similar drawbacks. When removed
from the protection of the red blood cell, haemoglobin becomes unstable and
split in half. The damaged molecules aggregate and block the smallest blood
vessels, particularly in the kidneys.
Baxter, Biopure and DNX all modify their haemoglobin products chemically in
order to stabilise their structures and enhance their release of oxygen. DNX
uses a cross-linking chemical which simultaneously achieves both aims.
DNX envisages extracting blood from herds of pigs which would be genetically
engineered to produce human as well as porcine haemoglobin. The human
haemoglobin would be separated and modified chemically for use in
transfusions. Its cost would be comparable with natural blood. 'I am very
confident that we can produce haemoglobin at Dollars 5 a gram,' said Paul
Schmitt, DNX's chief executive.
Somatogen, a biotechnology company based in Boulder, Colorado, has taken a
different approach, in collaboration with scientists at the MRC Laboratory
of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England.
To stop the haemoglobin from splitting, the scientists used genetic
engineering to make a protein bridge between the two halves of the molecule.
Somatogen has copied a natural haemoglobin mutant which binds oxygen less
strongly than usual, potentially boosting oxygen release into the tissues
30-fold. And the protein is produced by bacteria, allowing large quantities
to be made in a fermenter with no recourse to natural blood products and
their associated contaminants.
Somatogen started human tests, giving patients up to a pint of the
engineered 'blood', last February under the guidance of the US Food and Drug
Administration. Although there have been slight flu-like reactions, no toxic
side-effects have been seen so far, said Charles Scoggin, president of
Somatogen.
He envisages the product being used primarily to replace blood lost in
surgery. Somatogen is building a Dollars 40m production plant in Boulder,
with two 3,000-litre fermenters.
The alternative to haemoglobin is to use inert chemicals to carry oxygen.
Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) have such properties and they first reached the
headlines in 1966, alongside photographs of submerged mice breathing oxygen
from PFC solutions.
Although PFCs have been in development for longer than engineered
haemoglobins, they still have several hurdles to overcome before they can
replace human blood. Like oil and water, PFCs and blood do not mix;
therefore, they have to be emulsified with the help of chemicals called
surfactants. These, in turn, cause the PFC to become unstable, requiring the
addition of another fluorinated compound to stabilise the first.
The pioneering PFC is Fluosol, sold by Alpha Therapeutics, a subsidiary of
Green Cross of Japan. It is licensed in the US and UK for use to prevent
severe oxygen deprivation when treating patients with blocked coronary
arteries. But no PFC has been approved as a general blood substitute.
Researchers expect eventually to find new applications for artificial blood
in several fields of medicine. In cancer treatment, for example, carrying
more oxygen to the tumour would make radio-therapy more effective and reduce
the doses of radiation required.

The Essential History Of Europe (8.00 BBC2) promises to provide unusual
insights into each of the 12 member states of the EC, starting with Denmark.
With scenes shot at a birthday party, a night voyage to Sweden, a Viking
fantasia, and a furniture design company, this opening programme tries to
establish why the Danes were the first to vote against Maastricht.
BBC1's new wildlife series Living Dangerously (8.00) offers unusual points
of view: the world and all its human activity seen from the animal's
eye-line. It begins with a Bengal tiger in Nepal, an animal which many
greenies would like to see thriving and increasing. However, producer
Richard Brock points out that those who live in the area regularly come face
to face with the tigers on their doorsteps.
BBC2 starts the heavily promoted comedy series Absolutely Fabulous (9.00).
It is written by Jennifer Saunders, who also stars as a fashion PR, with
Joanna Lumley playing the fashion director of a glossy magazine.
We Have Ways Of Making You Think (9.30 BBC2) is the first in a series of
three programmes about propaganda and the mass media.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Arts: A Christmas Carol - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christopher Gable has, with considerable acumen, studied the balletic
market, and identified an audience need. That need is for lively drama,
well-known themes, dance as an undemanding aspect of entertainment, and a
denial of the supposedly forbidding aspects of ballet. And this is what he
has very astutely set his company, Northern Ballet Theatre, to provide.
There is no call for critical sniffiness when faced with such populist
tactics. Mr and Mrs Smith enjoy Eldorado, Richard Clayderman, Jeffrey
Archer's writings and the umpteenth revival of Sound of Music, and their
lives are made happier thereby. Why not, then, ballets whose appeal is as
immediate? That, in the process, an art can be reduced to its lowest common
denominators is no news.
Comment is necessary when, as with last week's Swan Lake, a major work is
transmogrified for the unlikely cause of 'poetic truth', and a critic is
entitled to carp. But what Gable offers with the Christmas Carol receiving
its London premiere this week, is solid, jolly entertainment. I may deplore
Massimo Moricone's deadly choreography for A Christmas Carol, as for NBT's
Romeo, yet Gable's company works with enthusiasm, touches its public's
heart, and the staging is expertly done.
A Christmas Carol boasts a cast-iron title, sentiment, and the best of
plots. Its theme invites - and, by Heaven, it gets - a score from Carl Davis
replete with carols everyone knows - and would probably like to hum-along
with. The cast sing them, and there can't be a dry eye in the house when
Tiny Tim gives us 'How far is it to Bethlehem'. To the staging's great
credit, the narrative is everywhere responsive to the original. And it
boasts, in Lez Brotherstone's design, a dazzling and imaginative re-creation
of Scrooge's world. The stage picture is on two levels - an upper walk
offering something like High Holborn, with a distant foggy prospect of St.
Paul's. Below, scenery opens out to show us Scrooge's counting house, the
Cratchit home, and every locale specified by Dickens. Costuming is no less
apt. On these terms alone, the production is a huge success, and
Brotherstone's work notably fine.
What Gable has done is no less remarkable. The story is surely told, vivid,
and aimed straight at the heart - as Dickens alone knew how. (Ah, the tiny
abandoned crutch on the stair; and Ho-ho, the Cratchit family preparing to
feast upon a well-developed starling). The dance is mere chit-chat of steps,
and at moments - a solo for Christmas Past; a duet for the Young Scrooge and
his lost love - numbingly awkward. Carl Davis' score, when it departs from
traditional tunes, is brash, to say the least. To say the most, it is
efficient. But A Christmas Carol does not pretend to be a ballet - in the
sense that another populist work, David Bintley's Hobson's Choice, relies
upon choreographic means alone for its attraction and its dramatic effects.
Gable proposes a form of music-theatre for dancers, of ingratiating and
unrelenting emotionalism, in which song, dance, mimetic drama all have a
part. The piece's flaw is that Scrooge (well taken by Jeremy Kerridge) is
not interesting enough as a peg on which to hang the staging. Christmas
itself is the hero, pervasive in Dickens, but unfocussed as an excuse for
dance-drama. Of course, A Christmas Carol may worry purists - though Lez
Brotherstone's triumphant designs should be seen by anyone interested in the
theatre. But Mr and Mrs Smith will love it.

PETER'S FRIENDS (15) Kenneth Branagh
SNEAKERS (12) Phil Alden Robinson
LONDON FILM FESTIVAL
Peter's Friends is The Cherry Orchard crossed with The Big Chill and set
deep in 'Loves, darlings]' country. As his five best friends from university
converge on Peter's place in reel one - Peter is Stephen Fry, his place is
his late Dad's stately home - one fears a nuclear explosion of chumminess.
'Pe-ter, Pe-ter, Pee-tah]' screams Emma Thompson's ageing flower child:
hug-hug, kissy-kissy goes everyone else (Kenneth Branagh, Hugh Laurie,
Imelda Staunton, Alphonsia Emmanuel); and the whole cast is in danger of
being embraced to death before crossing the front doormat.
One is surprised the film was not called The Big Meltdown and set to songs
by Ivor Novello or the Cambridge Boating Club. In the event it was directed
by Kenneth Branagh, co-written by American comedienne Rita Rudner with her
husband Martin Bergman, and the main music you hear is gusts of audience
laughter punctuating the tie-in 1980s hits.
This is the old story about the reunion that sows disunion. Gathered into
the bosom of the past - they have not met since giving a disastrous cabaret
before Peter's pater ten years before - the old friends start shucking off
their new relationships. Branagh's Hollywood wife Rita Rudner is a
pixie-faced health freak sent packing by well-wined British sodality.
Sex-mad Miss Emmanuel loves and loses her two-week Lothario Tony Slattery.
And of course the only ex-varsity pair married to each other (Laurie and
Staunton) overcome the emotional scars of a recent bereavement - a twin that
died soon after birth - to deepen their union.
We cringe at the message these subplots spell: better the buddies of our
youth than the interchangeable bedmates of mature years. Such youthist
twaddle would have us all leaping back into our university photo albums
crying 'Where did we go wrong?' But at best Peter's Friends is better than
its message. Indeed it is like one of those coach trips where though the
guide keeps asking you to look out of the right window you find just as many
interesting things on the left.
Each character is allowed his or her moment of sublime crack-up followed by
(even better) the dustclouds of the ridiculous. Love-smitten Slattery breaks
off with his wife by phone; then, rebuffed by Emmanuel, frantically rings
his young son back to mediate a reconciliation. Rudner sits in her bedroom
baring her sense of social exclusion - 'I'm stuck down there with the cast
of Masterpiece Theatre' - then hops down to the pantry hours later to pig
out on dinner leftovers. And Branagh has a glorious scene of drunken venom
followed by a mazy, equally glorious aria of drunken apology.
If it is not Chekhov it is a good English equivalent. And if it is not The
Big Chill - well, actually it is better than The Big Chill. Lawrence
Kasdan's influential comedy of reunited thirtysomethings was stiff with
statements about the Meaning Of The 1960s. Peter's Friends, when not
corseting itself with overemphatic nostalgia, is lithe with non-didactic
charm. It also marks the point at which an entire mini-generation of TV
comics - Fry, Laurie, Slattery - make their convincing jump into straight
acting under the Svengali tutelage of K. Branagh.
'People hire you to break into their places to make sure people can't break
into their places?' asks the bank clerk in Sneakers. 'Yes' says Robert
Redford's winning smile.
After nurses and welfare workers, the most useful people in the world are
minor characters who tell us what the main characters are up to. In Phil
Alden Robinson's hi-tech caper Redford leads a group of professional
computer hackers hired by a dubious government agency to find a vital black
box. This McGuffin - as Hitchcock dubbed any object custom-made to be fought
over in a movie - gives its owner tap-in power over everything from banks to
air traffic control to government departments. Soon it is leading the cast
Pied Piper-style through a maze of fraud, murder, espionage and world
domination plans: these last hatched by - whom else when we need
burning-eyed monomania? - Ben Kingsley.
You could call Sneakers a Peter's Friends for plot-mad Hollywood. Redford
and his team of fellow forty/fiftysomethings Sidney Poitier, Dan Aykroyd and
David Strathairn - with River Phoenix as token youngster and Mary McDonnell
as token moll - are 1960s survivors in search of a 1990s mission. The Cold
War is over, but the catarrh of conspiracy delirium lingers: allowing
Robinson and co-scenarists Lawrence Lasker and Walter F. Parkes (who penned
that seminal computer caper WarGames) to make Sneakers a delicious
postmodern parody of films like Three Days Of The Condor and The Parallax
View.
This is a world with no easy international enmities to concentrate the mind,
and no easy utopias in technology itself. The best scenes show the thrill
and the fallibility of the hi-tech age: an earpiece-prompted scam by Redford
that gets hilariously out-of-sync, a heist that defies every security system
but human error, a 'perfect getaway' in which the only available driver is a
blind man.
If Robinson's last comedy-elegy to a world of vanished ideals, Field Of
Dreams, was a mixed artistic crop - part wry, part corn - Sneakers is all
crackling shoots of irony, grown from the fertile ground of pre-millennial
anxiety. And no one handles the ironic mode better than Redford: the cocked
quizzicality, the lightning tics of despair or self-deprecation, the sense
of a golden boy lost in the engulfing glitter of another techno-dawn.
The 36th London Film Festival pounds on. Are you attending as regularly as
you should be? If not, the coming week may tempt you with its rollercoasting
programme of new and old, domestic and exotic films. The range is from 1990s
Hong Kong melodrama (Stanley Kwan's Actress) to 1940s Hollywood musical (On
The Town in pristine print) via American independents (Susan Seidelman),
prize-winning Italian neo-realism (Gianni Amelio's The Stolen Children),
Siggraph computer animation and collector's-piece Tinseltown documentary
(Music For The Movies: Bernard Herrman).
All movie life is here, and some human life to go with it. Personal
appearances are promised from actor Nicolas Cage and directors Alan Rudolph
and J. Lee Thompson.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Arts: French singers on song - Saint-Etienne Massenet
festival - Andrew Clark on Esclarmonde, Griselidis and La Terre Promise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone with the slightest acquaintance of music-making in France knows that
the provincial cities, rather than Paris, now provide the best opportunity
to hear French artists in their native repertoire. Indeed, a visit to a city
like Saint-Etienne, which has just staged its second Massenet Festival,
offers a valuable corrective to the widely-held view that France's stock of
native talent has run dry. Here was a plentiful supply of French singers -
polished and presentable if not of glamorous international renown - doing
honour to their country's musical heritage, distinguished by a linguistic
understanding and tonal authenticity that one hears only in France.
At first sight, Saint-Etienne is the most unlikely place for a festival.
Traditionally overshadowed by nearby Lyon, it is stuck on a road to nowhere
at the edge of the Massif central, and has lately become a victim of
disappearing industries and high unemployment. The Massenet Festival -
celebrating the composer who turned his back on his birthplace as soon as he
could - is just one plank in Saint-Etienne's ambitious regeneration
programme. The city (pop. 250,000) spends 12 per cent of its budget on
culture, one of the highest in Europe. The local taxpayer foots two-thirds
of the festival's FFr12m (Pounds 1.4m) costs, with much of the rest coming
in sponsorship from France Telecom and a deal with Koch-Schwann that enables
festival productions to be commercially recorded.
Perhaps mindful of the sad fate of the Berlioz Festival in Lyon in the
1980s, the organisers have settled for a biennial event. This year's
programme, marking the 150th anniversary of the composer's birth, consisted
of a staging of Esclarmonde, concert performances of Griselidis and the
oratorio La Terre Promise, a symphonic concert, a song recital and a
musicological conference. The Esclarmonde was in need of reappraisal.
Written shortly after Manon for the young American soprano Sibyl Sanderson
(by whom Massenet was apparently besotted), it tells the unlikely tale of a
veiled princess whose use of magical powers to catch the man of her fancy
nearly backfires. The work has been seldom revived, and received a critical
drubbing after the Covent Garden performances with Joan Sutherland in 1983.
At Saint-Etienne, I found myself admiring it in isolated sections: the
dainty ceremonial choruses, the delicate brilliance of Esclarmonde's
incantation 'Esprits de l'air]', the gently swelling lyricism of the love
scenes, the simple woodwind melody introducing the final act. Everything is
impeccably crafted - but the music rambles.
Saint-Etienne provided the kind of special sympathy which a non-foolproof
opera needs. On the surface, Esclarmonde is a vehicle for a prima donna, an
invitation to operatic spectacle - but to judge by this staging, it works
best in an intimate framework, with a cast of equals. Disciplined by the
needs of a touring production (to be shown at the Opera-Comique in Paris
later this month and then in Palermo and Genoa), the film director Claude
d'Anna kept the action fluent and small-scale, offering no psychological
insights but resisting the temptation to send up or blow up the far-fetched
workings of the plot. Giantito Burchiellaro's stylised Byzantine designs -
matched by Ivan Stefanutti's graceful, low-key costumes - consisted of
little more than a drop cloth and two net side-panels, with a moonlit blue
seascape for the mysterious isle of Act II.
This fidelity to the work's dramatic essentials found an echo in the pit:
Saint-Etienne's talented young music director, Patrick Fournillier, proved
once again a dextrous interpreter of Massenet's music, allowing air into the
warm choral and orchestral textures, shaping and balancing the music
faultlessly. The instrumental timbre of the Franz Liszt Symphony Orchestra
(sharing the festival workload with the Nouvel Orchestre de Saint-Etienne)
may not be authentically French, but it brought out the Wagnerian influence
in Massenet's brass writing and played with a discipline which few French
orchestras achieve.
The Italian soprano Denia Gavazzeni - Mazzola was the only non-French member
of the cast. Her slim, agile Esclarmonde looked youthful and made musical
sense of Massenet's vocal decorations. Bernard Lombardo was sweet-voiced but
androgynous in the tenor part of Roland. Jean-Philippe Courtis was a
commanding Emperor, ably supported in smaller roles by Christian Poulizac,
Guy Gabelle and Helene Perraguin (whose recital the next day, marred by her
gauche platform manner and peremptory accompanist, revealed a mezzo of
considerable potential).
Courtis turned up again as a towering, nimble-footed Devil in Griselidis
giving such a graphic, richly-nuanced performance that one momentarily
forgot this was a concert. In the regrettably short baritone and tenor
roles, Didier Henry and Jean-Luc Viala sang with the inspiration and ardour
of mature youthfulness. In the title role - one of Massenet's most bland
characters - Michele Command was elegance personified, expertly supported
again by Fournillier and a chorus imported from Lyon. In the early 1980s,
Wexford proved that Griselidis is alive with drama: it seemed a pity
Saint-Etienne's resources did not stretch to a staging.
For La Terre Promise (1900), composed in memory of Ambroise Thomas, the
festival moved from the charmless modern Maison de la Culture to the
neatly-proportioned Grand'Eglise. Here again, one was struck by the
effortless directness of Massenet's vocal writing, and the skill with which
the Saint-Etienne chorus and three young soloists - Laurent Naouri, Daniel
Galves-Vallejo and Brigitte Lafon - delivered their parts. The oratorio
describes the journey of the Israelites past Jericho, where the tumbling of
city walls is graphically described by a choral wail and a lingering crash
of percussion, to the promised land, heralded by waves of peaceful choral
polyphony. The work lasts a concise 75 minutes and would make a handsome
alternative to the endless round of Bach Passions with which north Europe's
choral societies content themselves each year. The Saint-Etienne
performance, with the local orchestra conducted by Kurt Redel, was one of
great dignity.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Independence for the Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE ARE at a critical juncture for economic policy in this country', says
the governor of the Bank of England, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton. He is right.
The need for careful consideration of where UK economic policy should be
going is only a little less pressing than that for radical institutional
change. In yesterday's admirable lecture at the London School of Economics,
the governor provided the former and allowed others to draw conclusions for
the latter. The governor calls for price stability but does not advocate the
central bank independence needed to achieve it.
The analytical heart of the governor's speech is the case for price
stability. This he defines as has the chairman of the Federal Reserve. 'For
all practical purposes,' argued Mr Greenspan, 'price stability means that
expected changes in the average price level are small enough and gradual
enough that they do not materially enter business and household decisions.'
The governor says that 0-2 per cent inflation would be low enough.
What is clear is that inflation does not lower unemployment in the long
term. Over the last 20 years, for example, British retail prices have risen
six and a half times, while unemployment has risen in the successive
cyclical troughs from half a million in 1973 to 1.2m in 1979 and 1.6m in
1990.
Many agree that inflation serves no purpose and imposes significant costs,
but they also argue that lowering it would be too costly. Yet accepting
inflation at, say, 5 per cent seems ridiculous. Who would want a metre to
become 5 per cent shorter every year? Why should the pound?
Choice
Also, a policy of accepting a particular rate of inflation is likely to mean
in practice accepting the latest rate of inflation. This is a road to ruin.
In the governor's words, 'the simple choice is . . . between a variable and
unpredictable inflation rate caused by instability in monetary policy, and a
more stable monetary policy that delivers price stability.'
The question facing the UK authorities is how to achieve that goal. The
government needs to tie itself, like Ulysses, to the mast. But the UK had
precisely such a strategy, ERM membership, which collapsed because
disinflation was 'unduly rapid', given the asset price inflation that
preceded it. Can any alternative be credible?
The chancellor has announced a target for underlying inflation of 1-4 per
cent. Meanwhile, the governor promises to make the Bank's quarterly
inflation report 'a wholly objective and comprehensive analysis of
inflationary trends and pressures'. This is, as he says, 'a giant leap for
the authorities'. But it is not big enough for Britain.
Possible
The argument for central bank independence, combined with accountability for
the achievement of inflation targets, appears overwhelming. Some economists
object, because they envisage, instead, disinterested policy makers
manipulating all the policy levers for the greatest good of the greatest
number. They are naive. Some politicians object because they know they
cannot deliver what they have promised without the surreptitious
redistribution of income. They are dangerous.
Central bank independence is tricky in a Westminster-style democracy. But
the New Zealand example shows it is possible. What is needed is a contract,
to which the Bank can be held accountable. How this can be made to work is
discussed by Peter Nicoll and David Archer, of the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand, in one of the prize essays published this week by the American
Express Bank. The key, they claim, is discretion in achieving pre-announced
targets for inflation.
This is the kind of arrangement the UK needs. It is particularly important
when credibility is very low and the announced goal remains price stability,
but by implication stability at a significantly higher price level than
today's.
Reculer pour mieux sauter is what the governor wants the UK to do. But an
enduring failure is far more likely. Even radical institutional change may
not be enough. But with it the UK would have a chance of combining higher
prices now, with stability in the not too distant future. Without it, the UK
will have higher prices now and, almost certainly, still higher prices
later.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Struggle to spike a smoking gun: The Matrix Churchill
scandal throws light on how Whitehall departments battle for control of
policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement of an independent judicial inquiry into the Matrix
Churchill affair has for the moment defused another embarrassing situation
for the government. But present and former ministers must now be wondering
how damaging the disclosures will turn out to be when Lord Justice Scott,
known as a liberal but pragmatic judge, delivers his conclusions.
The production of 500 Whitehall documents, many carrying high security
classifications, in the collapsed court case against businessman Mr Paul
Henderson and his colleagues has already provided a substantial indication
of potential discomfort to come. The papers also provide a unique insight
into the mechanics of Whitehall policy formulation. The episode will,
according to Peter Hennessey, professor of contemporary history at Queen
Mary College and a specialist on Whitehall, unquestionably prove to be a
locus classicus on ministerial and official behaviour.
The basic charge against ministers is that they colluded to break the
government's own guidelines on the sale of defence-related equipment to
Iraq; and that the relaxed attitude to the sale of so-called dual-use
equipment (which can have both civil and military applications) to Iraq
could have resulted in that equipment being used against British troops in
the Gulf war.
Certainly the documents revealed to the court, in the course of the case
brought against the former directors of machine-tool maker Matrix Churchill
by Customs &amp; Excise, suggest that the Whitehall machine was duplicitous.
While an inter-departmental committee appears to have wrestled tortuously
with the pros and cons of granting or revoking export licences for Matrix
Churchill's potential exports to Iraq, individual minutes by senior
officials convey a rather different impression.
One of the more striking is a note by Mr Michael Blackley of the Foreign &amp;
Commonwealth Office (FCO) Middle Eastern Department in January 1988, when
the Iran-Iraq war was still some months from its end. Whitehall had just
learned from intelligence sources that Matrix Churchill's machine tools were
being used to manufacture munitions at the Nasser and Huteen industrial
complexes in Iraq.
Part of Blackley's comment reads: 'I accept the recommendation that the
licences should for the moment not be revoked, but if it becomes public
knowledge that the tools are to be used to make munitions, deliveries would
have to stop at once. Once the UN arms embargo is adopted they will probably
have to stop. The companies should be warned of the falling guillotine and
urged to produce and ship as fast as they can.'
That implies that deceit was an essential element of the whole approach, at
least at official level. And it smacks more of opportunistic realpolitik
than enthusiastic adherence to the government's guidelines, announced in
revised form in the House of Commons in October 1985. These prohibited the
sale of any defence-related equipment that could significantly enhance the
capability of either side to prolong or exacerbate the war. But was deceit
so reprehensible in the circumstances at the time?
If the Foreign Office had concluded that it was in Britain's interests to
bolster the potential military capability of the country generally perceived
to be the weaker party in the war in order to maintain a stalemate, a policy
of non-disclosure would have minimised the fall-out for relations with a
highly dangerous power, Iran.
Officials appear also to have believed initially that revocation of the
licences might have bankrupted Matrix Churchill. And by helping keep in
business the company, which was majority-owned by representatives of the
Iraqi state and part of the Iraqi procurement network, Whitehall was
maintaining a source that might have provided much more valuable information
about the crucially important Iraqi attempt to establish a nuclear
capability.
A further reason for not revoking the export licences was that the single
intelligence source of information about the use of the machine tools for
munitions manufacture might have been compromised.
Much the same excuses could be made for ministers and officials once the
Iran-Iraq war was over. Since the maintenance of military balance was no
longer so important, it is not surprising that the Whitehall papers reveal a
shift in inter-departmental power away from the FCO in favour of the
Department of Trade and Industry. Indeed, it appears that the then trade
minister, Mr Alan Clark, who is at the centre of allegations about collusion
to breach government guidelines, responded to FCO foot-dragging over exports
to Iraq in characteristic fashion. Clark, a notorious loose cannon, appears
to have encouraged his department to license Matrix Churchill's exports
before obtaining the endorsement of the FCO, thereby bouncing the diplomats
into a retrospective endorsement.
Meanwhile, Mr William Waldegrave, then minister of state at the FCO, stated
in a letter to Mr Clark in April 1989 'that we should continue to interpret
the guidelines more flexibly in respect of Iraq' - an unpublicised policy
change that took place in late 1988. The political background, including
Iran's hostile role in the Salman Rushdie affair, was specifically cited as
a reason for the pro-Iraqi bias. The letter went on to suggest these weasel
words for parliamentary use: 'The guidelines on the export of defence
equipment to Iran and Iraq are kept under constant review and are applied in
the light of prevailing circumstances, including the ceasefire and
developments in the peace negotiations.'
Once again, a hard-headed observer might wonder whether this was really so
shocking. Disclosure of a policy that discriminated against Iran would still
have been potentially very damaging to British interests. And the fact that
none of the Whitehall documents released to the court carries any hint that
civil servants had worries about a breach of guidelines, or wished to flag
their dissent, leaves open the possibility that no one in Whitehall thought
twice about the issue.
The sale of dual-use equipment has long been the subject of debate in
Whitehall, with the DTI tending to put weight on commercial interests, while
the FCO's priorities are more political. In this particular case the West
Germans and Italians, not noted for their delicacy over the sale of
defence-related equipment, were competing for the business. It is scarcely
surprising that successive trade ministers, Mr Clark and Lord Trefgarne, are
revealed in secret papers as being in favour of a more emollient approach to
exports to Iraq.
But in the final analysis realpolitik arguments have to stand up to the test
of success or failure. And in this case success is hard to perceive.
Whether, for example, the intelligence that subsequently emerged via Matrix
Churchill was of any value seems questionable.
For a start, Mr Paul Henderson seems to have been a remarkably amateur spy,
who cheerfully admits to having served MI6 for a long time before he
recognised the extent of the risks he was running. Having been instructed by
his control to write nothing down and to memorise all telephone numbers, he
recorded the numbers against fictitious names that he invented because his
memory was poor. This looks potentially deadly for anyone at the other end
of the line - an extraordinary gaffe, given the fact that Henderson reported
to a chairman who was himself a high-ranking Iraqi intelligence officer.
Perhaps MI6 felt the risks were acceptable when Iraq appeared to be close to
achieving nuclear capability and intelligence was thus at a premium. But in
the absence of conclusive evidence, all we know for certain is that any
intelligence thus gleaned signally failed to prevent Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
In the 1980s Britain started putting its money on Saddam Hussein, in much
the same way that it had gambled on the Shah in the 1970s. In both cases,
commercial interests were given excessive weight, and the political
reporting on the spot failed to grasp the things that really mattered. The
best that can be said is that this time the FCO did at least have some
inkling of the menace of Saddam Hussein's regime, which was expressed in Mr
Waldegrave's letters to his fellow ministers; also that the prime minister,
Mrs Thatcher, expressed worries about exports to Iraq.
But only weeks before the invasion of Kuwait the MoD was calling for the
removal of export restrictions and Mr (now Lord) Ridley, Whitehall's other
and weightier loose cannon, then trade secretary, was writing a letter to
the prime minister that reads like a lament for the deterioration in
Britain's relations with Iraq.
Despite the newly discovered information about the Iraqi supergun and
Britain's recent interception of shipments of nuclear triggers and supergun
parts, Ridley expresses in his letter implicit concern about Customs &amp;
Excise investigations into exporters to Iraq. And despite the obvious signs
of the growing dangers arising from Iraqi trade, he states: 'I can see no
prospect of any improvement in the position while investigations into
possible breaches of export controls continue. On the contrary, I see a
considerable risk of further deterioration from which only our competitors
can benefit since we have no evidence that they take as restrictive a view
as we do on trade with Iraq'. Yet it should have been clear by then, even
without hindsight, that the problem was too much trade with this dangerous
regime, not too little.
The prime minister's response, and the outcome of meetings to discuss
Customs &amp; Excise investigations and to discuss a review of the policy are,
sadly, unrecorded in the court documents. Could it be that ministers
concluded that their position would look even more foolish and improper if
they sought to block the independent-minded Customs men in the legitimate
pursuit of their duty?
As for the commercial gains and losses from the episode, they were probably
negligible or worse, since the Export Credits Guarantee Department had a
Pounds 1bn exposure to Iraq, on which the Iraqis defaulted. The British
taxpayer, therefore, has had to pay a substantial bill.
But perhaps the grubbiest aspect of the saga was the readiness of four
ministers, Michael Heseltine, Kenneth Clarke, Malcolm Rifkind and Tristan
Garel-Jones, to sign public-interest immunity certificates that could have
condemned three men to jail. In this instance, ministers failed to suppress
information - the one failure for which there is reason to be grateful.

CASTRO'S FINAL HOUR By Andres Oppenheimer
Simon &amp; Schuster, Dollars 25, 462 pages
CUBA AFTER COMMUNISM By Eliana Cardoso and Ann Helwege
The MIT Press, Dollars 24.95 in Europe (Dollars 17.95 in US), 148 pages
Fidel Castro, leader of the Cuban revolution and head of one of the few
remaining hard-line communist states, is now courting foreign capitalists in
an attempt to sustain the island's economy and his grip on power.
Since the fall of his Soviet benefactors, which removed a vital source of
aid and trade, Castro's regime has struggled to find the hard currency it
needs to import food and the luxury goods required by its tourist industry.
Though it has had some success in attracting investment through joint
ventures in tourism, other initiatives have been less successful. A lack of
clear rules about property rights is one important reason.
Castro seems to think he can create islands of capitalism in a socialist
state. But seeking to encourage profit-seeking companies from abroad while
repressing local entrepreneurs is contradictory and unlikely to work, as
these two books make clear.
'Attracting capital to modernise and expand Cuba's productive capacity
requires privatisation. Joint ventures alone will not do the job. Cuba needs
more than big hotels; it needs everything from hot-dog stands to fax machine
outlets,' say Cardoso and Helwege, two US academics.
Castro's willingness to get close to foreign capitalists shows his pragmatic
nature. Expelling foreign investors was, after all, one of the tenets of his
revolution. However, he has opposed the measure that would do most to
increase Cuba's own food output: allowing smallholders to sell surplus food
at market prices.
Castro tried this in the early 1980s, but banned it again in 1986. Perhaps
the main reason for his change of heart was a fear that further development
of the market would have proved impossible for him to control.
In this respect - the preservation of control - Castro's political acumen
should not be underestimated. According to Oppenheimer, a Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist on the Miami Herald, Castro understood long before
most of his subordinates the threat posed by Gorbachev's reforms for the
Soviet Union and, by extension, for Cuba.
Castro has also been skilful in his dealings with the opposition. By
allowing opponents to leave the country, he has deprived the growing numbers
of disaffected Cubans of a focus. The vociferous right-wing exiles may think
of themselves as the country's next leaders, but they have little support
inside Cuba. For one thing, as Oppenheimer points out, Cuba is
overwhelmingly black and the exiles overwhelmingly white.
Greater equality between races was one of the achievements of Castro's
revolution. The others - good healthcare and education and reasonably fair
distribution of income - have set it apart from the rest of Latin America.
But much of this was made possible by big subsidies from the Soviet Union
and now the subsidies have gone.
Castro's Final Hour does a fine job of reporting recent developments in
Cuba, some little known until now. Oppenheimer has pieced together, for
example, the politicking behind the Fourth Communist Party Congress in 1991.
Reform-minded party members in Cuba had hoped that this would start the
process of change; instead Castro blocked reform. Since then, the Cuban
regime has become more repressive.
Cuba After Communism looks forward to what Castro could do to avoid a
violent end to his revolution and what action the world should take to
ensure a peaceful transformation in Cuba.
Both books forcefully outline Castro's dilemma. He could embrace reform
wholeheartedly, and risk losing control of the country but perhaps preserve
some social benefits of the revolution. Or he could take the course he seems
to have decided upon: make minor adjustments but allow no big change to the
economic structure. Both books agree this will not be enough; in all
probability, it will bring the economy closer to collapse and the revolution
to a violent denouement.
Oppenheimer's book convincingly argues that Castro's Cuba cannot survive in
its current form. However, despite its somewhat hyperbolic title, it fails
to make the case that the end is necessarily imminent.
Castro's character suggests that, anachronistic as his regime may now seem,
he is unlikely to give up. He has been in even more desperate straits. His
tiny band of 82 men was routed soon after landing in Cuba in 1956. But the
men regrouped and gradually expanded their influence. Nor are there obvious
leaders to organise a rebellion - since Castro has neutralised them - or
mechanisms through which popular discontent could be expressed.
Those who want to see Castro ousted must therefore await a spontaneous
revolt, the unlikely prospect of foreign military intervention or his death.
Castro is only 67 years old; the final hour could yet be a long one.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Italy's fight for credibility
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY STILL has a long way to travel before it can claim its fiscal problems
are solved. But as summer has turned to autumn, it has become apparent that
Prime Minister Giuliano Amato represents Italy's best hope of salvation.
September's exchange market crisis, which saw the lira limp from the
exchange rate mechanism, might have represented a mortal blow to his
government's credibility. But Mr Amato appears to have the gods on his side.
By concentrating the minds of Italy's conservative parliamentarians, it has
turned out to be a blessing in disguise.
Credibility is the key to success for any reforming Italian administration.
But that credibility must be earned by fiscal action, not by brave but
fruitless attempts to stick to unsustainable exchange rates. What Italy has
needed for some time is fiscal retrenchment combined with the promise of
more to come. That is what was missing before September 14. That is what the
Amato government has since delivered.
Exit from the ERM was, in fact, the catalyst for change. The national mood
of impending crisis, exemplified by high short-term interest rates, has
persuaded parliament that the Amato government's budget package must be
enacted. The most important third of the L93,000bn package - tackling
structural spending on health, pensions, public administration and local
government - has already been passed, while the entire combination of tax
increases and spending cuts should be through by December.
Short-term rates
If the Italian fiscal package can be made to stick, then the medium-term
outlook is moderately encouraging. Economic recovery should produce a
virtuous cycle of lower cyclical spending, higher tax revenues and a smaller
budget deficit, leading to lower interest rates on government bonds as faith
in the new-found fiscal prudence grows. In addition, the lira's 10 per cent
devaluation since early September on a trade-weighted basis means a sizeable
boost to the competitiveness of Italy's dynamic industrial base.
The problem is getting from here to the medium term. Italian short term
interest rates may have fallen by over 5 percentage points since their
September peak, but, at 14 3/4 per cent, they are still painfully high. The
impact of these high rates is already feeding through into depressed output
and rising unemployment. Nor can the Italian economy expect much help from
elsewhere. The outlook for the European economy is anything but rosy for the
year ahead.
The government must persevere. Tough fiscal consolidation is the only way to
reduce the large risk premium in Italian interest rates, while wage
restraint is essential if the competitiveness gains are not to be
squandered. But, in the short-term, these will compound the economic pain
and make the government's political task harder. Mr Amato's administration
must pale at the thought of persuading Italy's recalcitrant civil service to
implement his budget measures, including job cuts and a freeze on public
sector pay, against the background of a deteriorating economy.
ERM re-entry
Yet Europe may offer a useful crutch to keep the reform process on the road.
No one can claim that the ERM, in its current battered state, offers an easy
route to credibility, especially to indebted countries like the UK or Italy.
The risk of early re-entry is that it might become an open invitation to
currency speculators and prevent Italian short-term interest rates from
falling as far as the Bank of Italy might like. But German short-term
interest rates, now 5 percentage points lower than Italy's, are not likely
to constitute a constraint on Italian monetary policy anytime soon, while
the risk of speculation is lower today than in the early weeks of the Amato
administration when the lira was overvalued.
ERM re-entry at the current rate, combined with a credible fiscal package,
might even make it easier for Italian interest rates to fall without pushing
the lira down. Most important, ERM membership is the most available signal
of Italy's European commitment. Without the EC, Italy's reform process might
not have come this far. For the Italian state, it remains the best insurance
against political collapse and hyperinflationary suicide.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Letter: Education in need of fewer new initiatives and more
stability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SERGE LOURIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Adonis is correct to warn that the new Education Bill could
reduce the independence of state schools ('Classroom reform fails the
freedom test', November 9).
As chairman of the governing body of a comprehensive school in the London
Borough of Richmond, I have watched a never-ending stream of government
initiatives, many inconsistent or contradictory, creating enormous amounts
of work for teachers at the cost of preventing them from concentrating on
teaching.
We have taken responsibility for a devolved budget of more than Pounds 2m
and made major improvements at the school, proving that local management for
schools (LMS) works. However, the governing body remains very suspicious of
opting out to grant maintained status (GMS) because of the many
imponderables. We have always received a good service from the local
education authority and would be reluctant to change, especially because of
the lack of clarity of what GMS actually means.
There are two main areas of concern, one organisational and one financial.
Clearly the proposed funding agency will consist of unelected officials who
will be difficult to influence. There would well be a centralised
bureaucracy like the Department of Education which will be remote.
The financial difficulties are also significant as there is no way in which
the level of education spending nationally is going to be increased and the
bribes being offered to opting out schools cannot be sustained.
What schools now need is a period of stability rather than the constant
change of the past five years.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Learn from Keynes but don't be a parrot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many years ago a reader wrote to the Financial Times to say that it was a
revealing reflection on the would-be scientific standing of economics that
exponents of rival theories thought it important to find chapter and verse
for their views in Keynes - which they always can for, like most such
figures, he said a great many things. Can one imagine the protagonists in a
controversy in physics trying to advance their views by showing that they
were implicit in some obscure passage in Einstein, and their opponents
replying either that this was a misunderstanding or that it was all said
better by Isaac Newton (the Adam Smith of physics)?
Yet I have been enjoying Robert Skidelsky's John Maynard Keynes, Volume II;
The Economist as Saviour, 1920-37 (Macmillan, Pounds 20). Like the first
volume, it is a good read and brings together history, biography, analysis
and reflections. Unlike too many other writers on Keynes, Skidelsky supports
some form of liberal capitalism; so I can be stimulated by the occasional
disagreement without having to get into intellectual battle dress.
There are also striking parallels between today's problems and those of the
interwar period, but equally important differences. An example of both is
shown on the chart. The similarities are the very high rates of unemployment
 -although even here depression-mongers who quote crude numbers out of work
overlook both population growth and the increase in workforce participation
rates.
But of course the biggest discrepancy is in the behaviour of prices.
Interwar consumer prices reached a peak in 1920. After that the price level
 -not just the rate of inflation - was on a falling trend. Thus in some
respects Keynes had a much easier task than present-day advisers. For he
could concentrate on fighting one evil - depression. Recent policymakers
have had to contend with two evils - unemployment and inflation - pulling
them in opposite directions. More fundamentally, we have learnt something
'about the pathology of governments' since Keynes.
Indeed, the net impact of this biography is likely to be to reduce the
exaggerated role so often given to the 1936 General Theory. Skidelsky
obviously has a soft spot for the Treatise on Money, a rambling earlier work
repudiated by card-carrying Keynesians, but perhaps more relevant to
capitalism for most of its history.
The relevance of Keynes today is that, after many false alarms, we really
may face a danger of deficient demand, that is, total spending in money
terms not increasing fast enough for reasonable growth at a low rate of
inflation. Keynes did assume, more often than not, that in such
circumstances any boost to spending must take the form of infrastructure
investment.
In 1928 he wrote in support of the Lloyd George Yellow Book: 'When we have
unemployed men and unemployed plant and more savings than we are using at
home, it is utterly imbecile to say that we cannot afford these things (a
programme of national development).' Skidelsky adds: 'The whole subsequent
history of the Keynesian revolution was not able to improve substantially on
this rationale for state action to get an economy out of depression.'
Keynes had moral and aesthetic reasons for favouring public investment. He
envisaged a time when productive capacity would reach its maximum, the
economic problem would be solved, and people left free to concentrate on
higher matters; and he wanted a crash programme to accelerate this glad day.
He also envisaged rebuilt British cities as noble beacons to the world.
Are there more prosaic reasons why a demand boost should take a fiscal form
at all rather than a credit stimulus? And even if the boost has to be
fiscal, why can it not be tax cuts to finance consumption?
What is wrong with Peter Jay's idea of a two months' holiday from VAT or
income tax, which would inject Pounds 16bn into households (The Independent,
November 10)? As Jay remarks, even if the beneficiaries used their windfall
to repay debt, this would bring forward the time at which they felt secure
enough to resume normal spending. The net effect is that the government
would take over some of the personal sector's indebtedness.
Instead, the government is flying kites about a tax increase in the guise of
higher National Insurance contributions, which can only depress personal
spending power and which non-doctrinal common sense suggests should be
postponed until economic recovery. Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they
first make mad.
The sound, but probably temporary, reason for giving a demand boost a fiscal
emphasis is that an all-out drive for very low interest rates would risk
putting sterling under even greater downward pressure than it is already,
which could feed back into inflation even at today's depressed level of
activity. Last month's import price rise is a warning.
If the Bundesbank decides to pull out the anti-recession stops and go for
cheap money, then the UK should do the same and go back to long-term fiscal
guidelines. But we cannot leap too far ahead and would not do so even if
Kenneth Baker (the Eurosceptic Pretender) were premier.
Within fiscal policy, some of the reasons for favouring public spending over
tax cuts are perverse. Increased personal spending is supposedly more likely
to go into imports - which would help other countries to fight recession,
just as their tax cuts would help the UK. There is also the weak presumption
that public investment will stimulate supply potential as well as demand, so
that it would not be wasted even if the demand boost does not work or is
mistimed.
My main reason for limited acquiescence in the infrastructure fashion is
that it pays to bend to the mood of the times when no great evil is
involved. Since Keynes's time public works have become more respectable,
while reigning puritanical opinion is likely to think tax cuts a sign that
'governments have gone mad'.
Moreover, despite the many millions of words which have been written since
Keynes's time, we are not really much wiser about how much a budget deficit
matters in times of economic slack or how the relevant deficit should be
defined. There is therefore a case for minimising the government's so-called
'current deficit', if that will slightly reassure domestic business or
international financial opinion
A modern New Deal should be compatible with different theoretical models of
the economy rather than be too dependent on any one being true. The more I
think about it, the more this makes sense of many - although not all of -
Keynes's multifold policy zig-zags. The search for the one true Keynesian
model is a wild goose chase, even though it was one in which the Master
sometimes indulged himself.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Letter: GATT negotiators would do better to talk of feeding
Third World
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RAYMOND GELY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Dodwell's article, 'Trade war - what it means to you' (November
7), prompts me to raise a few more questions on the matter.
Mr Dodwell rightly mentions that, as far as oilseeds are concerned, the US
is the world's largest OECD producer - accounting for 63m tonnes out of a
world production of 86m tonnes and the world's biggest exporter, selling
over 18m tonnes while the EC is the world's biggest importer (14m tonnes
last year).
Do I understand that we have to accept that the US could export even more to
Europe or we would face 'sanctions'? Does it really mean that the Americans
would demand an even greater share of the world trade in that agricultural
sector, which in fact would lead to a quasi-monopoly? I learned on many
different occasions that the American or European liberals were always
strongly against trusts or monopolies.
How is it that they changed their views so drastically on this occasion?
I also wonder if the supporters of free trade feel very happy and
comfortable in promoting a policy of desertification of Europe when hundreds
of millions of people are suffering from malnutrition all around the world
and hundreds of thousands of them - mostly children - are now dying of
starvation in Africa?
Don't you think that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiators
 -who have worked for six years already without reaching a trade agreement -
would have achieved a better end by trying to organise on a world basis the
ways and means of transferring the American and European food surplus to the
famished population of the Third World?
How is it that the governments of the rich countries to which we belong are
fighting each other on economic grounds and are not ashamed of leaving to
charity or private organisation the greater obligations we have in the world
of to-day, which is feeding the world population?

<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'CBI obfuscation' (November 10), takes us to task on two
points. First, you argue of our national manufacturing council report that
'the overwhelming impression created is that government action is both the
primary cause and cure for industry's weakness'.
We had not intended to create that impression, and hoped that by saying, in
paragraph 2 of the report, 'The primary responsibility for winning
internationally rests with UK industry', we had avoided it . Certainly your
point is well understood here.
Second, you appeal for an employers' organisation 'with the courage to tell
its members and their employees that they should put profits and investment
before increases in wages and executive salaries'. I agree, which is why, in
my speech to the conference, I described the 1967 devaluation experience and
said that what was needed to avoid a recurrence was 'tight control of wages
in the private sector as well as the public. Settlements have fallen rapidly
in the last two years but are still running at around 4.5 per cent. The
challenge now is to push on down below that'.
I went on to point out that 'senior management pay, too, has been 'sticky
downwards'' and emphasised the 'duty on management to respond to the
market-place and to the need to ensure that our economy is well-balanced and
delivers prosperity for all out people'.
Since those sentiments accord quite closely with your own I found it odd
that you did not report them.

Sir, The last sentence in your last paragraph of your leader, 'The Matrix
case' (November 10), tells in effect the whole story of this debacle. You
realise now that as a supporter of the Common Market you have to behave like
your partners do - put your country first and forget your high principles.
It is also the reason why people like Alan Clark, the former trade minister,
are of the right calibre to deal in our negotiations, as he has exactly the
same attitude as have all our European partners. There were considerably
more machine tools from the US, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and France used
in the Iraq factories, although they all subscribed to the UN arms embargo
and no fuss was made in these countries about their involvement, which was
taken for granted.
Because of the internecine fight between government departments and the
behaviour of our MPs, things have come out which would have been better left
unsaid. This is the tragedy of it all and responsibility for this lies
fairly and squarely with Civil Service intellectuals and MPs, both
categories being completely devoid of any common sense.

Sad to hear that Culicoides impunctatus, the super-midge whose bites are the

The government has squashed tourist industry proposals to support the
introduction of two of the midge's deadly enemies - the oddly-named
Natterer's bat and a red mite - into the Highlands. The plan was that these
exotic predators would devour the midges.
However, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, the Scottish Office minister, has told
the House of Lords that the Natterer's bat 'would probably have to consume a
considerable number of midges before it had a substantial high tea'. More
worrying was what the bat would eat when the offending midges were not in

Canada's Conrad Black, the new boy on the Australian newspaper block, may be
bending over backwards not to upset the locals, but rival Rupert Murdoch's

No sooner had Black demonstrated his love for local journalists by rehiring
a couple of old Fairfax hands to edit two of his Fairfax flagships, than a
rogue columnist on his newly acquired Australian Financial Review attacks
the changes.
Peter Robinson, a Review columnist and former editor, says the episode is
part of a wider effort to bring Fairfax into line with the 'rougher culture'
favoured by Murdoch and fellow media tycoon, Kerry Packer.
Having spiked Robinson's column, the Review's new editor was somewhat
surprised to see it appear in the Murdoch-owned Australian, the country's
leading national daily. Students of media studies will remember that this is
not the first time the Murdoch camp has tried to embarrass Black.
Not so long ago a memo from Black's Daily Telegraph management in London
detailing the alleged shortcomings of the Fairfax team fell into the hands
of Murdoch's men and was published at length.
Expect more of the same.

Observer hears that Matrix Churchill's involvement in retooling Saddam
Hussein's war machine was not confined to supplying high-tech machine tools.
A gold-plated, pearl-handled pistol was ordered from Asprey's, the Queen's
jewellers in New Bond Street, and was dispatched to the then Iraqi minister
of military industry, Hussein Kamel, who is Saddam's cousin and married to
his favourite daughter. Asprey's 'highly decorated' handguns can cost as
much as Pounds 35,000 although a boxed pair of Browning pistols with gold
inlay can be picked up for a mere Pounds 17,000.
Whether Kamel took delivery of the Matrix gift is unclear, but it sounds as
if he already has plenty of pistols.
Crescent Petroleum, which produces oil from an offshore field in the Gulf,
bought him an Asprey's pistol a couple of years ago. It reached Baghdad
airport just before the invasion of Kuwait.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Observer: Advising the advisers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Michael Heseltine really wants to put his own stamp on the Department of
Trade and Industry should he really imitate his predecessor Lord Young by
hiring a deregulation adviser to tackle yet more red tape?
Heseltine's ministry was supposed to be different.
It is over 13 years since a Conservative administration committed to
improving efficiency and eliminating waste in government was first elected,
and over seven years since the first of Lord Young's white papers entitled
'Lifting the burden'.
This led to the setting-up of an advisory panel on deregulation filled with
hard-headed business types and currently headed by Slough Estates' Sir Nigel
Mobbs.
Now Hezza has hired Lord Sainsbury as part of a 'renewed campaign' to tackle
the 'burden of red tape' imposed on business. His role will be
'complementary' to that of Sir Nigel's panel. It sounds like the authorities
are suffering from a surfeit of 'red tape' advisers.
Lord Sainsbury is an excellent businessman. During his 23 years as chairman
of the Sainsbury supermarket chain, profits rose from Pounds 4m to Pounds
628m and market share more than quadrupled.
He is not the sort of person to be taken in by government gimmick. Perhaps
he is being spurred on by the thought that he can do a better job advising
government on how to cut waste than did his old rival Lord Rayner, the
former chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer? After all there is not a lot of love
lost between Britain's two premier retailers and Sainsburys overtook M&amp;S in
terms of sales during Lord Sainsbury's time at the helm.
That said, there has to be a limit to how far an analysis of how to cut red
tape by even Britain's best-run retailers can help the understanding of the
rest of British industry. Supermarket chains with captive domestic markets
do not have to worry about breaking into export markets, for example.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Kohl and Major united over EC integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY and Britain closed ranks on EC integration yesterday after a summit
meeting that patched up recent quarrels between London and Bonn.
Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, declared his confidence that Britain
would ratify the Maastricht treaty in the first half of 1993.
In contrast to President Francois Mitterrand of France, who on Monday
criticised the British delay, Mr Kohl said he understood the UK's reasons
for postponing Maastricht's passage through parliament.
During a press conference with Mr John Major, the prime minister, at
Ditchley Park, Oxfordshire, Mr Kohl repeatedly referred to 'my friend John'.
Underlining that he 'respected' the British view on Maastricht, he said: 'If
they need a bit more time, it's no reason to get excited.'
Mr Kohl said he hoped that negotiations on EC enlargement to include members
of the European Free Trade Association could start, on schedule, at the
beginning of next year.
On the four-nation European fighter aircraft, which has been dogged by
rising costs and German opposition, Mr Kohl said he wanted 'a common
European solution' for the project's future. British officials interpreted
this as a sign that Germany would, after all, go ahead with EFA, but with a
lighter, cheaper model.
Mr Major said he believed an agreement was possible on the basis of a recent
report from the aerospace industry in the four countries showing that costs
could be cut 'very substantially'.
Mr Kohl added that a compromise on EFA was 'a precondition for an efficient
European aerospace industry'.
Mr Major appeared particularly pleased at Mr Kohl's understanding for his
domestic political difficulties over Maastricht.
However, the prime minister remained ambiguous about the exact timing of
ratification.
Mr Major hinted that the committee stage for the Maastricht bill could
continue beyond May next year. But he did not rule out British ratification
before a second Danish referendum on the treaty later next year.
German officials said Mr Kohl was unusually relaxed yesterday. 'He likes
Major', one noted.
However, Mr Kohl refused to answer a question over whether Germany had
offered Britain the chance of a formal sterling devaluation within the
European Monetary System in September.
German officials have suggested that this would have prevented the
speculative EMS flare-up and Britain's dramatic exit from the exchange rate
mechanism.
'You and I can write about this when we are in retirement,' the chancellor
quipped.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Lautro imposes record fine on Guardian Royal Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAUTRO, the life assurance regulator, yesterday fined Guardian Royal
Exchange Pounds 100,000, the biggest penalty it has yet imposed.
GRE, a composite insurer, had failed to monitor two agents tied to selling
its life products exclusively, Centrust and Coventry Investment Group, in
the three years to February 1991. Both companies are now out of business,
and investors are claiming compensation. The proprietor of Coventry
Investments, Mr John Steel, received a 2 1/2 -year prison sentence for
misappropriation of investors' funds. Centrust's proprietor, Mr Jake
Reynolds, was arrested in Cromer, Norfolk, on Tuesday. He is being
interviewed by police in Norwich and has not been charged.
Lautro's previous highest fine, of Pounds 80,000, was levied last week on
London &amp; Manchester Assurance, also for problems monitoring its tied agents.
However, Ms Julia Liesching, Lautro's chief policy and administration
officer, denied that there had been any toughening of the regulator's
stance. She said that procedures had been improved, and the disciplinary
process had speeded up, leading to a faster resolution of cases.
Mr Peter Buckell, a spokesman for the Centrust Investors' Action Groups,
said he was pleased the fine had been levied, but disappointed Lautro had
not used its power to demand that compensation be paid to investors. He also
regretted that Lautro had taken so long to act. A group of Centrust
investors would take legal action against GRE, he said.
Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy for the Consumers' Association,
welcomed the trend towards stiffer penalties from regulators. She said:
'Certainly Lautro is looking a lot more effective than it did a year ago.
The trend is right. Whether it is enough is another matter.' She said other
regulators had not been as strict.
GRE said yesterday: 'Major changes have been made to our control procedures
and we make great efforts to ensure that we provide appropriate monitoring
of all appointed representatives.'
It has not appointed any new tied agents for 18 months, and has cut its
total number of agents from 900 to about 500.
So far, the company has offered Pounds 164,000 in compensation to 30
Centrust clients, and another 20 claims are being processed.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Plan to announce Jubilee Line deal frustrated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT plans to announce the go-ahead for London Underground's Jubilee
Line extension as part of today's Autumn Statement have fallen through.
The future of the Pounds 1.8bn project remains uncertain because the private
sector has yet to agree terms for contributing Pounds 400m towards the cost.
Failure to win agreement is deeply embarrassing to the government which had
hoped to use the go-ahead as a centrepiece of its newly adopted growth
strategy.
This afternoon's Autumn Statement had been expected to set the scene for
increased spending on big capital projects such as the Jubilee Line as a
means of getting the economy moving.
It had also been expected to cite the project as an example of how the
private and public sectors could work together to start big infrastructure
projects.
The planned extension would run from central London through Docklands to
Stratford in east London. Some Pounds 400m of the cost was supposed to have
been paid by Olympia &amp; York, developers of the Canary Wharf project in
Docklands.
When Olympia &amp; York went into administrative receivership earlier this year,
the government stopped work on the line pending a new financing agreement
with Canary Wharf's bankers. A deal has still not been reached.
The government is expected to say today that it still hopes to proceed. The
setback is likely to be presented as a delay rather than a cancellation.
It is understood that ministers have agreed to fund the public sector's
share of construction costs as part of the current spending round, provided
the private sector contribution is forthcoming.
The delay will bitterly disappoint local authorities and businesses in east
London and Docklands. Many of them have said that a failure to proceed would
prove to be disastrous for the area.
It also jeopardises up to 12,000 jobs which London Transport says will be
created in the UK construction and supply industries if the project goes
ahead.
Police yesterday arrested two London Transport employees and a consultant
working for a company in Croydon, Surrey, in connection with an alleged
attempted Pounds 100,000 fraud involving the sale of land for the Jubilee
Line extension.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Third quarter results from Astra of Sweden yesterday are a reminder that it
is fast catching up with the giants in ulcer treatment. Around two-thirds of
Glaxo's profits come from Zantac, its market-leading ulcer drug, and
SmithKline Beecham plays a profitable second fiddle. Little wonder the
market is asking how the Pounds 5bn sector will be carved up later this
decade.
While Astra is gaining ground in Europe, it has yet to convince the US
regulators its drug is safe for a wide range of applications. With 10
similar approvals in Europe this is surely only a matter of time. SmithKline
loses its US patent in 1994. With the extra mass created by the merger, it
can ride out the decline. But cheap generic competition would be bad news
for Glaxo. More importantly, Glaxo must defend Zantac's patent in the US
courts. If it fails, sales will slump from 1995 when the current patent
expires. The next generation of ulcer drugs is promising enough, but Glaxo
is hardly likely to have them ready in time.
If the patent can be defended, the company should have enough fire-power in
ulcer treatment and elsewhere to maintain a more than respectable rate of
growth. With prospects elsewhere so bleak, Glaxo does not look unduly
expensive even on a multiple of 20 times next year's forecast earnings. On a
prospective multiple of 18 and with a growing international following,
though, Astra is starting to look cheap.

FT  12 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Siemens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The important message from Siemens is contained in the unchanged dividend,
not in yesterday's 8.9 per cent after-tax profits advance. That result may
have been marginally better than the market was expecting, but then there is
always scope to smooth the numbers, and high D-Mark interest rates will have
had a particularly beneficial effect on financial income this time.
In the absence of more specific guidance Siemens' second successive pegged
payout must be interpreted as a pessimistic sign for the future. The
problems at Nixdorf and in semiconductors obviously remain deep-rooted, even
if the haemorrhaging from computers has been staunched to some extent.
Stronger businesses such as telecommunications and medical systems could
conceivably lose some of their shine; the one if Deutsche Telekom turns into
a more cautious buyer, the other if President Clinton carries out his threat
to curb US healthcare costs. Over-riding all this is the German economic
slowdown, and the impact of a revalued D-Mark on competitiveness abroad.
There is little reason to think, however, that in the long run Siemens is
other than a proxy for the German stock market. Over five years it has
performed exactly in line; over 10 years it has underperformed by a mere 2
per cent. Deutsche Bank's downgrading yesterday of corporate earnings for
1992 and 1993 will hardly encourage the many investors who have lately
reduced their German weightings to change their minds.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HSBC's value has risen from 2 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent of the All-Share
since it joined the index in the summer. So it was no surprise to see
institutions scrambling to take advantage of yesterday's Pounds 435m share
offer. Simply accepting HSBC's paper for Midland would have left them
seriously underweight in a company whose total capitalisation is in the
process of overtaking that of BAT. Still, institutions who waited until
yesterday to make good the shortfall have done themselves no credit. The
bank has outperformed the market by some 50 per cent since July.
Latecomers can cover their embarrassment by claiming that the party does not
look quite over. Hong Kong equities have proved resilient in the face of
China's frosty response to Mr Christopher Patten's democracy proposals.
Local banking profits remain buoyant. HSBC should easily be able to earn in
excess of 50p this year which puts it on an undemanding forward multiple of
around 10.
But the glow cannot last for ever. HSBC does not need the proceeds of the
issue. Tier 1 capital will rise from a comfortable 6.4 per cent to a
supremely comfortable 6.9. The fact that it has chosen now to tuck the extra
capital away must say something about its own perception of its share price.
Once US interest rates turn, Hong Kong's economy, and therefore the
prospects for HSBC, could look distinctly different.

FT  12 NOV 92 / The lasting legacy of the Treuhand: David Marsh and Leslie
Colitt on the industrial problems that lie behind the heavy borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the Treuhandanstalt, the agency in charge of privatising industry in
former East Germany, ends its operations on schedule in 1994, it will live
on in two ways.
First, in the international capital markets, where the Treuhand, with a
Triple-A rating thanks to its government guarantee, is becoming a regular
borrower.
And second, through the legacy of partly reconstructed heavy industry that
is the agency's biggest problem in its attempt to revive the east German
economy.
In the German capital markets, the Treuhand looks set to become a prime
issuer of 10-year bonds. It made a successful DM10bn (Pounds 4bn) issue in
September, and is expected to make another of the same size around the end
of November.
The agency confirms that an understanding has been reached with the Bonn
finance ministry for the Treuhand to be a priority issuer of 10-year bonds.
The federal government has said it plans to avoid issuing 10-year federal
bonds in future, concentrating on other maturities.
The Treuhand needs the money. Even after privatising around 9,500 companies,
it still owns 3,800 companies in eastern Germany. Its priority is to sell
them off quickly, says Ms Birgit Breuel, the agency's chief executive. 'They
say abroad that the jewels have been sold out,' she says. 'But it isn't
true.'
Allowing for disposals and closures - 1,600 Treuhand companies have been
shut down - the agency aims to have only around 500 companies left by
end-1993.
The Treuhand's problem, however, lies in those that remain, including many
of the huge former state-owned Kombinate which depended on exports to the
former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. And for them, the outlook grows
bleaker by the month.
Some of these groups have found overseas partners. The former monopoly
tyremaker, Pneumant, has been rescued by the government of Iran. The deal
will secure 910 jobs out of the present 1,800 - but Pneumant had 6,000
employees in 1990, a figure which gives an idea of the Treuhand's problems.
Another successful sale is that of Werk fur Fernsehelektronik, which makes
television tubes under license from Toshiba of Japan, and has now been sold
to Samsung of Korea. The company lost DM120m on sales of DM140m last year,
but has recently installed a automated Japanese production line. Samsung has
promised to retain 800 out of the present 1,200 jobs - but the group used to
employ nearly 10,000 people.
Other Treuhand assets have fared worse. Large metal-working combines such as
Takraf, the Leipzig crane-builder, and SKET engineering in Magdeburg, have
failed to find western partners.
Krupp's recent decision not to take over the Eko steelworks at
Eisenhuttenstadt has been another setback. It has left the Treuhand with
little option but to pump in millions of D-Marks to modernise a plant which
few see as viable in the long run.
Most of the east German machine building industry in Saxony and Brandenburg
is in similar straits. West German engineering groups, facing a drop in
world demand, are not interested in acquiring additional capacity in the
east. The Treuhand is expected to keep at least the core of these companies
afloat - but at heavy cost.
This financing burden is one of the reasons for the projected sharp increase
in the Treuhand's debts, to at least DM250bn by the end of 1994. Other
factors are the cost of cleaning up the environment and covering debts
inherited from the communist regime.
The Treuhand aims to raise between DM100bn and DM130bn in bond issues to
around end-1994. These operations will be 'the main pipeline through which
we do our funding', according to Mr Paul Hadrys, Treuhand's chief financial
officer. But the agency will also be using other financing vehicles. It has
outstanding DM3bn of short-term loans from the domestic money markets and
the Euromarkets, DM9bn of commercial paper and DM24bn of borrowers' note
loans (Schuldscheine).
One problem for the agency is the general perception that Treuhand bonds are
less liquid than more established issues.
A specific handicap was the decision by the London International Financial
Futures and Options (Liffe) not to make the first Treuhand issue deliverable
into its Bund contract - the main reason why the Treuhand issue trades at a
slightly lower price than comparable Bund issues. Dealers say the yield
spread above Bunds has been as high as 24 basis points, although this week
it has been only about half that.
The Treuhand is hoping that the problem of Liffe deliverability will be
resolved before the launch of the next DM10bn issue. Even if that happens,
Treuhand bonds will not be deliverable until well into 1993.
'The Treuhand isn't quite regarded as the same as a Bund or a Unity (a bond
issued by the German Unity Fund),' according to one London bond dealer - but
he adds that, during the next few years, familiarity is expected to grow
rapidly.

FT  12 NOV 92 / GPA bank debts increase by Dollars 1.7bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA GROUP has drawn Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.1bn) on its two main banking
facilities since March 31, leading to a sharp increase in its overall
indebtedness.
This increase in the aircraft leasing group's bank debts will come as a
surprise to some of its 73 banks when they meet on November 23 in London to
hear details of its financial restructuring proposals.
GPA has two main banking facilities: a Dollars 2.17bn corporate credit
facility and a Dollars 1.19bn associated companies long-term credit
facility. In its last set of accounts, GPA said that at March 31 the company
had drawn Dollars 1.397bn from its corporate facility and Dollars 110m from
the associated companies facility.
However, leading bankers to the group said yesterday that the corporate
facility is now virtually fully drawn and the associated companies facility
is 90 per cent drawn.
GPA Group has had to increase its bank indebtedness to pay for aircraft it
has contracted to buy from manufacturers.
It also has a Dollars 325m interim financing facility, which was undrawn at
March 31. This facility has also been used, so the total increase in GPA's
indebtedness since March may approach Dollars 2bn.
Bankers are expecting GPA to ask for a deferment of principal repayments on
these three main facilities.
The Dollars 325m facility is due to be repaid in spring 1994. On the
corporate credit facility, a 'balloon payment' of 61 per cent of the
principal is due to be repaid in September 1996. Some 61 per cent of the
principal on the associated companies facility falls due a year later.
On these three main facilities, 15 international banks each have an exposure
in excess of Dollars 75m. Of these six are Japanese.
Banks with the biggest exposure include Citicorp, the US's biggest bank,
Toronto Dominion Bank of Canada and Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation
of Japan. Citicorp said its exposure was less than Dollars 250m. Swiss Bank
Corporation is also understood to have an exposure greater than Dollars
100m.
The UK banks with the biggest exposure are NatWest, with around Dollars 70m
and Barclays with less than Dollars 50m.
Bankers expect GPA to ask for waivers on its borrowing covenants which
stipulate it should maintain three financial ratios at certain levels. These
ratios are a measure of its financial strength. Bankers expect GPA to breach
these covenants because of a decline in profit projections.
A waiver of the covenant clauses would require the agreement of two thirds
of the banks.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Hongkong parent raises HKDollars 5bn

HSBC Holdings, the parent of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and the UK's Midland
Bank, yesterday surprised investors by selling 80m new shares to raise
HKDollars 5.12bn (Pounds 435.3m).
The bank said the main reason for raising the money was to repay loans made
by Hongkong Bank Limited, the Hong Kong-based banking subsidiary, to other
parts of the HSBC group. These loans had been made primarily to help the
group finance the Pounds 3.9bn acquisition of Midland Bank, completed in
June.
HSBC said Hongkong Bank would use the loan repayment proceeds to 'develop
its traditional business, particularly in the expanding economies of the
Asia/Pacific region'.
Mr Bernard Asher, one of HSBC's directors who runs its investment banking
activities, said that HSBC had always maintained higher capital levels than
many of its international competitors. It was therefore keen to raise
additional capital by selling shares when there was strong demand for them.
The issue increases HSBC's ratio of tier one or core capital, an important
measure of its financial strength, from 6.4 per cent to 6.9 per cent, well
above the internationally agreed minimum of 4 per cent.
Mr Asher said Midland Bank had been performing much as HSBC had been
expecting when it bought the bank, though he described the UK banking and
industrial climate as 'dreary'. He said that the new capital was not needed
to compensate for high loan losses at Midland.
HSBC's share price has more than doubled since the beginning of the year and
its market value now represents 2.5 per cent of the entire stock market.
Most UK investment institutions have only relatively small HSBC
shareholdings, so they have not benefited from the great share price rise.
As a result, they were keen to buy the shares and around two thirds of the
issue was placed with them.
The brokers to the deal were Cazenove and two of HSBC's own subsidiaries,
James Capel in London and Wardley James Capel in the Far East.
HSBC's sterling-registered shares rose from 561p to 565p. Its Hong Kong
Dollar shares rose from 565p to 567p. New shares of both types are being
issued.

FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: St James's Place net assets up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NET ASSETS per share at St James's Place Capital, the investment company
chaired by Lord Rothschild, rose by 5.4 per cent to 100.7p in the six months
to September 30.
The directors take the view that the company should be judged on a net asset
basis, rather than on the profit and loss account. Pre-tax profits fell to
Pounds 3.7m, against Pounds 21.6m.
The company was formed after the demerger of J Rothschild Holdings. It
operates a fund management arm and has interests in J Rothschild Assurance,
a life company, J Rothschild, Wolfensohn, a corporate finance business and a
stake in RIT Capital Partners.
The increased value of the stake in RIT was the main factor behind the
increase in net asset value over the period.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p .
RIT Capital Partners, the investment trust, reported a fully diluted net
asset value of 146.1p per share at September 30, a 3.8 per cent rise on the
year-end figure of 140.7p. Net asset value at end-September 1991 was 136.6p
per share.
RIT's biggest investment, representing 31 per cent of its net assets, is a
stake in Newmont Mining, included at 75 per cent of the market price on the
NYSE to reflect the lack of liquidity of a large block of shares - the
holding is 7 per cent of Newmont's equity.
Earnings per share were shown as 0.36p (1.58p). The shares fell 3p to 109p.

<TEXT>
BCE, Cable and Wireless's new Canadian partner, has a reputation at home as
a company which speaks softly but wields a big stick.
Formerly known as Bell Canada Enterprises - and no relation to the US Bell
telephone companies - BCE is Canada's biggest company. Its revenues could
exceed CDollars 20bn (Pounds 10.4bn) for the first time this year, and it is
the only Canadian group to have achieved earnings of more than a billion
dollars a year.
Net income in 1991 was CDollars 1.33bn, or CDollars 4.01 a share, from
revenues of CDollars 19.9bn. The 20 per cent stake in Mercury Communications
announced yesterday is expected to add between 2 and 4 cents a share to 1993
earnings.
The deal with Mercury reflects BCE's eagerness to return to its roots in the
telecommunications business after its patchy attempts at diversification
during the 1980s. A venture into real estate development was a costly
disaster, and it has retreated from investments in energy, pipelines and
publishing.
BCE retains a minority interest in TransCanada PipeLines of Calgary. Its
only other substantial investment outside telecommunications is now Montreal
Trust, a mid-size financial services group.
BCE's cash cow is Bell Canada, its wholly owned subsidiary which has a
virtual monopoly on telephone services to the 15m residents of Ontario and
Quebec.
BCE holds 53 per cent of Northern Telecom, a telephone equipment maker which
last year acquired Britain's STC. Nortel and Bell Canada share ownership of
Bell-Northern Research, an Ottawa-based telecommunications research and
development company.
Three years ago, BCE also acquired a 23 per cent stake in Videotron, the
British cable TV arm of Canada's second-biggest cable operator.
With the arrival of some fresh blood in recent years, BCE's top ranks now
include some of Canada's most respected executives. Its president, Mr Red
Wilson, is a former chief executive of Tate &amp; Lyle's Canadian operations.
BCE was the envy of many a Canadian company last month when it recruited Mr
Derek Burney, Canada's current ambassador in Washington and a former chief
of staff to Mr Brian Mulroney, the prime minister.

FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Review Panel clears Oceana
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oceana, the South African-controlled investment company, has been cleared by
the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog, over the way
it shows profits from Etam in its annual accounts.
But the action did nothing to reduce the feud between Oceana and Etam, the
fashion retailer for which it made an unsuccessful hostile bid last year.
Oceana was left with a 34.4 per cent stake in Etam, and has used equity
accounting in its accounts, which allowed it to show 34.4 per cent of the
company's profits as its own.
Equity accounting requires a shareholder to have 'significant influence'
over the company in which it has a holding. Etam says Oceana has no such
power, and complained to the Review Panel. Oceana has no board members or
co-operation agreements with Etam, and can only block special resolutions at
an annual meeting.

FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Vulnerable markets behind slip at Dunhill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DUNHILL, the luxury goods maker which owns Alfred Dunhill, Montblanc pens
and the Chloe fashion house, yesterday announced a slight fall in profits
owing to lower interest income and recession.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 30.1m in the six months to September 30. This
compared with Pounds 30.8m last time, when reduced duty-free sales in the
wake of the Gulf war hit profits.
Lord Douro, chairman, said Japan and Germany - two of the company's largest
markets - were both weak.
Turnover increased 21 per cent to Pounds 138.1m, with almost all the growth
due to acquisitions. These included fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld and
stakes in Dunhill's distributors in Japan, the US and Italy.
Operating profits increased 6.5 per cent to Pounds 21.8m.
Sales in Japan fell about 10 per cent while Germany and France, important
markets for Montblanc, looked vulnerable. However, Lagerfeld's recent Paris
shows were successful and boded well for the company's women's wear sales
next year.
Dunhill spent about Pounds 18m on acquisitions during the period and net
cash fell 'about 10 per cent' from the year-end total of Pounds 179.6m.
Lower cash balances and falling interest rates meant interest income fell
from Pounds 10.4m to Pounds 8.3m.
Earnings fell to 11.3p (11.5p); the interim dividend was increased to 2.9p
(2.75p).
The shares fell 9p to 384p.
COMMENT
The 10 per cent decline in Japan, while perhaps not surprising, is still
slightly unnerving, even if some of the shortfall was made up in smaller
markets elsewhere in the Far East. The second half is going to be tough.
Dunhill's hedging policy means there will be no currency gains from
sterling's decline until next year, while profits from the Lagerfeld
acquisition will also be delayed because of long lead times. Dunhill's
ability to manage its worldwide brands is not in doubt, and it has the added
defence of a still substantial cash mountain. But it will be some time
before its image as a high growth stock, achieved in the 1980s, returns.
Forecast profits of Pounds 64m put the shares on a multiple of 16, which
looks fully valued.

FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Receiver expected at Barrett
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HENRY BARRETT Group, the Bradford-based steel and industrial fasteners
group, has joined the list of small late-eighties stock market stars to
crash to earth.
The shares were suspended at 7p yesterday, valuing the group at Pounds 3m,
compared to a peak of Pounds 110m in 1989.
The company asked for the suspension at 8.50am, pending clarification of its
financial position.
No statement was forthcoming yesterday, but the appointment of a receiver is
expected today.
Henry Barrett, which employs about 750 people, grew rapidly after flotation
in 1987.
It benefited from the last construction boom and bought 13 companies in an
attempt to diversify away from the inevitably cyclical core business of
steel stockholding and making steel-framed buildings.
The group's problems were precipitated by the collapse in demand for
steel-framed warehouses and out-of-town stores from retailers such as MFI
and Texas Homecare.
And the acquisitions programme meant that the group entered the downturn
with a heavily-geared balance sheet.
Although most of the companies concerned have since been sold, the group was
heading for a loss this year and in July said its debts stood at Pounds 18m.
The diversification was masterminded by Mr Stuart Greenwood, then finance
director, who departed two years ago to join Spring Ram Corporation, the
Bradford kitchens and bathrooms group, as main board director.
The collapse is a cruel blow for Mr James Barrett, 37, and his brother, Mr
Richard Barrett, 35, who helped buy out the 48 per cent of shares held by
family members and bring the company to market.
The brothers, who respectively manage the stockholding and construction
divisions, are great-great-grandsons of the founder, Henry Barrett, who
started in 1866 as an iron merchant,
The company had been trying to reduce its working capital and improve
efficiency under the chairmanship of Mr Donald Parvin, a former chief
executive of Matthew Clark, the mechanical and electrical engineers. Mr
Parvin became chairman last December and assumed an executive role in July.
The group had been making some progress, but it is understood that an
unexpected problem exhausted the patience of its banks, led by Barclays,
which were increasingly alarmed by the trading outlook.

FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Hambros down 33% as investment profit dips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAMBROS, the merchant bank and financial services group, yesterday reported
a 33 per cent fall in interim profits after the contribution from direct
investments dropped sharply.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 fell to Pounds 25m
(Pounds 37.6m). The interim dividend is maintained at 4.2p, payable from
earnings per share of 8p (12.6p).
Investment profits were pulled down from Pounds 9.8m to Pounds 1.7m by what
the bank described as a lack of selling opportunities in a subdued market,
and by the sale in March of a shareholding in CE Heath which means the
insurance broker's accounts were no longer consolidated.
A slower-than-expected launch of Hambro Guardian Assured Care, a managed
care business, contributed to a Pounds 2.5m pre-tax loss in miscellaneous
investments.
The banking division made profits of Pounds 37.3m (Pounds 40.5m), reflecting
a rise in half-year provisions for loans to Pounds 9m. The loan provision
for all of last year was Pounds 13m.
Mr Charles Hambro, chairman, said banking activity and profits had held up
well both at home and abroad. There had been 'particularly strong
contributions' from treasury, capital markets and asset finance.
The bank said it was encouraged by a recent rise in loan activity, and the
fact that only Pounds 1m of the loan provision had been set aside for
non-payment of interest. It had noticed a recovery of customers' ability to
make interest payments.
The loss on retail financial services, largely the Hambro Countrywide estate
agency chain, rose to Pounds 4.6m (Pounds 4.1m). Central finance charges and
overheads rose to Pounds 9.4m (Pounds 8.6m).
Profits for the full year may depend on whether the bank completes a
proposed flotation of Hambro Legal Protection by the end of March. Analysts
said they expected a successful flotation to realise an investment profit of
at least Pounds 10m.
Ms Alison Deuchars, analyst at Smith New Court, said she believed investment
profits were likely to recover in the second half, and Hambros would make
full year pre-tax profits of Pounds 67m, giving diluted earnings per share
of 22.9p.
The shares initially fell to 230p but recovered to 235p, still down 9p on
balance.

PROVISIONAL liquidators have been appointed to Cabra Estates, the property
company that owns two London football grounds.
The move does not immediately affect its subsidiaries, including those which
own the grounds used by Chelsea and Fulham football clubs.
The appointment of the liquidators follows a request made to the court by
the company's directors. This resulted from its banks' demand for the
repayment of their loan on Monday, a move that triggered the suspension of
Cabra's shares on Tuesday.

FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Mercury spreads wings to Canada - Hugo
Dixon and Roland Rudd report on C and W's latest deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER MORE than a year of negotiations with several of the world's largest
telecommunications companies Lord Young, chairman of Cable and Wireless, has
finally pulled off his big deal.
The international telecommunications group sees three main advantages from
the sale of 20 per cent of Mercury Communications, Britain's number two
telecommunications operator, to BCE, the Canadian telecommunications group.
Firstly, it has crystallised the value of C and W's UK subsidiary. The
Pounds 480m price values the company at a notional Pounds 2.4bn, while at
the same time giving rise to a Pounds 300m exceptional profit.
Secondly, it has produced a partnership which C and W hopes will enhance
Mercury's ability to compete more effectively against British
Telecommunications and provide the basis for further collaboration around
the world.
At the same time as BCE is bying a fifth of Mercury, C and W is investing
Pounds 30m in BCE's UK cable television interests.
Thirdly, the cash generated from the deal will reduce the group's gearing by
about 20 percentage points and so allow C and W to maintain its current
investment programme in Mercury while taking on new projects outside the UK.
Without the deal C and W would have had a net cash outflow of Pounds
300m-Pounds 400m in the year to end-March 1993, estimated Mr Laurence
Heyworth, of stockbrokers Robert Fleming Securities.
C and W's eagerness to make such a deal is underlined by the fact that BCE
was not the group's first choice.
Lord Young held extensive talks with AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group,
which broke down earlier this year because C and W was afraid of losing its
independence.
He then turned his attention to US West, one of the US 'baby Bell'
telecommunication companies.
They agreed to pool their mobile communications interests in the UK but
could not reach agreement about a partnership over Mercury.
Lord Young had been conducting simultaneous negotiations in Montreal and
London with BCE.
At the end of August the two sides were able to reach a tentative agreement
at a meeting of their senior executives at New York's exclusive Plaza
Athenee Hotel.
The fine detail was settled earlier this week.
The financial benefits of the deal are clear. The price BCE paid for its
stake was in the upper ranges of what analysts expected. Moreover, because
of the group's underlying negative cash flow, it needed to raise money if it
was to continue to expand.
The value of the partnership with BCE is more nebulous.
The deal might have been expected to presage a more aggressive attack on
BT's dominant UK market position, but both companies made clear that neither
Mercury nor BCE's cable television interests would be stepping up their
investment as a result of the deal.
There might also appear to be substantial synergies between Mercury's
long-distance network and BCE's local cable operations, which have just
begun to provide telephone services. But the potential to collaborate is
restricted by Mercury's licence which prevents it from showing 'undue
preference' to any customer.
Mercury already has 14 operational agreements with cable TV operators to
provide them with long-distance services. Its agreement with BCE's cable
interests will have to be on the same arms-length basis, although they do
plan to develop products and services jointly and exchange personnel.
Another possible area for collaboration would have been by Northern Telecom,
BCE's telecommunications manufacturing subsidiary, increasing its supply of
infrastructure equipment to Mercury. However, the UK company said supply
arrangements would continue to operate on an arms-length basis and it would
not be changing its multi-source purchasing policy.
Other areas for collaboration could develop in the long-term, but nothing
has been agreed.
Lord Young said the main focus would be in the European Community, although
he conceded that opportunities were restricted by the monopoly structure of
most markets.
In any event Lord Young made clear that the BCE partnership was not
exclusive. C and W already has joint ventures with US West in the UK, and
Bell South, another 'baby bell', in Australia.
More are in prospect as telecommunications markets are opened up around the
world. 'We are embarrassed by choice,' said Lord Young. 'Our problem is
deciding which company offers us the best returns for shareholders.'
The cash from the BCE deal will eventually be used in such investments. 'It
is not going to burn a hole in our pockets' said Mr James Ross, C and W's
chief executive.
Whether C and W will cut BCE in on such future deals will depend on the two
groups' ability to form a productive relationship in the UK.

FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Car distribution buy for Tibbett
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIBBETT &amp; Britten, a distributor and warehouser to the garment and retailing
industries, is moving into car distribution through the proposed acquisition
of Silcock Express, a private company.
Mr John Harvey, Tibbett's chairman, said the two companies had much in
common.
Both rely on long-term contracts and have developed added-value products in
distribution service.
Tibbett will pay an initial Pounds 31.2m to Mr Bernard Holmes, Silcock's
founding shareholder. Depending on Silcock's profitability up to 1994, the
maximum possible price will rise to Pounds 52.6m.
Tibbett is launching a 1-for-5 rights issue, underwritten by Hill Samuel, at
465p to raise Pounds 30.8m after expenses.
Mr Holmes will receive Pounds 7m of the initial consideration in new shares,
giving him a 3.5 per cent stake. This will leave the company Pounds 6.4m of
the rights money as working capital.
The stock market reacted well to the news. Tibbett's shares ended 1p lower
at 547p, after recovering from 535p.
Silcock operates about 550 transport vehicles and 31 rail wagons with
businesses in the UK, France, Belgium, Spain and Portugal.
As well as transport and storage service, Silcock provides special services
such as repairs, customisation and de-waxing. Its biggest clients are Ford,
Volkswagen/Audi and Peugeot.
Tibbett will use Silcock's European network to expand its distribution
services into Europe, where it is poorly represented. It also hopes to
introduce more sophisticated distribution and warehousing practices from the
retailing sector into car distribution.
Silcock made pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.8m on turnover of Pounds 94.5m in
the year to December 28.
Under the terms of the acquisition, the purchase price will be reduced if
Silcock's pre-tax profits this year fall below Pounds 5.5m or if
shareholders' funds are less than Pounds 15.2m by the year end.

FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Wardell Roberts falls to IPounds 1.27m
despite sale

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WARDELL ROBERTS, the Irish Foods group, reported a fall in first half
pre-tax profits from IPounds 1.33m to IPounds 1.27m (Pounds 1.39m) as tough
trading conditions offset the disposal of Country Style, its loss-making UK
poultry business.
Turnover was virtually unchanged at IPounds 20m at the core businesses, but
operating profit fell to IPounds 1.39m (IPounds 1.53m). Interest payments
were reduced to IPounds 116,000 (IPounds 199,000).
Earnings per share on the increased capital dipped to 4p (4.4p). The interim
dividend is maintained at 1.27p.
Mr Ken Peare, chief executive, said shareholders could take comfort from the
unchanged dividend, a sign of the strength of the balance sheet - debt was
being consistently reduced - and its healthy cashflow.
The group did not expect any improvement in the current half, but was still
on the look-out for acquisitions.
He said Wardell had been able to keep increases in fixed costs below the
rate of inflation, but higher marketing costs, associated with long-term
development of health food brands in the UK, had knocked operating profit.
Sales at the Healthilife subsidiary in the UK rose 12 per cent, while
turnover improved 5 per cent at Kelkin Naturproducts, the Irish health food
division. The joint venture with KP performed well, but the tea and coffee
retail business was affected by lower sales and tighter margins.

FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Alliance shareholders seek dismissal of
board in wake of receivership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS representing more than 10 per cent of Alliance Resources, the
Louisiana-based natural resources company that went into receivership last
month, have called for the board to be dismissed.
Mr Graham Wilson, the administrative receiver, said yesterday that
shareholders had requisitioned an extraordinary meeting to consider
dismissal of the three directors and their replacement by four new
candidates.
The EGM would look into possible claims against directors over alleged
breaches of obligations to the company.
New candidates proposed by the shareholders include Mr John O'Brien, former
Alliance chairman and managing director of Manx Petroleum, which called in
the receiver over default on a loan agreement.
The other three are Mr John Craven, former employee of Cluff Resources, run
by Manx chairman Mr Algy Cluff; Mr Marcus Black, formerly of broker Greig
Middleton; and Mr Russ Hammond, ex-managing director of Greenwell Montagu,
and well known to the independent oil sector. Mr Hammond holds 6 per cent of
Alliance.
The receiver on Monday dismissed the directors of Alliance's US subsidiary
and only significant asset, which had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection last month. Mr O'Brien was appointed president of the subsidiary.
Mr O'Brien, dismissed as chairman of Alliance in October, said he hoped a
compromise could be reached before the EGM was called. However, he added:
'If they don't call an EGM, it doesn't matter . . . Manx is running the
company. The plc (the parent company which held the shares of the US group)
has no function.'

FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: IFE offers cash alternative for TVS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TVS shareholders are to be given a full cash alternative under revised terms
of the recommended offer by International Family Entertainment of the US.
The initial offer for TVS, the south of England ITV company that lost its
franchise, was a mixture of paper and cash valued at Pounds 38.2m. The new
full cash alternative - 23p a share for ordinary shareholders and 43p for
preference shareholders - is worth about Pounds 36m.
The value of the share offer has been increasing because of the sinking
pound and performance of IFE shares in New York.
The sterling value of a new IFE share for the offer document due out on
Friday has been taken to be 759p. This is based on the Dollars 11.5 (Pounds
7.60) price of an IFE share and an exchange rate of Dollars 1.516 to the
pound on November 10. This, the company says, values TVS at approximately
Pounds 47.8m.
It is not clear how many small TVS shareholders will be interested in
holding American stock. Under revised terms a free dealing offer for IFE
stock has been withdrawn.
IFE is the company behind The Family Channel, a successful cable television
channel in the US, controlled by Mr Pat Robertson, the television evangelist
and his son Timothy.
Meanwhile, a second US television production company has expressed an
interest in TVS, which owns the MTM production company in the US.
A number of preference shareholders have expressed opposition to the IFE
deal on the grounds that it undervalues TVS.

allegations

<TEXT>
COSTAIN, the UK construction group which is being sued for accepting a
higher offer for its Australian coal-mining business, yesterday strongly
denied claims that it had acted in 'bad faith and breach of written
obligations'.
Altus Finance, a subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, announced
on Monday that it had agreed to pay Dollars 245m (Pounds 162m) for the
mining business and Costain's remaining Australian commercial property
interests.
Costain had previously agreed to sell the mining business for Dollars 200m
to Peabody Holding, the US-based coal-mining subsidiary of Hanson, the UK
conglomerate.
Peabody, in a lawsuit filed in the St Louis circuit court, asked that
Costain be made to abide by the terms of the original agreement, and an
injunction placed on the sale to Altus.
Mr Peter Costain, chief executive, who is also being sued by Peabody, denied
that he had broken an agreement. 'There was a written agreement giving
Peabody exclusive negotiating rights until September 21. Subsequently I
agreed, orally, to extend these rights to September 30. Altus did not appear
on the scene until some time after September 30.'

Scottish Value Trust, which has the bulk of its investments in the
investment trust sector, said that in the year to September 30 net asset
value per share had risen from 48.8p to 60.1p and that since then it had
risen further to 65.84p at the end of October.
The company said good progress had been made in investing the proceeds of
the Pounds 14m placing and open offer in September.
The company, formerly Bremner, has changed its year end, so comparisons were
not possible.
Available revenue for the period came to Pounds 426,000. In the six months
to September 30 1991 available revenue came to Pounds 70,000. Earnings per
share came to 1.78p, against 0.48p.
A dividend of 1.8p has already been paid for the year.

FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: AJ Archer forecasts decline to Pounds 0.9m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AJ Archer Holdings, the listed Lloyd's agency, yesterday estimated that
pre-tax profits for the year to September 30 would be not less than Pounds
900,000.
Despite the downturn from the previous year's Pounds 3.12m, the agency, the
second biggest after Sturge Holdings, plans to pay a final dividend of 2.2p,
maintaining the total at 4.4p.
Archer also announced the terms of its acquisition of fellow agency, Kellett
(Holdings). The initial Pounds 1.25m will be satisfied by Pounds 30,000 in
cash plus 2.25m shares. Additional sums due are based on share of profit
commissions on the Kellett syndicates.

<TEXT>
BETT BROTHERS, the property, building and leisure group, returned to the
black with profits of Pounds 3.3m pre-tax in the second half of its year to
August 31, writes Graham Deller.
The profit, which partly reflected lower interest charges of Pounds 2.49m
(Pounds 3.17m) following restructuring of the balance sheet, reduced the
deficit for the full year from Pounds 8.85m to Pounds 4.21m, struck after an
exceptional charge of Pounds 7.51m (Pounds 15.6m).
Group turnover fell to Pounds 23m (Pounds 30.9m). Losses per 20p share
worked through at 19.17p (57.35p). The final dividend, like the interim, is
passed; a total of 4.2p was paid in the previous year.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Irish Company News: Allied Irish Banks buoyed by strong
performance in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED IRISH Banks, the Republic's largest clearing bank, reported an 8.9
per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 95.6m (Pounds 104.7m) for
the six months to September 30, against IPounds 87.8m last time.
The rise was achieved through the growing contribution to profits from First
Maryland Bancorp of IPounds 36m (IPounds 18.8m) and a 10 per cent reduction
in loan loss provisions to IPounds 91.1m (IPounds 100.5m).
Losses in the UK division at IPounds 17.2m (IPounds 18.1m) were down
substantially from losses of IPounds 28.9n in the half-year to March 31.
Mr Kevin Kelly, financial director said: 'The banking environment in the UK
continues to be difficult, but there has been a stabilisation of our
non-performing loans and our retail banking activity in the UK has shown a
modest profit.'
Non-performing loans in the UK amounted to IPounds 353m, down from IPounds
370m, equal to 19 per cent of the loan portfolio there, compared to IPounds
306m in Ireland (5.3 per cent of the portfolio) and IPounds 97m in the US
(3.1 per cent of the portfolio).
A surge in employee costs, from IPounds 199m to IPounds 231.6m, was due to
'one-off' costs of an agreement with the bank unions on extended opening
hours in the Republic and rationalisation costs in the UK.
Mr Gerald Scanlan, group chief executive, said that the underlying wage cost
increase was only 4.5 per cent.
In the Irish division, there was a 4 per cent decline in profits due to
lower business activity and an increase in loan loss provisions.
Mr Kelly said that the bank's biggest concern was the 'flattening out' of
lending in the Irish market.
Disaggregated figures were not given, but the group's overall loan portfolio
fell by 10 per cent, from IPounds 13.4bn to IPounds 12bn, with total assets
slipping from IPounds 18.4bn to IPounds 18.1bn.
Mr Kelly said that the Irish market had been an 'engine of growth' for the
group as a whole.
The Tier One capital adequacy ratio improved to 6.9 per cent (6.7 per cent).
Earnings per share rose to 9.2p (8.5p) and an interim dividend of 3.8p
(3.6p) is declared.
COMMENT
Of all the clearing banks on both sides of the Irish Sea, AIB continues to
stand out as being the only one not to have been downgraded over the past
year by the rating agencies. Losses in the UK have been brought under
control, and costs are set to fall further in 1993. The one cloud on the
horizon is the worrying outlook for the bank's core market in Ireland. The
next results - due in three months as the year-end is changing to December -
are likely to reflect a further deterioration in lending and non-performing
loans, caused by sterling's fall in September and the current high level of
Irish interest rates. If rates do not fall significantly in the months
ahead, economic activity may stagnate in 1993. Thus, it is handy that the
well-timed expansion into the Maryland banking market is now contributing to
the bottom line. Pre-tax profits for 12 months to December are forecast at
around IPounds 220m for a p/e of 9.

FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Back to basics approach helps Jessups to
Pounds 0.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRINGENT COST cutting and an overhaul of its business strategy returned
Jessups to profitability in the year to August 31, in spite of another year
of declining car sales.
In a Pounds 1.4m turnround, the Romford-based motor dealer reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 506,000, compared with a Pounds 871,000 loss.
Turnover fell 12 per cent to Pounds 75.9m, but cost reductions led to
operating margins of 3.3 per cent, against 2.7 per cent. Operating profits
were Pounds 2.49m before net interest charges of Pounds 1.98m. Last year's
charge of Pounds 2.71m swallowed operating profits of Pounds 2.33m.
Mr Ron Joseph, managing director, said the group had 'gone back to basics'
and restructured its businesses, including losing some 50 jobs from the
450-strong workforce.
The group was broadening its franchise base, which had been too narrow,
changed the geographical focus of its dealerships and acquired new ones.
Jessups bought the loss-making Clarkes Ford dealership in June and Mr Joseph
said its parts, service and bodyshop business had made a net contribution to
profits, as the group sought to reduce its dependence on retail sales.
Earnings were 1.05p (13.26p deficit) the final dividend of 3p makes an
unchanged 4.5p total.

<TEXT>
SOUTHERN ELECTRIC has postponed the announcement of its interim results from
November 24 to December 15.
The company said yesterday that the three-week delay was intended to avoid a
clash with a scheduled appearance of its chairman, Mr Duncan Ross, on
November 25 before the Commons select committee inquiry into the coal
industry.
Southern Electric is deeply involved in the construction of gas-fired power
stations, which have been blamed for edging coal out of the market.
There is concern within the company that controversy could interfere with
the communication of its results.
'We have no intention of ducking the issues, but we want to do everything at
the appropriate time,' said Mr Jim Hart, commercial director.

FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Fresh provisions push Regalian to Pounds
21m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRESH set of provisions against falling property values pushed Regalian
Properties into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 21.5m for the six months to
September 30.
The result, which compares with a profit of Pounds 6.42m for the same period
last year, followed a loss of Pounds 26.8m for the year to March 31.
Mr David Goldstone, chairman and chief executive, was pessimistic about
prospects for the second half.
'The approach of the traditionally quiet winter months and no immediate
prospect of restoration of consumer con-fidence, no upturn in the market,
nor significant improvement in trading during the second half of the
financial year is envisaged,' Mr Goldstone said.
The Pounds 18.3m provisions against falling property values largely referred
to a luxury block of flats in Kensington Palace Gardens, west London.
The company is attempting to sell the block in its entirety through an offer
for sale.
These provisions, together with a Pounds 5.35m loss on the sale of fixed
assets and other items, resulted in an exceptional charge of Pounds 24.5m.
This offset an operating profit of Pounds 3m (Pounds 6.42m).
Borrowings fell sharply from Pounds 130m to Pounds 66m.
Regalian's last set of accounts were qualified because of the auditors'
concern about the value of its property, particularly the Kensington Palace
Gardens flats and a Paddington development site.
Mr Goldstone said disposal of the flats would provide the basis of future
profitability.
'Residential refurbishment opportunities are available which, even at
current house prices, would give rise to significant return on capital for
those developers with cash resources and the expertise which Regalian
retains,' he said.
Net assets per share, adjusted for the effects of a rights issue in July
1991, fell from 104.8p to 88.58p.

FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Electrocomponents leaps 33%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTROCOMPONENTS, the distributor of electronic, electrical and mechanical
components, yesterday reported a 33 per cent jump in interim profits.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30, increased to Pounds 27m
from a depressed Pounds 20.3m in the same period last year when profits were
hit by poor trading conditions and high start-up costs in Europe.
Turnover from continuing operations grew by 9.5 per cent to Pounds 161.4m
(Pounds 147.4m) while gross margins were maintained and operating profits
from continuing operations increased by 6.5 per cent to Pounds 26.1m (Pounds
24.5m).
Earnings per share increased by 34 per cent to 8.42p (6.3p) and the interim
dividend is raised by 5 per cent to 2p (1.9p) to reflect the group's 'sound
trading performance and positive cash flow'.
Despite the continuing weakness of the UK economy, the group's core RS
Components business managed to increase sales by 7.5 per cent. Net margins
were maintained despite payment of rates for a full half year as a result of
the ending of the Corby Enterprise Zone, completion of phase 2 of the Corby
expansion programme and additional investment in computer systems.
In Europe the launch of new operations in Germany, Denmark and Italy during
the past 18 months helped RS International achieve a sales increase. These
new operations will incur losses for their first three years of trading.
Pact, which supplies pre-packed electrical accessories to all large DIY
retailers in the UK, 'had a difficult half year', with sales below the
corresponding period. However, Mr Robert Lawson, group chief executive, said
September was stronger and this trend continued in October.
As a result of 'stringent economies' made in overheads and operating costs,
Pact made only a marginal loss in the seasonally weaker first half.
Group operating results excluded losses at the Misco computer supplies
catalogue business, which has been reorganised and is up for sale. Mr Lawson
said negotiations on the sale of the business were continuing and he was
hopeful that they would be completed shortly.
COMMENT
Even allowing for last year's profits being depressed, figures for the
latest half are impressive. Revenues in the core UK business expanded by 7.5
per cent despite the state of the economy, while net margins rose in spite
of higher costs. The gains mostly reflect the group's success of splitting
the catalogue and introducing a substantial number of new products while
keeping a tight lid on costs. As expected, the new international operations
in Europe are losing money, but their revenues are in line with budget and
form a key part of the strategy to refocus the group and further exploit the
RS distribution network. Remaining Misco operations will be sold shortly and
Pact should strike profit in the second half. The balance sheet is strong,
with net cash to Pounds 20.6m at the end of the first half, up from Pounds
5.1m at the end of March. Full-year profits of about Pounds 58m look
possible and earnings of 18p per share put the stock on a prospective
multiple of 18.2. This is a stock to hold, or buy on signs of weakness.

FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Wm Cook hit by US losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIAM COOK, the Sheffield-based steel castings group, yesterday reported a
collapse in profits following the slide into losses of a US company acquired
two years ago.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to October 3 fell from Pounds 4.05m to
Pounds 604,000 on sales down 13 per cent at Pounds 49.6m.
In spite of the recession, the company said its UK operations held up well
with margins almost maintained at 8.2 per cent.
The problem was with Unitcast, the US steel-caster purchased in 1990. During
the period, it lost Pounds 1.1m on turnover of Pounds 3.47m after sales to
the US rail freight cars business collapsed.
Monthly losses at the US company have been reduced to Pounds 100,000 a
month. If a buyer is not found by the end of the year, the company will be
closed, according to Mr Andrew Cook, chairman and chief executive.
Sales in the US fell 40 per cent and while eight William Cook executives had
been despatched to sort out the problem, Mr Cook said the company had been
caught in 'an old fashioned knacker-trap.'
In the UK, however, sales of Pounds 46.2m produced profits of Pounds 3.77m.
Gearing fell slightly during the period to 65 per cent. However, an expected
write-off of the Unitcast investment is likely to increase the percentage.
Earnings per share dropped from 12.96p to 1.93p and the interim dividend is
cut from 5p to 1.5p.
COMMENT
There are occasions when shareholders would be best served by the chief
executive leaving for a two year holiday; sometimes, there can be no more
powerful sell signal than a management team with time on its hands. William
Cook is a case in point. Within two years it has paid Dollars 12.6m for an
ill-considered expansion into the US and has tried and failed to take over
Telfos, the engineering group. The latter left William Cook with a bruised
reputation and a Pounds 300,000 loss; the US move is more likely to leave
the group with a Pounds 6m write-off. Whether exceptional or extraordinary,
this is a nasty dent in the balance sheet. The shame is that underneath is a
good business. The same man who sunk William Cook in its US adventure
successfully forged the UK foundry industry into a workable and
internationally competitive form. With forecasts of Pounds 3.7m pre-tax this
year, giving 12p of earnings and a prospective multiple of 8, this stock is
undervalued.

FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: J Bibby suffers 9% downturn to Pounds 32.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J BIBBY &amp; Sons, the industrial and agricultural group which recently became
the first foreign company to win a hostile bid in Spain, yesterday revealed
a 9 per cent fall in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 32.2m on sales 14 per
cent higher at Pounds 625.2m.
The profits included a Pounds 1.9m contribution at the operating level from
Finanzauto, Spain's only Caterpillar distributor, and its Portuguese
subsidiary, Stet, which Bibby acquired for Pounds 86m this summer after a
six-month-long bid battle.
After interest charges, however, Finanzauto - which was purchased in July -
incurred a Pounds 1m loss, while Stet returned a profit.
Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, chairman, said the prospects for Finanzauto were
good following a restructuring of the business. 'I would hope this time next
year to be making very bullish noises about Finanzauto in 1994,' he said.
However, the outlook for the group as a whole - which is 79 per cent-owned
by Barlow Rand, the South African Caterpillar distributor - remained
difficult. 'Our current expectation is that . . . bleak conditions will
probably prevail well into . . . 1993,' he said.
Bibby's four other businesses all suffered a decline in operating profit,
with the sharpest fall in agricultural products.
Severe price competition in animal feeds had depressed margins, although Mr
Mansell-Jones said there would be room for improvement following a
rationalisation of the industry earlier this year.
In the materials handling division, the recessionary conditions of the UK
were offset by growth in the south-eastern US.
Scientific products suffered from declining markets and a bad debt of Pounds
1m from Japan. Mr Mansell-Jones said the Japanese market was proving
increasingly difficult.
Finally, Bibby's paper operations were down almost 10 per cent at the
trading level, but slightly higher in pre-tax terms.
During the year, Bibby cut gearing from a peak of 120 per cent to 65.6 per
cent, although on a banking basis - which includes guarantees as debt - the
ratio was 77.9 per cent.
The final dividend is maintained at 6.9p, for a same-again total of 9.75p.
Earnings of 20.09p, against 20.61p, were cushioned by a substantially lower
tax charge of 18.2 per cent (29.1 per cent).

FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Gardini steps up efforts to win
SME
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE publicity machine of Mr Raul Gardini, the Italian financier who divorced
from Ferruzzi-Montedison last year, has swung into top gear to gain support
for his bid to take over SME, the state-controlled foodstuffs group shortly
to be privatised.
Yesterday, Gardini associates confirmed that Gardini srl, his
Luxembourg-based holding company, was planning to raise its capital from
L500bn to L2,000bn (Dollars 1.47bn) with the eventual aim of becoming a
listed company on the Milan bourse.
The application to the Milan stock exchange authorities dates back to
October 17. The suggestion from the company yesterday was that a flotation
might involve up to 40 per cent of the company.
So far Mr Gardini has given little hint as to how he intends to raise the
money, but has merely stated its purpose is to gain control of SME. 'The
main purpose (of the capital increase) is to present a take-over bid for the
activities of SME; but the precautionary measure of raising fresh capital
could also be useful for other activities,' an aide was quoted as saying
yesterday.
Mr Gardini left Ferruzzi-Montedison in July 1991 with a L505bn pay-off,
representing his own indemnity and the value of his wife's Ferruzzi
shareholding. The money enabled him to set up Gardini srl in August 1991.
Reports suggest that Mr Gardini has a number of allies, including Nestle,
and that if successful he would hive off the bulk of SME interests,
retaining only the rice and the oils sides.
By publicly declaring his interest in SME, despite open government
hostility, Mr Gardini is also challenging his former friends and adopted
family, since control of SME would put him on a similar footing to Ferruzzi
in the Italian foodstuffs business.
First-half profits of SME this year were L41.8bn with sales of L2,961bn.

ASTRA, Sweden's leading pharmaceuticals group, lifted pre-tax profits by 32
per cent to SKr3.42bn (Dollars 570m) in the first nine months of 1992, as
sales of its anti-peptic ulcer drug, Losec, continued to soar.
The result compares with profits of SKr2.58bn in the first nine months of
last year and is ahead of the SKr3.41bn profit achieved in the whole of
1991.
Sales in the latest period climbed 26 per cent to SKr11.21bn from SKr8.92bn.
Astra's Losec sales rose 41 per cent to SKr3.06bn, but total sales, after
including sales through licensees, climbed to SKr5.00bn from Skr3.40bn.
Sales of the anti-inflammatory asthma agent, Pulmicort, climbed 59 per cent
to SKr1.38bn from SKr847m, making it Astra's second-largest selling product
after Losec.
The group stands by its earlier forecast that group sales this year will be
20-25 per cent above last year's SKr12.5bn.

<TEXT>
BANK Austria has become the first non-Russian bank to receive a licence to
operate a branch in Russia.
To date, foreign banks have only been allowed to operate through
representative offices. As a result, they have been unable to open accounts
for Russian companies or Russian banks.
Mr Michael Franz, who will be general manager of the Moscow branch, said
yesterday that Bank Austria had been planning to open the branch for three
years. The Central Bank of Moscow has been considering Bank Austria's
application for the past nine months.
With a staff of 16, the branch will initially concentrate on providing
foreign exchange and payment services to local banks and up to 25 Russian
companies with hard currency earnings. It will also provide a range of
banking services to western companies with interests in Russia.

Netherlands, stressed that there had been no detailed negotiations.
The loss-making Dutch group said it was considering supplying Klockner with
coke and steel plate, but closer links through a merger or
cross-shareholdings were not being discussed.
Both sides agreed the search for partners had been prompted by the depressed
state of the European steel industry.
The German steel industry association says real prices for domestic steel
have fallen below levels reached in the 1965 crisis.
Already depressed by international recession, the market has also been hit
by rising cheap imports from eastern Europe. The association expects 2.3m
tonnes - sold 'at any price' - this year, after only 900,000 tonnes in 1991.
It claims there is up to 25m tonnes excess capacity in the European
Community, and has called repeatedly for restructuring aid and an end to
what it claims are unfair government subsidies in France, Spain and Italy.
Hoogovens, which estimates EC overcapacity at 38m tonnes, has presented
Eurofer, the Community steel association, with a proposal for Ecu1bn
(Dollars 1.23bn) in aid for a restructuring plan which will entail the loss
of 50,000 jobs.
The company, which is in the process of shedding 2,300 workers, has forecast
a record loss for 1992 after a Fl 51m (Dollars 28.41m) deficit last year.
Meanwhile, Klockner, one of the smaller German steel makers with only 3.4m
tonnes capacity, suffers from its relative lack of scale compared with
companies such as Thyssen and Krupp.
A medium-term restructuring programme has already radically altered the
group's shape.
Steel, which accounted for 60 per cent of sales in 1989, contributed only 33
per cent of last year's DM7.2bn (Dollars 4.5bn) group turnover. Plastics,
accounting for 38 per cent, is now the biggest single sector.
However, withdrawal from steel seems unlikely. Klockner is currently
building a DM400m steel galvanising plant at its main base in Bremen.

<TEXT>
NOVO Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceuticals and enzymes group, yesterday
reported a 20 per cent drop to DKr330m (Dollars 53.92m) in 1992
third-quarter pre-tax profits, against the same period a year ago.
The company said it had been hampered by the currency turbulence in
September. The quarter incurred net financial costs of DKr121m compared with
net financial income of DKr45m last year.
However, Nordisk, which expects capital investment to increase to DKr2bn
this year from from DKr1.3bn in 1991, reported strong gains for the whole
nine months, with pre-tax profits 15 per cent ahead at DKr1.27bn.
Earnings per share rose 8 per cent to DKr23.84.
Based on current exchange rates and interest levels, Nordisk said that
pre-tax earnings for the full year were expected to increase by about 15 per
cent from last year's DKr1.46bn.
Nine-month sales were ahead by 16 per cent to DKr7.95bn after an increase of
20 per cent in sales by the bio-industrial enzymes division to DKr2.38bn and
by 11 per cent to DKr5.18bn in the health care division, where sales of
insulin, human growth hormone and gynaecological products all increased.
Sales growth was largely a result of volume increase, the group said.
Net financial costs for the nine-month period increased to DKr62m from DKr2m
last year.
Unidanmark, Denmark's second biggest banking group, has raised DKr3.3bn in
supplementary capital from 27,000 subscribers.
Institutional investors put up DKr2bn, but the rest has been subscribed by
the bank's customers.

FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Takeovers bring Solvay out of
the shadows - The chemicals group has identified five core sectors for
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOLVAY, the big Belgian chemicals group, is emerging from the shadows.
Traditionally discrete, it has been thrust centre stage over the past 18
months with the completion of three strategic takeovers.
The deals, aimed at repositioning Solvay, included a marketing agreement
with Upjohn, the US group, for its anti-depressant Fluvoxamine: the Dollars
500m acquisition of the soda ash business of Tenneco of the US: and the
purchase of the 50 per cent it did not own of Interox, a hydrogen peroxide
joint-venture with Laporte, the UK chemical group.
Baron Janssen, chairman, says the deals were designed to focus group efforts
in areas in which it could excel and become a world leader. 'We need to find
areas with high added value and margins which are less cyclical than our
traditional core areas,' he says.
Solvay, whose sales of BFr254bn (Dollars 7.76bn) last year made it number 18
in the world chemicals league, has identified five core sectors in which it
wants to grow: health, soda ash, peroxygens, plastics and processing.
The first three areas - the sectors where Baron Janssen has concluded his
deals - have been chosen for expansion because they are less vulnerable than
the highly cyclical basic chemical industry.
Brokers Wertheim Schroder believe the growth areas of health and peroxygens
represent 27 per cent of Solvay turnover. Soda ash, salt and processing are
stable businesses with 28 per cent.
The remaining operations, which are cyclical, represent 45 per cent.
Solvay's most significant move was the acquisition of an 80 per cent stake
in Tenneco's Wyoming soda ash plant. The deal added 1.8m tonnes of low-cost
production to Solvay's capacity and confirmed its position as the world's
largest soda ash manufacturer. It already dominated the European market with
4m tonnes of the region's 7m tonnes annual capacity.
The group is cementing its position in European soda ash by investing in a
540,000 tonnes-a-year plant at Bernburg in the former East Germany. Baron
Janssen says the factory made a small but unexpected profit in the first
four months to December 1991. Solvay has promised to spend DM200m (Dollars
125m) on the site over the next five years.
Baron Janssen also stresses the importance of the Interox acquisition. He
says the hydrogen peroxide market is growing rapidly. The substance, which
is used in the paper, water and gas industries, is viewed as environmentally
friendly because it can be used in chemical reactions without creating toxic
by-products. Margins have traditionally also been high in spite of its
commodity status.
Solvay's main problem in this sector is that other groups have also
identified hydrogen peroxide as a growth area. Additional capacity has been
added at the same time that demand has slowed.
Healthcare is the final counter-cyclical sector that Baron Janssen has
chosen for expansion. The pharmaceuticals industry is highly profitable and
expanding rapidly, but Solvay's performance has so far been disappointing.
Operating margins were only 6.1 per cent last year, compared with 31.4 per
cent at Glaxo of the UK, for example.
The tale of Fluvoxamine, the group's anti-depressant, illustrates the
problems facing small pharmaceuticals groups such as Solvay.
Fluvoxamine was the world's first of a new generation of drugs called
selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI).
The drug was first launched in Switzerland in 1983. Small drugs companies,
such as Solvay, with little experience of dealing with regulatory
authorities, tend to have difficulty demonstrating their drugs' safety and
efficacy. It took eight years before Fluvoxamine had approval throughout
Europe.
Although the medicine was one of the first in its class, Fluvoxamine still
lacks approval in the US, the world's largest market. In 1989, Eli Lilly,
the big US group, launched Prozac, a similar product. Last year this
medicine generated revenues of Dollars 910m. Fluvoxamine, pushed by Solvay's
limited sales force, had sales last year of only Dollars 40m.
'We failed to market effectively what was a good product,' admits Baron
Janssen. 'We are new in the business. We only started 12 years ago and we
are still on a learning curve.'
A review two years ago was followed by the decision to remedy the group's
lack of regulatory and marketing expertise by setting up development and
joint-marketing agreements.
The most significant consequence was a marketing alliance with Upjohn, the
US group, to co-market Fluvoxamine and Xanax, one of the American company's
central nervous system products.
Baron Janssen hopes that with Upjohn's help, Fluvoxamine will receive
approval in the US and be commercialised in 1994.
He does not exclude the possibility of medium-sized acquisitions to help the
division gain critical mass.
Meanwhile, Baron Janssen has no intention of switching out of the highly
cyclical commodity plastics business. He says he sees this as a core
business with good growth which is sometimes highly profitable.
Operating earnings last year from plastics fell 81 per cent to BFr1.7m. The
group will continue to look for niche markets, such as polypropylene car
petrol tanks.
Although Solvay group earnings fell 14 per cent during the first half of
1992, Baron Janssen believes his efforts will ensure full-year results will
match last year's pre-tax profits of BFr12.9bn.
Baron Janssen expects to ride out the recessionary storm. He hopes his three
strategic moves will then ensure the group is better placed to take
advantage of clearer economic waters.

<TEXT>
BETHLEHEM Steel, the second biggest US steel group, may sell its bar, rod &amp;
wire operations to Ispat Group of Calcutta.
Bethlehem, which said in January that it would sell the division, said the
discussions include the sale of the entire operations apart from the
Johnstown wire mill. It has agreed to sell the wire mill to TMB Industries
of Chicago.
The decision to sell the bar, rod and wire operations, which contribute less
than 10 per cent to Bethlehem's roughly Dollars 4bn annual sales, was
announced during the fourth quarter last year when Bethlehem turned in
losses of Dollars 638m, including a charge of Dollars 575m.
Before putting the operations on the block, Bethlehem had discussed
modernising the loss-making division with the United Steelworkers' union
(USW) for more than a year.
The decision to sell the business was made after the two sides failed to
agree on a new labour pact and Bethlehem said it could no longer consider
modernisation because of its deteriorating finances.
The division has been hit hard by intensifying competition from low-cost
mini-mills, which are increasing their share of the market for less
sophisticated products. Low priced imports have also hurt the operations.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NET profits at Siemens, the German electrical and electronics group, rose
8.9 per cent to DM1.95bn (Dollars 1.22bn) in the year to the end of
September, the company said yesterday. The dividend will be unchanged at
DM13 a share.
The result, in line with group forecasts, was achieved on sales up 7.7 per
cent at DM78.6bn. This was around DM1bn below target due to the recent
strength of the D-Mark against foreign currencies, a spokesman said.
Powerful growth in core businesses such as telecommunications, power plant
and motor components was partly offset by continuing losses in the
Siemens-Nixdorf computer subsidiary, which increased sales by 7 per cent to
DM13bn, and semiconductor manufacture. The full results from Siemens-Nixdorf
are due out today. While the deficit at Nixdorf was 'much less' than the
DM781m last year, it was still big, and losses from semiconductors increased
further, the spokesman added.
The company also reported a slow-down in new order growth. After a rise of
21 per cent a year earlier, total orders last year rose only 4 per cent.
Domestic bookings were up 9 per cent at DM40bn and foreign orders slipped
marginally to DM45bn.
The group, which published its provisional results with little comment and
gave no forecasts for the current year, is clearly feeling the effects of
the economic slowdown. While the workforce rose 3 per cent to 413,000 during
the year, after correction for the effects of acquisitions it fell 14,000.
A further 2,300 jobs are scheduled to go by the end of 1995 in the
semiconductor division.

FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Chrysler plans Dollars 17.3bn
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRYSLER, the US vehicle maker, is planning to invest Dollars 17.3bn between
1993 to 1997 in capital expenditure and new product development, according
to Mr Robert Eaton, vice-chairman.
Mr Eaton, who takes over as chairman from Mr Lee Iacocca in January,
admitted that 'it was not clear one-and-a-half years ago that Chrysler would
survive this current recession'.
The company had considerably weakened its balance sheet to maintain a very
ambitious new product development programme, and Mr Eaton said that Chrysler
now had to rebuild its finances as a top priority.
Chrysler, the smallest of the three US vehicle makers, was profitable in the
second and third quarters of this year, the first time since the first half
of 1990 that the group has been profitable in two consecutive quarters.
Both General Motors and Ford reported a loss in the third quarter this year.
Mr Eaton said that Chrysler's spending plan was more than the company had
achieved in profit in its entire history.
It was an 'unbelievable' achievement that the company had maintained its
product programme intact during the recession, and Chrysler was now planning
to launch a new product every six months for the next three years.
'We have trashed our balance sheet to get to this point,' he admitted, and
the company had been forced to sell assets worth Dollars 1.7bn in 1991/92 to
maintain spending on product development.
Chrysler was aiming to achieve an investment rating on its debt by the first
quarter of 1995 and was seeking to reach a cash balance of Dollars 5bn by
1995 compared with around Dollars 3.2bn at present.
The Dollars 6.8bn revolving credit agreed with its banks earlier this year
had been Chrysler's last big hurdle to 'keep the company financially
afloat'.
The company's low debt rating was blocking access to the US commercial paper
market, which increased the group's costs by Dollars 300m a year and meant
that Chrysler was unable to offer competitive leasing deals, said Mr Eaton.
In 1990 Chrysler and Fiat halted far-reaching year-long negotiations about a
possible merger of their car-making operations, and Mr Eaton said that the
US car maker was no longer seeking any significant collaboration deal.
'We do not feel that we need to be looking for a merger to maintain our
viability,' he said.
Last March Chrysler reduced its holding in Mitsubishi Motors of Japan from
10.9 per cent to 5.9 per cent with the sale of 43.6m shares for Dollars
215m, and Mr Eaton said the US car maker was also prepared to sell the
remaining stake.
'We do not think the holding is at all necessary to our continuing
relationship. There are no plans, but yes, we could sell it.'

multi-media news service

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PILOT market test of 'news on demand' services, beaming news reports via
satellite to personal computers is to be conducted jointly by US groups.
The companies in the venture, IBM, the computer giant, NBC, the television
network subsidiary of General Electric, and NuMedia, a privately held
multimedia software and equipment developer, will target corporate
customers.
The proposed multimedia information service, to be called NBC Desktop News,
integrates text, graphics, video and sound clips into customised news
reports that can be viewed on a PC.
The venture is the latest example of how the integration of computer,
communications and consumer electronics technologies may spawn new products
and services.
NBC Desktop News is designed for corporate users who need access to the
latest news on a specific subject, but do not have time to comb through the
diverse range of news and information sources available to businesses today,
the companies said.
'The bombardment of news and information available each day is staggering,'
said Mr Tom Rogers, president, NBC Cable and Business Development.
He added that the pilot test marked 'a key step in our ability to cut
through the clutter and deliver news and information to corporate and
government offices, an area traditionally under-served by broadcast
television and cable.
'Being able to recall information on demand is an important feature in this
pilot test,' he added. Corporations in pharmaceutical, computer, and
financial industries are seen as likely candidates for the proposed
industry-specific news services.
Initially, the customised multimedia news reports will be distributed via
satellite to the customer sites. Broadcast, fibre optic and cable delivery
systems may also be tested in the future, the companies said.
NuMedia will provide PC software used to access the news services with
options to customise further the content through the network server for
individual PC users.
The market test will be conducted in New York and is scheduled to begin next
month.

S Korea

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAEWOO Motor, South Korea's third biggest vehicle maker, announced yesterday
that it is to begin licensed production of Honda's Legend luxury car next
year.
The agreement with Honda is the first step by Daewoo to find foreign
partners following the recent ending of its 14-year joint venture with
General Motors of the US.
Mr Kim Woo-choong, chairman of the Daewoo business group, said the technical
tie-up with Honda could extend to other car models.
The Legend is the first luxury car produced by Daewoo in recent years. It
will compete in the domestic market under the Daewoo name against Hyundai
Motor's Grandeur and Kia Motors' Potentia.
Daewoo will initially sell the Legend only in Korea, but it hopes to export
the model later. Output will begin in the autumn of 1993 at Daewoo's Pupyong
plant near Seoul, with an annual capacity of 5,000 cars, increasing
eventually to 10,000. It expects to produce about 2,000 to 3,000 Legends
next year.
It will spend about Dollars 140m over the next two years for new presses and
the development of automotive components.
Daewoo Motor, like other Korean vehicle makers, is dependent on foreign car
companies for technology, with most of its models developed in co-operation
with GM. It also needs foreign financing since the unlisted company is
heavily in debt.
But the parent Daewoo group, Korea's fourth largest conglomerate, agreed at
the end of October to buy out GM's 50 per cent shareholding in Daewoo Motor
for Dollars 170m following growing managerial disagreements. The two
companies, however, will continue their automotive components joint venture.
While GM expressed concern about losses at Daewoo Motor, which amounted to
Dollars 200m last year on sales of Dollars 2.2bn, Daewoo said overseas
marketing restrictions imposed by GM were hurting the company.
Daewoo was unable to sell its cars independently in the US or Europe, where
they compete against similar GM models. Instead, most Daewoo exports
comprised the GM-licensed Opel Kadett which was shipped to the US and sold
by GM as the Pontiac LeMans.
Under the agreement terminating its partnership with GM, Daewoo can start
independent distribution of its cars in the developing world next year and
in North America and Europe in 1995.
Mr Kim predicts Daewoo Motor will earn profits of Won60bn (Dollars 76m) to
Won70bn this year although analysts estimate that it lost Won50bn during the
first half.

<TEXT>
BRIERLEY Investments, the New Zealand hotels and investment concern, has
sold a 7.5 per cent stake in Air New Zealand to institutional investors in
the UK, Asia and the US.
The move reduces BIL's ownership from 42.5 to 35 per cent, but the company
remains the airline's largest shareholder. The other major shareholders are
Qantas, the Australian flag carrier, with 20 per cent, and Japan Airlines
with 5 per cent.
Mr Bob Matthew, BIL executive director and Air New Zealand chairman, said
that BIL intended to keep its 35 per cent interest in Air New Zealand for
the long term, but had always planned to sell the parcel of B class shares.
The shares are believed to have been bought at around NZDollars 1.35 a
share, and were sold at NZDollars 2.70, ex dividend.
Analysts say the sale has no implications for the Australian government's
flotation of Qantas.
Both Air New Zealand and Brierley Investments have said they were interested
in buying a shareholding in the Australian carrier, and they may join a
consortium with Singapore Airlines.
The Singapore government is the largest shareholder in Brierley Investments,
and is also a partner with it in UK hotel group Mount Charlotte.

in tough first half

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Steel Manu-facturing, a Mitsubishi group company producing
springs and special steels, reported pre-tax losses of Y791m (Dollars 6.4m)
for the first six months to the end of September, highlighting the pressure
on components suppliers within Japan.
The fact that a Mitsubishi group member reported a loss suggests that other
components suppliers are under extreme pressure, as Mitsubishi Motors, a
leading purchaser of its products, has been more successful than most other
Japanese car makers over the past year.
In the first half last year, Mitsubishi Steel reported pre-tax profits of
Y720m, while sales for the first half this year were down 9.2 per cent at
Y38.6bn, as orders fell from the car and construction industries.
The continuing weakness in the stock market has meant that the company has
been unable to supplement its core earnings with an increase in financial
income, a common practice among Japanese manufacturers in the past.
For the full year, Mitsubishi Steel forecasts pre-tax losses of Y1.7bn,
compared with profits of Y1.6bn last year, on sales of Y78bn, down 5.4 per
cent. But the company indicated that the proceeds of a land sale would
contribute to a net profit of Y700m.
Mitsubishi Gas Chemical, a maker of chemicals and engineering plastics,
reported a 70 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y1.14bn in the first half,
as demand declined from car makers, electronics companies and the paper
industry.
Sales for the period fell 9 per cent to Y101.6bn, while after-tax profit was
down 59 per cent to Y1.17bn.
The company said that the interim dividend would be cut from the Y3.5 of
last year to Y2.5 a share.
The company has a stake in joint venture methanol projects in Venezuela and
Saudi Arabia, but its problems have arisen in supplying industrial products
to the home market, where demand from manufacturing industry is still
declining.
As part of its attempts to broaden its sales base, Mitsubishi has put
emphasis on developing engineering plastics and on supplying components to
electronics manufacturers, but the weakness of that industry has undermined
that strategy.
Mitsubishi Gas forecast a full-year pre-tax profit of Y2.5bn, 48 per cent
below the previous year's figure, on sales down almost 5 per cent to Y207bn.

Australia

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAMPBELL Soup's hostile bid for Arnotts, the Australian biscuit maker, took
a fresh turn yesterday when Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer (finance
minister), criticised Campbell's record in Australia.
Mr Dawkins said the federal government would be 'very closely involved' in
the decision on whether to allow the bid, which is subject to approval by
the Foreign Investment Review Board (Firb).
He said Campbell was 'very much under the spotlight', and suggested the US
food group had failed to keep promises to the Firb when it acquired its
existing 32.9 per cent stake in Arnotts in 1985.
Campbell is offering ADollars 8.80 a share for the 17.2 per cent stake
required for control of Arnotts. The bid, which has been rejected by
Arnotts, values the group at ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 857m).
Arnotts representatives met Mr Dawkins last week to draw attention to
promises the company says were made by Campbell in 1985, including an
undertaking not to seek to control the board and a pledge to use Arnotts
recipes in its European operations.
Mr Dawkins said last month that Campbell's plans to use Arnotts as a
springboard for expansion into Asian markets would be central to his
decision on whether to allow the bid to proceed. He suggested yesterday that
Campbell might not need a bigger stake in Arnotts to increase its
involvement in the Asia Pacific market. 'I think that will need to be
tested, particularly in the light of Campbell's somewhat indifferent record
of sticking to its earlier commitments,' he said. Mr Dawkins also said
Arnotts's export performance had been 'pretty disappointing.'
The Firb, which approves about 97 per cent of foreign investment proposals,
has been under pressure to reject the bid to maintain ownership of Arnotts
within Australia.

FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Dah Sing agrees to buy Wing On
for HKDollars 530m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANG Seng Bank has accepted an offer by Dah Sing Financial Holdings to buy
its Wing On Bank unit, Reuter reports.
The bank said no final price had been decided, but Dah Sing would probably
pay about HKDollars 30.13 each for 17.6m shares, making the offer worth
about HKDollars 530m (USDollars 68.8m).
Hang Seng, which is 68 per cent owned by HSBC Holdings, holds 50.3 per cent
of Wing On. It said Dah Sing would make a cash offer for remaining shares in
Wing On. The total offer would value the bank at more than HKDollars 1.05bn.
Hang Seng rescued Wing On in 1986 after it ran into financial trouble.
Dah Sing, which owns Hongkong Industrial and Commercial Bank, announced in
March net annual profits of HKDollars 159.81m, compared with HKDollars
119.20 the previous year.
Hang Seng said the Hong Kong Commissioner of Banking had indicated his
approval of the takeover but had yet to be approached for a formal ruling.

FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Improved beer sales help SAB
group to lift earnings by 7%
</HEADLINE>

IMPROVED profits from the beer division helped South African Breweries
(SAB), one of South Africa's leading industrial companies, record a 7 per
cent increase in attributable earnings to R252m (Dollars 84m) in the six
months to the end of September, compared with R236m a year earlier.
A 13 per cent increase in attributable earnings from the beer division to
R184m from R163m helped offset a 7 per cent fall in earnings from SAB's
other interests to R68m from R73m. These include retail, manufacturing,
hotel and international activities
Beer volumes rose marginally compared to 1991.
Group turnover rose by 29 per cent to R10.29bn from R7.99bn, but this figure
was inflated by the acquisition in April of the Plate Glass group. Stripped
of this, turnover rose by 10 per cent on a comparable basis.
Operating profits rose by 18 per cent to R901m from R765m. But a higher tax
bill and a 52 per cent increase in the share of profits attributable to
outside and preference shareholders to R129m from R85m caused attributable
profits to rise by only 7 per cent to R252m from R236m. This performance was
in line with market expectations.
Mr Meyer Kahn, executive chairman, said that the 'severity of the prolonged
recession in South Africa, together with the lack of any meaningful progress
in eliminating the root causes of the prevailing socio-political turmoil,
continues to have a devastating effect on consumption expenditure in the
mass consumer markets.'
Private consumption expenditure in the South African economy is expected to
decline this year for the first time since 1985.
SAB's furniture, retail and textile interests, which are traditionally very
cyclical operations, have been hardest hit. Even Edgars, the retail fashion
group with a formidable earnings track record, managed to lift attributable
earnings by only 4.5 per cent.
Looking ahead, Mr Kahn said the short-term outlook both in the domestic and
main international economies remained 'extremely uncertain'.
He said there was little prospect for recovery in personal disposable
incomes before the latter part of 1993 and predicted that the rate of
improvement in group earnings would remain 'severely constrained' over the
rest of the financial year.
Earnings per share rose by 6 per cent to 93.4 cents from 88.2 cents on an
attributable basis. The dividend is being raised by 6 per cent to 35 cents a
share from 33 cents.

FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Exports give Fujisawa pre-tax
rise
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUJISAWA Pharmaceutical, a leading Japanese drug company, reported a firm
rise in interim pre-tax profits, thanks to improvements in its financial
balance.
The company said non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the first six months
to September rose 15.8 per cent to Y10.87bn (Dollars 88.3m) from Y9.38bn, on
a 1.2 per cent rise in sales to Y116.08bn from Y114.66bn. After-tax profits,
however, fell 8.5 per cent to Y3.28bn from Y3.59bn, due to a rise in tax
payments.
Fujisawa said a 16 per cent rise in exports offset a 1.4 per cent drop in
domestic sales. Sales in the domestic market were hurt by slack demand for
its antibiotics and anti-ulcer agent.
The company, however, benefited from cost-cutting efforts and increased the
ratio of in-house products.
It spent Y14bn on research and development during the half-year, 12.1 per
cent of its sales.
For the full year to March, Fujisawa expects a 9 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits to Y17bn and a 2 per cent rise in sales to Y233bn. After-tax profits
are expected to increase 7 per cent to Y6.5bn.
Ono Pharmaceutical, a medium-sized Japanese drugs company, also posted firm
first-half profits thanks to its diabetic neuropathy drug. Sales for the
half-year to September grew 16.2 per cent to Y45.9bn. Pre-tax profits rose
10.3 per cent to Y17.5bn. Net profits rose 2.7 per cent to Y7.4bn.
For the year to March, Ono expects a 14.8 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
to Y34.4bn on a 17.2 per cent increase in sales to Y93bn.

FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Tiger Oats shrugs off poor
trading conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIGER Oats, the food manufacturer in the South African Barlow Rand group,
overcame difficult trading conditions to record a 16 per cent increase in
attributable earnings to R335m (Dollars 111.6m) for the 12 months to
September from R289m for the year before.
Turnover rose by 15 per cent to R9.2bn from R7.98bn, and operating profits
advanced 13 per cent to R677m from R598m. Owing to the larger number of
shares in issue, earnings per share were only 11 per cent up, at 230 cents
against 207 cents. The dividend is being lifted by a similar amount to 79
cents per share from 71 cents.
Mr Robbie Williams, chairman, said the depth of the recession was evident
from the fact that there were declines in volume terms of nearly half of the
grocery categories measured in South Africa's leading retailers.
He said, however, that volumes in basic foodstuffs had held up and Tiger
Oats had been able to increase its market share.
Mr Williams said there had been real growth in turnover across all the main
areas of Tiger Foods.
Referring to other group activities, he said pharmaceutical companies Adcock
Ingram and Logos had been helped by new products to perform well. Oceana,
the fishing group, also achieved good results following increased landings
of fish.
Mr Williams said short-term prospects 'do not look at all promising', but
said Tiger Oats was expecting an improvement in the year ahead, although
this could be weighted towards the second half of 1993.
Rand Mines, the mining arm of the Barlow Rand group which was split into
four businesses at the beginning of October, reported a 4 per cent fall in
earnings from continuing operations to R173.4m in the year to September from
R181.1m.

CERAMCO, the New Zealand lingerie maker, is to launch its products in Europe
and Canada, after a 50 per cent sales rise in Australia in the six months to
June 30, the company said yesterday.
The boost in Australian sales followed Ceramco's purchase of Hickory
Fashions.
Ceramco doubled interim pre-tax profits after extraordinary items to
NZDollars 15.03m (USDollars 7.9m). Sales rose 26 per cent to NZDollars
78.24m.
Net profits edged ahead to NZDollars 7.5m from NZDollars 7.17m.

48.8%

<TEXT>
YAMAHA Motor, the world's second largest motorcycle maker, yesterday
reported a 48.8 per cent fall to Y2.57bn (Dollars 20.8m) of parent-company
pre-tax profits in the half-year to September, from Y5.03bn a year earlier.
Although Yamaha's export sales were almost unchanged at Y132bn, domestic
sales slipped by 14.2 per cent to Y92.77bn, reflecting the weak state of
consumer spending in Japan. Total sales were down by 6.5 per cent to
Y224.83bn.
Total motorcycle sales fell from 454,000 to 429,000 units, although within
the total export sales rose by 9,000 units to 213,000. Weak sales to Europe
were balanced by stronger markets in Asia and North America. The total value
of motorcycle sales fell by Y3.67bn to Y108.6bn.
Sales of marine equipment, such as outboard motors and leisure craft, were
down sharply from Y53.49bn to Y44.01bn.
Sales of special equipment - such as golf carts, generators, and ski
vehicles - were healthier, up from Y26.17bn to Y30.22bn. Sales of car
engines to car manufacturers slipped by Y3.49bn to Y17.19bn.
The company said the outlook was bleak.

FT  12 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Edgar to tackle the paper
mountain - Patrick Harverson reports on the installation of the SEC's
electronic filing system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every year the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is deluged with an
estimated 10m pages of documents filed by US and foreign corporations and
investment companies. The documents cover everything from share prospectuses
to detailed earnings reports and data on stock ownership.
And each year the time-consuming and inefficient system the SEC uses to
assemble the mountain of paper, examine its contents and distribute the
information to the public, becomes ever more costly to maintain, threatening
to undermine the agency's ability to effectively regulate the industry.
Now, after more than nine years and Dollars 70m in the making, a new
electronic filing system is ready to revolutionise the way corporate
information is disseminated in the US.
The new system, called Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval, or
Edgar for short, will allow companies to electronically file the 300 or so
different forms required by the SEC. Edgar will also enable the SEC, headed
by Mr Richard Breeden since 1989, to assemble and examine via computer the
information in those forms. It will also allow public access to all
SEC-filed corporate documents via computer databases.
The idea behind Edgar is that it will make it easier and quicker for
companies to file documents to the authorities (an IBM-compatible personal
computer is the only technology that companies will need). It will also cut
the cost and time the SEC spends handling the information, and widen public
access to it.
So far only a few hundred companies have volunteered to file electronically
via Edgar, but by the middle of next year mandatory filing will begin, and
if everything goes to schedule, the 14,000 or so companies that regularly
file with the SEC will all be using the system by mid-1996 .
Yet in spite of its obvious usefulness, Edgar has been dogged by controversy
throughout its nine-year life. Criticisms have concentrated on the cost and
time it has taken to build the system, and on the lack of public access to
the information it collects.
Edgar's life started in 1983 when an SEC staffer wrote a paper recommending
automating the filing process. A prototype version was built the following
year. The original plan was for the pilot system to last two years, but it
lasted until this summer, when it was replaced by the operational system.
The project fell badly behind schedule primarily because of a fight over
funding. The SEC originally wanted Edgar to pay for itself by charging firms
to subscribe to the system, but Congress, always reluctant to cede control
of the purse-strings on government projects, insisted otherwise.
After much debate, it was agreed the public dissemination sub-system - the
part that allows vendors to sell the information gathered on Edgar to the
public - would be the only element financed privately. The rest of the money
would come from the public purse.
Deciding who should build Edgar also slowed things down. The task of running
the pilot system was originally given to Arthur Andersen, but in late 1987
the SEC decided it needed a new contractor for the operational system.
Changing horses midstream, however, led to wrangles over the choice of the
new contractor, and further delays. After a detailed and lengthy review
process, the job of developing the operational project was awarded in early
1989 to a five-company consortium consisting of BDM International, Bowne &amp;
Co, CompuServe, Disclosure Inc and Mead Data Central.
When the new contractors were chosen, the SEC hoped Edgar would be ready by
the end of 1990. But further problems set the date back. The biggest single
reason for the delay was the SEC's insistence on adding to an ever-expanding
list of rules and requirements for Edgar users.
In a report by the General Accounting Office (GAO) released in September,
the SEC was severely criticised for continually changing the list of user
requirements. The original list of 350 requirements in 1989 ballooned to
1,000 by the start of this year.
The GAO said the SEC failed to exercise 'top management oversight' to
control the rapidly expanding list of functional changes in the system.
Mr John Penhollow, director of planning and administration in the SEC's
office of information technology, says reaching a consensus on the
requirements was difficult: 'It took a long time to get agreement on
requirements, but it is unrealistic for any agency that is building a system
of this magnitude and complexity to believe that any one group of people can
write down all the requirements that should be included.'
Development of the Edgar project has also been interrupted by the complaints
of consumer groups, who have argued that the cost of gaining access to the
information on the system will be prohibitively expensive.
Critics argue that access to Edgar would be limited to a few terminals in
reading rooms in three cities - New York, Chicago and Washington DC  - and
that charges levied by vendors of Edgar information will put the information
out of reach to the general public.
The delays have inevitably pushed up Edgar's costs. In 1989 it was
originally estimated the system would cost Dollars 51.5m. This summer that
figure stood at Dollars 70.2m.
By the time the system is fully operational in 1996 (assuming there are no
more major delays), Edgar is expected to have cost Dollars 78.3m, a 52 per
cent increase over the initial estimate.
Furthermore, there is no guarantee that Edgar will be ready by the target
date of mid-1993. The SEC is still receiving and responding to comments from
the industry on the proposed rules for Edgar that it published in August.
Congress will also want another look at the system, to respond to questions
about funding and public access, and given the pace at which legislative
inquiry progresses, Edgar's troubles may not be over.

FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Pemex revamps borrowings with
Dollars 350m bond issue
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PETROLEOS Mexicanos, Mexico's state-owned oil company, is set to announce
today a significant departure in its foreign-borrowing programme, with the
issue of at least Dollars 350m of bonds in the New York market, to be backed
by the company's deliveries of oil into the US.
The use of oil receivables for the first time by Pemex will allow it to
reduce significantly the costs of borrowing.
Mexico is rated just below investment grade when it borrows in its own name.
Backing the issue with receivables has secured a single-A rating, well into
investment grade and thereby securing a significantly wider group of
potential investors.
The issue, being arranged by Citicorp, is expected to be priced at 165 basis
points over the five-year US Treasury note. It carries a final maturity of
seven years, with an average life of five years.
The issue may be further expanded with an issue of Dollars 100m of bonds to
small banks that have shown interest in the bonds.
According to Mr Ernesto Marcos, corporate director of finance at Pemex, such
issues in the US could significantly exceed Dollars 1bn. Further issues in
Europe and Japan, backed by oil deliveries to these regions, are also
conceivable.
The issue forms part of a significant borrowing programme for Pemex.
The company's five-year plan calls for an investment programme of Dollars
20bn-Dollars 22bn between 1993 and 1998, of which up to 40 per cent may be
borrowed and the rest internally generated.
In addition, Pemex wants to repay a significant amount of other external
debt, including a long-standing bankers' acceptance facility arranged
through Bank of America of up to Dollars 4bn.
Mr Marcos said the company was considering a future registration with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in the US, a move which would intensify
the financial discipline on the company.
'What we are looking for is the discipline of regular disclosure in
financial markets,' he said.

earnings rise

<TEXT>
TURNER Broadcasting System, the media and entertainment group that controls
the CNN cable network, yesterday posted third-quarter net income of Dollars
12.5m, or 5 cents a share, up from Dollars 7.4m, or 1 cent, a year ago.
Gains from the company's entertainment operations offset weaker performances
from its sports, news and real estate businesses.
Stripping out extraordinary items in both years, earnings stood at 2 cents a
share, against a loss of 1 cent a share last year. Operating profits were 8
per cent higher at Dollars 64m, while revenues rose 16 per cent to Dollars
456.4m from Dollars 392.6m
Revenues from the entertainment division rose 11 per cent to Dollars 23m,
including Dollars 10m from several start-up operations in 1991 and the
acquisition of the Hanna-Barbera animation studio. Increased advertising
revenue also contributed to the improvement. Operating profits from
entertainment rose 18 per cent to Dollars 43.6m.
Operating earnings from Turner's news division, which includes CNN, fell 3
per cent to Dollars 36.4m, from Dollars 37.6m, although revenues rose 15 per
cent to Dollars 126.9m from Dollars 110.1m. The company blamed the costs of
covering the US election, and increased costs associated with international
operations.
Operating profits from the sports division, which includes an equity stake
in the Atlanta Braves football team, tumbled to Dollars 493,000 from Dollars
2m.
For the nine months, the group lifted net income to Dollars 47.9m from
Dollars 42.5m, which took earnings per share to 19 cents, against 6 cents.
Revenues were Dollars 1.23bn, compared with Dollars 1.08bn.

TELECOM Argentina, one of the country's two privatised telephone companies,
has almost trebled 1992 net profit to about Dollars 150m in the financial
year to September, from Dollars 53.3m in 1991. However, the company would
not provide other data.
Last week, Telefonica de Argentina, the largest telecom operator, also
reported net income up sharply with a 88 per cent rise to Dollars 222m and a
57 per cent increase in sales to Dollars 1.63bn.
However, the 1991 figures for both companies are slightly understated
because they cover an 11-month accounting period.
Argentina's two telephone companies have posted impressive gains after the
notoriously inefficient and corrupt state company was privatised in November
1990.
Gains have come from a big increase in lines, a steep reduction in jobs and
indexed telephone charges, further magnified by an overvalued exchange rate.
Consumers, however, permanently complain of poor service, despite company
efforts to tighten up management. Telecom says it invested Dollars 770m in
1992.

FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Nintendo set to make top three
in profit league
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NINTENDO, the Japanese video game manufacturer, is likely to replace
Matsushita, the world's largest consumer electronics company, as the third
largest profit earner among listed manufacturing companies in Japan in
fiscal year 1993.
The change in fortune stems largely from the sharp fall in Matsushita's
earnings rather than from any dramatic increase in profits from Nintendo.
Industry analysts in Japan said that in the year to March 1993 they expect
to see Nintendo emerging third in profits earned among the non-financial
companies, after Toyota, the automobile manufacturer and Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone, the telecommunications group.
The forecast rise in Nintendo's ranking came as the company prepared to
unveil interim pre-tax profits next week.
For the full year to March 1993, which will include results from the
important Christmas selling season, Nomura Research Institute forecasts
parent current profit for Nintendo of Y167bn (Dollars 1.35bn) against Y156bn
in 1991.
Matsushita, which sells internationally under the Panasonic and Technics
brand names, is forecasting parent current profit of Y102bn, down from
Y196bn a year ago.
Last month, Matsushita reported interim pre-tax profits down 51 per cent at
Y52.3bn on sales down 7 per cent to Y2,294bn.
In contrast to the sluggish demand experienced by consumer electronics
products overall, video games have been enjoying strong sales in major
markets.
Nintendo's popular games characters - Mario, in particular - have a wide
following. Mario is to be featured in a film to be released next year.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Bund dealers sceptical over rate cut
prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN government bonds ended lower, led by a fall in short-dated issues as
the bund market appeared increasingly sceptical over prospects for a
near-term cut in interest rates.
The Bundesbank left interest rates unchanged at 8.75 per cent in yesterday's
securities repurchase tender, dampening hopes of a cut in official interest
rates. The central bank drained a net DM5.7bn of liquidity from the money
market, but dealers said the drain was 'technical' rather than an indication
of Bundesbank policy.
Dealers said short and medium-dated issues showed the biggest falls, with
investors taking profits in the five-year area where the gains have been
strongest in recent days. They also noted some extension trades, with
investors switching from five-year to 10-year bunds.
The Liffe bund futures contract fell from a high of 91.57 to end at 91.47
while the DTB's December Bobl future fell from Tuesday's close of 96.06 to
95.90.
THE UK government bond market ended lower at the long end, but activity was
subdued ahead of Chancellor Norman Lamont's Autumn Statement.
Short-dated gilts traded in a narrow range and ended little changed or
weaker, although dealers said the short-end was underpinned by hopes of a
base-rate cut and a 'bond-positive' Autumn Statement.
The Liffe gilt future contract fell from the opening of 102.12 to 102.01 by
late afternoon on average volume.
Long-dated issues rallied initially, allowing the Bank of England to sell
the remainder of its Pounds 1bn tap stock, the 8 per cent gilt due 2009
which was announced last Friday.
The 9 per cent gilt due 2008 ended at 104 1/32 , down from 104 7/32 , to
yield 8.52 per cent while the 9 3/4 per cent stock due 2002 fell from 111
1/2 to 111 7/16 .
ELSEWHERE in Europe Italian government bonds closed higher on hopes of a cut
in official interest rates, following the easing in money market rates. The
Liffe December BTP contract ended up 40 basis points at 94.88.
JAPANESE government bonds jumped in afternoon trading as a drop in the stock
market rekindled hopes of an interest rate cut.
The rally was mainly in the futures market with the March contract, which
acquired benchmark status on Tuesday, rising from 107.26 to end at 107.49.
In the cash market, the yield on the No 145 moved from 4.655 per cent at the
opening to close at 4.625 per cent.
The Nikkei index fell 118.96 points to end at 16,318.15, leading to
speculation in the bond market that the Bank of Japan may be forced to ease
monetary policy and cut the Official Discount Rate.
US bond markets were closed for the Veterans' Day Holiday.

FT  12 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Focus falls on sterling ahead of Autumn
Statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING provided the talking points in the international bonds market
yesterday. The sector was in an optimistic mood ahead of the Autumn
Statement by the chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont. As one trader put it, people
appeared to be buying the top names whatever the spread.
Confirming the interest in sterling bonds from elite names, Barclays de
Zoete Wedd brought two triple-A rated issues to market.
The first was from European Investment Bank, which launched its first bond
in the currency since Italy withdrew its withholding tax exemption on
foreign bond investments.
Judging the pricing for the Pounds 200m 5 1/4 -year 7 per cent issue without
the support of Italian investors made life difficult for sole underwriter
Barclays de Zoete Wedd. It said demand was strong despite the very tight
terms, 17 basis points over the reference gilt which is also partly paid.
BZW said demand came particularly from overseas investors who get a hedge
against a further weakening of the pound if interest rates fall in line with
expectations. The indications are that the issue was swapped into
floating-rate sterling at around Libor minus 30 to 32 basis points.
The EIB says it has borrowed, or is committed to borrow, around
Ecu12bn-equivalent so far in 1992, and plans to borrow Ecu1bn to Ecu1.5bn
more before the end of the year. It hopes to tap the Portuguese market for
around Esc15bn, and raise the balance probably in US dollars, Japanese yen
and French francs.
BZW's second top-rated borrower of the day was National Grid, making its
debut in the Eurobonds market, also with a Pounds 200m 5 1/4 -year bond.
Sparks flew in some quarters over the pricing on this transaction, after the
spread was presented variously as 20 and 43 basis points over comparable
gilts. Both proved to be correct: two quite different gilts were being used
as benchmarks.
The higher level was the one on which the professionals based their
reactions, but the confusion underlined for many the drawbacks of using the
gilts market to set prices. None of the gilts is a perfect measure of value,
as yields have come down so sharply, although a new current coupon frame of
reference is being established in the five- to six-year maturities.
Some bankers described the issue as clearly mispriced. National Grid could
have saved itself up to a further 20 basis points, they argued, but it
appears to have been happy to pay a premium to ensure the success of its
debut issue. 'We're very content,' said treasurer Mr Martin O'Donovan.
The Guinness Pounds 150m issue launched on Tuesday by JP Morgan duly broke
syndicate but suffered from the launch of National Grid, its spread widening
by several basis points.
Set to continue the internationalisation of the D-Mark is a DM1.5bn bond to
be launched today on behalf of Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW). The
maturity will be five years and the spread between 21-24 basis points over
comparable government bonds.
The issue will represent the borrower's biggest yet and the first by a
German entity using the fixed-price reoffer system.
Deutsche Bank will lead the bond, which will be launched through KfW
International Finance, the Delaware-based vehicle used by KfW for more than
30 foreign currency bond issues so far.
'This has been created for investors who want Eurobond features in a D-Mark
investment,' said Mr Gunther Braunig for KfW, which feels it is important to
broaden investor demand for D-Mark product. 'We want to give them large
liquid transactions syndicated by banks with placement power and market
making capabilities.'
Dresdner Bank's shares fell back on the announcement of the DM750m five-year
equity-linked deal it led for itself.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Last LME sterling metal prices
to go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Metal Exchange yesterday decided to end its tradition of quoting
copper and lead prices in sterling during the twice-daily open outcry
sessions in the 'ring' and in kerb (after hours) trading. From July next
year these metals, like the other five traded on the exchange, will be
quoted in US dollars.
LME members previously had resolutely stood against this change, some
claiming trading in sterling often provided opportunities to make extra
profit from arbitrage and foreign exchange transactions.
However, minds were changed during the recent turmoil in currency markets,
which resulted in the UK's withdrawal from the European Community's exchange
rate mechanism. Dealers complained that trading virtually ground to a halt
at that time because it was impossible to convert sterling prices into
dollars on forward contracts.
After members put on pressure for the change, the LME held a poll. Dealers
said about 70 per cent of those who voted favoured trading copper and lead
in dollars and the LME board voted for the change at yesterday's meeting.
The US currency is already used almost exclusively in inter-office copper
and lead trading.
Mr David King, the LME's chief executive, said talks were going on with
members and industrial users of the exchange to find the right mechanism to
ensure an orderly transition from sterling to dollars.
Yesterday's move inevitably will increase pressure from some members for LME
copper warehouses to be established in the US. They see this as an important
step towards winning more North American copper hedging business away from
the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex). Mr King said, however, that the
currency move had no connexion with any plan to establish LME copper
warehouses in the US and added that this question had not arisen at
yesterday's meeting.
Credit Lyonnais Rouse, part of the Credit Lyonnais banking group of France,
was yesterday accepted as a ring-dealing member of the LME, taking the total
to 17. There were 29 ring-dealing members in 1980 but the numbers have
dropped mainly because of the traumas arising from the 1985 tin crisis,
which at one point threatened the very existence of the LME, but also
through mergers. The exchange recently set up a working group of
non-executive directors to study why most recent entrants have opted for
associate, rather than ring-dealing, membership.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India worried about rise in
imports of cashew nuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA IS becoming increasingly dependent on the import of raw cashew nuts to
sustain a high level of export of cashew nut kernels.
Strong growth in the domestic demand for cashew nuts, much to the surprise
of commodity experts, has eaten into India's exportable surplus. As a result
the country will have to import about 100,000 tonnes of raw nuts to maintain
its share of more than 50 per cent of the world trade in cashew nut kernels.
In 1987-88 imports amounted to 42,600 tonnes.
Traders say India cannot continue to depend on raw cashew imports
indefinitely as the East African countries that supply them are rapidly
developing mechanised cashew processing facilities of their own. India has
nearly 532,000 hectares (1.3m acres) of land devoted to cashew cultivation.
Besides Kerala, the other important growing states are Maharashtra,
Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa.
It is believed that better agricultural techniques could lead to a
substantial improvement in the average productivity from the present 635 kg
a hectare. Moreover, there is scope for bringing more land under the crop,
particularly in the north-eastern states.
Because of its value as a foreign exchange earner - export receipts are
about Rs5.5bn (Pounds 126m) at present - and the huge employment it offers
to the poorer sections of society, the federal and state authorities have
been wooing established business houses to take up cashew cultivation and
export.
The World Bank has also made available a line of credit to promote cashew
cultivation in a number of states.
India's capacity to process raw cashew is almost double the domestic
production of the crop. Without a high level of imports, much of this
capacity will lay idle, throwing hundreds of people out of employment. The
edge Indian cashew enjoys in the world market is largely because of the
quality of manual processing.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Enlightened self-interest in a
multi-racial sugar sector - Philip Gawith on efforts to make up for years of
benign neglect of the mainly black small growers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE SOUTH Africa's politicians make heavy weather of lending
constitutional shape to the new South Africa, a whole range of initiatives
across the business and social spectrum make clear that the transition
process is, in other respects, well under way.
One such initiative is in the sugar industry, one of South Africa's largest
agricultural sectors, which has the unique feature of having a large
non-white component.
Located mainly in the coastal regions of Natal, the industry is split
between the 2,000 almost exclusively white commercial, or quota, growers and
the 40,000, mainly black, small growers. The latter - defined as anyone
producing less than 150 tonnes of sucrose a year - farm about 20 per cent of
the total area under cane, but produce only 10 per cent of the total crop.
In April, however, these growers launched the Small Grower Development
Trust, a move which, seen together with other deregulation initiatives, has
the potential fundamentally to alter the shape and functioning of the
industry.
Although the examples of individual commercial growers assisting their
smaller neighbours are many, going back decades, the industry attitude
tended towards benign neglect rather than any concerted effort at small
grower advancement.
An important exception to this was the formation in 1973 of the Financial
Aid Fund, an effort to assist small growers, most of whom would not have
been eligible for assistance on normal commercial grounds, through provision
of subsidised loans. To the extent that the scheme has contributed to the
dramatic increase in small grower numbers from 3,000 in 1973 to 40,000 now,
the fund has achieved great success.
This surge in numbers, however, must be kept in perspective. With the
average size of farm only about 2.5 hectares (six acres), most of these
units are too small to be viable and act only as supplementary sources of
income, to the tune of R2,000 to R3,000 (Pounds 280 to Pounds 420) a year.
Probably less than 15 per cent of the small growers qualify as proper
farmers, these being the ones with larger than average plots.
Thus although the sugar industry had achieved considerable success in
broadening its base, the development of these new farmers had lagged. Most
of them were not on a viable financial footing, and they were not properly
integrated into industry structures.
They felt disenfranchised and powerless in the running of the industry and a
perception took hold that the industry's interest in them did not extend
beyond viewing them as a source of production.
This is where the trust comes in - an initiative of small growers, supported
by the industry, to promote their personal empowerment and development as
farmers. Essentially it aims to support and assist them in the development,
improvement and extension of their sugar farming operations. There will be
three main phases to its activities - first the development of
administrative and organisational support structures; then offering improved
extension services; and finally provision of further financial support. The
first phase will involve the stationing of administrative officers at all
the mills where small growers deliver cane. Their job will be to improve
communication with small growers, and to provide assistance across a wide
range of training, financial, organisational and other needs.
A total of R70m is being sought both in South Africa and abroad to ensure
the trust's viability. The industry will donate at least R20m over the next
five years, while the small growers themselves intend to levy a sum of 30
cents a tonne of cane to help finance the trust.
Small growers had already benefited from deregulation initiatives in 1990,
allowing those within 30 km (18 miles) of a mill free entry into the
industry - commercial growers must purchase quota - while in 1991 racially
discriminatory restrictions on land ownership were scrapped, to the
potential benefit of small growers.
Although the trust did not have its origins in politics, the greater
attention being given to small grower needs is undoubtedly intertwined with
the political reform process under way in the country since February 1990
when the African National Congress was legalised and its leader, Mr Nelson
Mandela, released from prison. Mr Patrick Sokhela of the newly formed trust
notes: 'We said if the country is changing, there is no way we can carry on
like this'. The grievance being referred to was one of representation -
until a few months ago, representation on the producer body, the South
African Cane Growers Association, was on a 'one tonne, one vote' basis, with
the result that small growers only had three representatives on the board of
37.
Now the composition of the SACGA board has been revised to a
regionally-based structure where small and commercial growers will enjoy
equal representation in each region. Apart from being the necessary
political accompaniment of the trust - empowered people will clearly want
representation - the structural changes in the industry also represent
formal recognition by established interests that there is more to small
growers than how much cane they produce.
One issue is why commercial growers should be so keen on assisting their
poorer colleagues? Clearly there are a number of motives at work here. One
is goodwill - many commercial growers have long provided assistance to small
grower neighbours, so formalising this through the trust is a logical
development. Millers also approve, because the trust holds out the promise
of increased cane deliveries.
The trust is also underpinned by impeccable socio-economic logic. Driving
just north of Durban through parts of Kwazulu - the Zulu homeland
interspersed with Natal - where most of the small growers are, the uplifting
potential of the sugar industry is clear. Where the sugar farmers are
present and successful, lifestyle standards are clearly superior to where
farmers are merely involved in subsistence crops. The distinction is almost
as simple as looking to see whether they live in comfortable,
commercially-built dwellings, or whether they are in more basic mud-huts.
There is also a strong whiff of of enlightened self-interest about industry
support for the trust initiative. After all, with white agriculture in South
Africa apprehensive about how it will fare under a future government, what
better defence for the sugar industry than the presence in its midst of the
largest semi-commercial black farming sector in the country, supported by
its richer partners in a way which amounts to affirmative action?
Mr Mike Mathews, executive director of the South African Sugar Association -
the body that administers the industry on behalf of growers and millers -
concedes that the industry has not done as much as it might, in the past, to
help small growers, but adds, 'I don't think anybody in this country can say
they did enough, or did all they could'. He also adds that the sugar
industry's record enjoys favourable comparison with just about any other
agricultural sector in the country.
Although the trust's aims are admirable, the challenges it faces are
formidable. As mentioned, many small farmers are on sub-economic units, not
least because traditional systems of land tenure mean that farmers do not
own the land they farm; it is held by the chief and hence consolidation of
plots into a larger entity requires more than a willing buyer and a willing
seller. Empowerment also means grappling with basic problems like literacy.
There is also more that can be done to help the small grower. Thus there is
pressure to have small grower redefined as one producing not 150, but 200
tonnes of sucrose a year (though 150 tonnes of sugar currently grosses about
R100,000 - a not inconsiderable sum); and to have the 30-km restriction
limit removed. Means also need to be found of allowing these farmers to
obtain access to preferential Land Bank loans from which they are at present
excluded, owing to factors of size and risk.
For both political and economic reasons, these are challenges that simply
have to be overcome. If there is any area in agriculture where there exists
a reasonable platform from which to develop a sizeable number of black
commercial farmers, it is in sugar.

London ROBUSTA coffee futures, after several days of retracement, extended
early gains in a late rally thought to be caused by fresh speculator buying.
The January position ended the day Dollars 29 up at Dollars 937 a tonne. The
advance may have been encouraged by new that Brazilian October coffee
exports were 810,000 tonnes lower than in the same month last year at 1.36m
bags (60 kg each). COCOA prices surrendered some of the previous day's gains
as dealers said the market was consolidating after recently reaching
nine-month highs. They noted light industry buying but said producers were
mostly sidelined, although there had been small West African sales in nearby
months. GOLD and SILVER prices steadied following Tuesday's sharp setbacks,
which traders said had left gold heavily oversold. At the London Metal
Exchange COPPER prices edged higher following Tuesday's rally, but early
gains in the NICKEL market were wiped out by merchant selling. The ZINC
market, lacking follow-through after an early rally, closed virtually
unchanged.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Go-ahead expected for S African
aluminium project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALUSAF, THE aluminium producer in South Africa's Gencor group, looks set
today to give the go-ahead to the development of a 466,000 tonnes-a-year
smelter that will catapult it into fifth place in the world primary
aluminium production league.
Analysts in Johannesburg yesterday agreed that the project would be given
the go-ahead following a tough struggle to raise the necessary finance.
There is speculation, however, that the company will not, as originally
planned, be listed on the stock exchange, because of the poor market
sentiment currently prevailing.
The financial plan is for a total of R6.7bn (Pounds 940m) of new capital to
be raised, the equity portion of this representing R3.1bn. Gencor and the
Industrial Development Corporation will be putting up R1bn and R800m
respectively, while Alusaf was seeking the balance of R1.3bn from local
institutions.
Mr Dave Russell, analyst at stockbrokers Irish &amp; Menell Rosenberg, said he
believed that Escom, the electricity supply utility, would be contributing a
portion of the equity funding following reluctance on the part of smaller
institutions to commit themselves to funding a project where there will be a
delay of about four years before returns are received. That difficulties
were encountered in raising funds is evident from the fact that the share
placing with institutions was originally supposed to close on October 28,
with listing of the company set by the sponsoring brokers for November 4.
The existing Alusaf smelter, with its capacity of 170,000 tonnes a year, is
a small and uncompetitive producer with only a 0.9 per cent global market
share. With the new capacity in place on the likely completion date in
October 1996, Alusaf's ultimate tonnage will be equivalent to 3.6 per cent
of present global production.
Mr Mike Wuth, mining analyst at stockbrokers Rice Rinaldi said yesterday
that the timing of the project was excellent, coming as it did with the
aluminium market at or near the bottom of a downturn. Although the industry
is at present experiencing difficult times with low metal prices rendering a
considerable portion of world production uneconomic, there is a view that
the industry will be facing a shortage of aluminium by the middle of the
decade.
Sumitomo Corporation of Japan, one of the world's largest metal trading
groups, recently estimated that by 1995 annual demand for aluminium would
outpace supply by 1.23m tonnes.
Alusaf has obtained favourable long-term contracts for the supply of alumina
and power which will shift it towards the bottom of the cost curve when
world aluminium prices are low.
At the London Metal Exchange yesterday the cash aluminium price rose by
Dollars 16 to Dollars 1,163 a tonne, but that was only about Dollars 80
above the life-of contract low reached last year.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Survey of Jordan (1): King strikes sombre note - The
Hashemite Kingdom is emerging from the political, economic and diplomatic
straits caused by the Gulf War. But King Hussein's health problems and the
challenges of the Middle East peace talks raise some difficult questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST as Jordan had begun to rise out of the economic and political trough
into which it plunged during the Gulf crisis of 1990-91, a new and deep
worry has arisen over the health of King Hussein who for 40 years has
anchored the nation through countless emergencies.
Surgery for cancer that the King underwent in the US in August sent a
shudder of fear through Jordanians over how long he may have to live and
what might follow his reign.
The deeply unsettling prospect of his death was addressed by the King
himself earlier this month in a sombre television speech. Telling his
subjects that he did not yet know whether he was cured, the monarch, who
will be 57 on November 14, appeared to be preparing the nation for the
worst. 'I wish to say to you that the life of an enlightened people and a
vibrant nation cannot be measured by the life of an individual,' he said.
The King's illness has struck at a time when Jordanians have looked to him
as perhaps never before to chart them through formidable challenges.
Although the economy has undergone a dramatic upturn this year, and the
international isolation that Jordan underwent in the Gulf crisis has eased,
complex issues confront the kingdom.
The surge in the economy must be sustained if the country is to cope with
the burden of a sudden 10 per cent population increase caused by the arrival
over the past year of some 300,000 Palestinians expelled from Kuwait and
other Gulf states.
In the Middle East peace negotiations, Jordan must not only try to make
peace with Israel on its own account, but will also have to work out a
future relationship with the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza.
Meanwhile, the King has been the key figure in the management of a gradual
process of democratisation that has allowed Islamic fundamentalists a
political voice beyond the limits permitted in most Arab countries.
The irony of the King's illness is that it has emerged when he appears more
secure and in command of his kingdom than ever. Since his grandfather
Abdullah established - with British backing - his family's rule over Jordan
in 1921, the Hashemites have struggled to entrench their hold over a
resource-starved country carved more or less arbitrarily out of the desert
and latterly peopled mostly by Palestinians originally from west of the
Jordan River.
Now King Hussein is more popular than at any time since he succeeded his
father in 1952. The acclaim he won at home for his refusal to back his Gulf
neighbours and the US against Baghdad in the war to oust Iraq from Kuwait
has not waned. His reward was a triumphal welcome home on September 24 when
he returned from the US.
In an interview for this survey, conducted in his office behind doors
guarded by sword-wielding, black-coated Circassian sentries, the King said
he had never expected to experience 'that kind of warmth and feeling and
concern in my lifetime. I was deeply moved.'
To the layman's eye, the King seemed well and in good spirits. For the
moment at least, he and his government, led by Sharif Zeid Bin Shaker, the
prime minister, can take satisfaction from the evident improvements in the
past year.
In the economy, an inflow of capital in the form of aid from western
countries and money brought in by the Palestinian 'returnees' has more than
compensated for the loss of Gulf aid and remittances. Much of the
Palestinian money has been invested in a private-sector construction boom
that has driven up real GDP growth this year to 11 per cent.
This has eased the pressure of the heavy cost of coping with the population
increase. Exporters have proved adroit at finding substitutes for the
once-dominant Iraqi market and tourism has bounced back to 1989 levels,
easing the current account deficit.
The government was expected this week to conclude a new standby agreement
with the IMF, its third since the economy lurched into a debt crisis in
1989. Jordan's Dollars 8bn foreign debt has been brought under tight
management, with a rescheduling agreement struck earlier this year with the
Paris Club of sovereign borrowers and a buy-back deal secured with Moscow
for a big tranche of Russian debt.
The worrying side of the economy is high unemployment and historically high
poverty levels. These could help stir political discontent. But the
improving economy has provided a helpful backdrop to the delicate task
facing King Hussein of rebuilding international relations sorely damaged by
the Gulf crisis.
A toughening of Jordan's policing of UN sanctions against Iraq earlier this
year has solidified links with Washington. Cool relations with Egypt were
warmed by a visit that the King paid to President Hosni Mubarak immediately
after the Cairo earthquake in October. Next on the list that the King would
like to visit is Saudi Arabia.
The King has also begun publicly to distance himself from the Iraqi regime
of Saddam Hussein. In his FT interview, he did so in the plainest terms he
has used so far. Speaking of his concern that Iraq may fragment, with
consequences for the region 'too horrible to imagine', he said:
'I would like to be absolutely clear that I am not, nor was I ever, ready to
link Jordan, or myself, or my House to the possibility of an association
with a group in power that might eventually go down in history as partially
responsible, if not totally responsible, for the destruction of Iraq.'
He called for 'respect for human rights, pluralism, democracy' in Iraq.
'There has to be change,' he said.
Pluralism and democracy are the King's constant themes for Jordan also. In
the past three years, he has allowed elections to the lower house of
parliament, legalised political parties and promulgated a National Charter
guaranteeing political freedoms, while upholding the supremacy of the
monarchy.
The chief result has been a surge to prominence of Islamic fundamentalists
who form the biggest parliamentary bloc. Tensions between the Palace and
parliament have been highlighted recently by the trial of two Islamic MPs
who this week were jailed for 20 years for plotting to overthrow the state
with Iranian help.
Many see the case as a clear signal that the limits of democracy in Jordan
will be tightly circumscribed by the King, particularly if the main
beneficiaries are Moslem radicals. There may be seeds of discontent here
which could grow into political problems. But the King insists: 'I don't
think anyone should worry. We are totally committed to democracy, to
pluralism, to respect for human rights.'
Most Jordanians see the King as the best guarantee the country has of
stability; hence the concern over his health. In his television address,
King Hussein stressed that continuity would prevail after his demise. His
designated successor is his younger brother.
Crown Prince Hassan, 45, has long experience of state affairs. But concern
about his ability to cope with pressure is widely expressed in private in
Amman. 'Constitutionally, it is not an issue,' says a former prime minister.
'Nor should it be. But people are talking.'
Part of the uncertainty stems from the strains anticipated if there is a
peace settlement with Israel. In that case, some kind of confederation with
a Palestinian entity on the West Bank will have to be worked out. This is
likely to cause difficulties both within the Palestinian community and
between Palestinians and East Bank Jordanians.
By no means all Palestinians accept the idea of such a dual state being
presided over ultimately by a Hashemite. Supporters of an Islamic republic
also object. But very many Palestinians and probably the vast majority of
Jordanians have come to regard King Hussein as being the only figure capable
of ensuring stability both on the West and East Banks. Without him, there
are fears for the outcome.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
JORDAN'S returnees have given the kingdom's banks something akin to a course
of financial steroids. As the estimated 300,000 returnees repatriated their
savings, foreign currency deposits shot up to Dollars 3.2bn in July, against
Dollars 1.4bn at the end of the Gulf war in February 1991.
This huge one-off boost pumped vigour into the banking system: total private
sector deposits, excluding government and interbank deposits, rose 54 per
cent in 1991, overall assets by June this year were up 58 per cent on 1989
at JD5.97bn and the average liquidity ratio of Jordan's commercial banks
stood in June at 65.9 per cent, well over twice the 30 per cent legal
minimum required by the central bank.
But what pleases the central bank most is that this huge influx has not
translated itself into a burst of inflation which would have jeopardised
Jordan's attempts to meet International Monetary Fund targets. The central
bank estimates that inflation will fall this year to 5 or 6 per cent, after
annual rates of 8.2 per cent and 16.1 per cent in 1991 and 1990.
In April last year, the bank imposed tight credit limits on Jordan's banks
to prevent just such a burst, limiting private lending to 10 times a bank's
capital and reserves, or to 90 per cent of its dinar deposits - the latter
aimed at restricting banks' ability to lend on the back of the big rise in
foreign currency deposits.
As a result of the strictures, loans and advances of the 15 main commercial
banks have risen just 10 per cent over the past year, mostly to corporate
customers. The greater part of bank's surplus holdings have found their way
overseas, deposits with foreign banks being up 100 per cent in 1991
over 1990. Amid some signs that Jordan's economic boom was easing, the
central bank removed the credit limits in October. The bank had earlier
approved the reopening of foreign exchange houses in Jordan for the first
time since the country's 68 exchange houses were closed en masse during
Jordan's 1989 currency crisis, which saw the dinar devalued by around 45 per
cent.
However, the dinar has been stable at around its present level for the past
30 or more months and the central bank's foreign currency reserves, worth
JD979m in 1991, stand at more than twice their average level troughout the
1980s.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Survey of Jordan (4): Returnees on the move - The labour
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JORDAN'S labour market is in transition. According to Ministry of Labour
figures, unemployment has risen sharply from 8.9 per cent in 1988 to 16.8
per cent then 18.9 per cent in 1990 and 1991 respectively. But some
economists claim a more accurate figure is more than 30 per cent.
Jordan's traditional labour market in the Gulf has shrunk since the Gulf war
and the status of the 300,000 returnees from Kuwait, of whom an estimated
59,000 are said still to be without jobs, remains largely unknown.
Furthermore, with government statistics showing that 43 per cent of the
population is under the age of 15, the future demand for jobs seems certain
to outstrip supply for years to come.
Government officials talk of 'creating the right atmosphere' for jobs and
'allowing the market to find its own equilibrium'. But few tangible policies
are in evidence.
Apart from institutions such as the Vocational Trainng Corporation (VTC),
which offers retraining for the unemployed, and the Development and
Employment Fund (DEF, which offers low-interest loans for new businesses,
the goverment has largely adopted a laisser faire approach to Jordan's
labour market.
The most successful government initiative appears to be the DEF, which has
allocated JD3.6m towards the establishment of 694 small businesses since it
opened in March 1991. Dr Abdul-Ilah Abu-Ayyash, the its director, DEF has so
far created 2,300 jobs.
Borrowers are given nine years to repay their loans, with a two year grace
period. Some 67 per cent of the new entrepreneurs are graduates. Dr
Abu-Ayyash says he aims to create 6,000 new jobs a year with the help of
more government and overseas funds, including an EC grant.
But according to one official in the prime ministry, the root of Jordan's
unemployment problem is in peoples' attitudes: 'The social value of work
needs updating,' he says.
For one thing, Jordanians tend to reject low salaries and manual labour and
are undercut in these areas by foreign workers. This is pertinently
reflected in the astronomical rise - from 18,000 in 1991 to 92,000 in the
first nine months of this year - in work permits issued by the Ministry of
Labour to non-Jordanians (mainly Egyptians and Syrians) coinciding with the
country's construction boom.
For another, the country's higher education system turns out thousands of
graduates who tend to rely on finding work in government dempartments rather
than in the private sector. An independent study of unemployment in Jordan
by the Royal Scientific Society showed that by the end of 1991, 47.5 per
cent of the unemployed interviewed were university or college graduates.
Figures from the Civil Service Commission show that a total of 75,773
graduates applied for just 3,025 government posts by June 30 this year.
Meanwhile, a new draft labour law is to be presented to PArliament in
December which is described by a Ministry of Labour official as 'a
modernisation of the relationship between employer and employee'.
The legislation will include a minimum wage and a stipulated minimum working
week, provisions for maternity leave and support for the disabled.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Survey of Jordan (2): Silver linings gleam through Gulf
clouds - Mark Nicholson charts the recent surprise upturn in the Jordanian
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STABLE Jordanian dinar, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth this year
of at least 11 per cent and a finance minister gleefully expecting to meet
the next set of International Monetary Fund adjustment strictures, having
comfortably met most of the last?
These are among the indicators which testify to one of Jordan's biggest
recent upturns - and to the kingdom's unexpected good fortune in finding
silver linings to the black clouds which hung over the economy only two
years ago. Quite by surprise, Jordan's economic policymakers find themselves
worried these days not by how to engineer growth, but how to sustain it.
By the end of the war, Jordan had lost most of its biggest export markets in
the Gulf and Iraq. It had been forced to suspend its IMF adjustment
programme - itself forced by a severe foreign exchange crisis in 1989. It
had lost almost all its traditional aid from Gulf countries and was required
somehow to absorb about 300,000 returning Jordanians and Palestinians
evicted by Kuwait - a 10 per cent rise in the country's population.
Estimates of the war's cost to Jordan's tiny economy (GDP this year was
Dollars 3.98bn) ranged from Dollars 1.7bn to Dollars 5bn.
But each setback, in the event, produced some countervailing benefit.
Jordan's exporters, for example, were forced to seek fresh markets and, with
surprising success, found them in Sudan, Yemen, Morocco, Tunisia, eastern
Europe and even in the US.
The loss of about Dollars 400m in annual aid from the Gulf countries,
withheld because of Jordan's pro-Iraqi tilt during the war, prompted Japan
and numerous EC countries to pledge assistance which totalled Dollars 800m
by the end of 1991. This in turn helped Jordan to build its foreign exchange
reserves and meet the conditions of its second IMF programme - which in its
turn helped the country successfully to reschedule Dollars 7.5bn of Paris
Club debts.
As a bonus, tourism to Jordan is already skirting pre-Gulf war levels.
Most significant of all, however, has been the potent economic effect of
Jordan's returnees. The breadwinners among them, 70,000 or so, essentially
represent the professional and technical middle-class of Kuwait; they
returned to Jordan with both skills and money. 'It is the first time in
Jordan's history we have had a huge influx of rich refugees,' remarks a
local businessman.
Repatriation of the returnees' savings poured about Dollars 1.5bn into
Jordan's banking system. As the cohort settled (Mr Michel Marto, deputy
governor of the central bank, estimates that 60 per cent have now been
absorbed into the labour market), these funds began flowing into the
economy, both through strong consumer demand and, most significantly, into
the construction sector. Mr Marto estimates that the construction sector
will account for about half of this year's real GDP growth.
Here lies the rub. Nothing indicates more clearly the one-off nature of the
returnees' fillip to the economy than the proliferation of gleaming new
limestone apartments and villas across Amman's nine hills, where 80 per cent
of the returnees have settled.
The stimulus to the economy has taken its effect before the government has
committed itself to the large infrastructural work which, it believes, the
arrival of 300,000 more people will require. According to Mr Basel Jardaneh,
the finance minister, this will demand at least Dollars 300m on
telecommunications, Dollars 600m on power networks, Dollars 300-Dollars 400m
on water supplies and additional spending on roads.
HthY@and Mr Jardaneh is ruling out syndicated commercial loans, not least
while Jordan has still to reach a rescheduling agreement with the London
Club of commercial creditors over more than Dollars 1bn of debt. The kingdom
will have to stay firmly on-side with the Paris Club - and thus firmly
within IMF performance criteria. Mr Jardaneh says Jordan will be seeking an
additional Dollars 300m from its donors in 1993.
He can point to an impressive record of meeting IMF targets. The budget
deficit, which the IMF wanted to see fall from 17.9 per cent of gdp to 13.7
per cent, is down to 7 per cent; a figure helped by the bonus in customs
duties on imports sucked in by returnees. He expects this to rise slightly
to 8.5 per cent of gdp for 1993, still below an expected IMF target of 11
per cent.
But substantial problems remain. Not the least of these is unemployment,
which the government estimates (conservatively, many believe) at just about
18.9 per cent. More seriously, poverty blights an estimated 24 per cent -
familes living on an income of less than JD101 a month are reckoned below
the poverty line. Three per cent are said to be living in 'absolute
poverty'.
Any hope of creating jobs and hauling people out of poverty will rest on
meeting the IMF's longer-term target of sustainable 4 per cent to 5 per cent
growth - a target Jordan will have to reach very much on its own resources.
Another cost of the returned workers from Kuwait will be the fall in annual
remittance income; before the Gulf war it used to average at least Dollars
400m.
Sustainable growth will depend, therefore, on Jordanians spending some of
what bankers estimate to be savings, held both at home and overseas, of up
to Dollars 7bn on productive and, preferably, manufacturing investment in
Jordan.
Only then will the kingdom succeed in tearing its economic fortunes free of
an historic dependence on the Gulf states. And even then, success will
depend crucially on the outlook for peace with Jordan's immediate
neighbours.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Survey of Jordan (5): Nimble traders on their toes in a
troublesome corner of the world - Mark Nicholson reviews export performance
and prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GIVEN the mayhem wrought by the Gulf crisis on Jordan's export markets, the
fact that the value of the kingdom's exports for 1991 shrank by just under 3
per cent to Dollars 879m is almost something to crow about.
What is more, by the end of this year, Jordan's exports look likely to reach
or exceed pre-war levels, even though the kingdom still does not enjoy full
access to its main local markets.
Exports to Iraq, historically Jordan's biggest trade partner, fell by 53 per
cent in 1991, thanks mainly to the United Nations embargo which permits
Jordan to export only food and medicines across its eastern border.
Worse, bankers and businessmen say trade has thinned further this year; a
result of Iraq's shortage of foreign currency, partly fear among Iraqi
traders after the execution earlier this year of 42 'profiteering' traders
in Baghdad and the Iraqi government's decision recently to ban the import of
more than 140 'luxury' items. Mr Basel Jardaneh, Jordan's finance minister,
puts the cost of the lost Iraqi market at Dollars 100m a year.
Exports to the Gulf also tumbled after the political embargo imposed on
Jordan by Saudi Arabia, in particular, as punishment for the Hashemite
kingdom's Iraqi leanings in the Gulf crisis.
Trade with Saudi Arabia resumed only in November last year and remains at
about 60 per cent of pre-war levels. A full political reconciliation between
King Hussein and King Fahd is almost certainly the pre-requisite of resuming
normal trade.
To compound matters, exports of phosphates - the country's biggest foreign
exchange earner - were hit quite independently by a contraction of demand in
eastern Europe, leaving the industry's exports down by 30 per cent on 1989
levels at Dollars 180m last year.
All this makes Jordan's ability to keep overall export earnings within sight
of pre-war figures the more surprising. It comes, according to bankers and
businessmen in Amman, of extreme nimbleness among Jordan's small-scale
exporting industries in finding new markets. 'The business community here is
remarkably quick on its feet,' says a local banker. 'Businesses have been
going as far as Sudan, Yemen and Tunisia with some success - they even seem
to be getting paid.'
Traders have also managed to find markets in Morocco, China, eastern Europe
and, notably, Russia, with which trade rose by more than 60 per cent in 1991
and will rise further next year under the terms of Jordan's recent agreement
to reschedule Dollars 750m of debt to the former Soviet Union. This includes
an undertaking to supply Dollars 52m worth of Jordanian-made consumer goods
which traders hope will give them a useful foothold in the market.
Aside from phosphates and potash, Jordan's main exports comprise foodstuffs,
exports of which were up 33 per cent to Dollars 117m in 1991,
pharmaceuticals, paints, cosmetics and other light chemical products,
clothing, textiles and locally assembled electronic goods.
But whatever success exporters enjoy in replacing markets damaged by the
Gulf war will not be enough alone to guarantee the home-grown economic
growth on which Jordan must depend, now that there can be no assurance that
Gulf countries will resume their pre-war aid hand-outs.
Exporters will also have to cover the foreign exchange gap left by the
return to Jordan of 300,000 returned workers from Kuwait, who will no longer
be sending home monthly remittance cheques.
The onus on Jordan's export industries is considerable, given the country's
historic appetite for imports, which include almost all its energy needs.
Jordan's merchandise trade deficit in 1991 was Dollars 934m, and its current
account surplus of Dollars 410m the result essentially of remittances rising
to Dollars 796m because of repatriated savings.
Some of this burden will be taken by Jordan's heavy industries of
phosphates, potash and fertilisers, which between them have traditionally
accounted for around half of Jordan's exports by value and which in each
case have substantial expansion plans in train. Mr Jardaneh estimates that
these industries will be earning Jordan 80-100 per cent more than at present
by 1995.
But sustainable growth will also depend on expanding Jordan's light
industries. And with this in mind, the government is - belatedly in the view
of many bankers and traders - acting on several fronts both to help
exporters find markets and to encourage investment, both domestic and
inward, in export industries.
An export credit guarantee agency is planned, and awaiting parliamentary
approval before the year end. The trade ministry is also establishing a
one-stop investment agency, meeting criticism that the government has so far
done little to inform or ease the bureaucracy for potential inward
investors. 'I've never been able to find a single investment guide to
Jordan,' remarks one banker, who says there is nonetheless strong interest
in the country from, among other sources, Cypriot clothing manufacturers.
The appeal for foreign investors lies essentially in Jordan's low-cost
labour, with semi-skilled workers earning an average of around Dollars 100 a
month and skilled workers between Dollars 150-Dollars 200.
But the disincentive, as ever, lies in Jordan's location in such a
politically troublesome corner of the world. Many bankers and traders in
Amman believe that there will be a substantial influx of foreign capital
only when there is a comprehensive and durable regional peace between Israel
and its neighbours.
The government is hoping, meanwhile, that Jordan's own entrepreneurs will
invest in exporting industries - a habit which the greater part of the
kingdom's investors have traditionally forsworn for the shorter-term, more
liquid and thus safer, returns of the financial markets.
However, there are signs that some Jordanians believe the economy's recent
buoyancy and the region's relative peace may last. Jordan's Investment
Development Bank last year approved loans worth Dollars 30m - a threefold
rise on its 1989 commitments. Also, 821 new industrial projects were
registered with the ministry of trade and industry last year, against 451 in
1990. Proposed capital for these projects is Dollars 140m, against Dollars
37m in 1990.
The test will be in the commitment of that money. And the test of that
perhaps lies in Washington, with the participants in the Middle East peace
talks.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Survey of Jordan (7): 'One family' under strain - In Middle
East peace moves, Jordan must face both ways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JORDAN'S role in Middle East peace negotiations has a double aspect which
makes the country a pivotal player.
Not only must it hammer out a settlement on its own account with its
neighbour Israel; it is also inextricably involved in the question of how to
resolve the core dispute between Israel and the Palestinians.
From 1948 until the 1967 Six Day War, Jordan ruled the West Bank and east
Jerusalem, including the Old City, which, with the Gaza Strip, are the areas
the Palestinians and their Arab backers envisage, as they bend their efforts
towards making up a future Palestinian state.
King Hussein renounced Jordan's claim to the West Bank and Jerusalem in
1988, ostensibly clearing the way for the Palestine Liberation Organisation
to push ahead unhindered with its quest for a fully independent Palestinian
nation.
But now, faced with the economic and political difficulties such a putative
state would face, and the opposition to its creation still voiced by Israel,
the Palestinians themselves are looking to forge a new relationship with
Amman based on some kind of confederation.
In effect, therefore, Jordan must not only negotiate with Israel, but also
work out a deal with the Palestinians which would allow the central pieces
of an Arab-Israeli settlement to fall into place.
Jordan is treading cautiously along this second track, afraid of putting the
cart of a future Jordanian-Palestinian relationship ahead of the horse of an
Israeli-Palestinian agreement.
But it accepted the inevitability of such a link in effect when it agreed
that there should be a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation to the peace
talks when they opened in Madrid a year ago.
For the time being, however, the two parties are in practice negotiating
separately with Israel.
The Palestinians are struggling to achieve terms for an interim period of
self-government that would precede a final settlement in which the nature of
a Palestinian-Jordanian relationship would have to be worked out.
In the latest round of talks last month - the seventh since Madrid - Jordan
and Israel drew up a draft agenda on how to proceed to a full peace accord.
In itself something of a breakthrough, the agenda envisages reaching a full
peace treaty, renouncing the use of force.
To get there, the most important issues to resolve are Jordan's claims to
some 400 sq km of territory, mainly along the Wadi Araba frontier south of
the Dead Sea, the fate of the Palestinian refugees that Jordan has taken in
since 1948 and the sharing of water resources.
By themselves, none of these should be too difficult to overcome. But the
Jordanians are committed not to sign a treaty with Israel unless there is
parallel progress between Israel and the other Arab parties, including the
Palestinians.
Meanwhile, the PLO has pushed for the issue of a Jordanian-Palestinian
confederation to be considered sooner rather than later.
Senior members of Fatah, the mainstream PLO faction led by Mr Yasser Arafat,
the organisation's chairman, admit privately that they are anxious to
pre-empt possible violent opposition to an interim agreement with Israel
from radical Palestinian groups, such as Hamas, the Islamic fundamentalist
organisation. They see a firm link with the stable figure of King Hussein
and his security forces as a way to achieve this.
Jordan is not against the idea. King Hussein says the Jordanian-Palestinian
relationship is bound to be close. 'We are members of one family,' he is
fond of saying.
But he is hesitant. On the one hand, the King does not want to arouse
suspicions among many Palestinians that his long-held ambition is to bring
them fully under his rule.
On the other hand, so-called East Bankers - that is, the 40 per cent of the
population of Jordanians who do not originally come from west of the Jordan
River - fear being swallowed in a joint state which would have a heavy
Palestinian majority. King Hussein and his army fought a bloody war against
the PLO in 'Black September' 1970 when he feared the PLO was threatening to
take over Jordan and unseat him.
At present, East Bankers dominate the 150,000-strong armed forces and the
equivalent-sized bureaucracy. Only two out of 29 ministers are Palestinian.
Jordanians fear losing their big stake in the state - fears that were
exacerbated by the influx of 300,000 Palestinians from Kuwait and the Gulf
over the past year.
'The ties between the two people are so interwoven it is impossible to tear
the fabric,' says Mr Kemal Abu Jabbar, the foreign minister. 'But I honestly
don't believe this is the time to negotiate. When the Israelis withdraw,
when there is a Palestinian entity, when it is clear what the Palestinian
jurisdiction is - then we can start to talk of our future relationship.'

FT  12 NOV 92 / Survey of Jordan (6): The genie leaves the bottle -
Fundamentalists dominate parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than most Arab states, Jordan has let the much-feared genie of Islamic
fundamentalism out of the political bottle.
Since 1989, when the first legislative elections were held for more than two
decades, parliament has been dominated by members identified with the
Islamic movement. Their successes have brought ministerial appointments,
albeit in relatively lowly posts.
But while gradual democratisation is the avowed aim of King Hussein, he has
been careful to keep a tight rein on the process to ensure that the country
does not fall into the hands of the Islamicists or, as it almost did in
1970, Palestinian radicals.
The clearest sign of this came in recent months with the trial in the
military state security court of two Islamic fundamentalist members of
parliament. Mr Leith Shbeilat and Sheikh Ya'akub Qarrash were accused on
capital charges with two other men of plotting with Iranian help to
overthrow the regime. Both men received 20-year jail sentences earlier this
week.
Mr Shbeilat, perhaps the most popular and articulate MP, shot to national
prominence as a result of the liberalisation that led to the 1989 elections.
He was one of the Islamicists, most of them associated with the Moslem
Brotherhood, who won 22 of the 80 seats in the House of Representatives, the
lower house of parliament.
Unlike in 1989, when no organised groups were allowed to contest the
election, political parties will be permitted to take part in new elections
next year under a law which took effect only last month.
But of the half-dozen secular parties which have so far applied to register,
none reflects a cohesive ideology or group that looks capable of attracting
mass support. Because of this, and because the Islamicists attract heavy
support from the under-represented Palestinian community, the so-called
Islamic Action Front is widely expected to win at least 30 seats.
This would appear to put the fundamentalist camp on course for even greater
influence. But talk of an Islamic revolution is not much heard in Amman.
'They have no way to convert Jordan into an Islamic state,' says Dr Jamal
Sha'er, a prominent physician-politician. 'I don't believe they are a threat
to the parliamentary system. They can be contained within it.'
One reason lies in the popularity of the King himself, who is now seen as a
bulwark against instability and is, after all, a direct descendant of the
Prophet.
A second reason lies in the structure of the system. In the Jordanian
parliament, 18 lower house seats are reserved for Christians, Circassians
and Bedouin. The 40-seat upper house, the Senate, is appointed by the King.
Any change in the constitution requires a two-thirds majority of both houses
together.
A national charter published by King Hussein in 1991 enshrined the principle
of political freedom. But it also underscored the ultimate power of the
monarchy. A senior foreign diplomat said the coming years will test whether
'parliament will evolve from a body that lets off steam, or will
increasingly take power from the palace.'
Many among Jordan's emerging breed of politicians - Islamicists and
secularists alike - saw the trial of Mr Shbeilat and his colleagues as an
ominous shot across the bows of parliament, whatever the outcome. 'There is
a struggle going on. The implications for democracy are very serious,' said
one senior MP.
King Hussein insists on his commitment to 'democracy, pluralism and respect
for human rights'.
But he also stresses his determination that Jordan should not become a
'battleground' for outside forces; a reference to Palestinian and other Arab
nationalist forces as well as Iranian-inspired fundamentalism. The King
wants a dose of democracy rare in the Middle East - but he does not want a
European-style constitutional monarchy as yet.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Survey of Jordan (9): Culture worth more than camels - The
untapped tourist potential presents a delicate problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WADI RUM, the place where TE Lawrence and the Arab rebels he was riding with
in 1917 were stunned into silence by the 'stupendous' surroundings, must
rank among the world's most impressive desert landscapes.
Yet over a period of four hours on a late October day, when the worst of the
broiling summer heat has faded, not many more than 50 visitors arrived at
the little Bedouin settlement and picturesque 'Beau Geste' police post which
serve as the departure point for journeys by camel or four-wheel drive
vehicles into the sandy-floored Wadi.
More come by bus in the late afternoon to watch the sun set over the great
brown fractured cliffsides towering over either side of the valley. But the
Wadi - about 50km as the crow flies north east of the Red Sea port of Aqaba
 -remains remarkably little tainted by the tramp of tourist masses.
So it is at most of Jordan's rich tourist attractions. At the most famous of
all, the extraordinary rock-cut Nabataean city of Petra, south east of the
Dead Sea, visitor accommodation is still limited to just 400 beds. On the
Dead Sea itself, where the minerals in the water and the atmospheric
conditions provide relief for many skin and other ailments, there is only
one hotel.
Elsewhere, from the beautifully preserved Roman city of Jerash, north of
Amman, to evocative crusader castles such as Kerak, the story is the same:
few tourist facilities, and relatively few tourists.
The government in Amman is well aware of the untapped tourist potential in
the country. It is working to develop the local industry, worried about
being left behind by its neighbours, Egypt, Israel and even the well-oiled
Palestinian tour operators in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem and the West
Bank.
But the authorities are faced with a delicate task. Much of the attraction
of Jordan lies in the unspoilt nature of its sites. To increase volume too
much and too fast could easily be to kill the goose that laid the golden
egg.
This year, tourists have returned to Jordan in large numbers following the
1991 slump induced by the Gulf war - as they have done throughout the east
Mediterranean area. Officials say the volume will match the 1989 peak of
380,000 visitors, reaffirming tourism's place as the country's
second-biggest earning industry. Gross earnings of some Dollars 500m in 1989
accounted for 17 per cent of gross national product.
But Mr Yanal Hikmat, the minister of tourism, says he is anxious to avoid
expanding into the mass market. 'I have always wanted to raise Jordan above
the level of the belly dancers and camel caravans to a more cultural and
educational type of tourism. I think we would be satisfied with 1m visitors
a year by the year 2000, well catered for and well serviced.'
His senior official in the ministry, Mr Nasri Attallah, echoes this. 'Our
success lies in simplicity. Our sites are untouched, they have mystery, they
are uncrowded. Local people still mix with tourists. We very much want to
preserve that.'
Certainly, visitors have up to now benefited from the relative lack of
crowds - and welcome features such as fixed prices for horse and camel rides
at Petra and Wadi Rum that contrast with the chaotic rip-offs endemic to the
tourist industry in Egypt.
But the best intentions may be swept away by fast-growing demand and the
need to keep up with neighbouring competitors. This will be particularly
true if Middle East peace negotiations eventually yield open borders for
tourists. The prospect of Jordan becoming little more than a day trip for
visitors from Israel, Palestine and even Egypt is real and worrying.
Petra, for example, would be easily accessible to day trips from the Israeli
Red Sea resort of Eilat and the neighbouring Egyptian resort of Taba. Both
at present have hotel facilities far more sophisticated than Jordan's Aqaba,
also on the same strip of coast.
'I want to make sure these people stay in Jordan at least two nights and do
not just pass by in one day,' says Mr Hikmat. His overall intention is to
extend the average stay in Jordan beyond the present five to six nights.
To achieve that, Jordan must have the accommodation to compete. So it is
looking to the private sector to invest, providing incentives such as easy
terms for land acquisition and duty free imports. Two new privately-built
hotels will open in Petra next year, doubling local bed capacity. (A further
doubling is planned by 1995.)
But this quickly raises the tricky question of preserving the remoteness of
such sites - which gives them so much of their cachet now. Already the
authorities are considering whether to limit passage into Petra through the
famed 'siq', or narrow defile, to entry only, leading visitors out by an
alternative route.
As Mr Attallah says, Jordan's problem is to expand tourism while wearing
'kid gloves'.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Survey of Jordan (10): Exporters look further east - James
Whittington notes problems in the phosphate trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUGH phosphate exports have fallen by 33 per cent in the past three years,
slashing Jordan Phosphate Mines Company (JPMC) profits from a record 109m
Jordanian dinars in 1989 to just JD33.1m in 1991, the company is still the
world's third biggest phosphate exporter. 'Phosphate remains the oil of
Jordan,' says Mr Thabet Taher, the state-run JPMC's newly-appointed general
manager.
The boon to JPMC offered by Jordan's 45 per cent devaluation in 1989 was
shortlived as the company's traditional eastern European markets collapsed.
In the late 1980s, eastern European countries bought more than 30 per cent
of Jordan's phosphate exports. But these countries' shortage of hard
currency, combined with ambiguity in some of them over who actually owned
previously state-run phosphate processing plants, cut Jordan's exports in
1991 to 0.58m tonnes, from 2.3m tonnes in 1989.
To make matters worse, this decline coincided with the Gulf crisis and the
disruption caused by United Nations-backed inspections of all vessels
entering Jordan's only port, Aqaba.
These factors contributed to a fall in the company's total phosphate exports
to 4.2m tonnes in 1991 from 6.4m tonnes in 1989. And this year shows little
sign of improvement. Just 3.12m tonnes have been shipped in the first nine
months of 1992.
However, the downward trend is by no means unique to J o r d a n. The
International Fertiliser Industry Association (IFA) reports that world
phosphate exports fell by 29 per cent between 1989 and 1991 and the group
forecasts that no substantial recovery is likely before the end of the
century.
The JPMC's response to the prospect of tighter markets has been to shift
trade towards Asia and develop a strategy to raise production of
phosphate-based fertilisers in co-operation with its trading partners.
Contracts with India, for example, have partly replaced already the void
left by eastern Europe. Last year Jordan shipped 1.3m tonnes of phosphate to
India and contracts for 1.6m tonnes have been signed for 1992 - making it
the biggest importer of Jordanian phosphate.
Towards the end of 1991, JPMC signed a Dollars 100m joint venture with
India's Southern Petrochemicals Corporation to produce an annual 200,000
tonnes of phosphoric acid for the Indian market. A new processing plant,
which will be 60 per cent owned by the Indian company and 40 per cent by
JPMC, will be opened in 1995 at Shideya, southern Jordan.
This site, the most recent of the JPMC's three mines, started operations in
1988 and has 790m tonnes of confirmed quality phosphate reserves - some 83
per cent of Jordan's total known reserves.
A similar deal was finalised earlier this year with a Mitsubishi-led
consortium of four Japanese companies which will take a 60 per cent share in
a Dollars 360m compound fertiliser plant, also planned to open in 1995, with
JPMC and the Jordan-based Arab Potash Company (APC) each taking a 20 per
cent share.
Mr Taher sees the future lying in such joint ventures. 'Countries now prefer
to import finished products rather than raw phosphate,' he says. 'It is
cheaper and less damaging to their environment.'
Mr Kazuhiko Sakishima, general manager of the Mitsubishi Corporation's Amman
branch and liaison officer between JPMC and the Japanese consortium, says
that the plant to be built in Aqaba will produce 300,000 tonnes of
fertiliser for Japan, or about 10 per cent of its entire consumption.
Both joint ventures will be built on 'duty-free' zones in Jordan, which
offer investors tax exemption on profits, exemption from duty on imported
machinery and a holiday from income of property tax for up to 12 years.
APC, which is Jordan's second biggest exporter, has meanwhile emerged
largely unaffected by the geopolitical shocks of the past three years and
saw sales rise to Dollars 150m in 1991 from Dollars 130m the previous year.
Miss Miranda Batshon, APC's marketing manager, says the company has profited
from a rise in demand from its Far Eastern markets, particularly China,
which raised its demand last year for Jordanian potash by 47 per cent.
As well as holding a 20 per cent share in the Jordan- Japanese fertiliser
plant in Aqaba, APC has begun a two-phase plan to raise annual production to
2.2m tonnes from the present 1.4m tonnes a year by the end of the century.
Mr Taher says Jordan's phosphates production will rise to 9.6m tonnes by
2000.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Survey of Jordan (8): No bridging the gulf - Aqaba port
needs UN sanctions against Iraq to end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT AQABA on the Red Sea, Jordan's only sea port, the gates to the oil
terminal are kept chained shut.
The jetty is deserted most of the time. Inside the administration building,
a few officials while away the time drinking sweet tea and pondering one
question above all others: when will UN sanctions against Iraq be lifted?
Two years since the onset of the Gulf crisis, Aqaba Port is still suffering
gravely from the lack of transit trade from Iraq it thrived upon in the
1980s.
This year, total cargo handled at Aqaba will be about 14m tonnes. In 1988,
it was more than 20m; the missing 6m tonnes accounted for almost entirely by
the loss of Iraqi business.
Last year, transit container volume collapsed to less than 10,000 tonnes
from almost 240,000 a year before Iraq invaded Kuwait.
Quite apart from the wider impact on the Jordanian economy of the loss of
this trade, Aqaba itself is struggling to make ends meet until the unknown
day when sanctions will end.
The authorities invested heavily in the port in the 1980s to handle
ballooning demand from Iraq when Baghdad's Gulf outlets were blocked by war
with Iran.
The 300,000 tonne per month oil jetty, now idle, was built; so was a new
industrial port and a Dollars 3m communications centre. Two heavy-duty 3,200
horsepower tugboats were bought. A slipway was constructed to bring some
cargoes ashore by barge.
Now the port is operating at only 60 per cent of capacity. Annual revenues
are down to less than 30m Jordanian dinars from JD40m. Though there are
still 2,500 port employees, hundreds of workers previously employed on a
daily-hire basis are no longer needed.
There are other costs as well. Ships coming into Aqaba with cargoes for
Jordan and other transit destinations, such as Syria, are subject to
inspection by naval ships in the Red Sea, policing the sanctions.
Operators have upped charges by Dollars 1,000 per 40 ft container, to take
account of the interference which causes delays and means lighter loads to
allow easy inspection.
Port officials are confident they will win back the Iraqi trade immediately
sanctions are lifted. 'The sanctions will not be for ever,' says Mr Ibrahim
Tayyan, chief of the port's development programme. 'So we are planning
always to expand.' For now, however, the reality in Aqaba is expensive
contraction.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: A decisive day for sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE EVE of the UK chancellor's Autumn Statement, sterling traded quietly
on the foreign exchanges. But some dealers believe that the pound will soon
fall below its current levels against the dollar and the D-Mark whatever Mr
Norman Lamont announces to parliament today, writes James Blitz.
It is 10 weeks since sterling was forced out of the European exchange rate
mechanism, and the currency closed unchanged last night at DM2.4175, some 13
per cent below its former ERM floor against the D-Mark.
Against the dollar it ended at Dollars 1.5260, up 1 1/4 cents but some 48
cents below this year's record high, reached on September 2. The pound's
trade-weighted index closed near its all-time low, at 77.9. In New York it
finished at Dollars 1.5250.
Sterling's fall has been triggered by economic gloom in the UK and
uncertainty over the direction of the government's economic policy. Today's
statement on spending plans for 1993-94 is seen as Mr Lamont's best
opportunity to salvage his chancellorship and rebalance economic policy
after two months in which its direction has been unclear.
A 2 percentage-point cut in UK base rates before the new calendar year has
been priced into the value of short-dated sterling futures in the belief
that the government will 'go for growth'.
Mr Steven Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, believes
this is a realistic forecast, but warns that sterling will fall sharply if
200 basis points are taken off base rates today or tomorrow. He considers
that a 1 percentage-point cut will have little effect on the currency.
'The government is facing more instability, having to push through public
expenditure cutbacks, the introduction of the council tax and a tough public
pay round,' he said. But he believes the growing German recession and the
D-Mark's incipient weakness will keep sterling above DM2.40, if UK base
rates are lowered gradually.
Mr Ian Beauchamp, chief economist at Hambros Bank in London, strongly
emphasises the downside risk for sterling. He believes Mr Lamont is caught
in a Catch-22: 'The tougher his stance on fiscal tightening, the greater the
scope for thinking that there will be more base rate cuts,' he said. The
announcement of a weaker fiscal package, however, will not dispel the belief
that rates are coming down anyway.
Mr Beauchamp thinks DM2.30 and Dollars 1.40 are possible targets for
sterling before the new year. The economics team at UBS Phillips&amp; Drew
forecasts a breach of the record closing low of DM2.3675 within three
months.
There is a worry here for British visitors to France and French exporters to
the UK. The pound finished little changed last night at FFr8.172. The franc
continues to appreciate, leaving every chance that the all-time sterling low
of FFr8.03 will soon be broken.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Money Markets: Euromark futures fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT setback in short-dated Euromark futures continued yesterday after
the Bundesbank carried out a net drain of funds in its weekly money market
operations, writes James Blitz.
Elsewhere, however, markets were quiet. There was almost no change in cash
rates in the sterling money market on the eve of today's Autumn Statement.
The prevailing view is that a 1 percentage-point cut in base rate will be
signalled tomorrow.
The December Euromark futures contract fell 6 basis points to a close of
91.39 after the Bundesbank drained a net DM5.7bn of liquidity from the
German money market in its weekly repo operation. Most of the funds
allocated were at 8.75 per cent, unchanged from last week.
The net effect of these moves was to push call money up to 8.83 per cent
from around the 8.80 per cent seen on Tuesday evening. Three-month money
rose to 8.89 per cent from a previous close of around 8.85 per cent.
Movements in the short-dated Euromark contracts indicate how expectations of
an easing in official and market rates in Germany have been dampened in
recent weeks.
On October 27 the December Euromark contract closed higher at 91.80,
forecasting that three-month money would be at 8.2 per cent by the year-end.
The contract has fallen sharply since then, declining 6 basis points
yesterday to close at 91.39. At this level the contract prices three-month
money at 8.61 per cent, less than 30 basis points below its current level.
However, yesterday's closing price still assumes that there will be a cut in
the discount rate, currently at 8.25 per cent, before the new year. The
Bundesbank is believed to assume that there should be a margin of around 50
basis points between the lower posted rate floor and the level of market
rates.
The Bank of England forecast a small shortage of only Pounds 450m at the
start of its operations yesterday, and the overnight rate of lending peaked
at 11 per cent. Three-month money again ended at around 7 per cent.
December short sterling dipped 5 basis points to a close of 93.52. The gap
between the December and March contracts has widened recently to 70 basis
points, reflecting the belief that there will be more rate cuts in the
spring.

FT  12 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow outperformed by small
growth stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER A weak opening, US share prices posted modest gains, although
small-capitalisation growth stocks traded on the Nasdaq system once again
outperformed the wider market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 14.86 firmer at 3,240.33, buoyed by
heavy demand for drug stocks. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 3.58 at
422.20, while the American SE composite put on 3.15 at 388.81. The Nasdaq
composite advanced afresh by 7.16 to 634.92 in active trading. Turnover on
the New York SE was very heavy at 243.7m shares.
Outside influences on the market were scarce, with no economic statistics of
importance due for release, and the bond markets closed for the Veterans Day
holiday.
The pattern of the first two days of the week was repeated, with blue chips
struggling to make headway amid active two-way trading but secondary stocks,
especially more spec-ulative issues traded over the counter which attracted
extremely strong demand, registering decent gains on steady investor demand.
Profit-taking continued to plague some leading cyclical stocks, especially
those that had benefited from demand linked to the Presidential election. In
the weeks running up to the November 3 poll, investors had bought into
cyclical shares that were expected to benefit from a new Democratic
administration's plans for increased government spending. By the start of
this week, those same investors had begun to book some of the profits earned
during the run-up to polling day.
Among the cyclical shares, International Paper lost a further Dollars 1/4 to
Dollars 62 7/8 after broking house Bear Stearns lowered its rating on the
stock from 'attractive' to 'hold'. The broker also reduced its earnings
estimates because of concern over the sluggishness of the white paper
business and the company's exposure to weakening European markets. Westvaco,
another paper company also downgraded by Bear Stearns, slipped Dollars  5/8
to Dollars 35.
Pharmaceuticals, especially those recently hit by selling on fears that a
Clinton administration would put controls on drug prices, rallied strongly.
Johnson &amp; Johnson moved up Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 50 3/8 , Pfizer Dollars
2 1/2 to Dollars 77 1/8 and Merck Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 44 7/8 .
Federated Department Stores firmed in early trading but slipped back to end
steady at Dollars 16 7/8 in turnover of 2m shares after the retailer
reported third-quarter net income of Dollars 31.6m, a dramatic turnround
from the Dollars 61m loss incurred at the same stage a year ago.
Other retailers were also firmer, boosted by signs of a modest recovery in
sales. Sears appreciated Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 43 3/4 , JC Penney Dollars
 7/8 to Dollars 76 3/8 and The Gap Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 31 1/4 . The
exception was Wal-Mart, down Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 62 after seeing its
stock rating cut by PaineWebber.
On the Nasdaq market, Nordstrom jumped Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 35 1/4 as
investors applauded the company's 29 cents a share third-quarter profit, an
improvement on the 24 cents earned in the 1991 period.
Canada
TORONTO was steadier, bolstered by a rally in Canada's heavyweight gold
shares and strength in pharmaceuticals.
The TSE 300 index gained 9.2 at 3,286.4, although declines slightly
outnumbered advances by 259 to 251 after volume of 25.1m shares. Dealings
were thin due to a Remembrance Day bank holiday in Canada and the US
Memorial Day.

FT  12 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Profit-taking hits Frankfurt
and Milan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANKFURT and Milan succumbed to selling after their recent gains, writes
Our Markets Staff. Paris and Brussels were closed for a holiday.
FRANKFURT came to a halt after a week of steady gains on afternoon
profit-taking, the weaker dollar and selling from the futures market. The
DAX index closed 6.85 lower at 1,512.21 after a 2.50 gain to 597.53 in the
FAZ at midsession, the afternoon downturn leaving an early carmakers' rally
in disarray.
Turnover rose from DM4.2bn to DM4.6bn. The Bundesbank's weekly securities
repurchase tender, which left minimum short-term rates unchanged at 8.75 per
cent, reinforced the view that interest rate cuts were still some way off.
Among carmakers, BMW was the early winner but after an early high of DM503,
it ended with a DM1 loss at DM493. Daimler maintained some of its early
strength, ending DM4.60 better on the day at DM530.50 but still DM6.50 off
its high, while Volkswagen lost DM7.20 to DM268.80 on talk of a switch into
BMW.
A 9 per cent rise in profits from Siemens and an unchanged DM13 dividend
left it DM2.80 lower at to DM558.70, but rumours of an Indian power plant
contract for its KWU subsidiary took the shares up to DM561 in the London
afternoon.
Among financials, Dresdner Bank lost DM5 to DM356 on a DM750m eurobond with
equity warrants but AMB rose DM10 to DM800 on the sale of part of its stake
in BfG Bank to Credit Lyonnais. In second-liners, Asko extended its fall
after the cartel office block on its planned merger with Metro, closing DM20
lower at DM484.
MILAN made good gains at the start but weakened suddenly around midday, soon
after news that a cabinet meeting on privatisation had ended. No statement
was issued after the meeting but the fall in state-controlled bank shares
gave dealers the impression that insiders were selling. The Comit index fell
1.05 to 449.99 in turnover estimated at around L220bn after Tuesday's heavy
L325.9bn.
Banca Commerciale Italiana dropped to L4,015 but finally closed L320 or 7.2
per cent down at L4,130 in heavy volume of 7.9m shares and Credito Italiano
fell as low as L2,740 before closing L183 or 6.1 per cent lower at L2,797.
Other privatisation candidates were also weaker.
Dealers also attributed the market's weakness to profit-taking after recent
gains and to technical selling linked to the expiry of the monthly stock
options, most of which were exercised.
ZURICH's banks came under pressure late in the session, UBS bearers falling
SFr13 to SFr805 and topping the active list while SBC bearers lost SFr8.50
to SFr270. Swiss money market rates were slightly higher, and this also
affected insurers where Winterthur registered fell SFr30 to SFr2,460.
Profit-taking brought the engineering group, Sulzer, back to close SFr4
lower at SFr574 after an earlier high of SFr590 on a reiterated forecast of
a big rise in 1992 profits.
STOCKHOLM dropped 2 per cent on higher domestic interest rates and slightly
disappointing nine-month results from Astra. The Affarsvarlden General index
fell 14.60 to 722.60 in turnover of SKr486m after SKr530m.
Astra's pre-tax profit of SKr3.42bn came in at the low end of expectations
and the free A-shares fell SKr7 to SKr589m.
Volvo's free B-shares fell SKr12 to SKr261 after Mr Louis Schweitzer, chief
executive of Volvo's French partner Renault, ruled out a full merger between
the two vehicle makers in the near future.
COPENHAGEN banking and financials continued to benefit from Tuesday's repo
rate cut but the biotech company, Novo Nordisk, fell on third quarter
results which came in slightly below expectations.
The KFX top-20 index gained 1.22 to 76.28. Den Danske Bank and Unidanmark
rose DKr4 to DKr135 and DKr4 to DKr233, while Novo Nordisk edged down DKr1
to DKr511.
OSLO's all-share index closed 1.95 lower at 344.92 but Den norske Bank,
Norway's biggest bank, was an exception with a jump of NKr0.3 to NKr1.0 on
continuing speculation about a restructuring of state-controlled banks.
AMSTERDAM ended mixed as the CBS Tendency index ended down 0.4 at 103.8.
Unilever dropped another Fl 2.10 to Fl 183 on worries over its earnings
prospects in the fourth quarter.
HELSINKI traded higher on lower domestic interest rates and the HEX index
firmed 9.3 to 822.8.

FT  12 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong rises 2.4 per
cent to new high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING remained dull on the lack of fresh news, and the Nikkei average lost
ground on arbitrage-related selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed 118.96 off at 16,318.15 after a day's high of 16,481.95
and low of 16,279.74. It firmed in the morning on a rise in the futures
market, but was later weighed down by margin-unwinding and selling by
investment trusts.
Volume dipped to 190m shares from 216m. Declines outnumbered advances by 633
to 259, with 171 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks shed 6.73 to 1,248.33, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased
1.48 to 1,005.98.
Analysts said the Nikkei could fall further, as investors who bought shares
in the September rally were now selling. 'There is a clean-up of arbitrage
and margin positions built up in September,' said Mr Craig Chudler,
strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
Traders said most participants expect the index to fall below 16,000, which
would prompt buying by investors and public funds. However, buyers are
likely to be either short-term players or long-term investors. 'What we need
are investors who are in-between,' said one trader.
Banks were bought by public funds in the morning but later declined on
profit-taking. Industrial Bank of Japan lost Y20 at Y2,390 and Fuji Bank Y30
at Y1,760.
Kurabo Industries, the cotton spinner, was the most active issue of the day,
rising Y25 to Y365 on reports that it will start selling a popular synthetic
fibre.
Aids-related stocks were lower as dealers and speculators liquidated margin
positions. Investors were still discouraged by the recent 'TSD shock' when
the computer software company TSD, listed on the over-the-counter market,
last week admitted misinforming investors of clinical trials of its HIV
vaccine. Green Cross fell Y70 to Y1,260 and Okamoto Industries, the condom
maker, lost Y29 to Y956.
Gajoen Kanko, a hotel chain with close ties to Itoman, the scandal-tainted
textile trading company based in Osaka, was the weakest spot of the day,
dropping Y14 to Y120. Reports that Itoman, which is due to be dissolved by a
merger next year, had sold the bulk of its 13.9 per cent stake in Gajoen
prompted light selling.
In Osaka, the OSE average was 60.19 lower at 17,832.24 in volume of 23.3m
shares. Profit-taking depressed pharmaceutical and construction issues.
Roundup
THE SPORTING instincts of the Hong Kong investor stood out as the Pacific
Rim region put on a mixed performance.
HONG KONG's Hang Seng index closed 148.95, or 2.4 per cent, higher at a new
peak of 6,422.03 in heavy turnover of HKDollars 4.77bn, partly on news that
Governor Chris Patten had met China's top official in Hong Kong, but also on
the chance that the Legislative Council would reject Mr Patten's scheme for
wider democracy.
It was thought that rejection of Mr Patten's scheme - which would appease
Chinese anger over what Beijing sees as a challenge to its sovereignty after
Hong Kong's 1997 handover from Britain - could send the market to even
greater highs.
Tuesday's award of an estimated HKDollars 10bn container port contract to
several local consortia lifted Li Ka-shing's Hutchison empire, a unit of
which will share in the contract. Hutchison Whampoa was up HKDollars 1.10 at
HKDollars 17.10.
SINGAPORE saw late profit-taking as volume fell from 275.1m to a still
active 176.3m shares, and the Straits Times Industrial index ended just 3.72
higher at 1,441.86.
BANGKOK's banks led a strong technical rebound. Following reassurance on
market prospects by Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, the finance minister, they
boosted the SET index to a rise of 10.60 to 937.12 in Bt10.64bn turnover.
Siam City Bank gained Bt1.50 at Bt17.75 on Bt1.41bn turnover.
SEOUL retreated on profit-taking after a five-day rally, the composite index
losing 17.90, or 2.6 per cent, to 658.96. Volume was again a record,
reaching 74.65m shares after Tuesday's 71.28m. Daewoo Corp attained the
highest ever day's turnover for a single company as it rose Won200 to
Won11,200 on 5.58m shares.
AUSTRALIA fell on a report that the country's debt rating was under
pressure. Moody's Investor Services said later that there was no immediate
threat to the debt rating, and the All Ordinaries index closed only 3.1 off
at 1,394.5.
BOMBAY dropped on reports of more payment defaults at other Indian bourses.
The BSE index touched 2,555.53 before finishing at 2,596.53, down 88.56 or
3.3 per cent. Brokers said the Ahmedabad bourse was hit by a payment crisis,
following defaults in Calcutta last week.

FT  12 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Taiwan searches for way back to the
golden days - Simon Davies on the problems depressing Taipei
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the golden days of 1989, average daily turnover on the Taiwan Stock
Exchange used to exceed TDollars 150bn (USDollars 5.8bn). By Tuesday this
week it hit a three-year low of TDollars 5.7bn, underlining the extent to
which the Taiwanese have lost confidence in their stock market.
Around 70 per cent of investment capital in Taiwan comes from individuals,
rather than institutions, and they have found better homes for their excess
cash in Hong Kong and southern China.
The Taiwanese economy remains robust (7 per cent growth is still achievable
for the full year), inflation is easing and corporate earnings growth should
pick up next year; but in spite of this seemingly positive scenario, the
stock market looks unlikely to show any substantial recovery in the near
term.
Yesterday the weighted index ended 36.36 higher at 3,570.89 after the
Finance Ministry announced late on Tuesday a long-awaited package of
measures to boost the market, and turnover recovered slightly to TDollars
7.7bn. Nevertheless, the index is still languishing 71 per cent below its
all-time peak of 12,425 reached in February 1990.
The banking sector has suffered a decline in profits because of a
competitive squeeze on interest rate spreads, while the steel and textile
sectors have felt the impact of the global recession and increasing
production costs. Analysts say the net result will be minimal corporate
earnings growth this year.
It is the stance of the government which appears to be occupying the minds
of investors. Government plays a powerful role in regulating overseas
activity, but it also exerts a strong influence on local institutions.
This week's package included a Finance Ministry pledge to ask the postal
system and labour pension funds to buy shares, and a promise to encourage
foreign investment in the stock market. But investors are also looking for a
more liberal approach to investment and travel links with mainland China.
At present, the pattern of investment in China is for leading businessmen to
reduce their family stakes in listed companies in order to raise capital for
private investment in China. This creates an overhang of stock at a time
when listed companies are not participating in the boom across the Straits
of Taiwan.
It is estimated that Taiwanese corporations have indirectly invested more
than USDollars 4bn in China. With GNP per capita in Taiwan of around 30
times the figure in China, the benefits from relocating the island's
low-margin, export-oriented businesses could be enormous. But until the
government relaxes policy towards the mainland, the stock market will not
benefit directly.
The likely devaluation of the Taiwanese dollar could provide a short-term
boost to export industries, and some economists suggest that further cuts in
interest rates are likely, providing another boost to stock market
liquidity.
However, it is likely to take more than that to bring the investors back.
Uncertainty ahead of the December 19 elections for the legislative Yuan, or
parliament, is depressing business confidence, due to concern over the
fragmentation of the ruling Kuomintang party. A poor showing by the
supporters of President Lee Teng-hui could be damaging for the business
community.
The jailing of the leading stock market player, Oung Da Ming, and the
subsequent scandal over more than TDollars 7bn in stock payment defaults has
also damaged the market's credibility. In addition, it has taken away the
last of the 'big hands' who used to make up the bulk of turnover, but who
have been scared off by the apparent government clamp-down on speculation.
Mr David Hsu, president of Jardine Fleming Taiwan Investment Management,
says: 'We are cautious from now until next Chinese New Year (late in
January). But we hope that after the elections the situation will become
clearer.'
It is impossible to exaggerate the impact of a change in stock market
sentiment on Taiwan's cash-rich individual investors. But for the moment,
there is little sign of a return to the casino days of old.

FT  12 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Utility sectors switch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UTILITIES attracted exceptionally heavy trading, with the regional
electricity (recs) and water stocks chased higher during the early part of
the session before the former came off sharply after Hoare Govett reiterated
its recommendation to switch from the recs to water shares.
The latter maintained Tuesday's late upsurge and closed with sharp gains
across the board as analysts adopted the view that the latest Ofwat
consultative paper contained nothing untoward for the sector. 'Institutions
are looking for dividend growth and security and the water sector delivers
on both of these categories,' said one specialist.
The market also responded to the relatively good figures released on Tuesday
by Anglian Water, which showed profits at the very top end of expectations
and a satisfactory 7.8 per cent increase in the interim payment.
Anglian, Hoare Govett's prime selection in the sector, ran up 15 to 494p,
while Northumbrian advanced 19 to 562p, Southern 14 to 476p and Thames 9 to
512p.
The recs were broadly lower after Hoare's switch recommendation, which
impacted mostly on Southern Electricity. The latter settled 12 off at 416p
after shifting its ex-dividend date from November 30 to January 1, a move
which prompted substantial selling by income funds.
The Scottish generators were heavily bought, with BZW said to have
emphasised their immunity from the Heseltine energy review and their
attraction following the expected British Coal deal. Scottish Hydro-Electric
and Scottish Power added 7 apiece at 235p and 215p respectively.
Glaxo easier
Two large lines of stock on offer contributed to weakness in Glaxo, which
was also marked down ahead of figures from Swedish pharmaceutical company
Astra. The Astra figures were expected to show an improved performance from
anti-ulcer drug Losec, which would suggest erosion of Glaxo's key product
Zantac. In the event they were strong but in line with forecasts.
However, there was pressure from the two blocks, of around 1m Glaxo shares
apiece, that were being sold at the bid price of 812p. Although the stock
did not recover its early fall, it held against a sliding market and closed
13 down at 813p with 5.4m traded.
Coats supported
Textile group Coats Viyella was firm as analysts returned from a company
visit to the US in enthusiastic spirits. The shares picked up 3 to 212p,
with BZW and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew reinforcing their buy stance on the stock.
Ms Julia Blake, BZW's textile analyst said: 'There was considerable
reassurance in terms of forecasts and the strategy and speed of the
integration with Tootal. It was good solid stuff, which settled people's
nerves.' However, she cautioned that after running up on currency benefits
and the US visit the shares were nearing the top of their trading range.
The placing of 80m new shares in HSBC Holdings, raising some Pounds 480m,
was said by dealers to have gone smoothly, with all the shares taken up
'within minutes' and the whole issue substantially oversubscribed.
HSBC shares opened higher at 570p but came off sharply to trade at 560p as
the placing got under way, before stabilising and then moving up again to
close a net 4 firmer at 565p.
The big placing of HSBC shares triggered wholesale selling of the other UK
banks to enable institutions to pick up cheap stock in HSBC. National
Westminster fell 12 to 389p on turnover of 5.2m, Barclays 8 to 360p and
Lloyds 11 to 484p.
Merchant bank Hambros emulated SG Warburg in reporting disappointing interim
figures. Hambros shares fell sharply, touching 224p, before rallying after
what was described as a positive post-results meeting with analysts to end
the session 9 off at 235p. Kleinwort Benson dipped 5 to 289p with turnover
boosted by an agency cross of 535,000 shares at 285p.
Shares in the London discount houses burst into life as dealers anticipated
a cut in UK interest rates of a full percentage point. The sector was
additionally boosted by the encouraging statement from King &amp; Shaxson, one
of the smallest of the discount houses.
K &amp; S increased its interim dividend by 60 per cent and reported that in the
half-year to end-October it had made 'excellent profits', as opposed to a
small profit in the same period last year, deriving great benefit from
falling interest rates. The stock jumped 32 per cent, closing 21 ahead at
87p.
Cater Allen, scheduled to announce interims on November 19, advanced 22 to
370p, Gerrard &amp; National 10 to 339p and Union Discount 7 to 61p.
The absence of the much rumoured bearish news on Lasmo saw the market shrug
off the effects of the recent spate of bear raids and lift the shares 5 1/2
to 160 1/2 p.
Turnover in the stock expanded strongly, eventually reaching a very heavy
16m shares, the largest single day's business since September 1988.
The shares were helped by a number of recommendations from broking houses,
notably from Hoare Govett, whose oil team told clients to switch out of
Enterprise Oil and into Lasmo because the 'massive disparity between the two
stocks is both unjustified and unsustainable'. Enterprise eased to 447p.
Calor dipped 3 to 225p after an agency cross of 1.3m shares executed at
220p.
Paper group Bowater firmed a penny to 452p as the shares attracted interest
following Monday's one-for-one share split.
Cable and Wireless's deal with BCE, of Canada, was greeted with enthusiasm
and saw C and W shares move forward 9 to 658p.
Rumours of an imminent dawn raid lifted Tarmac 2 to 96p. Taylor Woodrow fell
7 1/2 to 67 1/2 p after Hoare Govett increased its forecast of losses in the
current year.
Amersham International performed very well on good results and the
realisation that profits for the year to March 1994 would receive a big
boost from currency changes. Hoare Govett increased its forecast for 1994 to
Pounds 37m from Pounds 32.9m. The shares climbed 29 to 555p.
Courtaulds had been looking oversold and recovered 4 to 503p ahead of
results expected next week.
A large line of stock was said to have unhinged Asociated British Foods,
leaving it down 14 at 421p. More heavy two-way business in ASDA saw 21m
traded but with little effect on the share price, which edged forward  1/4
to 47 3/4 p.
Switching fromn J. Sainsbury, down 13 at 479p, and into Argyll lifted the
latter to within a penny of its all-time high. It ended at 370p, up 2 on the
day.
Nervousness ahead of today's half-time results held back Boots. Analysts
said potential black holes included the US drugs market, the domestic DIY
business and the impact of a price war in perfumes. The shares slipped 5 to
497p.
Vickers eased 2 to 79p after Smith New Court bought and sold a block of 4m
shares at around 77p.
Motor trader Jessup forged ahead 10 to 65p as the company announced
full-year figures back in the black and an upbeat trading statement.
Rothmans International weakened 18 to 595p in reaction to a BZW profits
forecast downgrading and depressed also by slightly lower profits from
Dunhill Holdings, in which Rothmans has a 58 per cent share stake. BZW cut
its 1992-93 profits forecast to Pounds 592m from Pounds 605m and to Pounds
667m from Pounds 675m for 1993-94 as a result of weak results from Rothmans'
Australian operations. Dunhill closed the session 9 lighter at 384p.

FT  12 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Interest rate nerves unsettle
equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIDENCE in prospects for an encouraging autumn economic statement today
from Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, suddenly receded
in the UK stock market yesterday afternoon. Share prices, which had been
effectively treading water while awaiting today's statement, turned down
smartly towards the close of business, driving the FT-SE Index below the
2,700 mark at which the market has been struggling to hold.
Investors' doubts appeared to focus on the cut in base rates which the stock
market has virtually built into its previews of the chancellor's statement.
Suggestions that the base rate reduction would be only half a point, in
sharp contrast with the two-point reduction called for this week by the
Confederation of British Industry, circulated in the City's financial
markets.
With Wall Street at only half speed in the new session because of a public
holiday, London marketmakers reduced share quotations smartly. By the close,
the FT-SE Index had increased its earlier loss of around 7 points to 17.8
for a final reading of 2,696.8.
While there seemed little substance behind the sudden rumours of base rate
cuts of only  1/2 percentage point, equity strategists sounded more cautious
than earlier in the week.
At Strauss Turnbull, Mr Ian Harnett commented that it could prove difficult
for the autumn economic statement 'to deliver both what the equity market
wants - growth prospects - and what the gilt-edged market wants - tight
fiscal policy'. He expects the stock market to concentrate on the estimate
for the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement for 1993-1994.
The strategy team at Goldman Sachs believes that the Autumn Statement will
have short-term impact on relative sector performance, but for the medium
term throws the emphasis back on to the utility sectors, underpinned by
their yield attractions.
Mr Robin Aspinall at Panmure Gordon was another to warn that investors might
face 'some disappointment or confusion' today. The base rate reduction may
not arrive until Monday and the economic stimulus may turn out to be of
modest proportions, he commented.
The session opened brightly, with the Footsie adding six points within the
first hour of Seaq trading. But an easier trend in the US dollar and the
closure of some European markets took the strength out of the international
blue chips, and domestic stocks soon followed suit. However, trading volume
was light and shares drifted down without seeing selling pressure until the
setback at the very end of the day.
Seaq volume fell to 555.7m shares from the 615.8m of the previous session;
Tuesday's retail business remained satisfactory from the traders' point of
view, recording a money value of Pounds 1.1bn.
Among the firmer sectors, the UK water industry stocks responded favourably
to the regulatory statement on dividend policies. Shares in Cable and
Wireless rose strongly after announcing an important link-up with BCE, of
Canada.
But retail and consumer stocks, the immediate beneficiaries from cuts in
interest rates, hung fire as investors settled down to wait for today's
economic statement.

FT  12 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH ALL eyes on the chancellor of the exchequer's Autumn Statement today,
business in the derivatives market was quiet, with a hint of nervousness
over the exact content of the package adding downward pressure, writes
Christopher Price.
The December contract on the FT-SE future opened firmly at 2,745. However,
this proved to be the high point of the day as buyers stayed on the
sidelines and the contract drifted in quiet trading.
Despite an attempt at a lunchtime rally, the slow downward trend continued,
with one overseas bank reported to be a big seller in afternoon trading,
revealing a nervousness in the market that the Autumn Statement would not
produce the dynamic economic package hoped for. In particular, talk that
interest rate cuts would be limited to just  1/2 percentage point was heard.
A late plunge meant December closed at 2,717, a fall of 28 on the previous
session and at a 4-point premium to its fair value of around 17. The trading
range fluctauted between zero and 10 to fair value during the day. Volume
was 5,386 lots.
Traded options were busier, 25,504 contracts being traded of which 6,389
were in the FT-SE 100 option.
Asda was once again the busiest stock option at 3,632, followed by Scottish
Power at 1,723 and Lasmo at 1,697 contracts.

FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Berlitz charged with securities
violations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our New York Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERLITZ International, the Princeton-based language school and publishing
group, yesterday unveiled a steep drop in third-quarter net income and said
it had been charged with violating various securities laws mainly relating
to earlier financial results statements.
Berlitz, which Fukutake Publishing of Japan is seeking to acquire, said it
plans to 'contest vigorously the allegations set forth in such complaint'.
The suit, filed in the US district court of New Jersey, is part of a larger
body of litigation faced by Berlitz.
Most of the earlier litigation centres on about 56.5 per cent of the
company's shares pledged to banks last year as collateral for loans made to
the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
These shares were nominally owned by Macmillan, then part of the Maxwell
Communication Corporation (MCC). MCC is now operating under Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection and the status of the Berlitz shares is the subject of
various legal actions.
Berlitz posted net income for the three months to September 30 of Dollars
700,000, or 4 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 69.6m against Dollars 5.7m,
or 14 cents, on sales of Dollars 62.5m a year earlier.
The drop in net income was even steeper than the previously-reported decline
in operating earnings which fell to Dollars 1.7m from Dollars 5m.

<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government has threatened to cut off gas supplies to the Baltic
states unless they accept a new plan to finance Russian troops based on
their territories, Reuter reports from Moscow quoting Itar-Tass news agency.
Under the plan, gas exported to Estonia and Latvia would be partly paid for
in Estonian kroons or Latvia's national currency, which is yet to be
introduced. A similar scheme is planned for Lithuania.
The money would be paid into branches of Russian banks in each state for
withdrawal by the troops. Russia would provide extra support in freely
convertible roubles.
Tass said Russia would cut off gas to the three Baltic states if they failed
to recognise non-cash transfers from the Russian bank.
Last week President Boris Yeltsin ordered withdrawal of the troops from all
three Baltic states to be suspended because of what he called discrimination
against Russian minorities. But he later said the troops would quit
Lithuania as agreed by mid-1993.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Gibraltar ready to push for self-rule within EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS and JOE GARCIA
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID, GIBRALTAR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BESET by Euro-scepticism at home and Euro-impatience elsewhere in the
Community, the UK government could probably do without another battle over
Europe with its own crown colony of Gibraltar.
Yet Mr Jose Bossano, chief minister of the Rock at the tip of Spain, will
insist in talks with Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign Secretary, in
London today that Gibraltar is the '13th member of the EC' and opposes any
increased interference by London in what it claims are its domestic affairs.
Mr Bossano is determined that his demands for self-determination within the
Community should not be brushed under the table by the UK Foreign Office.
'If the British government attempts to dictate to us, it will lead to a
major confrontation,' Mr Bossano said before leaving for London.
The core of the problem is that Gibraltar's 15-member House of Assembly has
introduced a series of regulatory banking measures tailored to meet Brussels
directives, and that Mr Bossano is aggressively marketing Gibraltar as a
tax-efficient rival to Luxembourg within the Community.
The Foreign Office view is that, with the onset of the Community's single
market, the UK, as the member nation, is responsible for the compliance by a
dependent territory such as Gibraltar with EC directives. Accordingly, it
will be London that will regulate in Gibraltar, not Mr Bossano's executive.
Mr Bossano has passionately embraced Europe as a replacement for Empire,
having watched virtually all the British presence, save the governor,
withdraw from Gibraltar. The dockyard that used to refit the Royal Navy was
closed in the 1980s and the last UK ground forces left last year.
The stand taken by the pugnacious former trade union official, who was
overwhelmingly elected for a second term earlier this year by the Rock's
14,000 voters, could be embarrassing for Britain.
Mr Bossano argues that the UK government, while preaching the virtues of
subsidiarity to its European partners, finds itself practising quite the
opposite when it comes to Gibraltar. However, Mr Bossano will again be told
during the London talks that the Rock is only in the Community because it is
a UK colony and there is consequently 'no future' for his 13th member
pretensions.
Mr Bossano directly challenges this. He argues that Gibraltar, by
implementing EC directives on its own initiative, has effectively acted as a
member of the EC in its own right.
He echoes a virtually unanimous view among the Rock's business community:
that Gibraltar can only be competitive within the EC if it regulates its own
affairs.
However, his battle for Gibraltar's self-determination within the EC is
unacceptable to the Spanish government as well.
Under the terms of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht by which Spain ceded Gibraltar
to the British Crown, the Rock is either a colony or it is returned to
Spain.
Spain has adamantly refused to allow any development that would bolster the
Rock's self-reliance. Spanish pressure has recently been highlighted by the
Madrid government's opposition to the inclusion of Gibraltar as a European
entry point under single market legislation.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Bhopal safety violated, court told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S Central Bureau of Investigation said yesterday that Union Carbide
and its Indian subsidiary had poor safety controls at the plant in Bhopal
where a gas leak in December 1984 killed more than 3,000 people and affected
thousands more.
The bureau presented documents to a court in Bhopal, central India, which is
hearing two cases against Union Carbide, the US chemicals company, Union
Carbide of India Limited, its Indian subsidiary, and their executives, on
charges of culpable homicide.
It said the companies were aware of the hazardous nature of the gas, but had
'failed to maintain proper control and adopt adequate safety measures'
stipulated by the industrial development ministry when a licence was
granted. The companies had violated the agreement with the Indian
government. More gas had been stored in a tank than was permitted, and no
high-temperature alarm had been installed to warn of an accident. 'Sheer
negligence' led to the disaster, it said.
The testimony yesterday was for the trial of Union Carbide of India Limited
and nine of its employees. The court is hearing a parallel case against
Union Carbide, Mr Warren Anderson, its former chairman, and three executives
of its Hong Kong subsidiary. The split trials were necessary because Union
Carbide and Mr Anderson have refused to honour court summons or be
represented by lawyers. Their trial will resume on December 5.
The court has ordered Mr Anderson to be extradited from the US. It is not
clear whether the Indian government will press for his extradition. The
court has also ordered the seizure of all of UCIL's assets in India,
including the now-closed pesticides plant in Bhopal.
Union Carbide has admitted 'moral responsibility' for the accident, but
blames sabotage. In 1989, it agreed a settlement with the Indian government
under which it deposited Dollars 470m with the court for compensation to
victims. Criminal proceedings were to be dropped.
India's supreme court last year upheld the compensation amount but lifted
the immunity from prosecution. Compensation, with the exception of nominal
interim payments, has been delayed by litigation, though in June the
government fixed the compensation amounts at Rs100,000 (Pounds 2,325) to
Rs300,000 for relatives of those killed, and Rs50,000 to Rs100,000 for the
injured.

FT  12 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Washington could pay price for lifting
veil from subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US faces the prospect of being taken to task by Gatt, after an
extraordinary formal admission of the considerable export credit insurance
subsidies it provides to exporters.
The disclosures, detailed in a 14-page study by Mr Daniel Bond, Eximbank's
chief economist, result from new US budgetary procedures aimed at greater
financial transparency in government agencies.
Unfortunately for Eximbank, export credit agencies are supposed to operate
on the basis of balancing their books. Few do this, but other agencies so
fudge the figures that they are not forced to admit they subsidise. By
formally admitting it subsidises, the US breaks the Gatt subsidies code.
It is not yet clear whether any country will make a formal complaint to
Gatt. But such countries as the UK and Sweden, both of which insist their
exporters pay higher export credit insurance rates as credit agencies try to
match premium income against country risk, may come under pressure from
local exporters, for whom the study provides clear prima facie evidence that
US exporters have an unfair competitive advantage.
The study is equally embarrassing to such countries as France, Germany and
Italy, which would be forced to admit to subsidies considerably larger than
those detailed by the US if they had to conduct a similar exercise.
Mr Bond's study, presented last week to a working party of export credit
agencies, showed:
Export credit insurance premiums to exporters cover barely a third of
expected losses on contracts in riskier countries, with the Eximbank
bridging the gap with a specifically calculated subsidy;
Eximbank premiums match the cheapest available to exporters from other
countries as part of government policy to ensure US exporters suffer no
disadvantage resulting from insurance cover costs.
Mr John Macomber, Eximbank chairman, said yesterday the US government
budgets just over Dollars 700m (about Pounds 450m) a year to subsidise
Eximbank's operations, about Dollars 50m to run the agency, up to Dollars
200m as a 'war chest' to match aid-funded export efforts by other countries,
and up to Dollars 500m to provide subsidised insurance cover for US
exporters in risky markets, mainly in the developing world.
'For this much money, we are providing for trade that otherwise wouldn't get
done,' Mr Macomber said. 'The problem is that it seems to be in violation of
the Gatt.'
He is unembarrassed by the US move: 'Export credit agencies will lose their
credibility with the public unless they become much more up-front about
their costs. We are changing the regulations to make it clearer what is
going on.'
Mr Bond notes in his study that Eximbank until recently made no attempt to
estimate explicitly the potential magnitude of losses due to non-payment.
'Rather, the fee structure was designed so that Eximbank fees would be
highly competitive with the fees charged by other export credit agencies.'
The study traces changes to be introduced in the coming financial year which
aim to measure more exactly the level of risk involved with providing credit
cover on export contracts.
'Given the visibility of Eximbank's subsidy budget and the intense
competition between government programmes for funding, Eximbank is exploring
ways to reduce the level of its estimated subsidy budget,' Mr Bond wrote.
Mr Macomber says he hopes an international trend in the direction of higher
insurance premiums would make this possible without US exporters losing
their present advantage of comparatively cheap access to insurance cover.
A fee rise is 'under consideration,' the report says. 'The bank has some
scope for raising fees without running the risk of becoming uncompetitive.'

FT  12 NOV 92 / Technology: House on skis sets sail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FIONA MCWILLIAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Western housing markets may be in the doldrums, but at least home owners do
not face having to move every few years or risk being crushed by tonnes of
ice.
That is the situation on Antarctica's Brunt Ice Shelf, where winter
temperatures can fall to minus 30 deg C and the wind causes snow to drift
for 180 days a year. The extreme conditions and continuous lateral movement
of the ice mean that buildings become buried and subsequently crushed.
This makes the long-term survival of fixed structures impossible. So the
battery of vehicles supporting the British Antarctic Survey's (BAS)
southernmost research station is currently maintained in a garage
constructed within the ice.
But this is expensive, and the BAS recently opted for a mobile structure - a
prefabricated steel garage mounted on two skis - which it will move to a new
location every few months. Two bulldozers will twist the garage free from
the ice before dragging it to a new site.
The BAS is confident that the structure, produced from high-grade steel,
will survive more than a few years of service at the Halley Research
Station, where measurements of ozone depletion revealed the 'hole' in 1985.
The mobile garage was manufactured by Yorkshire company VM Fabrications and
designed by sister company Bennett Associates. It is a fully independent
unit, with its own generator and heating systems.
Its base incorporates a sump into which used oil will drain before being
shipped away from the base, in accordance with the Antarctic Treaty. The
skis are coated with the same hot-application, low-friction paint used on
the hull of a recently commissioned BAS research ship.
The garage is on its way to the Brunt Ice Shelf aboard the BAS vessel RRS
Bransfield. Weather permitting, it will be ready for the servicing and
repair of vehicles by the end of January.

FT  12 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Telephone exchanges
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A quick glance at Cable and Wireless's agreement to sell 20 per cent of
Mercury to BCE for Pounds 480m might give investors the wrong impression.
Lord Young, C and W's chairman, was busy yesterday trumpeting the synergies
which would flow from co-operation between the two groups. Yet in anything
except the long-term these are fairly limited. Northern Telecom, partly
owned by BCE, is already a supplier to Mercury. Given the cut-throat way in
which equipment suppliers vie for business, Mercury would be unwise to allow
that relationship to become too cosy. Nor is Bell-Northern Research likely
to hand Mercury all of its best ideas for nothing, however friendly the
companies become. As for BCE's UK cable television services, Mercury has to
treat all cable companies equally and in any event already supplies all the
telephone services required.
Of course, the two may eventually find projects to develop jointly. But
success will depend on their fostering a collaborative spirit, something
which has eluded many alliances before. The financial benefits to C and W
are clearer. The price is reasonable. In the absence of a deal, capital
outflows over the next two years would have increased gearing from 26 per
cent to around 45 per cent. While that is not abnormally high for a telecoms
company, C and W is clearly in a better position to pitch for new franchises
 -from Bulgaria to Sweden - with a strengthened balance sheet. Having an
equity partner and a valuation placed on Mercury may also reassure
governments thinking of hiring C and W that the company is not
overstretched. Still, it is hard to escape the feeling that this is a deal
for a deal's sake. With the global telecoms business in flux, it seems C and
W wanted a partner. Whether it has found the right one remains to be seen.

FT  12 NOV 92 / O&amp;Y warns of liquidation threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York has warned creditors that failure to approve a
debt-structuring plan later this month will probably lead to the company's
bankruptcy and the forced liquidation of its assets.
O&amp;Y, which was the world's biggest property developer before it filed for
court protection in May, said in a letter to lenders that unsecured and
under-secured creditors were likely to receive nothing if it is forced into
liquidation.
This group of creditors holds more than CDollars 4bn (Pounds 2.08bn) of
O&amp;Y's total debt of CDollars 13.5bn. The restructuring proposals cover
CDollars 8.6bn of debt.
Thirty-four groups of creditors will vote on O&amp;Y's proposals at meetings
scheduled to be held in Toronto between November 25 and November 30.
Canada's Companies Creditors Arrangement Act, under which O&amp;Y is operating,
is silent on the precise proportion of votes required for the plan to go
ahead. The final decision will rest with an Ontario judge.
The company hopes to obtain the approval of all 34 groups, but is confident
that it can implement the restructuring without the endorsement of some of
the smaller groups whose claims relate to specific buildings.
The approval of the unsecured creditors, whose vote is scheduled for
November 30, is viewed as crucial.
In their present form, O&amp;Y's proposals provide for the unsecured and
under-secured creditors to acquire a 90 per cent equity stake in the parent
company, Olympia &amp; York Developments.
O&amp;Y's US and Canadian properties would be spun off into two new separate
companies in which creditors would also have a substantial shareholding.
The viability of the plan depends heavily on an upturn in the North American
commercial property market.
O&amp;Y's proposals assume a substantial increase in rental incomes over the
next five years to finance improvements in the buildings which it will
continue to manage.
The plan does not cover the Canary Wharf project in London's Docklands or
negotiations with lenders to specific US properties.
Mr Gerald Greenwald, O&amp;Y's president, said in his letter to creditors that
the initial 250-page restructuring plan might be modified in the course of
negotiations over the next two weeks.

FT  12 NOV 92 / C and W sells 20% of Mercury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABLE and Wireless, the international telecommunications group, yesterday
announced the sale of 20 per cent of its Mercury Communications subsidiary
for Pounds 480m to BCE, the big Canadian telecommunications group.
At the same time, C and W is investing Pounds 30m in BCE's UK cable
television interests, which are beginning to provide local telephone
services to residential customers and small businesses.
The two groups said they hoped the deal would support a 'major alliance'
which would pursue opportunities around the world.
Mercury and the BCE's cable interests are both rivals of British
Telecommunications, which dominates the UK telecommunications market. The
partners hope the new alliance will enhance their ability to compete with
BT.
Mercury, which has focused mainly on long-distance services in its 10-year
history, has about 7 per cent of the market.
BCE, Canada's largest company, has interests in cable franchises covering
1.8m homes and 120,000 businesses, most in central London. Only a few
thousand customers use its telephone services but it plans to expand this
business substantially.
Both groups said they would not accelerate their investment programmes as a
result of the deal. Mercury will continue to invest around Pounds 400m a
year.
C and W will make an exceptional profit of about Pounds 300m on the sale
because the amount BCE is paying is significantly higher than 20 per cent of
Mercury's net asset value.
Lord Young, C and W's chairman, said: 'We are getting proper value for our
shares in Mercury.' The deal was welcomed in the City, where C and W's
shares closed 9p up at 658p.
The cash from the deal will in the first instance be used to reduce C and
W's gearing by about 20 percentage points. In the longer term it will allow
the group to pursue investment opportunities outside the UK.
The two groups have agreed not to buy shares in each other for five years
unless there is a hostile bid for either company.
BCE has the right to appoint two directors to Mercury's board and a senior
executive to the company's chief executive's committee. But it has no option
to increase its share in Mercury.
C and W's investment in BCE's UK cable interests will be a combination of
equity and convertible securities. C and W will have an initial shareholding
of 12 per cent, rising to 20 per cent on full conversion.

FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Amersham rises 24% to Pounds 10m as
healthcare sales improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURNROUNDS IN its healthcare division and in interest payments helped
Amersham International, which makes radioactive products, to increase
pre-tax profit by 24 per cent to Pounds 10.2m in the six months to September
30.
The advance from Pounds 8.2m was achieved on reduced turnover of Pounds
124.8m (Pounds 136.6m) as the clinical reagents business, sold to Eastman
Kodak, dropped out.
Mr Kirk Stephenson, finance director, said like-for-like sales grew by 10
per cent at constant exchange rates. Operating profit from ongoing
businesses rose 18 per cent, from Pounds 6.8m to Pounds 8m.
Royalties from clinical reagents amounted to Pounds 1.7m, compared with last
year's Pounds 2.8m. Annual royalty income was expected to be Pounds
4m-Pounds 5m.
Operating profit was struck after research and development spending of
Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 7.3m). The pre-tax figure benefited from Pounds 400,000
of interest received compared with a Pounds 1.4m charge. This followed the
receipt of Pounds 47m from Kodak at the end of March.
In the healthcare division the turnround amounted to Pounds 1.8m to give an
operating profit of Pounds 200,000 on sales of Pounds 42.3m (Pounds 40.1m).
Mr Bill Castell, chief executive, said sales of Ceretec, the brain imaging
agent, grew by 36 per cent to Pounds 9m and there had been a small
improvement in gross margins of the commodity products.
Margins could be rebuilt by increasing the branded element of the portfolio.
Progress had been made with both the follow-ups to Ceretec: Metastron, for
cancer pain relief, and Myoview, a heart imager.
In the life science division, which serves academic institutions and
research wings of pharmaceuticals companies, an additional Pounds 700,000 in
research and development spending accounted for the fall in operating profit
to Pounds 9.8m (Pounds 10.5) on sales of Pounds 46.9m (Pounds 44.9m).
Mr Castell said cuts in Japan, Germany and France had been offset by growth
in the UK and the US.
Long-term prospects lay in such areas as DNA investigation to diagnose
genetic propensity to illness.
Industrial quality and safety assurance improved profit by 10 per cent to
Pounds 2.3m. Losses in environmental assays were little changed at Pounds
1.3m.
Earnings per share rose to 11.4p (9.1p). The interim dividend goes up to 4p
(3.7p).
COMMENT
With 85 per cent of sales overseas but most of its manufacturing in the UK,
Amersham stands to benefit by at least Pounds 5m from sterling's
devaluation. Factoring that into next year's profit forecasts alongside the
underlying business growth helped pushed the share price up 29p to 555p
yesterday. Amersham's tantalising prospects come in two packages: ample
scope for rebuilding margins in healthcare and a promising product pipeline.
Profits should also be helped by reduced losses in environmental assays now
that the new dipstick to test for contamination is on the market. For the
full year, profit is forecast to grow from Pounds 20.7m to Pounds 24m-Pounds
25m. The prospective p/e of about 20 makes the group look fully valued short
term, but forecasts of a 30 to 40 per cent profit increase next year make
the stock worth holding.

FEDERATED Department Stores, one of the largest US department stores group
incorporating chains such as Bloomingdale's, The Bon Marche and Jordan
Marsh, yesterday reported a sharp improvement in third-quarter results, with
a profit of Dollars 31.6m after tax.
In the same period a year earlier, it suffered a net loss of Dollars 61m.
The company, which emerged from bankruptcy in February, saw both increased
operating profits and a sharply-reduced interest charge year-on-year.
On the former score, operating income rose from Dollars 53.3m to Dollars
99.5m for the three-month period, bringing the total of the first nine
months to Dollars 207m against Dollars 103.3m last time, while sales in the
third quarter amounted to Dollars 1.79bn, up from Dollars 1.71bn.
Federated said it was particularly pleased to have 'converted stronger sales
into higher profits by reducing expenses rates and controlling markdowns'.
On the financial front, the company also benefited from much-reduced
interest charges - down from Dollars 109.6m in the third quarter of 1991, to
Dollars 43.9m this time round.
The company's shares rose Dollars  3/4 on the results but closed unchanged
at Dollars 16 7/8 .
However, Mr Allen Questrom, chairman, still sounded a note of caution ahead
of the key fourth quarter.
'For the remainder of 1992, we continue to expect modest improvement in the
business,' he said. 'We remain cautious, however, as a result of low levels
of consumer confidence and a sluggish economy that could impact sales in
this most important selling season.'

FT  12 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Liffe closer to agreement
over Globex
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) is
moving closer to agreement on terms for joining Globex, the after-hours
trading system jointly developed by the Chicago Board of Trade the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and Reuters, following further meetings with
representatives of the two US exchanges in London this week.
The US exchanges appear to be adopting a more flexible attitude to the issue
of Liffe's initial commitment to the system.
Liffe has been pressing for a short time-span before it has an opportunity
to withdraw.
The exchanges have also moved closer together on the issue of exclusivity -
the rule that only one product in any underlying cash market can be listed
on Globex.
Liffe has now accepted the principle that any contract commanding over 50
per cent of world market share will be listed on Globex.

FT  12 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Stock Exchange tries to
settle a trading problem - Gilt marketmakers' rules have been eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London Stock Exchange yesterday relaxed its rules on gilt marketmakers
in an attempt to relieve the settlement log-jam in the gilts market, in the
process making it more difficult for private investors to switch between
gilt issues.
The continuing settlement problems, which first became acute last Thursday,
also prompted claims that the infrastructure supporting the gilt market was
inadequate, and the Bank of England should seek to modernise the settlement
arrangements. The Bank, said the current problems were caused by unusual
events and did not indicate any underlying problems in the market.
The stock exchange announced that marketmakers would no longer have to take
on 'contingent' trades of less than Pounds 50,000, in which investors sell
their holding in one gilt issue and move into another. These trades have
helped to clog the marketmakers' settlement systems, prompting them to
discourage retail brokers from passing them any more small bargains.
Contingent trades have become popular in recent days in part because of the
Bank of England's decision, announced a month ago, to redeem its 9 per cent
stock due 1992-96. For the Bank, early redemption gives the opportunity to
refinance the issue at a lower coupon.
Many of the retail investors who held these gilts have been switching into
other gilt issues, taking the advantage to move into longer-dated stocks to
benefit from the steepening UK yield curve.
The switching has become more active recently as speculation has grown of a
possible two-point interest rate cut to coincide with today's Autumn
Statement. Daily trading volume has jumped to an estimated 7,000 bargains,
from around 2,500 before.
The problem is said by brokers to have become acute since last Thursday when
Greenwell, one of the three big marketmakers who handle retails trades,
experienced a computer failure. Greenwell said yesterday its systems had not
shut down entirely, and the difficulties it experienced were 'readily
overcome'.
All three marketmakers - the others are County NatWest and UBS - were
reported by brokers to have turned away trades, though the marketmakers
denied they had imposed minimum size limits to deter small bargains. 'We've
all had difficulties, but we've done our best,' County said.
The settlement difficulties have raised the spectre of the far more
substantial backlog that threatened to overwhelm the equities market in
1987, and which was one of the main motivators for the development of
Taurus, a paperless settlement system.
The Bank's settlement arrangements, introduced five years ago, are
paper-based and rely on brokers delivering stock certificates within 24
hours of a trade taking place. Brokers complained yesterday that this
arrangement is designed to suit institutional investors, rather than private
clients.
'The Bank of England has resisted gilts going on to Taurus,' said Mr Paul
Killik of stockbrokers Killik. Gilts should at least be put onto the
exchange's Talisman system, which allows paperless settlement between
marketmakers, he said.
The Bank said current volumes were unusual, and yesterday afternoon it was
meeting other marketmakers who only deal with institutions to see if they
could help relieve the pressure.
It added that if volumes looked as though they would remain high, it
expected intermediaries in the market would increase their systems capacity
to service the extra business.

SHARES in Warner-Lambert, a large US pharmaceuticals company, were halted in
late NYSE trading yesterday following news that an encouraging study on the
company's tacrine drug for Alzheimer's disease would be presented in today's
issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The preliminary results of the study, called 970-26, were presented in July
at a conference on Alzheimer's Disease in Padua. It found that
Warner-Lambert's tacrine, known as Cognex, had statistically significant
results over a placebo in 'primary outcome measures' used to evaluate the
effects of a drug on Alzheimer's.
Warner-Lambert hopes the study will help in its efforts to have Cognex
approved by the Food &amp; Drug Administration. Twice last year, an FDA advisory
committee decided not to recommend approval of the drug amid concerns about
its efficacy.

<TEXT>
JAGUAR Cars, owned by the Ford Motor Company, said yesterday it is cutting
its US staff by 10 per cent immediately, agencies report.
Jaguar said the move followed a 12-month review of the company structure,
after an intensive reorganisation in mid-1991. The luxury carmaker blamed
the cuts on the depressed car market, saying sales in the prestige sector
were not improving.
Ford Motor Company posted a Dollars 158.9m loss in the third quarter of
1992. Its European operations were dragged down by the Jaguar unit, which
posted a Dollars 100m operating loss in the three-month period.
Ford said it was continuing to wring costs out of Jaguar which it bought in
1990, but was having difficulty curtailing the operating loss due to the
continuing fall in car sales.

Zealand
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIERLEY Investments Limited, (BIL) the New Zealand-based hotels and
investment concern, has sold a 7.5 per cent stake of Air New Zealand for
NZDollars 87.2m (Dollars 45.7m), agencies report.
The stake has been sold to New Zealand brokerage Doyle Paterson Brown and UK
brokerage Smith Newcourt, which have in turn sold the shares to 40
institutional shareholders in Asia, the UK and the US, Brierley Investments
said.
The sale reduces Brierley Investments's stake in Air New Zealand to 35 per
cent from 42.5 per cent.
Brierley Investments chief executive Mr Paul Collins said the company
remained committed to the long-term retention of its 35 per cent
shareholding interest in Air New Zealand, acquired in 1989.
However, Mr Collins added that it had always been envisaged that the 7.5 per
cent stake, which Brierley Investments acquired from American Airlines eight
months ago would in due course be sold.
Following the sale, the ownership of Air New Zealand comprises 35 per cent
Brierley Investments, 20 per cent Qantas Airways of Australia, 5 per cent
Japan Air Lines and 40 per cent institutional and private investors.
Air NZ shares were five cents stronger at NZDollars 2.65 in early trading.
The share price has lifted strongly recently. The stock has traded as low as
NZDollars 1.53 this year.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Matrix Churchill: Bush administration 'knew about arms
network'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JAMES BAKER, the outgoing US secretary of state, in March 1989 approved
the worthiness of the Ohio affiliate of Britain's Matrix Churchill to do
business with Iraq, in spite of the fact that the State Department was the
recipient of US intelligence reports which described Matrix as an Iraqi
military procurement front company more than three months before.
Documents obtained by the Financial Times and previously described in
Congress show that Mr Baker signed the Matrix Churchill certification on
March 14 1989. The approval by Mr Baker was sought by Baghdad because Iraqi
law required the certification of any US company seeking to become a
contractor with Iraq.
Accompanying the Baker document was an authenticated certification dated
February 24 1989 and signed by Mr Gordon Cooper, chief executive of Matrix
Churchill of Cleveland, Ohio.
Last night a US intelligence official, who asked not to be named, said the
Bush administration knew about Matrix Churchill's military procurement
activities in both the US and Britain, having first received British
intelligence information in 1987. 'The intelligence information was shared
between London and Washington, and at very high levels,' he said.
According to a US official the State Department received details about the
military procurement activities of Matrix Churchill in late 1988, several
months before Mr Baker vouched for Matrix as a US exporter to Iraq.
The US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control acted two years ago to
freeze the assets of Matrix Churchill in Ohio and identified the company as
an Iraqi entity involved in military procurement in the US.
Mr Henry Gonzalez, the House banking committee chairman who has been
investigating the financing of Iraq's war machine by the Atlanta branch of
Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), recently cited a June 1989 US
intelligence report on Matrix Churchill's role in the procurement network.
Matrix Churchill's Ohio affiliate has also been named in recent court
proceedings in Atlanta as a BNL-funded company involved in aiding Baghdad's
military procurement. BNL Atlanta financed Matrix Churchill in both the US
and Britain by way of letters of credit.
Mr Gonzalez claimed the Bush administration allowed the company to operate
from Ohio 'despite knowing that the network was responsible for procuring
technology for Iraq's covert nuclear, biological and chemical weapons
programmes as well as various long-range missile programmes'.
A two-year investigation of Matrix Churchill's Ohio affiliate by the US
Customs service will probably be completing its evidence-gathering process
by early January. The officials investigating the Matrix case are likely to
make criminal referrals to the Department of Justice early in the new year.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, said yesterday he did sign a Public
Immunity Certificate restricting the information available about Matrix
Churchill, but added: 'I certainly didn't seek any immunity in order to
conceal from the courts the truth.'
Mr Clarke, interviewed on the BBC's World at One programme, said: 'I have
personally had nothing ever to do with sales of weapons to the Iraqis and I
haven't sought immunity for any documents simply on the basis that they
might prejudice a prosecution or be helpful to the defence. I wouldn't dream
of signing any such certificate.'
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, last night refused to be
drawn on the relevance of documents for which he signed Public Immunity
Certificates. He told the BBC's The World Tonight programme that it was not
'a matter of opinion or discretion' but his duty. He stressed that the
decision to make documents available which were not normally in the public
domain rested with the judge and not with him.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Devon and Cornwall set up body to boost growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLIC AND private-sector bodies have joined forces to set up the
Westcountry Development Corporation to assist growth in Devon and Cornwall,
among the most depressed counties in Britain.
Mr Eric Dancer, chairman of the Devon and Cornwall Training and Enterprise
Council and managing director of Dartington Crystal, a leading force in the
project, said yesterday: 'We need to create 70,000 new jobs in the area by
the end of the century just to keep up with demographic change. Then we need
more jobs to overcome the present level of joblessness.'
The area's tourism, agriculture, mining and defence industries have been
eroded by the recession and defence cuts, and there are unemployment
blackspots in Torbay, Redruth, Camborne and along the north Devon coast
between Barnstaple and Bideford.
The two counties are at the bottom of the British league table of wage rates
and only just above the bottom in terms of gross domestic product.
The corporation aims to develop an economic strategy for the region and is
looking to the Welsh Development Agency and Scottish Enterprise as role
models. Applications close this morning for its Pounds 50,000-a-year post of
chief executive.
Among those supporting the project are South West Water, South West
Electricity, British Telecommunications, British Gas and South West
Enterprise, a consortium of companies. Both county councils and Plymouth are
involved, as well as the universities and the Tec, which has committed
Pounds 1m to it.
The corporation's launch follows the collapse earlier this year of the Devon
and Cornwall Development Company, whose aim had been to raise money from the
private sector to encourage growth.
The inward investment work of the Devon and Cornwall Development Bureau will
not be affected by the corporation. Mr Dancer said the intention was to give
increased support to the bureau so that it could promote inward investment
from other parts of Britain as well as from overseas.

FT  11 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Dunkel struggles to head off trade war -
Gatt chief on mission to US and Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS, DAVID GARDNER and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA, BRUSSELS, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Arthur Dunkel, director general of Gatt, faces a thorny task on his
planned trips to Washington and Brussels to head off a transatlantic trade
war over oilseeds and revive stalled trade liberalisation talks vital to the
health of the world economy.
Mr Dunkel said yesterday his mission was prompted by a 'deep sense of
crisis' and the 'concern and helplessness' felt by many countries at the
failure of the US and EC to settle their row over farm trade.
His intervention was mandated by trade negotiators from 50 countries holding
a meeting in Geneva of the Trade Negotiating Committee of the Uruguay Round
within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The negotiators made an impassioned plea to the US and EC to settle their
long-running argument over European subsidies to oilseeds farmers. This
dispute - which the US has threatened to escalate with punitive tariffs on
some European farm goods - is a main obstacle to a wide-ranging Uruguay
Round pact on liberalising world trade.
Meanwhile, officials of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development warned that failure to settle the trade rows would delay growth
and create unnecessary unemployment.
'Recovery could be retarded for a quite a long time and jobs put at risk
just because we don't have an agreement on one or two products,' said Mr
Bernard Molitor, vice president of the OECD's economic policy committee.
Mr Dunkel said he would be stepping in not as a mediator but rather as an
'intermediary' between the two economic superpowers and other participants
in the Uruguay Round of trade talks.
He will try to judge whether the US and EC are politically capable of
successfully concluding the Uruguay Round in the next few months. He would
also 'learn who is in charge' in Brussels.
His question was partly answered by Mr Delors, who said in the Hague: 'I am
more optimistic than 10 days ago because (EC ministers have). . . agreed a
common position, a dynamic position, with goodwill to conclude a fair and
balanced agreement, first with the US and after in the framework of the
Uruguay Round.'
Mr Dunkel faces an awesome responsibility in discharging the mandate he has
been given to avert a global trade war.
He will have two separate but linked objectives in view.
Firstly, he will be urging the two sides at all costs to settle the oilseeds
row before December 5, when the US has threatened to impose retaliatory
tariffs.
Trade diplomats in Geneva see this dispute as pivotal. The refusal of the EC
to comply with two Gatt panel judgments condemning its oilseeds subsidies as
illegal represents a fundamental challenge to the authority of international
trade rules.
But the US threat to go outside Gatt rules by imposing retaliatory tariffs
unilaterally would not only spark a ruinous trade war but damage, perhaps
fatally, the credibility of Gatt and its multilateral dispute settlement
mechanisms.
The five-year-old oilseeds dispute is technically separate from the Uruguay
Round since it relates to existing rather than future Gatt rules. But the EC
has chosen to link an oilseeds deal with broader negotiations on farm trade
reform in the round, holding the multilateral negotiations hostage to a
bilateral row.
Washington and Brussels last month came very close to agreement on these
broader farm subsidy questions.
Secondly, Mr Dunkel has the even more delicate task of seeing whether the US
and EC are in a position to decouple oilseeds and return to Geneva to
restart Uruguay Round talks. These have been stalled since December because
of the failure of the two big traders to settle their differences on farm
trade.
Negotiators stress that the six-year-old Uruguay Round, already two years
behind schedule, must resume now if the 108 countries involved are to
complete the wide-ranging negotiations, including country-by-country deals
on market access for goods and services, by March 1 1993.
This is the final deadline for the 'fast-track' voting procedure in the US
congress which requires legislators to approve or reject the Uruguay trade
round package without amendment.
Mr Dunkel said time was running out for the Uruguay Round. He noted that
with the US administration's 'fast track' negotiating authority expired in
March, Congress could then unpick any multilateral trade deal.
Several important issues remain unresolved in areas other than farm trade,
notably in services. Participants also have to conclude time-consuming
country-by-country negotiations on tariff cuts and market-opening measures
for services, which are likely to run well into the new year.
In Paris, France's Patronat employers federation yesterday expressed its
'deepest concern' at the recent hostile turn in the Gatt world trade talks,
and called for continued dialogue across the Atlantic and an end to US
'intimidation'.
The Patronat's statement is unusual not for its tone - which was
comparatively mild - but for the fact that it was issued at all. No pro-Gatt
industrial lobby has so far been willing to take on that of French farmers.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Chancellor joins effort to prepare
Tory MPs for public spending announcement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday joined the concerted effort by
the Treasury to prepare opinion among Tory MPs for a tough public spending
announcement tomorrow.
The campaign, involving all Treasury ministers in an intensive series of
meetings with every Tory MP, signals the government's nervousness both about
the severity and potential unpopularity of the planned expenditure
programme.
At a meeting with Tory members of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs
and with officers of the Conservative backbench finance committee, Mr Lamont
warned that the economic achievements of the Tory administrations since 1979
would be at risk unless the government held firm on public spending.
In particular, the chancellor highlighted the rise in government spending as
a proportion of national income, after earlier success in cutting it back.

FT  11 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Attack renewed on Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEAR raiders, out in force against Lasmo on Monday, reappeared yesterday
afternoon as Wall Street opened, and drove the share price down again amid a
flurry of bearish rumours and exceptionally heavy turnover.
The shares rose strongly in early trading, moving up from an overnight 164p
to 168p, and were trading comfortably around 165p when Wall Street opened.
They then came under significant pressure, with US investors said to be big
sellers amid a welter of wild rumours, including hints of an imminent shift
in dividend policy, an impending profits warning and big losses on currency
trading. At worst, Lasmo touched 154p before steadying and closing a net 9
down at 155p. Turnover reached a heavy 10m shares.
Sources close to Lasmo were sceptical about the rumours. Some believed the
selling reflected hints that Lasmo may be considering a stock offer in New
York and that some US investors were selling shares with the intention of
buying them back after the offering.
Rolls-Royce hit
Fears for the next year's dividend in the wake of the financial difficulties
at GPA sent Rolls-Royce falling sharply for the second day in a row.
At the day's worst the shares were down 12 1/2 at 112p, and backwardation -
a situation in which the offer and bid prices are temporarily reversed - was
seen late in the session.
Analysts fear that the problems at GPA, which has orders for 45 Boeing 757s
due to be powered by Rolls-Royce engines, may have a severe effect on the
1993 profits of the aero-engine maker, raising worries about the dividend.
Researchers also pointed to problems at the company's NEI subsidiary.
The strong market trend helped the stock to rally a little to end a net 9
1/2 off at 115p after heavy turnover of 7.4m shares.
UB placing
Shares in United Biscuit fell back after the food group said it was making
an Pounds 80m share placing to help fund the Pounds 198m purchase of an
Australian snacks company from Coca-Cola.
Dealers said the 24.1m shares were placed at 332p - 14 below UB's opening
price yesterday - by County NatWest and SG Warburg. However, as the market
closed, rumours continued to suggest that some of the stock had proved
difficult to shift.
Although some analysts expressed caution over the level of UB's debt - which
could reach 70 per cent by next year - they were generally supportive over
the move. Nomura raised its profits forecast from Pounds 196.5m to Pounds
204.25m for 1993, with earnings per share of 26.8p. UB's shares closed 9
cheaper at 337p.
The market was shaken by the extent of the profits decline revealed at SG
Warburg, the merchant bank widely viewed as the UK's most successful
integrated investment house since the Big Bang reforms of the 1980s. Warburg
shares plunged 45 to 479p with a hefty 2.5m shares changing hands.
Analysts moved quickly to downgrade forecasts after the post-results
meeting. Full-year estimates were chopped by around Pounds 50m, to the
Pounds 125m to Pounds 130m level, and for next year by around Pounds 20m.
Hambros, reporting interims this morning and expected to show profits only
marginally lower than last time's Pounds 37.6m, eased 4 to 244p.
The market gave a good reception to General Accident's third-quarter
numbers, which were accompanied by a relatively confident statement on the
current outlook. General Accident shares ran up 14 to 550p.
The oil majors were in the forefront of the market's advance, responding to
the further strength in the dollar, a rally in the oil price and suggestions
that Opec may take steps to reign in production when it holds its next
meeting at the end of the month. BP raced up 8 1/2 to 236 1/2 p on turnover
of 6.6m. Shell advanced 9 to 539p on 4.2m traded in front of tomorrow's
third-quarter figures. There was also aggressive switching from Royal Dutch
into Shell.
Calor dipped 5 more to 229p after the company confirmed that SHV, the Dutch
investment company, had been behind the recent buying and had lifted its
stake to 47.26 per cent, or 79.5m shares.
A stronger dollar helped some US earners. Reuters Holdings rose 15 to 1253p,
with Goldman Sachs said to be recommending the stock. Glaxo gained 11 to
821p even though it was announced that the US holding has dropped to 23.8
per cent, down around a percentage point over the past two months.
SmithKline Beecham 'A' put on 4 1/2 at 517p, but Wellcome weakened as US
sellers forced the stock down 8 to 987p.
ICI retreated from a day's high of 1058p to close 9 up on balance at 1048p
after US investment house Paine Webber downgraded its rating on the company
to neutral from attractive. Analyst Mr Andrew Cash said that while the
weaker pound might help dollar earnings it was 'clobbering the ADR price'.
He added that he was worried about Europe and has cut his 1992 earnings per
ADR forecast for the company to Dollars 3.10 from Dollars 3.40.
Industrial gases group BOC fell 11 to 703p, with Lehman Brothers selling the
stock ahead of results.
In a buoyant food retail sector, ASDA was the biggest volume stock of the
day as nearly 50m were traded, the price edging forward 2 1/2 to 47 1/2 p.
An agency cross of 6.1m was recorded, the shares apparently bought at 46 1/2
p and placed at 47p.
Dealers said the impetus for the continued heavy turnover - yesterday's was
the largest in nearly a year - came from institutions which had taken up
shares in the rights issue last year at 35p and were now taking profits.
However, ASDA's rehabilitation as a recovery stock meant that new buyers
were available to produce two-way business.
Heavy turnover was also seen in Tesco, with 15m shares traded. Staff share
options, thought to be up to 17m, could be exercised by Christmas. The stock
rose 3 to 226 1/2 p.
Dixons moved ahead, encouraged by a profits upgrade from Smith New Court.
The shares rose 11 to 236p.
Regional brewers were weak in early trading on an unconvincing rumour that
tomorrow's Autumn Statement would contain some form of excise duty increase.
Shares in British Aerospace continued to be hurt by the sentiment from GPA
and closed a penny lower at 134p after trade of 2.1m. Market watchers,
however, said further falls were restrained by reports that Germany is
reconsidering its withdrawal from the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA). BAe
is the UK's lead contractor on the project.
Confirmation from the chairman that car components manufacturer T &amp; N would
not be making a rights issue to fund its DM250m acquisition of German
company Goetze, announced yesterday, boosted the shares. Dealers saw the
deal as an indication that fears over the dividend may have been overdone.
The shares closed 7 up at 143p.
Pearson eased 5 to 348p on poorer than expected figures on sales of BSkyB
satellite dishes. Granada suffered for the same reason, falling 8 to 275p.
A strong buy recommendation issued by Henderson Crosthwaite was behind the 3
rise in GEC to 259p. Mr Brian Newman, electronics specialist at Henderson,
said the 10 per cent-plus sterling devaluation has improved GEC's
competitive position more than investors realise. Henderson lifted its
1993/94 profits estimate by Pounds 30m to Pounds 950m.

FT  11 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SQUEEZE in stock index futures helped to enliven an otherwise quiet day in
the derivatives market, as dealers once again waited for news of interest
rate cuts in tomorrow's Autumn Statement, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the December contract on the FT-SE was struck at 2,721,
an opening stronger than anticipated. But that early strength proved
temporary as December quickly went into reverse, falling to 2,713 by 9.15am,
the session's low point.
A mid-morning rally soon turned into a squeeze, sending the contract forward
once again to recover ground surrendered earlier in the day.
With Wall Street said to have had no significant impact, December finished
at 2,745, a 22-point improvement on Monday's close, and around 16 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of 17.
The premium over fair value remained between 5 and 15 throughout the
session. Turnover at 5,138 lots was again dull, though significantly up from
the previous session.
Traded options were more lively and saw volume of 25,769, up from Monday's
17,563. The FT-SE 100 option traded 7,164 contracts and the Euro FT-SE 2,009
lots.
ASDA, also busy in the equities sector, was once again the liveliest stock
option, having 1,783 lots dealt. The January 50 calls were the most active
series.

FT  11 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Stock market regains its confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRMNESS in the US dollar stocks and confidence that tomorrow's autumn
economic statement in the UK will be accompanied by a cut in domestic base
rates took the London stock market ahead yesterday. Although economic data
on both sides of the Atlantic gave little encouragement, share prices moved
up steadily and closed near to the day's best levels.
Trading volume increased, swollen by a handful of large share placings and
by the market's response to trading news and other corporate developments. A
rally in crude oil prices stimulated recoveries in the leading oil stocks,
and the pharmaceuticals attracted buyers again.
The FT-SE Index, uncertain at first in the wake of an unconvincing
performance from Wall Street overnight, climbed by more than 22 points at
midsession, moving significantly into Footsie 2,700-plus territory once
more.
London held up well against another cool start to the trading session in New
York, which was three Dow points down when the UK market closed. At the
final reading the FT-SE Index was 19.2 ahead at 2,714.6.
Seaq volume of 615.8m shares, against 517.5m, incorporated heavy trading in
the food manufacturing sector, where a placing of shares in United Biscuits
helped finance an acquisition in Australia; in food retailers, Asda saw
heavy volume.
The stock market appears to have factored in a one-point cut in domestic
base rates, expected to be announced either in Thursday's economic statement
from Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, or very shortly
afterwards. But the domestic economic scene remained bleak, with comments at
the conference of the Confederation of British Industry underlining the
severe pressures on British manufacturers. Political uncertainties were
fuelled by proposals for an offical inquiry into the sales of defence
equipment to Iraq during the run-up to the Gulf war.
Firmness in the US dollar was reflected in gains in ICI, in spite of a
downgrading from a New York analyst, Glaxo, Rank Organisation and other
US-influenced stocks. There was strong support for BP and Shell after New
York opened, although US holders were sellers of some North Sea stocks.
The stock market retained its optimism in spite of disappointing producer
price statistics in both the UK and US. Once again, second line issues
outperformed the stocks in the Footsie list, indicating a widening of
investment interest on the part of the institutions.
Retail, or customer, business in equities topped the Pounds 1bn mark again
on Monday, extending the period of relatively high business levels. But
confidence among City securities firms was dented by a poor interim
statement from SG Warburg, the merchant banking and securities trading
house, where the share price fell heavily.
Share gains among the domestic store and consumer retailer groups were
modest, in spite of the expectation of another early cut in base rates.
Restraining the sector were hints of an impending rights issue from a
leading leisure group believed to be considering an acquisition.
The potential implications of the reported debt rescheduling at GPA, the
world's biggest aircraft lessor, continued to overhang the aircraft
industry.

FT  11 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Blue chips encounter another
late sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
FOR THE second consecutive day, blue chip stocks ran into a late sell-off
yesterday as the broader market more than held its ground, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally down 15.40 at 3,225.47, with
the bulk of the loss incurred in the final 30 minutes of trading. Secondary
indices fared better. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended
0.03 up at 418.62 and the Nasdaq composite continued to outperform, rising
5.71 to 627.76 amid further strong demand for technology stocks.
New York SE turnover was heavy at 223m shares, and rises outpaced declines
by 986 to 817.
The day's economic news appeared positive for both equities and bonds. The
index of producer prices (PPI) rose 0.1 per cent in October (it actually
fell 0.1 per cent when the traditionally volatile food and energy components
were excluded). The market had been expecting a rise in the PPI of about 0.3
per cent, and the figures sparked a rally in bond prices, lowering long-term
market interest rates in the process.
The positive inflation news, however, failed to boost senti ment on stock
markets. Analysts said that with the Presidential election out of the way,
investors were looking to economic and corporate earnings fundamentals and
the PPI figures were not good enough on their own to spark a rally.
Airlines, which have posted strong gains recently on the back of falling oil
prices, came under selling pressure on reports that Saudi Arabia supports
limiting the crude output of Opec member countries. AMR, parent of American
Airlines, relinquished Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 65.
Revco slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 8 after the company, as part of a
major refinancing, filed for a rights offering and an issue of new senior
notes due in 1999.
Wal-Mart eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 62 3/8 , although it revealed
third-quarter profits of Dollars 438m, up sharply from the Dollars 353m
earned a year ago. Other retailers reporting yesterday included JC Penney,
down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 75 1/2 after a near 60 per cent improvement in
profits, and The Limited, Dollars  3/8 off at Dollars 23 3/8 after net
income only slightly higher than a year earlier.
Canada
THE PRICE of gold bullion and gold shares sank further, leaving the Toronto
market with its sixth consecutive loss. The TSE 300 index fell 16.6 to
3,277.2 and declines led rises by 322 to 242 after a large volume of 40.6m
shares. The golds sector index dropped 3.74 per cent as spot gold in New
York lost USDollars 2.80 to USDollars 330.25, another six-year low.
The market was also focused on a possible rise in the Bank of Canada's key
rate, which is expected to climb as much as 90 basis points at tomorrow's
weekly setting of the rate.

FT  11 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Late buying by trusts
lifts Nikkei off the day's low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES failed to react to the Ministry of Finance's plans to encourage
individual investors back into the stock market, and the Nikkei average
closed only marginally higher on late buying by investment trusts, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei gained 20.06 at 16,437.11. It rose to the day's high of 16,518.46
in the morning on the Finance Ministry's decision to ease regulations on
employees holding shares in their own company and to introduce a
savings-type cumulative stock investment system. However, interest failed to
last and the index fell to an afternoon low of 16,347.34 on profit-taking
and futures-related selling.
Volume picked up to 210m shares from 185m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks put on 5.60 at 1,255.06, but falls still led rises by 492 to
392 at the close, with 174 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50
index eased 1.98 to 1,010.84.
Tokkin, or specified money trusts, and individuals sold stocks in the
afternoon. However, activity remained thin on rumours that the Ministry of
Finance was keeping a check on large-lot selling.
Traders expressed worries over possible selling by foreign investors, able
to resist pressure from Japanese financial authorities to prevent investors
from selling stocks. 'European investors are looking to take profits on
holdings,' said one trader.
Banks were higher on last-minute buying. Industrial Bank of Japan gained Y40
to Y2,410 and Sakura Bank advanced Y30 to Y1,130.
High-technology exporters rose as the yen eased against the dollar. NEC
added Y9 at Y657 and Fujitsu Y8 at Y518. But Casio Computer fell Y19 to Y956
on news that the company now expected an 8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits
for the current year, against a previous forecast of an increase.
Reports of a 35 per cent fall in machine tool orders in September depressed
machine tool makers. Toshiba Machine dipped Y4 to Y486. Mori Seiki lost Y20
to Y1,440 on selling by institutional and foreign investors, discouraged by
Mori Seiki's forecast of a 96 per cent drop in annual pre-tax profits.
In Osaka, the OSE average shed 35.51 to 17,892.43 in volume of 11.1m shares.
Nintendo, the video game maker, declined Y80 to Y9,760 on reports that it
had indefinitely postponed sales of its CD-ROM game machine, currently under
development with Sony.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets reacted to domestic influences. Bombay was closed for a
holiday.
AUSTRALIA fell on weaker commodity prices and a run on transport group TNT.
The All Ordinaries index dropped below its support level of 1,400, to
1,389.5, before steadying to close at 1,397.6, down 21.9 in turnover of
ADollars 244.1m.
TNT, whose ADollars 65m first-quarter loss disappointed analysts, plummeted
22 cents, or 30 per cent, to an all-time low of 53 cents in heavy volume of
4m shares. The fall in TNT and worries about GPA in the UK upset News Corp,
joint owner with TNT of the aviation leasing group AWAS, and the stock fell
90 cents to ADollars 26.40.
SEOUL ran into heavy profit-taking following its five-day rally. The
composite index finished 9.95 down at 676.86, but was clear of the day's low
of 669.10. A total of 71.3m shares changed hands, breaking Monday's record
of 71.1m.
Brokers said worries that the Bank of Korea would try to siphon off cash in
circulation, because of the influx of overseas money into the bourse,
sparked the correction.
BANGKOK's small banks led the retreat for the second day on talk of
stepped-up market surveillance to curb excessive speculation. The SET index
shed 12.84 to 926.52 in turnover of Bt15bn, making a two-day drop of 3.4 per
cent.
SINGAPORE firmed on brisk buying led by individual bargain hunters and
another round of institutional demand. Trading again concentrated on OTC
Malaysian shares, led by the Kamunting and Renong groups. The Straits Times
Industrial index rose 22.26 to 1,438.14 in volume of 277.1m shares, after
Monday's record 348.8m.
KUALA LUMPUR was broadly weaker in active trading as profit-taking
continued. The composite index ended down 3.61 at 645.32 in turnover of
MDollars 641m, but well below the previous day's record high of MDollars
916m.
HONG KONG closed slightly higher, with the Hang Seng index 5.17 up at
6,273.08 in low turnover of HKDollars 2.5bn.
The most active stock was Cheung Kong, unchanged at HKDollars 22.30,
followed by HSBC Holdings, also steady at HKDollars 66, and Hong Kong and
China Gas, down 20 cents at HKDollars 16.50.
TAIWAN ended mixed after early buying on hopes that the government would
adopt a package of market-boosting measures petered out. The weighted index
was finally just 4.39 ahead at 3,534.53. Turnover hit a three-year low of
TDollars 5.71bn.
MANILA's composite index dipped 8.49 to 1,337.17 as reports of rising
imports discouraged a market already depressed by an electric power crisis.

FT  11 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Dublin's stockbrokers feel the pinch -
Tim Coone explains the reasons for the poor performance of Irish equities
this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ask an Irish stockbroker how business is these days, and you are likely to
get an unprintable reply. Ask about his mortgage, and he is likely to burst
into tears.
Anglo-Irish Bank closed down its Solomons stockbroking arm last month,
probably the first in a series of rationalisations among stockbroking firms
in Dublin in the coming year if business does not pick up. Projections made
by numerous analysts at the beginning of the year of some 15 to 20 per cent
growth in the ISEQ overall index during 1992 now look hopelessly optimistic.
In fact the ISEQ fell to 1,110 by last night, 20 per cent down since the end
of 1991 and threatening its October 19, 1992 low of 1,094.88. This was its
lowest since February 1988, a few months after the 1987 crash, and 43 per
cent down from the peak of 1,905 in January 1990.
According to Mr Tom Healey, general manager of the stock exchange, equity
turnover on the market is now at its lowest level in three years.
In fairness, a number of largely unforeseen circumstances have emerged this
year.
The failure of the world economy to pull itself out of recession has had a
major negative influence. Also, the anticipated easing of German interest
rates did not materialise, and when sterling pulled out of the European
exchange rate mechanism last September, Irish interest rates were forced up
to record levels as the government struggled to maintain the punt's link to
the D-Mark.
One key domestic factor has been a change in the taxation environment in the
finance bill, earlier this year, which gave favourable tax treatment to
interest earned on deposit and savings accounts at the expense of equity
investments.
Mr Kevin Barry, head of research at NCB brokers in Dublin, says this has
caused the flow of private funds into the unit-linked market to dry up, as
savings have shifted into bank deposits in anticipation of the changes, due
to be introduced in January next year. As funds are being cashed in, fund
managers are finding themselves forced sellers into an already
underperforming market.
Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, had promised to introduce a new
finance bill by the end of the year to redress the imbalance, but that has
now been postponed by the general election and its fate remains uncertain.
Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin believes that the year ahead will be tough.
According to one of its analysts, the very high interest rates and the high
exchange rate vis-a-vis sterling is putting pressure upon companies across
the board.
The market has thus begun discounting the banks, whose core business is in
the Irish market, as well as companies whose business is largely conducted
in the UK such as Fyffes, whose earnings figures will be lower once
converted into Irish pounds. The gloomy outlook for construction is
affecting CRH.
An EC-US trade war would also affect the fast-growth companies in the food
sector such as Kerry and Waterford Foods whose high-value food ingredients,
and some downstream products, have been pinpointed as likely targets for
punitive tariffs in the US. Waterford Crystal is also vulnerable. Thus
virtually all of the major Irish stocks face diffi-culties on one front or
another.
As if these factors were not enough to set the bears loose, there is GPA,
the Irish-based aircraft leasing company, whose flotation plans failed in
June this year, and which now appears to be facing serious financial
difficulties. The main Irish financial institutions all have significant
exposure to the company.
Mr Barry says: 'In ordinary circumstances, the market would take the GPA
problems in its stride, but it comes as a negative factor on top of five or
six others.'
There are flickers of optimism. Mr Mike Moroney, head of research at
Goodbody stockbrokers in Dublin, comments: 'At present levels Irish shares
are very attractive, and if there is an unwinding of the negative factors
over the coming months, there is a chance for rerating. The catalyst will be
significantly lower German interest rates.'
If this does not materialise, there may be more Irish brokers looking for
jobs.

FT  11 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan in focus as strong
dollar lifts bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RISING dollar gave bourses something to bite on, while privatisation
fever kept its grip on Italian equities, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT majored on continued dollar strength and today's results from
Siemens as the DAX index ended 10.26 higher at 1,519.06 and Siemens DM7.10
better at DM561.50.
Turnover eased from DM4.3bn to DM4.2bn, Siemens's part in that rising from
DM566m to DM932m. The electricals giant has had analytical support in recent
weeks on its combination of steady sales progress, east German prospects and
prospective high single-figure earnings growth.
But there have also been worries that the 1991-92 results could be marred by
the setbacks that other big blue-chips have encountered this year. This
week, however, the thought went out that the results could beat expectations
and short-covering did the rest.
Dollar-sensitive winners included Metallgesellschaft, up DM13 at DM335 for a
two-day gain of DM25, and BMW, DM6.50 higher at DM494.
In retailing, Karstadt rose DM7 to DM521 on media speculation that it might
be a buyer for some of Woolworth's German operations, but Asko fell DM9 to
DM504 after the cartel office said that it would block its planned merger
with Metro.
MILAN ended sharply higher on continued interest in state-controlled
companies earmarked for privatisation, so much so that Credito Italiano was
halted from trading for excessive gains. The Comit index added 18.45 to
451.04 in turnover estimated at more than Monday's L161.7bn.
Credito finally settled L550 or 22.6 per cent higher at L2,980. The state
telecommunications company, Stet, rose L105 or 6.9 per cent to L1,620 and
the food group, Sme, rose L399 or 8.3 per cent to L5,199. Rinascente, which
belongs to the Agnelli group, remained in demand, rising L699 or 11 per cent
to L6,999.
PARIS rebounded in the afternoon on position-squaring ahead of today's
holiday. There were also reports of selective US buying through the Paris
office of a US broker. The CAC-40 index came off the day's low of 1,780.07
to close up 11.81 at 1,798.46 in moderate turnover of FFr1.886bn.
The CAC-40 index was pushed up by buying of stocks that weigh heavily in the
index. Saint-Gobain rose FFr20 to FFr535, LVMH rose FFr32 to FFr3,592 and
Air Liquide added FFr22 to FFr748.
Peugeot dropped FFr4 to FFr496 after disappointing nine-month turnover
figures published late on Monday. The results prompted James Capel to
downgrade its 1992 and 1993 EPS forecasts to FFr70 and FFr60 respectively,
from FFr90 and FFr80 previously.
Hachette fell FFr7.70 to FFr92.50. Dealers attributed the fall to the merger
with Matra, as a result of which Hachette is expected to be removed from the
CAC-40.
ZURICH saw buying in the dollar-sensitive multinationals, but higher money
market rates weighed on banks as the SMI index rose 4.6 to 1,962.3. Ciba
which announced a small joint venture with Degussa, ended SFr6 higher at
SFr636.
AMSTERDAM closed mixed, supported by the dollar and a firm UK market. The
CBS Tendency index rose 0.5 to 104.2. Unilever steadied after its recent
weakness as the share edged up 50 cents to Fl 186.10.
STOCKHOLM rose as the dollar helped to offset profit-taking. The
Affarsvarlden General index rose 1.7 to 737.2 in turnover of SKr530m after
SKr511m.
Astra A fell SKr2 to SKr596 on profit-taking after its recent gains. The
pharmaceutical company is due to report its nine-month earnings today.
Procordia B shares fell SKr1 to SKr182 after reporting nine-month results at
the low end of market expectations.
COPENHAGEN rose with the bond market on the central bank's repo rate cut, as
the CSE index closed 2.59 higher at 258.83. Unibank closed DKr11 or over 9
per cent higher at DKr130 and Den Danske Bank was up DKr14 or 6.5 per cent
at DKr229.
OSLO was underpinned by lower interest rates, the strong dollar and modest
gains in North Sea oil prices, as the all-share index rose 3.18 to 346.87.
Norsk Hydro gained NKr1.5 to NKr132.5.
ISTANBUL rose 1.8 per cent on reports that a tax decree to encourage
investments in mutual funds with an equity content would be sent to the
cabinet. The 75-share index ended up 63.85 at 3,565.98.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Money Markets: Revised view on rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS in the sterling cash market remained firmly convinced yesterday that
there would be a base rate cut before the end of the week, but the view that
it would be in the order of 200 basis points seemed to be losing its
adherents, writes James Blitz.
A cautious correction in the sterling markets was matched in German money
markets, where the December Euromark futures contract fell back 10 basis
points at one stage from its opening level.
Again the market remained convinced that there would be an official cut in
rates, but the scale and timing remained in doubt.
After considerable bullishness in sterling cash on Monday, the market
appeared a good deal more tame yesterday. Six-month money, for example, had
been down at 6 1/2 per cent at the start of yesterday's trading, but soon
firmed back to 6 5/8 per cent. The December short sterling contract slipped
4 basis points to a close of 93.58. Three-month money remained unchanged at
around 7 per cent.
Dealers were more biased towards a smaller rate reduction because of
sterling's fall to a five-year low against the dollar on Monday afternoon.
A front page news story in the Financial Times, suggesting that Mr Norman
Lamont had let it be known that he was not contemplating a 2 per cent rate
cut, was also quoted by traders as a reason why views had been changed.
The cash market again suffered the liquidity problems that accompany
expectations of an imminent rate cut. The Bank of England forecast a
shortage of Pounds 1bn at the start of trading. Only Pounds 123m was removed
in the early round and late assistance was high at Pounds 590m.
In the German market, the December short sterling contract dropped to a low
of 91.42, later rising to a close of 91.45. This roughly assumes that
three-month money will be at around 8.55 per cent by Christmas, some 30
basis points below current levels.
A commercial bank dealer said this probably priced in a drop in the discount
rate, currently at 8.25 per cent, because there must be some margin between
the lower posted rate and market rate.
In the Eurodollar market, a 0.1 per cent rise in the US producer price index
helped to push the December contract up 1 basis point to 96.24 in the late
European afternoon.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar dealers wait for news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR yesterday regained some of the ground lost against the D-Mark at
the start of the week, but failed to break through the level of DM1.60,
writes James Blitz.
There is an air of 'wait and see' in dollar/D-Mark trading at the moment.
The US currency rose more than 5 pfennigs last week in the wake of the
Presidential election, but some dealers wonder whether the rise was
overdone. Yesterday the currency ranged between DM1.5907 and DM1.5991 before
closing  3/4 pfennig up on the day at DM1.5960. The dollar finished New York
trading easier at DM1.5913.
Last week's advance for the dollar reflected expectations that Germany will
ease monetary policy as it slides into recession, and that President-elect
Bill Clinton will fiscally boost the economy.
Those expectations must be fulfilled if the dollar is to appreciate from
here. Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in
London, said: 'The dollar is like a dragon with an insatiable appetite at
the moment. It needs news to drive it further.'
News on the German front is not likely to be dollar-positive this week.
Nobody expects an easing in official rates at the Bundesbank council meeting
tomorrow, and some even expect a net drain of funds in today's German money
market operations, pushing cash rates higher.
Attention is increasingly focusing on possible candidates for the economic
posts in Mr Clinton's administration.
It is generally thought that the dollar will see a strong break through
DM1.60 if Mr Paul Volcker, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, is
nominated as Treasury Secretary. His reputation for raising interest rates
to counter-balance the US deficits in the 1980s would help the dollar
upwards.
However, Mr Persaud believes that the other named candidates, including Mr
Roger Altman and Mr Robert Rubin, would also be positive for the US
currency.
Inside the European exchange rate mechanism, the French franc continued to
gain ground. Yesterday it appreciated  1/2 franc against the D-Mark to
finish at FFr3.3760. Some dealers believe it is slowly moving towards its
central ERM parity against the D-Mark of FFr3.3539.
Analysts of the ERM are considering how quickly the core currencies of the
system could move towards forming a unified currency in Europe.
For the first time since the autumn currency crisis, all the potential
hard-core currencies in the ERM - the D-Mark, French franc, Belgian franc,
Dutch guilder and Danish krone - were yesterday above their central Ecu
rates.
These currencies could continue to move in a uniform pattern next year.
Attention may focus on whether the hard core can move from the permitted
fluctuation bands of 2.25 per cent to narrower bands of 1 per cent or even
0.2 per cent.

THE METAL prices improved across the board on the LME as the market staged
corrective technical rallies after the recent sustained falls. Dealers said
many markets had become oversold, and were susceptible to a correction,
especially as there were some falls in warehouse stocks. 'Nothing goes down
in a straight line forever,' one said. But for rallies to be maintained, the
markets would need some fresh fundamental stimulus. London COCOA prices
closed just below a fresh nine-month high, boosted by a short covering rally
in New York and sterling weakness. The market was also aided by some signs
of buying interest from the industry, while producers appeared to have
returned to the sidelines after sales late last week. New York's arabica
COFFEE market was firmer on short covering after the recent falls. 'We
exacerbated the move to the downside,' said one analyst, adding that
fundamental news would be needed to take the prices back towards 70 cents.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Industrial sugar users seek end
of EC quotas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADICAL REFORM of the 23-year-old European Community sugar regime, including
the abolition of the national quota system, is being demanded by Europe's
industrial sugar users.
The Committee of Industrial Users of Sugar yesterday launched a campaign for
change of the regime, which it said costs the EC taxpayer and consumer
Ecu6bn (Pounds 4.85bn)a year. The present regime is due to end next summer
after being rolled over for two years last in 1991.
Members of the CIUS, which represents the sugar buying interests of Europe's
food and beverage industries, account for more than half the EC's sugar
consumption. Its call for reform comes a year almost to the day after a
savage attack on the regime by the EC Court of Auditors. In a report last
November the court said the regime had failed to establish a common market;
had generated the highest degree of overproduction of any community farm
policy; had inhibited the rational organisation of output according to
comparative advantage within Europe; and had depressed world sugar prices
while passing on excessive charges to EC consumers.
The CIUS is calling for the abolition of both national quotas and the
guaranteed price for sugar beet. A guaranteed price of white sugar should be
retained, it argues, but should be progressively reduced until supply
equates to community consumption.
At present the combination of quotas, high prices and imports each year
provides the EC with about 40 per cent more sugar than it needs.
However, if a balance between supply and demand were to be achieved,
efficient EC producers 'may well be able to demonstate their efficiency in
world terms by selling on those markets without need of subsidies,' the CIUS
believes.
Mr Tom Harrison, president of the CIUS, said that failure to implement
radical reform would demonstrate the European Commission's inability 'to
provide the framework for a competitive, efficient market required to meet
the needs of the consumers.' Such a framework could not be achieved simply
by rolling over the current arrangements again, he warned.
EC prices were 35 per cent above what they should be because of a system
designed 'to encourage and ossify inefficiency'.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Middle Eastern sellers push
gold to 7-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEALTHY Middle East syndicates that have battered the gold bullion
market several times in the past three years seemed to have scored another
financial success yesterday by pushing the metal's price down to its lowest
level in nearly seven years.
Silver and platinum prices were dragged down by gold's collapse in which
commodity funds, following the lead of the oil-rich Middle Eastern
speculators, played an important role.
Dealers said the market received no help from previous big buyers of gold
who decided yesterday to hold back to see how far the price eventually would
fall.
Producers in Australia and South Africa also contributed to the downward
pressure. They were selling forward because the strength of the US dollar
gave them good prices in their local currencies. Australian gold producers
could collect nearly ADollars 500 a troy ounce, about the best price for
them since the Gulf war.
Mr George Milling-Stanley, first vice president, bullion sales, at Lehman
Brothers in New York, pointed out that, not for the first time, the gold
price was ignoring the supply-demand fundamentals. Demand for the yellow
metal was likely to reach another record this year because sales to India
'are going like a train' while 350 to 400 tonnes of gold had been imported
to China through 'unofficial' channels. Meanwhile, supply from gold mines
was levelling off.
Mr Milling-Stanley said chartists believed that when the price of gold for
delivery in December dropped below Dollars 340 an ounce it was heading for
Dollars 320. He added, however: 'I'm not sure where the bottom is'.
Last night in London gold for immediate delivery closed at Dollars 329.80,
down Dollars 4.65 from Monday's close.
However, Mr Milling-Stanley also insisted that the Middle East speculators
and the commodity funds were 'very heavily short and there is a lot of short
covering to be done at some stage. So the price could bounce back very
quickly'.
The funds and the Arabs started to go short when December gold reached
Dollars 353 an ounce two months ago, he said. So they already had a Dollars
30-an-ounce profit on the first ounces they bought.
North American gold producers were not selling below Dollars 340 an ounce.
Mr Ian Bayer, president of Hemlo Gold Mines, the Canadian producer, on a
promotional tour speaking to analysts in Europe, said he believed that the
long-term price range for gold was Dollars 350 to Dollars 400 an ounce. 'But
I can't see much upside in the near term.'
Mr Bayer said he believed central banks, big holders of gold stocks, had
been net sellers this year, and dealers also suggested central banks had
been selling the metal in 50,000-ounce tranches for the past two months.

<TEXT>
THE US Department of Commerce has confirmed that Norsk Hydro Canada's
revised electricity contract with Hydro-Quebec does not amount to a subsidy.
This means that Canadian pure magnesium metal will now face a 7.6 per cent
US countervailing duty, down from 21.6 per cent set last July.
Norsk Hydro Canada, which operates a USDollars 400m export magnesium plant
near Montreal, has said it will continue to use Canada-US Free Trade Pact
channels to try to get the remaining duty withdrawn.
Pure magnesium still faces a US anti-dumping duty of 31.33 per cent, in
addition to the 7.6 per cent countervailing duty. Alloy magnesium is not
subject to the anti-dumping duty.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cuba fumes over Havana
name-game - Frank Gray reports on a legal battle over famous cigar brands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUBATABACO, the state company responsible for supplying Cuba's famous Havana
hand-made cigars, is locked in an angry dispute with its largest customer,
Tabacalera, the Spanish state cigar giant.
Tabacalera, which owns the three Havana marques, Upmann, Montecristo and
Larranaga, has withdrawn those brands from several key European markets,
notably France, as a result of litigation started in the 1980s by the three
brands' former owners, Cuban Cigar Brands (Curacao) of the US. Tabacalera
bought the brands from the US group a few years ago and carried the case
forward in the French courts.
The French court ruled last summer that Tabacalera's French counterpart,
Seita, could no longer sell the Cuban-made brands in France. According to
Cubatabaco officials, this has caused a row between it and Tabacalera that
could see the withdrawal of the same three marques from other markets.
Spain last year imported 28m cigars from Cuba, more than a third of its 80m
exports. Mr Francisco Padron, head of Cubatabaco, said in an interview that
Cuba was prepared to resume exporting the same three marques to France but
with different labels 'as early as next year'. It might resume sales to
Spain as well, Mr Padron said, but this would require the setting up of an
independent importing agency in Spain and aggravating already tense
relations with Tabacalera.
Cubatabaco was in discussions with Tabacalera over the impasse. 'They are
being difficult, but they are no longer a complete monopoly. This means we
can be an importer into Spain,' Mr Padron said. 'Tabacalera's profits from
Havana cigar imports are too big for our taste, even though it is our
biggest market, although our supplies have slipped from 34m a few years ago
to 28m last year.'
The nub of the dispute is the fact that the three marques, of which Upmann
and Montecristo are by far the most famous, are produced in other
cigar-manufacturing countries, such as the Dominican Republic (as are
numerous other famous Havana marques such as Partagas and Romeo y Julieta,
though these are not, as yet, subjects of litigation).
This anomaly arose in the 1960s following the Cuban revolution and the
subsequent expropriation of the famous cigar companies. Many cigar company
proprietors switched production offshore but did not have the economic clout
to raise a lawsuit against Cuba over the continued production within Cuba of
the same brands. This only became possible when the US group took control of
some of the offshore brands, which has now moved to Tabacalera. Tabacalera
controls the brand names for all markets outside the US.
The sale side-by-side in some overseas markets of Havana and non-Havana
cigars bearing the same labels is creating market ambiguity, say Cubatabaco
officials, and diverts attention from the acknowledged supremacy of Havana
cigars.
This has prompted Cubatabaco to undertake new strategies in Europe to boost
sales and broaden its revenue base. A few years ago, a Swiss holding company
was established by Cubatabaco to take a minority stake in importing
companies, such as Coprova of France, a small competitor to Seita, and
Hunters and Frankau of the UK, the prime UK importer.
Mr Padron said that strategy was being expanded to include the establishment
of Havana Houses in certain markets. These were franchise retail outlets,
which would be supplied by Cubatabaco-approved suppliers. One had been set
up in Cancun, Mexico, he said, another was planned for next year in Paris
and a so-called Cohiba Divan had been established in Hong Kong. Others were
being considered for Tokyo and the Middle East.
A third element of the strategy is beefing up production of Cuba's
post-revolution 'own brand' the top marque Cohiba cigar, partly to fill the
void created by the departure of Swiss-based Davidoff from the Havana market
into Dominican Republic cigars.
Cubatabaco last week used the occasion of the Fifth Centenary Anniversary
Conference in Havana celebrating Christopher Columbus's discovery of tobacco
(for it was in Cuba that the explorer saw Indians smoking rolled up tobacco
leaves on his first voyage) to display the latest range of Cohiba cigars.
These, at least, will be exempt from brand-ownership disputes abroad,
officials point out.
One official noted that, for its part, Cuba had successfully caused the
withdrawal of 50 brands from the international market place for erroneously
claiming to be Havana cigars.
Mr Padron acknowledged that the Cuban tobacco industry was undercapitalised.
'We are having good crops, but the problems are in the fields (58,000
hectares were under cultivation). We are suffering investment shortages,' he
said, 'some of which have been caused by the collapse of Comecon.'
Cuba, he said, was supplying 10m-11m mainly machine-made cigars a year into
eastern Europe, partly paid for through barter arrangements, but this had
been shaken up. Cuba now was having to reorientate itself to the eastern
European markets, through the setting up of 'joint accounts' in all the
region's capital cities.
Of total sales last year of 250m cigars, 80m were exported. Export revenues
for all Cuban tobacco was Dollars 115m, of which about Dollars 75m came from
cigars, he said.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tax changes for Mexican oil
company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEXICAN government is to make sweeping changes to the way it taxes
Petroleos Mexicanos, the Mexican state oil company and the fifth largest in
the world. The reforms are intended to enable Pemex to operate more as if it
was a private, international oil company.
The new scheme will not alter the amount of tax Pemex pays but will
reorganise the way in which it is levied. At present Pemex simply pays
around 90 per cent of its profits to the finance ministry; under the new
rules it will pay a special tax linked to the amount of oil it extracts from
the ground, but in all other ways will be treated as private company for tax
purposes. Any residual profits will be paid back to the government in the
form of dividends.
The difference between the retail price of petrol and the international
market price will be captured by the government in the form of an excise
tax.
Mr Francisco Rojas, the head of Pemex, hopes the changes will be made by the
end of the year. 'Pemex cannot analyse itself internally as a business when
the tax scheme is not related to its activities but only to collection,' he
says. 'In this sense I believe that we are going to take an important step
this year, perhaps not specifically in the amount we pay but in the
philosophy with respect to the taxes that Pemex owes.'
Officials familiar with the proposed changes say the government has been
influenced by the system used in the UK oil industry, where taxes on the
economic rent implied by extracting oil are isolated from taxes on the
company's ordinary operations.
Pemex was recently divided into four subsidiaries: exploration and
production; gas and basic petrochemicals; secondary petrochemicals; and
refining. The tax changes will enable the company to evaluate the economic
profitability of the subsidiaries. Mr Rojas emphasises that at the beginning
of next year transactions between these subsidiaries will be conducted
according to commercial prices, and full results of each subsidiary will be
published.
Once the proposed tax scheme is in place it will be relatively easy to allow
private equity investment in exploration and drilling, although this is
still prohibited by the constitution. The government says it has no plans to
relax that restriction.
Mr Rojas says Pemex will form alliances with the private sector and
encourage co-investments where it is convenient, sell off assets where it
suits the company and where the private sector can add value, and close down
plants that are not profitable and cannot be modernised. He will pay special
attention to the international side of Pemex, forging more international
strategic alliances, and extending its futures operations.
Pemex is facing pressure from the tight government budget next year, and is
thus intending to finance some investments - in particular refining -
off-budget. It is looking for foreign partners to build a refinery and lease
it to Pemex, which would be another break with tradition.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum closes at dollars
350.75
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Platinum plunged by Dollars 11.25 a troy ounce to close in London last night
at Dollars 350.75 while silver sank 20 cents an ounce to 367.5 cents by the
close. Both metals were affected by turmoil in the gold market and some
aggressive selling by investment funds.
The funds had previously been buyers of silver and platinum in the
expectation that Mr Bill Clinton would win the US presidential election and
that this would bring back small investors to the market, encouraged by the
hope that Mr Clinton's policies would spark economic growth. Platinum and
silver are seen more as industrial than precious metals today, with demand
and prices likely to reflect world economic activity.
When the funds were unsuccessful with attempts to push silver through the
psychologically-important Dollars 4-an-ounce level, they decided to sell
'and everyone joined in', said one dealer.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries show strong gains after
producer data
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US TREASURY prices posted strong gains yesterday on a better-than-expected
producer prices figure and a reasonably successful afternoon auction of
Dollars 11.25bn in new 10-year notes.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  23/32 at 95
1/32 , to carry a yield of 7.670 per cent. The two-year note was also
firmer, up  1/8 at 99 9/16 , yielding 4.467 per cent.
Prices opened firmer after the Labor department reported that the producer
price index rose just 0.1 per cent in October, or fell 0.1 per cent
excluding the volatile food and energy components. Analysts had been
expecting the index to rise 0.3 per cent, and the news quickly spurred
buying of longer-dated securities, traditionally the most
inflation-sensitive sector of the market.
Securities at both ends of the maturity spectrum added to their early gains
after the 10-year auction was completed. The issue was sold at an average
yield of 6.93 per cent amid solid demand from retail and institutional
investors.
HOPES of an interest rate cut continued to sustain the UK government bond
market, with gilts gaining up to a quarter of a point on the day.
The Liffe gilt futures contract rose from 101.24 at the opening to 102.09 by
late afternoon, but dealers said volumes were relatively low ahead of the
Chancellor's Autumn Statement tomorrow. 'A lot of people are just biding
their time ahead of the statement,' said one dealer.
The market opened on a weak note following press reports that Mr Norman
Lamont, the Chancellor, does not intend to cut interest rates by as much as
2 percentage points.
The gilt market had been expecting a cut of between 1.0 and 2.0 percentage
points. The news initially led to a fall in gilt prices, although the market
later recovered to end unchanged at the short end and firmer at the long
end.
The 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 rose from 111 11/32 to 111 9/16 to yield
8.01 per cent.
GERMAN government bonds closed towards the high end of a narrow trading
range, with the Liffe bund future ending unchanged on the day at 91.56.
Dealers said the market remained unperturbed by the finance ministry's
announcement yesterday, when it cut its forecast for west German economic
growth in 1993.
The ministry said west German GNP would grow by a nominal 4.2 per cent in
1993, although dealers warned that the forecast is generally seen at the top
end of the market's expectations.
The ministry added that tax revenue would be lower than expected, which
dealers expect will mean increased borrowing in the bund market.
AP-DJ adds from Frankfurt: Foreign investors bought a record DM34bn of bonds
in September, the Deutsche Bundesbank, the German central bank, has
revealed.
The strong flow of funds into the D-Mark during the European currency crisis
in September was cited as the main reason behind the massive shifts.
'In full, long-term capital imports climbed from DM9.5bn in August to
DM32.1bn in September,' the Bundesbank said.
Most of those funds flowed into the German bond market. 'Foreign investors
in September acquired a net DM34m of domestic fixed interest-rate
securities; most of that (nearly DM27bn) was public government bonds,' the
Bundesbank said. In August, foreigners bought a net DM12.19bn in domestic
bonds.
By contrast, only a net DM1bn flowed into equities in September. At the same
time, German investors sold their foreign securities in September, leading
to a net import of DM2.3bn in the month in total securities.
JAPANESE government bonds continued Monday's strong rally, but profit-taking
later yesterday wiped out some of the gains and the market closed lower.
The futures contract opened at 107.90, the high of the day, but fell to
close at 107.74. In the cash market, the yield on the benchmark No 145
opened at 4.645 per cent and moved to end at 4.665 per cent.

FT  11 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Increase in retail volume
strains London markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SURGE in private client trading in UK government bonds in recent days has
paralysed one corner of the gilts market, as staff, computers and
back-office facilities have become increasingly over-stretched.
Retail brokers complained yesterday that several market-makers had stopped
taking orders, and that where prices were available, they were often
inconsistent.
The log-jam prompted the Bank of England and the London Stock Exchange to
meet gilt market-makers and private client brokers yesterday to discuss ways
of easing pressure on the retail side of the market. Average daily volume in
the gilts market has increased from 2,500 to over 6,000 trades recently, the
stock exchange estimates.
Dealers said the surge was caused in part by a wave of buying by private
clients, prompted by growing expectations of a further two per cent cut in
UK interest rates. Some investors have also been switching from short to
long-dated gilts, to gain higher yields.
Retail investors were also reported to have been rushing to sell out of a
gilt issue which the Bank of England had called for early redemption.
Only five of the gilt market's 18 market-makers - Barclays de Zoete Wedd,
County NatWest, Greenwell Montagu, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and Warburg
Securities - are set up to deal in small amounts with retail brokers,
increasing pressure on them as volumes rise.
Market-makers, on the other hand, said that brokers' reluctance to group
small trades into larger orders had made the problem worse.
The difficulties were exacerbated by the practice in the gilts market of
same-day settlement, dealers said.
After yesterday's meeting, the Bank said settlement deadlines would be
extended from the current 3pm to allow more time for paperwork to be
prepared by brokers. Brokers would also be encouraged to aggregate small
orders to reduce the back-office pressure. 'There's nothing to stop the
brokers dealing as principals and then parcelling shares out to their
clients,' it said.
Retail brokers are due to hold a further meeting with the stock exchange
today to consider ways of easing the log-jam.
Retail investors can obtain gilts through their brokers, or through the
National Savings stock register, which buys gilts from the Bank of England.

FT  11 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Hungarian central bank launches DM600m
Eurobond

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
D-MARK issues dominated the international bonds market yesterday. Bankers
say that the consolidation of the past two weeks or so has come to an end
and the sector is rallying.
National Bank of Hungary started its 1993 borrowing programme early with a
DM600m seven-year Eurobond launched yesterday on the German market. The
bonds carry a coupon of 10 per cent and were priced at 102.00 to yield 9.59
per cent at issue or 250 basis points over German bunds.
Bayerische Landesbank, the German bank which led the issue, said that the
market was receptive if not bullish and trading was within fees at 99.70 to
99.80. Bankers described the terms as being in line with those on Hungary's
DM600m in January this year, adding that the issue looks like a slow mover.
They feel it looks slightly large in current market conditions, the pricing
a bit tight and the maturity possibly slightly too long. On the plus side,
they also noted that it is the first D-Mark issue for payment next year and
that this should give the underwriters enough time to clear their books.
NBH, the Hungarian central bank, said that it and the underwriters timed the
issue to exploit an opportunity at the long-maturity end of the German bond
market. Rates have fallen sharply but analysts do not expect the trend to
continue.
The latest issue, for which payment is due in January, is part of an NBH
programme to borrow Dollars 1bn in 1993 through at least four bond issues to
maintain Hungary's position on international markets and increase central
bank reserves.
NBH expects maturing debt of Dollars 2bn in 1993 to be offset - assuming a
balanced current account - by direct capital inflow of at least Dollars 1bn
and official borrowing of about Dollars 800m. The central bank plans to
increase foreign currency reserves from the present level of Dollars 5bn to
about Dollars 6bn. Nevertheless the view is gaining ground within the
government that reserves are adequate and pressure is strengthening for NBH
to ease its expensive borrowing programme.
Hungary is also set to meet a growing part of its external financing
requirements through domestic issues since NBH recently said domestic
underwriters could apply to sell forint bonds to foreigners. Hungary's
declining reliance on international capital markets has come as its access
has improved. NBH recently issued its first Yankee bond, a Dollars 200m
10-year exercise.
Meanwhile, Basle-based rolling stock supplier Eurofima's DM350m eight-year
bonds will find their way to the regular investors, say bankers, adding that
the associated currency warrants enabling buyers to take a position on the
dollar against the D-Mark look expensive. Eurofima's FFr500m block trade
re-opens an existing FFr1.5bn bond due 1999.
Strong investor demand is still being reported for sovereign, supranational
and elite corporate borrowers in sterling. But Guinness was criticised for
the way it tried to take advantage of the firm tone by launching a Pounds
150m five-year Eurobond. It was widely described as tightly priced at 42
basis points over comparable gilts. The borrower is, however, a well
accepted and regular name and a new issue which does not suffer from coupon
drag can risk being more aggressively priced.

FT  11 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: New Italian tax regime for
international investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL investors who hold Italian government bonds through the two
international clearing systems, Cedel and Euroclear, will now be able to
reclaim withholding tax on their investments, following an agreement reached
with the Italian authorities.
Delays and difficulty in reclaiming the tax, which currently stands at 12.5
per cent, has traditionally been one of the main factors discouraging
foreign fund managers from investing in Italy.
Rules introduced a year ago to make it easier for investors to reclaim the
tax failed to meet many of the concerns of foreign fund managers, since they
excluded market participants which have their tax residence in a different
country from their clearing system or global custodian.
In the summer, a group of banks, brokers and clearing houses announced they
had set up a group to negotiate with the Italian authorities to resolve
resulting difficulties.
Although some details have to be finalised, the agreement with Italy has
been concluded in principle, Euroclear said.

FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Westpac to implement recovery
strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTPAC, the troubled Australian bank, is planning a fast recovery programme
and a strategic redirection of its core retail and corporate banking
business in Australia and New Zealand, Reuter reports from Sydney.
Mr Frank Conroy, managing director, said yesterday that this followed a
review of the bank's strategy and recovery programmes by McKinsey, the
international management consultancy.
'Through these moves, the bank is seeking to further strengthen its capital
ratio, to rebuild market confidence and significantly boost the underlying
performance of its businesses,' he said.
Westpac's board had endorsed further development of the recovery strategy
implemented in the past few months, Mr Conroy said. This involved more
closely defined strategic priorities, an accelerated recovery programme to
improve performance and top-level management changes. The bank would
streamline and cut the size of the head office, sell non-core assets outside
institutional and retail banking and create an organisation to manage
problem assets.
Mr Conroy said Westpac would also rejuvenate its customer focus, improve
efficiency in Australia and New Zealand and reorientate institutional
banking. It would also build on its strong position in global financial
markets and eliminate corporate lending that did not meet strategic or
financial criteria.
He said a team of executives had been chosen to form the office of the
managing director to manage a fast recovery.
Westpac's share price fell to a nine-year low of ADollars 2.396 on Friday
after it revealed an extra tax liability of ADollars 115m (Dollars 82.1m) in
the US and said the final dividend could be halved from the previous
forecast of 12 cents a share. This prompted widespread investor criticism
and attracted the attention of regulatory authorities, including the
Australian Securities Commission

shake-up
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WILL Ford Motor, the second largest of Detroit's big three vehicle
manufacturers, follow rivals General Motors and Chrysler and remake its top
management team before the year is out? If so, might a British-born
executive emerge as heir-apparent to the chairman?
That is one of the hottest topics of debate in the US motor industry, with
some analysts suggesting Ford could move as early as this week to anoint an
heir-apparent to Mr Harold Poling, the company's 67-year-old chairman and
chief executive, who is due to retire next year.
The favoured candidate of the Detroit rumour-mill is Mr Alex Trotman, 59,
the British-born executive vice-president in charge of Ford's North American
operations.
Mr Trotman, who joined Ford in Britain in 1955 as a student trainee, rose on
the product planning side. He is the only member of the group's senior
executive team to have run its vehicle operations in the three major markets
 -North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific. Until just a few months ago, the
front-runner had been widely assumed to be Mr Allan Gilmour, 58, the urbane
executive vice-president in charge of worldwide vehicle operations.
However, some analysts claim to have detected growing enthusiasm on the Ford
board for Mr Trotman, who reports to Mr Gilmour. Mr Trotman's background is
in vehicle manufacturing, while Mr Gilmour reached the top through Ford's
finance operations.
The financial and engineering sides of the industry have often vied for the
top jobs - hence the phrase 'bean counters versus car guys'.
Ford's board is due to hold two meetings before the end of the year - the
first is on Thursday - and analysts suggest it may decide to set a
succession in motion, to ensure a smooth transition. A spokesman refused to
comment.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHEVRON, the fourth biggest US oil and gas group, unveiled plans to cut
annual corporate headquarters operating costs by Dollars 200m, or 30 per
cent, as a result of reductions in staff.
The San Francisco-based company said the decision - part of a broader
programme to reduce total group expenses - was taken following a six-month
long study.
The changes will result in a reduction of about 1,000 positions, or 28 per
cent, from the level of headquarters staff at the beginning of this year.
Since about 550 corporate staff employees have already opted for early
retirement, the net number of jobs being cut will be about 450. The job cuts
will occur in more than a dozen departments, including tax, treasury, legal
and human resources.
The oil and gas group also announced a separate measure to reduce costs by
restructuring its in-house technology company.
This move is expected to save Dollars 35m to Dollars 45m a year and will
result in the reduction of another 500 jobs, or 22 per cent of the total.
Mr Kenneth Derr, Chevron's chairman, said that he regretted 'that these
changes will leave some employees without jobs'.
He said the cuts reflected the business environment.
Chevron's third-quarter net earnings, announced last month, were 21 per cent
higher at Dollars 378m.

FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Montgomery in the limelight -
Patrick Harverson reports on a small but ambitious securities firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 700 of the most influential money managers in the US, representing
over Dollars 1,000bn in assets, assembled in San Francisco recently for an
annual conference that has become one of the most eagerly attended events in
the investment industry calendar.
The money managers were there for presentations and meetings with senior
executives from a select group of small, fast-growing companies that are
forging a name for themselves in several key industries.
Although it is one of the country's finest cities, San Francisco was not
chosen as the location because of its beauty, but because it is home to
Montgomery Securities, the small but ambitious securities firm that has been
hosting this get-together for more than 20 years.
The firm's sole office is in the pyramid-shaped Transamerica building that
dominates San Francisco's skyline.
As a private partnership, Montgomery rarely attracts much attention
alongside its bigger east coast rivals. Its annual securities investment
conference, however, gives it an opportunity to enjoy the limelight, if only
for a few days.
Outside the industry, Montgomery is probably best known for its successful
rebellion last year against the New York Stock Exchange's proposal to open
trading half an hour earlier each day. So effective was the Montgomery-led
rebellion that within a week the NYSE was forced to abandon its plans.
Inside the industry, the firm is known as a nimble, aggressive broker/dealer
of growth stocks from five specialised industry areas: technology, consumer
products, financial services, healthcare and environmental services.
Although Montgomery's raison d'etre is institutional broking and
market-making, the firm has been working hard - like almost every other in
the industry - to develop a presence in the increasingly competitive, but
profitable asset management business.
Unlike others in the industry, Montgomery has no proprietary or program
trading business. The firm likes to make the point that because it does not
trade for its own account, there are no conflicts between its own and its
clients' interests.
This may go down well with its institutional clients, but it cuts the firm
off from a potentially huge source of revenue. Some of the biggest profits
earned by securities houses this past year have come from the trading of
securities for their own account. Montgomery, however, is a private
partnership, and as such lacks the capital to support a significant
proprietary business.
Consequently, the firm concentrates on three core businesses. The most
important is equity brokerage, where Montgomery offers sales and trading
services to its institutional and a few private clients. Montgomery is
regularly among the top five equity traders of stocks in four of its five
specialist sectors, and recently opened the largest trading floor outside
New York.
Its corporate finance business, which includes mergers and acquisitions and
private placements, keeps the firm among the top echelon of stock
underwriters in its sectors. Like a few other San Francisco-based firms
(such as Hambrecht &amp; Quist and Robertson, Stephens), Montgomery is
well-known for handling technology and healthcare company flotations, or
IPOs (initial public offerings).
It's most famous client is pharmaceuticals group Amgen, which it took public
in 1983 and which is now worth Dollars 8.6bn.
Montgomery has reaped the benefits, along with the rest of the industry, of
the extraordinary underwriting boom of the past 18 months.
Mr Tom Weisel, Montgomery's long-standing chairman, says: 'As the
underwriting calendar took off last year, our firm went from Dollars 100m to
Dollars 170m in revenues, and it should be about Dollars 200m this year.'
Montgomery's smallest, but fastest-growing, business is asset management,
which it is building up as part of a strategy to use fee-based business as
insurance against volatile revenues from market-related activities, such as
broking and underwriting.
Montgomery began to construct an asset management operation 18 months ago,
and has Dollars 750m of assets under its wing, the bulk in a growth fund
(which performed best last year among US small company mutual funds). The
firm recently launched an emerging markets and a fixed-income fund, and
hopes to have Dollars 1bn in its custody by year-end.
The ultimate aim, says Mr Weisel, is to construct Montgomery's revenue base
like a three-legged stool. One leg will be brokerage, the second
underwriting and the third asset management, which he hopes will be a
Dollars 10bn or Dollars 20bn business within the next five to eight years.
The firm is as nationally minded as any on Wall Street. Its clients are
spread across the US, with the bulk in New York and Boston, and Montgomery
works hard at keeping its finger on Wall Street's pulse. Its role last year
in forcing the NYSE to abandon its early trading plans was a case in point.
As Mr Weisel explains: 'We don't think the stock exchange did a thorough
job. After talking to all our institutional clients across the country, we
felt that expanding trading hours was not going to expand trading volume . .
. and it was going to wreak havoc on west coast firms. We felt pretty
strongly about it, and we had to take charge.'

FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Skandia scales down reinsurance
operations in US
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDISH insurer Skandia has begun scaling down its North American
reinsurance operations, after rejecting a Dollars 550m offer for the
business from the US investment group John Head &amp; Partners.
Skandia said it intended to cut annual net premiums at Skandia America Corp,
its North American non-life reinsurance unit, to Dollars 100m a year from
the current Dollars 450m over the next two years.
SAC, currently the eighth largest reinsurer in the US, has already announced
plans to sell its surety portfolio to Nac Re, another US reinsurer.
Skandia said it had decided to break off talks with John Head because of
disagreements over pricing and uncertainties as to whether the deal could be
completed.
It said the structure of the transaction would have given it a continuing
exposure to reinsurance through the retention of preferred stock.
SAC, which has an equity of Dollars 400m, is expected to focus primarily on
casualty busi-ness.
US credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's yesterday downgraded the senior
debt, claims-paying ability, and commercial paper of a number of companies
within the Skandia group.
The move 'reflects continued upheaval in Scandinavian financial markets, an
expected further decline in asset values, and the company's inability to
significantly restructure its debt maturity schedule,' said S&amp;P.
Skandia International Insurance Corp, Skandia American Reinsurance Corp and
American Skandia Life Assurance Corp have had their claims-paying ability
downgraded to 'BBB' from 'A'.
Skandia Capital AB's senior debt was lowered to 'BBB' from 'A' and the
commercial paper ratings on Skandia Capital AB and Skandia International
Capital Corp to 'A-3' from 'A-2'.

FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Chinese communism's capital
steel project - Simon Holberton on how Shougang Corporation has exploited
its new autonomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last summer Shougang Corporation, the Chinese steel company also known as
Capital Steel, played host to an important visitor.
Deng Xiaoping, China's 88-year-old leader, paid a visit to the company's
headquarters on the outskirts of Beijing. Today, photographs, some 15ft by
5ft, adorn the company's premises commemorating his visit.
But Shougang, China's third largest steel maker, got much more out of Deng's
visit than just a photograph. Company officials lobbied him for greater
autonomy from China's central planning bureaucracy and won.
On October 10 the state council, China's cabinet, gave Shougang full
autonomy over capital investment, power to conduct its own foreign trading
relationships and approval to set up its own bank. From the beginning of
next year it will not have to fulfil state-determined production targets and
may sell all its steel products on the free market.
Shougang has not been slow to make the most of its new autonomy. In the past
month it announced three acquisitions and, according to the company, more
are to come.
On October 23 it joined with Cheung Kong, Mr Li Ka-Shing's Hong Kong
property and investment company, to acquire a 77 per cent interest in Tung
Wing Steel - a Hong Kong steel trader and distributor of steel products for
the construction industry - for about HKDollars 240m (Dollars 31.05m). The
deal leaves Shougang holding a 51 per cent stake in Tung Wing. On November
2, Shougang said it had bought, for an undisclosed sum, the Number 2
converter steel-making plant of California Steel Industries. The company
plans to send 300 workers to California to dismantle the plant and ship it
to Shougang's Qilu Steel Works in Shandong province.
The US deal was followed on November 5 with the announcement from the
Peruvian government that Shougang was the successful bidder for Peru's
state-owned iron producer, Hierro Peru. Shougang topped the competition  -
from Switzerland, Chile, Mexico and Japan - with an offer of USDollars 120m.
It has pledged to invest a further USDollars 150m in plant and assume
Hierro's debts of USDollars 41.8m.
These announcements are likely to be followed by Shougang establishing a
larger presence in Hong Kong. Mr Pan Huayuan, the company's vice-president
and senior economist, said recently the company planned to establish its
international headquarters in the colony because of its role as a centre of
finance, information and communications.
He also said the Shougang planned to buy a bank in the Hong Kong. This would
complement the bank it has just been given approval to establish on the
mainland.
He said the company had looked at Overseas Trust Bank - which was rescued by
the Hong Kong government in the early 1980s and has been put up for sale -
but would not be drawn on whether it had made an offer. Whatever bank
Shougang buys in Hong Kong 'it all depends on price', he said.
Shougang is at the centre of China's plans to modernise its steel industry -
one of the only steel industries straining to grow rather than suffering the
pain of retrenchment.
China produces about 70m tonnes of steel a year and plans to increase
capacity to 100m tonnes by the end of the decade. But much of the industry
uses outmoded production equipment; according to mainland Chinese reports,
60m tonnes of current capacity is in need of retooling.
Shougang produces 10m tonnes a year and has an ambitious programme to double
capacity in seven years. It has two main sites - one in Beijing and the
other in Shandong, for which the Californian mill is destined - and has
introduced fairly modern blast furnaces from Belgium. Recently it
commissioned its number 4 blast furnace at its Beijing works at a capital
cost of Yn410m (Dollars 73m).
The company employs about 200,000 workers, but only a quarter are directly
engaged in the steel-making business. Shougang - like many of China's large
state-owned industries - is a large vertically integrated organisation that
provides cradle-to-grave welfare for its employees.
It owns and operates iron ore and coal mines in China, although it is
importing some Australian iron ore for its blast furnaces; it owns
mechanical engineering businesses, which make the machinery it uses; a
construction company which builds its plant; and a shipping line. About 60
per cent of retained earnings - equal this year to Yn1.2bn - is used for
business expansion.
Shougang, however, devotes 20 per cent of its retained earnings to welfare -
which this year will amount to about Yn400m.
According to Mr Pan, employees at Shougang pay just 1 per cent of their
wages - which across the work force average Yn324 a month in 1991, including
bonuses - for housing. That comes to 62 US cents a month for rent, at
current official rates of exchange.
He is particularly proud of the company's record in providing new housing
for employees. 'Over the past 13 years we have built 1.93m square metres of
housing for employees,' he says. 'That is twice the area of housing we had
built before the reforms were started.'
And there is the rub. A lot has been made in the Chinese press of breaking
the cradle-to-grave employment system in Chinese state industry. There is
talk of hiring and firing employees, demoting those executives who do not
perform, while paying all on a performance-related basis.
Such ideas were written into Communist Party policy at its 14th congress in
Beijing last month. But, even in one of China's showcase enterprises, these
ideas meet resistance.
Mr Pan balks at the idea of redundancies. He finds the idea repellent and
would prefer to deal with non-performing workers by cutting their bonuses,
not jobs. Like a latter day Micawber he has faith that growth will pay the
bills.

FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Head of BNZ quits in wake of
takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR LINDSAY PYNE, the man credited with returning Bank of New Zealand (BNZ)
into profit after the near-disastrous losses of the 1987-1989 period,
announced his resignation as managing director yesterday, only five days
after the National Australia Bank (NAB) announced it had succeeded in buying
it.
Mr Pyne was appointed to head BNZ in 1989 when the first signs emerged that
the bank was faced with large scale losses. He led its restructuring and
took considerable political and shareholder flak when he insisted on making
public the full extent of its bad debts, totalling NZDollars 2.8bn
(USDollars 1.48bn at current rates).
He said that while other banks might succeed in hiding these for a time, in
the end this would only slow the bank's recovery.
Mr Pyne, a New Zealander who formerly worked for Citibank, said that he was
retiring because 'the job is done' although NAB has said publicly it wants
him to continue.
He said: 'BNZ is now in safe hands. I made the decision to go a long time
ago, once its recovery was complete and its future was secure.'
Mr Pyne's special field of expertise was restructuring companies. He
restructured Broadbank, a leading New Zealand finance company, and brought
to profitability Postbank, which was sold to ANZ Bank.
Mr Pyne's resignation takes effect from November 20, but he will remain a
consultant in the meantime.
He intends to continue in restructuring work, though he said his next job
would not necessarily be in handling a bank or financial institution.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the international ratings agency, has raised to A1 plus
from A3 the short-term certificate of deposits of BNZ to reflect its
takeover by NAB, Reuter reports from Wellington.
Separately S&amp;P Australian Ratings confirmed that it had raised BNZ short and
long-term ratings to AA/A1 plus from BBB/A3.
S&amp;P also removed BNZ from its creditwatch.
'Completion of the acquisition by NAB has made BNZ a strategically important
member of a strong regional and international bank,' S&amp;P added.
Conditions of the purchase also gave additional protection from the previous
two main shareholders, the New Zealand government and merchant bank Fay,
Richwhite, over further provisioning requirements for some outstanding loans
and litigation.

ARNOTTS, the Australian bakery group, will not take legal action to prevent
Campbell Soup, the US foods group, from sending takeover documents to

'We considered asking for an injunction to prevent the offers going out in

shareholders to raise a barrier between Campbell and the offerees,' Arnotts
said.
Campbell, which owns 33 per cent of Arnotts, is offering ADollars 8.80 a

Arnotts' shares closed at ADollars 9.18 in Australia yesterday.

<TEXT>
THAI Airways International, the national airline partially privatised this
year, has predicted its net profits will nearly double to Bt5.71bn (Dollars
224m) in the year to September 30 1993, from Bt3.02bn last year.
Some stockbrokers said yesterday's forecast was optimistic but added the
company could be including planned aircraft sales in the figures, as it has
in the past. Thai is expected to release further details to the stock
exchange of Thailand next week.
The company predicted total revenues would rise in the current year to
Bt64.44bn, from Bt55.03bn.
This month the new civilian-controlled board of Thai has announced further
changes in senior management, demoting military men associated with the old
regime of the Thai air force.
If Thai's profit forecast is accurate, the company's prospective
price/earnings ratio falls to around 14, making its shares more attractive
to foreign buyers, who have concentrated on the cheaper shares of other
regional airlines.
'No-one really knows how to forecast this monster,' said one stock analyst
yesterday, 'but there's a lot of built-in growth in this company if they
start cutting costs.'

<TEXT>
J. C. PENNEY, the large Texan retail group, yesterday reported a virtual 60
per cent surge in third-quarter results, with after-tax profits reaching
Dollars 186m, compared with Dollars 116m in the same period of 1991.
According to Mr William Howell, chairman, the group saw improvements across
the board, as stores, catalogue operations and life insurance interests all
posted 'strong earnings performances as compared with last year'.
The group's retail sales during the quarter were up by 10.3 per cent at
Dollars 4.34bn, and gross margins were virtually unchanged year-on-year.
However, the group's selling, general and administrative expenses, as a
percentage of retail sales, improved 'significantly,' suggesting that costs
are under firm control.
Profits for the first nine months of the year were Dollars 402m against
Dollars 227m for the comparable period last time. Penney's shares rose
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 75 1/2 .
The Limited, which operates specialist chains ranging from Victoria's Secret
to Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, also posted a 10 per cent increase in third-quarter
profits at Dollars 80m after tax.
Sales were 12.4 per cent higher at Dollars 1.43bn.
However, the company admitted performance had varied across its chains, with
the Structure and Lane Bryant faring well, for example, but Victoria's
Secret Stores experiencing 'a significant drop in third-quarter
profitability due largely to fashion errors.'
The Limited's shares eased Dollars  3/8 to close at Dollars 23 3/8 .

CANADIAN Pacific is reducing its 45 per cent interest in United Dominion
Industries, a US-based engineered products affiliate, as part of its plan to
sell peripheral assets.
United, formerly Dominion Bridge, was a star performer for Canadian Pacific
in the late 1970s as it pursued a string of US acquisitions but the harsh
economic climate has forced it to reduce the size of its business.
The Canadian group is raising CDollars 105m (USDollars 83m) through an issue
of 8.5 per cent debentures convertible into United common shares by December
15 1995.
If all the debentures were exchanged Canadian Pacific's interest would fall
to 17.5 per cent from 45 per cent.
Each CDollars 1,000 principal debenture would be exchanged into 95.238
United shares.

HYSLA, the steel subsidiary of the Mexican conglomerate Grup Alfa, is to

The mill should be ready by early 1995, and will be the first thin-slab

GENERAL Motors, the loss-making US vehicles group in the throes of a

Dollars 1bn through several tranches of fixed-rate preference shares.
The company has already raised some Dollars 4.6bn through common and

GM, announcing it had filed a shelf-registration, or pre-clearance request
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, gave no timetable for any new
issues, but said it expected to be in a position to make an initial offering
in the next few weeks.
GM said the proceeds would be used for general corporate purposes and added
that fixed-rate preference stock currently represented an attractive means
of providing equity finance to strengthen the balance sheet and provide
financial flexibility.

WANG Laboratories, the US office computer systems company that is struggling
to emerge from bankruptcy protection, said its revenues for the first fiscal
quarter declined about 22 per cent and projected a loss for the quarter.
Revenues for the quarter were approximately Dollars 360m, down from Dollars
461m in the same period last year.
As expected, the first quarter will reflect a loss from operations, the
company said, because anticipated cost reductions from the continuing
restructuring did not take full effect during the quarter.
In the first quarter of fiscal 1992 Wang suffered a loss of Dollars 9.8m, or
six cents per share.
'We are encouraged by our first-quarter revenues,' said Mr Richard Miller,
chairman and chief executive. 'They show a continued commitment to the
company from our customers and are in line with our initial revenue estimate
for the year of Dollars 1.4bn, which was made when we filed for Chapter 11
protection in August.'
The company said it expected to file revised financial statements for fiscal
1992 early next month. At the time of its bankruptcy filing Wang reported an
estimated loss of Dollars 139.2m, or 82 cents per share, on revenues of
Dollars 1.9bn. The company added that it had postponed the date of its
annual meeting.

SNC, the international engineering and construction group, saw earnings fall
to CDollars 2.8m (USDollars 2.2m), or 19 cents a share, in the first nine

Revenues were CDollars 492m, against CDollars 370m.
Third-quarter profit was CDollars 2.1m, or 14 cents a share, against
CDollars 2.4m, or 19 cents, on revenues of CDollars 173m, against CDollars

SNC has cut engineering and administrative staff and will feel the financial

It is looking for more international work and has won

change of status

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EQUITABLE, the large but ailing US life insurance company of which
France's Axa now owns a 49 per cent stake, yesterday reported an after-tax
loss of Dollars 35.2m in the three months to end-September.
The third-quarter figure, however, comes after an extraordinary charge of
Dollars 55.6m. The company said this reflected the final expenses of its
recent 'demutualisation' - the complex process of switching from a
policyholder-owned to a shareholder-owned company, with an associated share
flotation.
In the same period of 1991, the after-tax loss was Dollars 220m, after an
Dollars 11.1m extraordinary charge and a Dollars 239.5m deficit from
discontinued operations.
The Equitable said yesterday that profits from continuing operations, before
extraordinary charges, slipped from Dollars 30.6m to Dollars 20.4m in the
third quarter, but stand at Dollars 300,000 for the first nine months of the
year, compared with a deficit of Dollars 146.5m in the same three quarters
of 1991.
After extraordinary charges of Dollars 101.3m - again, demutualisation costs
 -the after-tax loss in the first nine months of 1992 is Dollars 101m.
During the third quarter, insurance operations made an operating profit of
Dollars 16.8m, ahead of investment gains and losses. This compared with a
Dollars 400,000 profit in the same period of 1991. The company said there
were 'strong earnings' in the life and annuity operations, partly offset by
losses on the disability lines.
On the investment services side - which takes in the Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette brokerage business and Alliance Capital Management - after-tax
profits rose strongly to Dollars 47m, compared with Dollars 27.4m in the
same period of 1991.
However, The Equitable registered a Dollars 2.6m after-tax loss on its
insurance investment portfolio. This compared with a Dollars 29.8m gain a
year ago, including the gain on the sale of an insurance subsidiary, and
came after a further Dollars 64.8m after-tax addition to valuation
allowances and asset writedowns.
Last year, The Equitable took a substantial net write-down and increase in
asset valuation allowances, amounting to Dollars 548m, as it attempted to
put its investment portfolio on a more conservative footing.

FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: McDonald's puts beef into its
expansion - Fast-food outlets are planned in the world's far-flung corners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The appetite for hamburgers seems immune to politics and recession.
McDonald's, the world's largest chain of fast-food restaurants, has
successfully delivered its brand of capitalism to Moscow, introduced
foil-wrapped ketchup to France, and may even offer its formula meal of
ground beef, fried potatoes and a cola in India's largest cities before the
end of the decade.
It operates in 62 countries, some as remote as Macau (two stores) and as
politically unstable as Yugoslavia, and has long-term objectives to reach
into every corner of the world. After gaining a foothold in western Europe,
China and Russia, the company plans to open in several middle eastern
countries in 1993.
Aside from a teryaki burger in Japan, and 'McSpaghetti' noodles in the
Philippines, McDonald's rarely diversifies its overseas menus beyond
burgers, potatoes and drinks.
International customers are seldom offered breakfast, salads, or any of the
other competitive innovations seen at McDonald's restaurants in the US.
Those frills are saved for mature markets that need an extra boost in market
share.
But those customers are vital if McDonald's, which has seen flat sales
growth in its US restaurants this year, is to maintain its 10-year history
of 14 per cent compound earnings growth.
International operations account for 40 per cent of the Illinois-based
giant's annual earnings, and are projected to reach 50 per cent by 1995.
In 1991 McDonald's earned Dollars 860m, or Dollars 2.35 per share, on
worldwide sales of Dollars 19.9bn while in the third quarter it reported
earnings of Dollars 289.2m, or 79 cents, on sales of Dollars 5.8bn.
The company does not release sales figures for individual countries and will
not say if its operations in regions such as eastern Europe have yet paid
back the 10-year lead time required to arrange suppliers and government
approvals.
However, Mr James Cantalupo, president of McDonald's International, says
expansion into the more far-flung outposts is vital. 'All of these economies
are growing. I don't see any market where we can't continue to accelerate
our growth.'
Market saturation and the appeal of things American in newly opened
economies help explain why McDonald's foreign units produce nearly twice the
average annual sales of their domestic counterparts.
While the US is nearing hamburger saturation - there is one McDonald's
outlet for every 29,000 people in the US, and plenty of fast-food
alternatives - there are millions of potential customers for each new
McDonald's in countries such as Poland and China.
Despite its global presence, the bulk of McDonald's foreign earnings comes
from just six countries. Canada, Japan, England, Germany, France and
Australia produce 80 per cent of the chain's overseas income.
That profile has caused some analysts to believe that its earnings growth
will suffer from the recessions in the UK and Canada, and growing weakness
in Japan, where the company has 912 restaurants, its largest distribution
outside of the US.
'Japan is the big question mark,' says Ms Caroline Levy, a Lehman analyst.
'Twenty to thirty per cent of McDonald's foreign income comes from Japan.
The economy there is weak, the market is much more competitive than it used
to be, and margins are under pressure.'
McDonald's sales outside the US were up 23 per cent in the third quarter,
and 18 per cent for the first nine months of 1992. With 200 more foreign
restaurants scheduled to open in the fourth quarter, sales are bound to
accelerate towards the year-end, although not at the annualised pace
projected a year ago.
Still, Mr Cantalupo's plans are long-term. He says the contributions of
locations outside the 'big six' countries are important to boost profit
growth and will become increasingly important.
He remains committed to eastern Europe and Moscow, where he plans to invest
Dollars 100m in the next three years to bring his restaurant count there to
100, and projected sales to Dollars 250m. Mr Cantalupo also plans to double
McDonald's presence in Europe within three years, and nearly triple outlets
in Latin America.
That would mean 1,000 new European hamburger stores, and 350 new outlets
south of the US border. Overall, McDonald's plans to open foreign stores at
a rate of 500 to 600 per year.
Mr Peter Oakes, equities analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York, says those
plans are ambitious, but realistic. Using even his most conservative
calculations, Mr Oakes says McDonald's is far from reaching market
saturation in most parts of the world. 'This is just the tip of the
iceberg,' Mr Oakes says. 'Just think about China.'
Making a rough estimate, Mr Oakes says investors have gained about three
cents per share in annual income for every 100 new foreign restaurants
McDonald's has opened.

FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Cohen to launch Republic venture
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER Cohen, who in early 1990 was ousted as chairman of the Shearson
Lehman brokerage subsidiary of American Express, has been recruited by Mr
Edmond Safra to become vice-chairman of the Republic New York Corporation
banking group to launch its newly approved securities business.
Republic, the holding company for New York area commercial and savings banks
that have combined deposits of Dollars 21bn and capital of Dollars 2.3bn,
won approval last month from the Federal Reserve to conduct a full-service
securities brokerage business in the US.
Mr Cohen was also named to Republic's board yesterday and as a member of the
executive committee.
The new securities subsidiary will begin operations with a staff of 43
people and initial capital of Dollars 100m. Its staff could eventually grow
to several hundred people.
Mr Safra, the Geneva-based financier, controls about 30 per cent of the
Republic group. He and Mr Cohen first met more than 20 years ago and did
business together during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1978 Mr Cohen left Wall
Street to spend one year working for Republic.
In launching its securities business, which will focus on brokerage and
investment advisory activities for Republic's affluent and largely non-US
client base, Republic joins the ranks of the very few US banks that are
allowed by the Federal Reserve into the securities sector.
The 45-year-old Mr Cohen said he began working as a consultant to the
Safra-controlled institution two years ago.
Mr Cohen said yesterday he expected to concentrate on developing a brokerage
business with a strong technology base that would offer a brokerage
execution capability for professional investors and Republic's high net
worth individual client base.

FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Cartel body rules Metro-Asko
deal anti-competitive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S federal competition authorities yesterday dealt a blow to plans to
create one of the world's largest retail groups with sales of more than
DM70bn (Dollars 46bn).
The Bundeskartellamt provisionally ruled that the planned purchase by Metro,
Germany's biggest stores group, of a majority stake in Asko Deutsche
Kaufhaus would be anti-competitive in a number of areas.
The privately controlled Metro, which is domiciled in Switzerland, already
has an 11 per cent shareholding in Asko. It announced its plans for a
takeover in July this year and the move has the support of Asko's
management.
However, the Bundeskartellamt concluded that in a number of sectors the
combined group would have anti-competitive market dominance in certain parts
of Germany. The authorities said yesterday that the sectors involved are
food, furniture and DIY, but gave no further details.
The ruling will not automatically lead to the unscrambling of the
acquisition plan as Metro, Asko and the authorities have until the end of
this month to negotiate over a possible compromise.
This could involve selling stores in the areas the Bundeskartellamt has
identified, but neither company commented yesterday on a likely response to
the ruling. If no compromise can be reached, Metro could challenge the
ruling in the Berlin courts.
Last year Metro reported turnover of DM46bn, of which more than DM30bn came
from its extensive network of retail businesses within Germany, at the core
of which is the majority owned quoted Kaufhof group. The business was
founded by the reclusive Mr Otto Beisheim, who copied the 'cash and carry'
concept from the US and opened his first store in Germany in 1964.
In July, shortly before Metro unveiled its plans, Asko reported sales up 64
per cent to DM19.9bn for 1991, reflecting the acquisition of the Co-op
retail group. Write-offs on acquisitions and share stakes meant the parent
company reported a loss of DM269m after a pre-tax profit of DM106m in 1990.
Sales this year are likely to be around DM22bn.

FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Shares in TNT plunge 29% after
poor result

TNT shares fell 22 cents to an all-time low of 53 cents yesterday after the
Australian transport group announced equity accounted net losses of ADollars
65.1m (USDollars 45.3m) after abnormals for the first quarter.
Analysts were surprised by the reaction to the poor result, which was widely
expected. Most said it in part reflected a lack of confidence on the
Australian Stock Exchange, where the All Ordinaries index closed at a
20-month low.
Directors faced angry questions at the annual meeting, with shareholders
forcing a ballot on a director's re-election. However, Mr Fred Millar,
chairman, said the group's financial position had improved since the end of
its financial year to June, when it reported net losses after abnormals of
ADollars 195m.
Mr Millar said the group expected to return to 'substantial' profits in
1993-1994, but was unlikely to pay a dividend until the following year.
Ansett, the airline group jointly owned with News Corporation, contributed
operating profits of ADollars 3.2m, marking a return to operating profits
after two years of heavy losses.

RENAULT has ruled out any merger with Swedish vehicle maker Volvo in the
near future, in spite of cross-shareholdings, Reuter reports from Stockholm.
'I think we have to increase co-operation within the current ownership
(structure),' Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault chief executive, said.
He said a new French law would be needed to change the ownership structures
of both companies. Renault has a 25 per cent equity stake in Volvo Car and
45 per cent in Volvo Truck. Volvo owns 20 per cent of Renault and 45 per
cent of the French group's trucks and buses company.

<TEXT>
HAFSLUND Nycomed, the Norwegian radiology products group, is paying Dollars
94m for Christiaens International, a Dutch pharmaceutical group.
In the last three years Hafslund has spent NKr3.2bn (Dollars 497m) on
expansion, mainly in Europe, and last month acquired a small Spanish
pharmaceuticals company.
Last year some 77 per cent of group turnover came from outside Norway, but
this will increase to more than 80 per cent with the latest acquisitions.
Yesterday's deal strengthens the group's sales and distribution network
while establishing a solid presence in the Benelux region.
Christiaens, which is being acquired by Hafslund's Nycomed Pharma unit -
itself the largest pharmaceutical supplier in Norway and Denmark - is a
holding company for a group of pharmaceuticals companies in Belgium and
Holland.
It has a workforce of 258 and expects turnover for 1992 to rise to NKr300m
from NKr260m in 1991. Hafslund will market its medical imaging and
therapeutics products through Christiaens' distribution network.

FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Simpsons rebels consider approach to Panel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REBEL SHAREHOLDERS at Simpsons of Cornhill, owner of the famous City chop
house, yesterday threatened to ask the Takeover Panel to examine the
proposed merger with Baldwin, the holidays, printing and properties group.
The dissidents told shareholders at Simpsons' annual meeting that they
feared Baldwin's all-paper offer could dilute the value of their holdings
because, they claimed, Baldwin was also considering a separate all-paper bid
for Leading Guides, the private publishing company in which Mr Roy Ackerman,
Simpsons chairman, has a majority stake.
Leading Guides, publishers of Egon Ronay guides, was formed earlier this
year after Alfresco Leisure Publications, of which Mr Ackerman was chairman,
went into receivership.
Mr Ackerman, who urged shareholders to support Baldwin's offer, said their
was no link between the Simpsons bid and negotiations over Leading Guides.
Although Mr Sandy Singh, Baldwin's chief executive, confirmed last week that
the company was considering an offer for Leading Guides, Mr Ackerman said
the talks were only at an early and informal stage.
The rebels, he claimed, were trying to divert attention from the Baldwin
bid, which values Simpsons at Pounds 1.68m.
Baldwin has offered one share for every two Simpsons shares; full acceptance
will involve the issue of 2.28m new shares in an enlarged group in which
Simpsons will be a wholly owned subsidiary.
The offer has been accepted by the Simpsons board and stockbrokers Raphael
Zorn Hemsley, together representing more than 54 per cent of the capital.
However, Mr Stephen Morris, speaking for the rebels, said three large
shareholders would oppose the offer. Guernsey-based Spread Trustee Company,
Mountjoy of the Turks and Caicos Islands and Capital Resources of Australia
all wanted 'more details about the Leading Guides deal,' he said.
Together the three companies control 23.8 per cent of the share capital.
'We are unlikely to accept the paper bid, and we will go to the Takeover
Panel to insist that Baldwin gives details about Leading Guides,' Mr Morris
added.
Simpsons is confident the rebels will back the Baldwin offer once the formal
bid document is published.
Dismissing concerns over Leading Guides as a 'red herring', Mr Ackerman said
Baldwin offered the best opportunity for expansion of Simpsons' restaurants
business.
