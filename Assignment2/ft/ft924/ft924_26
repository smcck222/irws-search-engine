Planning Your Pension, Executive pension plans / Occupational schemes for
senior directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON

<TEXT>
EXECUTIVE pension plans (EPPs) are occupational schemes designed for
individuals or small groups of senior executives and directors. As such they
offer all the usual benefits of company pensions and can be particularly
attractive tax planning vehicles.
EPPs were introduced by the Finance Act 1970 and proved particularly popular
during that decade. Today EPPs face tough competition from personal
pensions, which are simpler to operate although not so flexible for tax
purposes.
Anyone considering an EPP should be aware of the complex tax regulations
that govern these plans and be sure to get independent expert advice. The
over-enthusiastic use of EPPs' tax efficiency by high earners in small
companies has attracted the attention of the Inland Revenue on more than one
occasion. The latest Revenue crackdown will restrict the way these plans can
be used to accept extremely high contributions in years of profit to reduce
the corporation tax bill.
EPPs come from the same stable as small self administered schemes (SSASs),
also used by small businesses, especially family concerns. However,
executive pension plan contributions are invested entirely in insurance
company funds, whereas SSASs generally use external fund managers. There is
also a 'hybrid' SSAS which permits free investment choice once a minimum
contribution has been paid into the insurance fund.
The tax benefits of an EPP include.
Full corporation tax relief on the employer's contribution. (Since these are
occupational schemes there must be an employer's contribution.)
Full income tax relief on the employee's contribution.
The pension fund grows free of tax.
Death in service benefits, of up to four times salary, can be paid to the
member's beneficiaries. Where the plan is written in trust this benefit
falls outside the scope of Inheritance Tax (IHT). Some older plans were not
written in trust. If you have one of these you should ask your provider to
put this right to avoid a potential future IHT bill.
Part - and in certain circumstances all - of the fund can be taken as tax
free cash. This is because the tax-free cash is calculated as a proportion
of the final salary and not as a proportion of the fund accumulated at
retirement.
Spouse and dependants' benefits are automatically provided.
The pension, which can be taken between age 60 and 70, is taxed as income.
Although the pension is linked to final salary, contributions under an EPP
are invested on a money purchase basis and grow in an investment fund
earmarked for the individual employee.
Under most money purchase plans the employee and employer contributions are
limited to a certain percentage of annual salary. However, under an EPP,
while the employee is restricted to a contribution of 15 per cent of salary,
there is virtually no restriction on employer contributions. This is because
the level of contribution is based on the projected final salary and the
Revenue permits employers to vary contributions according to annual profit.
For this reason it is still possible to justify employer contributions of
over 100 per cent of salary for a member in his or her early 20s.
In the past directors have taken advantage of this anomaly and channelled
huge chunks of company profits into their plans to avoid higher rates of
corporation tax. This was particularly popular in the 1970s when corporation
tax for small businesses was 42 per cent, compared with the current rate of
25 per cent.
Moreover, due to a loophole in the Social Security Act 1973 young employees
could leave service and take the whole of their pension benefits with them
even though it was effectively overfunded in relation to the period of
service.
Earlier this year, the Revenue announced measures to restrict these
excessive contributions. The new rules, to be announced over the next few
weeks and expected to take effect from the end of 1992, are likely to cut
maximum contributions to about 25 per cent of salary in the early years.
The maximum pension of two-thirds final salary for new members joining on or
after March 17 1987 can be calculated on one of two bases:
Salary in any one of the five years preceding retirement; or
The average salary over three or more consecutive years ending not earlier
than ten years before retirement. (Only this definition can be used for
controlling directors and those earning over Pounds 100,000 per annum).
EPPs can be used to contract out of the state earnings related pension
scheme (Serps) but providers usually recommend that an appropriate personal
pension is used for this purpose, leaving the EPP to provide benefits on top
of the state pension.
A maximum two-thirds final salary pension can be achieved after 20 years
service, although those who joined before March 17 1987 can secure this
after just ten years. A further set of rules applies to plans established
between March 1987 and March 1989, which restrict maximum salary for pension
purposes to Pounds 100,000 with a maximum tax free cash limit of Pounds
150,000.
To complicate things even further, some employees will be caught by the
'earnings cap', which was introduced in the 1989 Budget to reduce the
contributions and pensions of high earners. The cap imposes a maximum salary
of Pounds 75,000 for the current tax year that can be taken into account for
pension purposes. This limits maximum employee contributions to Pounds
11,250 and the maximum pension to Pounds 50,000. The cap affects employees
who joined a new occupational scheme set up after March 14 1989 and new
members who joined an existing scheme after June 1 1989.
Many providers offer a loan facility for EPP clients, although if you want
to use the pension fund for business finance it is worth considering a SSAS.
Under an SSAS it is possible to arrange a loanback of up to 25 per cent of
the pension fund in the first two years, after which a 50 per cent limit
applies. The most popular use of a loanback is the purchase of business
property.
Since the majority of EPPs are run by insurance companies the investment
choice is similar to that of personal pensions and free standing additional
voluntary contributions (FSAVCs) discussed earlier in this series. The main
choices are deposit, with-profits, unitised with profits and unit linked.
Deposit-based contracts are run like a building society account with the
added bonus of tax relief on contributions and the fund. This option is
suitable for the few years before retirement. With-profits contracts
guarantee to pay a sum at maturity. Annual bonuses are added to the sum
assured; once allocated they cannot be taken away. On top of this there is a
final bonus which is discretionary and depends on the fund's performance.
The with profits fund invests in a mixture of equities, bonds and property
and aims to smooth bonus payments over the term.
Unitised with-profits contracts operate an investment structure similar to
the with-profits plan but on a unitised basis so that switching between
funds is easier. Finally, under unit-linked contract the value of the units
reflects directly the investment P6performance of the underlying fund and as
such can be more volatile and therefore more suitable for the early years of
a contract. According to the FT's handbook Executive and Directors' Pensions
1993*, published last week, there are more than 100 EPPs from which to
choose. The book offers some useful tips on picking a plan.
In particular, it warns that if you retire earlier than the date selected at
the outset you may face a hefty penalty. However, if you select an early
retirement date, check what proportion of your contributions is lost in
management charges, since some providers deduct proportionately more on
shorter term contracts.

WHAT will your pension be worth if you die? That is the question the Life
Association of Scotland is urging policyholders to consider.
A potential problem exists for those who have contributed to the old-style
retirement annuity, or section 226 contracts. If a section 226 policyholder
dies before retirement, his family will receive not the accumulated value of
the fund, but either the return of the premiums; premiums with interest; or
(in a limited number of cases) nothing at all.
The loss could be enormous. According to LAS, someone who had invested
Pounds 2,000 a year in a plan for the last 21 years might have built up a
fund worth Pounds 154,000. If the plan merely returned premiums, the family
would get just Pounds 42,000.
There is a further potential difficulty. Many of these policies are not
written in trust. As a consequence, if the policyholder's spouse dies
shortly after his or her death, the family may face an inheritance tax bill
on the policy's proceeds.
Section 226 contracts were replaced by the modern 'personal pension plans'
in July 1988 which do not have the same drawbacks. But some of the problems
may also occur with section 32 policies, executive pension plans and money
purchase schemes.
What can be done to solve these problems, given that the transfer charges on
a pension are so high? Life Association of Scotland stresses: 'It is likely
that only a minority of people with this problem should switch policies in
particular because of the heavy costs involved, unless they are in very poor
health or have made the policy paid-up and so already incurred the costs.'
LAS is issuing free Deed of Trust forms to allow policyholders to get round
the potential IHT problems. Another solution is to add term assurance to
cover the potential loss on death. This could be done at a relatively low
cost.
But if you do have one of these policies, you should first check what the
death benefit will be - and take independent financial advice.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Slowly sliding out the welcome mat /
Review of responses to the US election result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THE American people have spoken. What do British fund managers have to say
about it?
In spite of his two-year tenure in Oxford, Bill Clinton is unlikely to have
the interests of the UK's savers high in his list of priorities. But many
managers believe his arrival could usher in strong performance for UK
investors in US markets.
Much of this has to do with the dollar. In the last two months, the dollar
has appreciated against sterling by roughly 25 per cent - meaning that fund
managers who failed to make their fund grow at all in dollar terms can still
show their British investors a healthy profit.
Although the dollar has risen sharply, there are still two fundamental
reasons to expect continued US currency strength. Economists expect
purchasing power parity to be an important determinant of exchange rates. On
this basis, the pound still seems to be too strong against the dollar at
current rates, giving room for dollar appreciation.
Then there is the 'interest rate differential'. If interest rates in one
country rise while those in other countries stay constant, then, all other
things being equal, the country's currency will strengthen. With US base
rates currently thought to be at their lowest point, and cuts in European
base rates likely next year, the dollar should appreciate. Confidence in the
US should also improve now that political uncertainty has been resolved.
One implication of a continued strong dollar could be a boost for the
investment trust sector. Peter Walls, investment trust analyst with Credit
Lyonnais Laing, points out that as most investment trusts are heavy dollar
earners, the sector tends to out-perform during periods of dollar strength.
The trend over the last 10 years is marked with peaks of investment trust
outperformance almost exactly correlating with peaks for the dollar - so
there could be an opportunity here for British investors.
Another reason for optimism about the US is that many believe the economy
turned the corner under President Bush. Chris Jenkins, manager of the Hill
Samuel US Smaller Companies unit trust, pointed to the recovery in economic
growth and low inflation and said: 'It's ironic that Bush has lost just as
we are getting a turn.'
The drastic restructuring of many American companies has already fed through
into higher productivity, which analysts believe will mean good corporate
profits next year. That should be good for equity prices.
But many fund managers still think that Clinton in the White House will make
a real and positive change. Susan Wood, manager of Mercury's American unit
trust, put it this way: 'What we think is so optimistic about Clinton is
that it's the first time in many years you have got a co-operative Congress.
His policies will be pro-growth and we are greatly enthusiastic about the
plans for infrastructure and capital spending.'
She also pointed out that Clinton will try to restore the politico-economic
cycle, so that the economy reaches a peak in 1996 when the next presidential
election is due. He should therefore be able to resist any temptation to go
for a quick 'rush for growth' this year.
Other managers are less optimistic, although none are as negative as might
be expected when a Democrat comes to power. Martin Brooke, manager of Cannon
North American is nervous but says: 'I hope Clinton isn't going to do us too
much damage. I suspect there will good opportunities in the US market
regardless.'
Which sectors could benefit the most? Many managers are positive about
infrastructure and capital goods, both of which should benefit directly from
Clinton.
Vice-president-elect Albert Gore's enthusiasm for environmental issues has
created great interest in 'green' stocks. John Haynes, manager of the
Fleming North American IT, said: 'The environmental stocks should be boosted
by Clinton's victory. They've had a tough time for the last few years, as
the Bush administration has been very unco-operative.'
Other fund managers are less confident about the timing. James Findlay, of
Foreign &amp; Colonial, thinks that the pre-poll 'bounce' in environmental share
prices may have been overdone.
He said: 'We are playing more of a wait and see game and concentrating on
companies where the fundamentals are already good.'
Sectors likely to do badly include oil stocks, although Brooke points out
that poor crude prices may already be depressing the sector. Defence stocks
are also likely to be hit by Clinton's plan to benefit further from the
'peace dividend'.
The Clinton approach to the health issue could damage many drugs companies -
Wood names it as the most obvious sector to do badly under the new
administration. But the fast-growing health services sector, which provides
administration for hospitals, could be even more in demand as new reforms
are introduced.
Fund managers may be optimistic about the prospects for US shares, but
private investors should remember that equity investment is for the long
term. You should only invest if you can afford to maintain your holding at
least until President Clinton faces re-election in 1996.

BAA, the privatised UK airport operator, is expected to report higher
first-half pre-tax profits on Monday of Pounds 200m to Pounds 220m. However,
last year's Pounds 151m followed hefty provisions of Pounds 55m for property
write-offs and staff cuts.
Although traffic at BAA airports has recovered from the effects of the Gulf
War on air travel, the economic recession in the UK and other industrialised
countries has slowed the upturn.
Composite insurers General Accident and Royal Insurance, which report
nine-month results on Tuesday and Thursday respectively, are expected to
show improvements but still be in the red. GA is tipped to reduce losses to
Pounds 20m (Pounds 133m), thanks to higher premiums and the abating of
rising claims costs. Depending on claims over Hurricane Andrew, the third
quarter could even be profitable. Royal should cut its losses from Pounds
214m to about Pounds 106m, though it is still being hit by mortgage
indemnity losses. Water company results are skewed towards the first half.
Northumbrian, the smallest of the 10 privatised bodies by market
capitalisation, is expected to show a 25 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to
Pounds 39m in the six months to September 30 when it reports on Tuesday. The
interim dividend is forecast to go up by 9 per cent to 7.4p (6.8p).
At Anglian, the forecast profit rise is from Pounds 91.2m to Pounds 101m,
with dividend growth of about 8 per cent to 6.8p.
Dunhill, the luxury goods group which reports on Wednesday, is marked down
for flat to slightly lower interim pre-tax profits, compared with last
year's Pounds 31m. A cushioning effect will be higher interest receivable on
healthy cash balances of about Pounds 180m.
Boots, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group which has weathered the
recession better than most, is likely to report resilient interim profits on
Thursday. Analysts believe pre-tax profits may edge ahead to around Pounds
180m as the strength of the Boots the Chemists chain and the pharmaceuticals
division again shine through. However, the businesses acquired through Ward
White will probably continue to look pretty sickly.
BT is expected to show a 40 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds
1.6bn to Pounds 990m for the half year to September 30 when it announces its
results on Thursday. The main reason for the fall is exceptional charges for
the sale of its interest in Mitel Corporation, the troubled Canadian
telephone equipment maker, and for the voluntary retirement of 29,000
people.
Royal Dutch/Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil group, reports its third-quarter
figures on Thursday. Most analysts are forecasting a Pounds 550m to Pounds
750m profit on a replacement cost basis, compared with Pounds 523m in the
same quarter last year. The results are expected to be boosted by foreign
currency gains and an accounting adjustment at a subsidiary, forecast to net
Pounds 50m.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Tessa keeps its attractions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAVERS disappointed with the fall in base rates but who are reluctant to
move their money out of banks or building societies should not forget Tax
Exempt Special Savings Accounts.
A combination of relatively generous rates and tax efficiency continue to
make this an attractive product in spite of the limits on the amounts that
can be invested.
There is no tax to pay on interest earned in a Tessa, provided the capital
is held for its full five-year term. The maximum investment in the first
year is Pounds 3,000, with a limit of Pounds 1,800 each subsequent year, to
a total maximum of Pounds 9,000.
When Tessas were first launched in January 1991, banks and building
societies competed with each other for the custom, which represented a
reliable source of funds for a stable period. The institutions despair of
money that simply chases high rates and is very liquid.
The institutions are continuing to hold Tessa rates at a relatively high
level. This can be gauged in two ways: the level of interest paid on Tessa
in relation to base rates and in relation to savings accounts.
In January 1991, base rates were 14.5 per cent and most institutions were
offering 14 per cent and above.
Base rates have fallen to 8 per cent and the table of selected banks and
building societies shows that most lenders are offering returns of 8 per
cent and over. In fact, the average Tessa rate of the selected banks and
building societies shown is 8.14 per cent. Some institutions are paying
considerably more than this, notably Allied Trust bank and Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester, National Counties, West Bromwich and Woolwich building
societies.
The rate of interest paid on most savings accounts is, however, considerably
lower than base rates.
The Woolwich does not require a notice period for the transfer or
termination of a Tessa, but most institutions impose a period of between one
month and 90 days. The savings accounts selected for comparison in the table
are therefore one-month notice accounts.
Where the bank or building society does not have a one- month account, or
requires a minimum deposit in excess of Pounds 5,000, an instant access
account has been selected.
The maximum contribution possible to a Tessa since its launch is Pounds
4,800.
The table shows that, in most cases, the rate offered on the Tessa is two or
three percentage points higher than that on the savings accounts. The
average interest rate is 6.05 per cent gross compared with 8.15 per cent
gross from the institutions selected.
And many with Tessas will find after five years that the overall rate is
even higher if they qualify for the bonuses offered by most institutions.
Savers who need their money before the five years is up still have access to
their capital, just forgoing tax exemption on the interest. You are also
allowed under the Tessa rules to withdraw interest without penalty. Of the
institutions listed, only Bristol &amp; West offers a higher rate (on its
Balmoral postal account) than on its Tessa.
In taking out a Tessa, avoid banks or building societies that impose a fee
for transfer or termination as this will reduce the total return should the
Tessa be closed early.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Seeing red as charges fail to fall -
The high cost of overdrafts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT goes up does not necessarily come down where overdraft rates on current
accounts are concerned.
UK base rates have almost halved since their peak of 15 per cent at the
beginning of 1990 to 8 per cent today. Savers groan when rates come down,
although borrowers should be pleased. However, those with overdrafts at some
of the country's largest banks have little reason to cheer.
The table shows selected interest-bearing current accounts at banks and
building societies and compares the rates on authorised and unauthorised
overdrafts in January 1990, when base rates were 15 per cent, with those
today.
Using the figures in the table, the average authorised overdraft rate has
fallen by 2.2 percentage points and the unauthorised rate by only 0.8 of a
point, in a period when base rates have dropped by seven points.
Authorised rates:
It would perhaps be too much to hope that overdraft rates should have fallen
in line with base rates over the same period, but many institutions have
either held to the same rate or reduced rates by a pitiful amount.
Current account holders at Abbey National, the Co-Op and Bank of Scotland
will actually be paying more for an authorised overdraft today than they did
when base rates were 15 per cent.
Nationwide has kept its rates unchanged (a cut is planned later this month)
and the majority of institutions which have dropped charges have done so by
small amounts.
First Direct has only shaved its rate from 20.7 per cent to 20.1 per cent
over the period.
Barclays and Woolwich have reduced their authorised overdraft charges by
less than three percentage points. Halifax and Girobank show the highest
falls in charges - of over five percentage points - since the beginning of
1990.
Abbey National says that its rates have increased to reflect the higher
risks of unsecured lending during the recession. Along with First Direct,
Halifax, Nationwide and Woolwich, it does not impose other charges for an
authorised overdraft. This can make quite a difference.
Which?, the consumer association's magazine, in its survey of banks
published this month, found that if you had an authorised overdraft of
Pounds 500 and you slipped into the red by that amount for two weeks a
month, you would pay Pounds 127 more a year on a Girobank current account
than on a Nationwide FlexAccount.
'The charges make the difference and the interest itself is a relatively
small part of the overall cost of the overdraft,' said Jane Vass of the
Consumers Association. 'But rates are important because banks and building
societies have imposed the charges and yet they are keeping interest rates
high, too.'
Unauthorised rates:
The table shows that, on average, the cost of unauthorised overdrafts has
gone up since January 1990.
For example, Barclays has increased its unauthorised rate fractionally from
35.4 per cent to 35.7 per cent. If you are overdrawn without permission, you
have a grace period of Pounds 50 before being charged Pounds 15. If you go
above Pounds 200, the fee rises to Pounds 25 a month.
Barclays says its overdraft rates are not linked to base rates but reflect
the cost of administering an overdraft. However, Royal Bank of Scotland
takes a different approach. It says that the rate charged is left to the
discretion of the bank manager, who is told that base rates should be used
as a broad guide.
Girobank says it regards an unauthorised overdraft as an abuse of the
account and therefore has no compunction about widening the differential
between its authorised and unauthorised rates.
Others, including Halifax, argue that unauthorised rates have been kept
deliberately high to encourage people to arrange their overdrafts.
But Jane Vass
said: 'Most people who go into unauthorised overdraft usually do not expect
to be overdrawn and have no idea about the rates. One reason why rates are
high is that the banks and building societies think people will not notice.
It is a cynical attempt to cream off as much as they can.'
Once again, charges are crucial to the cost of the overall debt. Which?
estimates that if you go into the red without authorisation by Pounds 500
for a week every quarter, you would be paying Pounds 347 more a year on a
NatWest Current Plus account than on a Abbey National current account.
This is worth looking at in greater detail. Abbey National's unauthorised
rate is 34.4 per cent compared with Nat West's 37.6 per cent, so one would
expect the overdraft to cost more at NatWest.
But, Abbey has no further charges even on an unauthorised overdraft, while
NatWest will impose a fee of Pounds 59 a quarter if you exceed your
authorised limit by Pounds 50. The warning letter will cost a further Pounds
20.
The Co-Op is unusual in having the same rate for both arranged and
unauthorised overdrafts but rates on both have increased since January 1990,
although there is a three-day grace period before charges are imposed.
'Our rates went up in May 1990 and have not come down since, though they are
under review,' said a bank spokesman, defending the rise as reflecting
increased lending risks. 'The account is designed for people who stay in
credit since it is interest-bearing.'
Only Nationwide has attempted to mirror the fall in base rates, but only on
its unauthorised overdraft, which has been reduced by seven percentage
points. However, its overdraft rate of 36.8 per cent was one of the highest
in January 1990.
The message to customers is that they should arrange an overdraft with their
bank even if they do not envisage needing one. But they should also realise
that banks are widening margins at their expense.

SELF-regulation is not working, said a man this week who ought to know. The
man was Mick Newmarch, chairman of Prudential Corporation, Britain's largest
life insurer.
The import of his words was 'Let's just scrap self-regulation and replace
the system with a single statutory regulatory body, which will supervise
everyone in the same business in the same way.'
The casual reader of the personal finance pages of any newspaper will
realise that the myriad systems of self-regulation have left gaping holes in
the consumer protection safety net. From home income plans, to advisers who
run off with clients' cash, to the simple and pervasive practice of urging
people to buy expensive policies which they really do not need, consumers
are not being protected.
Indeed, the Securities and Investments Board subtly owned up to
shortcomings, in the disclosure area at least, when it said this week it
would review its new rules on the topic. To this end, it appointed as a
consultant Tim Miller, former marketing director at M&amp;G, the unit trust
company, who has been a fierce critic of life insurance industry sales
practices.
Earlier this year, Miller resigned from the board of Lautro, the
self-regulatory body for the life insurance and unit trust industry, over
its proposed disclosure regime. He felt it did not require companies to
offer prospective customers accurate projections of what their own charges
were likely to be over a policy's life.
Any recommendations from Miller are likely to include a requirement that
projections of 'own charges' be disclosed, instead of allowing each company
to simply project the industry average - a meaningless number to anyone
shopping for insurance.
That the SIB has decided to review its disclosure regime at all is an
admission that it does not expect the new rules to pass muster with the
Office of Fair Trading.
The OFT had ruled two years ago that insurance companies tell prospective
customers so little about their products and their costs that competition
between companies is actually inhibited.
The OFT is expected to announce shortly that the latest disclosure regime
also falls short of the mark in certain respects.
But how will Newmarch's alternative strategy offer consumers more
protection?
First, Newmarch argues that all companies in the same business should be
regulated in the same manner and hints that even bank and building society
deposit accounts - savings products like most life policies - should be
subject to the same tough disclosure rules as life insurers.
He also sets out some proposals for a new investor compensation scheme. The
current scheme's finances have been badly strained by large numbers of
claims and its solvency is currently dependent upon the willingness of life
insurance companies to contribute disproportionately to it.
Under Newmarch's plan, the investor compensation scheme would ideally have
no fixed ceiling on the amount which could be claimed by any individual. The
cost of claims would be met by spreading the losses among those companies
selling the same or similar products.
Meanwhile, compensation payments should be readily calculated and paid out
soon after the event - meeting a common complaint from those who have made
claims on the scheme.
But perhaps the most startling words from Newmarch were those in which he
acknowledged the legitimacy of the rising tide of consumer complaints about
life industry sales practices.
He urged the industry to open talks directly with the OFT about a disclosure
regime which could bear its imprimatur, thus putting an end to headlines
such as 'The Life Insurance Racket'.
For consumers, an OFT-blessed disclosure regime would allow prospective
customers to know how much commission sales agents will receive, how much
will be deducted from premiums to cover the seller's costs and exactly what
the effects of early surrender would be.
And that has to be good news for consumers.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Markets: Exchange switches strategy - The Bottom Line

BRITISH Telecommunications' shareholders will be relieved by the price the
company negotiated this week for the sale of its minority stake in McCaw
Cellular Communications, the US mobile phone group, to American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph.
The price of Dollars 49 a share is almost double the market price before the
deal was done and will bring about Dollars 1.8bn into the BT's coffers when
it is completed next year. It has saved shareholders from what was, only
last year, beginning to look like a costly error.
But the disposal is hardly a triumph. The most Barry Romeril, BT's group
finance director, could say was that, once the funding costs of the
investment were taken into account, 'there was certainly no loss and
probably a slight profit.'
The disposal has also raised doubts about whether BT's management has yet
developed a clear international strategy beyond stating its vision of
becoming 'the world's most successful telecommunications company'.
At the time of the McCaw purchase three years ago, commentators questioned
whether it fitted into any broader strategic vision. BT's chairman, Iain
Vallance, replied that McCaw was a piece in a strategic jigsaw, the other
bits of which could not be seen by outsiders.
One way of linking it to the jigsaw would have been to build a long-distance
network in the US and integrate this with McCaw's local operations - the
strategy now being pursued by AT&amp;T. But BT never attempted to build such a
long-distance network, while US regulatory restrictions prevented it from
increasing its stake.
With no synergies in prospect and AT&amp;T keen to buy into McCaw, this bit of
the jigsaw has now been abandoned.
Romeril denied, however, that the original purchase had been a mistake. He
said BT had 'learnt an awful lot about the US telecommunications market'.
Yet it is still far from clear where BT is heading. Since the company's
privatisation in 1984, its international strategy has undergone many changes
of which the McCaw sale is only the latest. Other retreats include the
disposals of Mitel, the Canadian equipment manufacturer, IAL, the airport
and hospital management company, and CTG, the north American distributor of
information technology products. BT has also closed down Metrocast, a US
paging company.
The remains of BT's international strategy is a plan to provide global
telecommunications services to multinational companies. This has three main
elements: Syncordia, its Atlanta based network management subsidiary; GNS,
its data communications company; and 'Operation Cyclone', a plan to invest
Dollars 1bn over the next decade in infrastructure outside the UK.
This strategy received something of a blow earlier this year when Vallance
was unable to attract other large international telephone companies as
shareholders in Syncordia. But, even if it proves successful, it is unlikely
to consume the vast amounts of cash which BT's UK operations are currently
generating.
Romeril refused to be drawn on how this cash would be used. But the
management is likely to face increasing pressure from shareholders for an
answer.
The main options are:
To buy out the 40 per cent minority stake in Cellnet, its UK cellular
subsidiary, from Securicor. This might cost about Pounds 1bn.
To acquire a major foreign telephone company, such as MCI, the second
largest US long distance carrier.
To hand back the cash to shareholders through dividends or by buying back
its own shares.
As set out in a report published this week by stockbrokers Robert Fleming
Securities, the scope for such distributions to shareholders runs into many
billions of pounds. Such a move would have substantial tax advantages for
many investors as well as allowing them to redirect their cash to more
productive investments.
It would also produce a clearer jigsaw puzzle, but very different from the
one BT was previously assembling.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Markets: Time for the revenge of the nerds - London Markets

<TEXT>
TRADITIONALLY, the Chancellor's autumn statement of public expenditure for
the 12 months from April, due next Thursday, lacks the excitement of Budget
day: the red box, the beer-and-fags populism, the jokes about mobile
telephones. Instead, it is dominated by haggling over footnotes and obscure
methodological debates about which definition of public sector borrowing is
least misleading. This is an occasion only a gilts analyst could love.
Usually. This year, though, things are different. Locked in the purdah
normally associated with planning a Budget, Norman Lamont has been working
on a November Surprise.
Of course, it may not be a pleasant surprise. It is pretty clear by now that
the statement will contain what one cabinet minister described as
'horrendous' figures for public borrowing next year; it may also contain
some accounting jiggery-pokery to allow local authorities to spend money
which does not show up in the government spending total.
On the more positive side, the City is expecting it to usher in another cut
in interest rates - anything from half a percentage point to the full two
points of cuts that the markets are discounting by the end of the year.
What is not clear, though, is whether there will be other measures as well:
a kick-start to the housing market, some tax concessions, a handful of fairy
dust. The equity market - standing up remarkably well this week to a barrage
of political uncertainty on everything from the future of John Major's
government to the collapse of the world trading system and the tax treatment
of UK companies in post-Clinton America - is currently more interested in
evidence of a serious commitment to growth than in worries about public
borrowing. So, even if the borrowing figures are as awful as that cabinet
minister predicts, the market could well respond favourably to a package
that promises deeds as well as words on growth.
The bankruptcy figures out yesterday - revealing that in the 12 months to
September one in every 38 companies went to the wall - give further impetus
to the desire for action. Still, though company chairmen remain almost
universally gloomy, the most recent figures do not seem quite as dark as the
public mood: car sales in October were 8 per cent higher than a year ago.
Profits are also showing an encouraging turn. This week's results included
interim figures from Sainsbury (up 19 per cent); third-quarter figures from
BAT (up 60 per cent, thanks to a recovery at Eagle Star, but doing well in
tobacco also); better-than-expected third-quarter figures at BP (up 33 per
cent on a replacement cost basis); and a 9 per cent increase in
third-quarter profits at Unilever.
If the economic climate is indeed improving - albeit imperceptibly - Tomkins
may prove to have timed its friendly bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall nicely.
This week, the rival bidder, Hanson, dropped out, unwilling to raise its
offer of Pounds 790m to match Tomkins' Pounds 935m. The stock market seems
to be overcoming its misgivings about the Tomkins bid: its shares closed at
226p on Friday, safely above the 200p price of the rights issue to finance
the bid. At that price, its share offer for RHM is worth only  1/2 p less
than the 260p cash alternative.
Hanson's shareholders have viewed the short-lived struggle with mixed
feelings. Since Lord Hanson launched his bid for RHM, his company's shares
have outperformed the market by 4 per cent: an indication, perhaps, that
investors like to see a flash of the old Hanson acquisitive spirit, but
would really prefer him to avoid the messy business of actually making a
purchase.
Another entrepreneurial businessman, Alan Sugar, has decided that the ups
and downs of the stock market are too much to bear. On Friday, he offered to
buy back the public's 64 per cent of shares in Amstrad, the computer and
hi-fi company he founded, at a price of 30p a share. He sold 7 1/2 per cent
of the company in March 1991 at 80p a share.
Intriguingly, Alan Sugar is putting Amstrad's money where his mouth is: the
biggest single chunk of the financing for his purchase of shares comes from
the company itself, in the form of a Pounds 50m loan. (The second-biggest
chunk comes from Lloyds Bank, with the Sugar family piggy-bank a poor
third.)
'There is a lot of necessary action that has to be taken with regard to
Amstrad,' he said on Thursday. Shareholders might be forgiven for thinking
that action was what he was being paid to take on their behalf.
The week was also notable for two nostalgic souvenirs of the past. One came
from British Telecom, as it announced a tentative agreement to sell its 22
per cent stake in McCaw Cellular Communications, the US mobile-phone
company, to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. BT, which bought its 35.8m
shares in 1989 for Dollars 1.5bn, is selling out for Dollars 1.75bn.
The nostalgia element in the proposal, of course, is the way in which it
brings back memories of BT's international ambitions, all of which seem to
end in a whimper. Increasingly, the company seems to be forced back on its
domestic base as a source of profits.
The second nostalgic moment came in the revelation that Bernie Cornfeld,
that once-potent figure of the 1960s share price boom, is trying to get back
into business. Cornfeld, whose mutual fund empire collapsed spectacularly
two decades ago, is hoping to buy MGM from Credit Lyonnais, the French bank
which lent the studio far too much money in the 1980s. So far, the bank
seems to be treating Cornfeld with a certain amount of disdain.
Still, if it succeeds, the bid will provide an object lesson in how a
once-discredited financial figure can rehabilitate himself in the eyes of
the world: talk big and throw lots of money around. Norman Lamont, are you
listening?

FT  07 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: At a glance - Bottom marks for Topsi
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most popular investment theories has come unstuck in the last two
years. Many analysts look at the yield on a share as a vital determinant of
whether it is worth buying - the argument is that a high yield means that a
company is undervalued and due for a sharp rise in price.
Kleinwort Benson constructs the TOPSI-100 index from the 100
highest-yielding shares within the FT-All Share index. Rebasing both to the
end of 1990, Kleinwort Benson finds that the TOPSI has risen by only 0.7 per
cent, while the All-Share as a whole has managed growth of 21.7 per cent.
The FTSE-100 index, which includes the largest companies by market
capitalisation has increased by 24.3 per cent, suggesting that 'blue chips'
have done much better than more speculative stocks.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: At a glance - Further slump in UK
house prices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nationwide Building Society produced yet more bad news for homeowners this
week, with the announcement that its index of house prices dropped a further
2.7 per cent last month. This brought the average house price down by Pounds
1,491 to Pounds 53,038, and piled on yet more difficulties for families
already struggling with 'negative equity' - where the value of their house
is less than the value of the outstanding mortgage.
Halifax Building Society's index only fell by 1.2 per cent, but this
followed a fall of 3.1 per cent in September, which was sharper than that
registered by Nationwide. Both societies suggested that confusion following
Black Wednesday continued to damage consumer confidence, and Halifax called
for base rates to be reduced 'at least' to 6 per cent. Woolwich mortgage

FT  07 NOV 92 / Markets: Saving the champagne for another day - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POOR OLD George Bush. Not only did he lose his job this week, but no sooner
was he voted out of office than the economic statistics started going the
President's way - what will be President Clinton's way, that is.
The Republicans have been hammering away for months with the argument that
the economy has not been as bad as people think - that the US was in the
middle of an unusually slow recovery, not an unusually deep recession. It
was a point that made some economic, if not political, sense.
There is a certain irony, then, in the fact that the most recent statistics
have painted a predominantly positive picture of economic conditions. This
week there was a rise in the National Association of Purchasing Management's
index of business activity, small but still welcome increases in car and
store sales, higher orders for factory-made goods, lower claims for jobless
insurance, a lower national unemployment rate and a rise in the number of
people on non-farm payrolls.
Many of these figures came with significant qualifications, and some were
either too old, or too out of line with longer-term trends, to be
meaningful.
Taken together, however, the figures suggested that the economy is advancing
at a solid, if unspectacular rate, and that the foundations for sustained
growth in 1993 and 1994 are being laid.
This, however, is of absolutely no comfort to (the soon-to-be-ex) President
Bush. For his part, president-elect Clinton must feel that his honeymoon
period has got off to an early start, although the possibility of a trade
war with Europe could give him a few headaches over the coming weeks.
The reaction of the stock markets this week to all this - the economic
numbers, the election result, the breakdown of the talks on the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - was remarkably restrained.
For one, the hoped-for and much-hyped 'Clinton rally' never materialised. On
election day, the talk was of a 'win-win' scenario for stocks. If President
Bush staged a remarkable recovery and won, the market would break out the
champagne.
Alternatively, if governor Clinton rode the polls to a landslide victory,
there would still be cause for a celebration. After all, the Democrats had
promised to stimulate the economy with heavy spending on capital investment
and the infrastructure - which could only be good for stocks over the
long-term.
In spite of what the headlines said about a Clinton landslide, however, the
Arkansas governor earned a less than overwhelming endorsement from the
electorate. He may have beaten Bush by 202 electoral college votes, but
between them, his two opponents attracted the support of 57 per cent of the
electorate.
More importantly, Ross Perot won the backing of 19 per cent of the voters -
which meant that almost one in five strongly believed that tackling the
deficit should be the main priority for the new president. As one analyst
said on Wednesday: 'If Clinton really listens to the message of the voters,
he's going to go very cautiously on the budget deficit.'
This realisation that Clinton will have to tread carefully next year, and
that the threat of higher interest rates on Treasury bond markets will keep
the Democrats' wilder spending ambitions in check, helps explain why the
stock market's reaction to the election result was so subdued.
What gains there were this week came primarily from individual corporate
stories. The news of a Dollars 3.8bn deal between AT &amp; T, the country's
largest telecommunications group, and McCaw Cellular Communications, its
largest cellular telephone company, delighted the market.
Analysts expect both companies to benefit from the link-up, which involves
AT&amp;T buying 33 per cent of McCaw, with an option to take voting control at a
later date. The deal pushed McCaw shares up more than Dollars 5, or 18.5 per
cent, to Dollars 32, and AT&amp;T up Dollars 2 to Dollars 44 7/8 .
Tobacco stocks were also in demand this week following the news that the
most high-profile lawsuit filed by a smoker against the cigarette industry
had collapsed, apparently because the lawyers who have spent years
supporting the case felt the cost of continuing had become unacceptably
high.
Anticipating that other similar lawsuits would also crumble, and hoping that
a dark cloud had been lifted from the industry, buyers rushed into tobacco
stocks.
The biggest beneficiaries were Philip Morris, which rose Dollars 3 1/4 to
Dollars 78 5/8 , American Brands, which rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 43,

FT  07 NOV 92 / Markets: Taking money out of the frying pan - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE most important issue facing UK savers at the moment is this: where to
put their money once they take it out of the building society?
Everyone should keep some rainy day savings in an instant access account to
cover immediate commitments such as a leaky roof, a car breakdown or a
holiday. But, now that interest rates have tumbled, building societies
simply do not represent a sound investment for long-term savings.
This is a theme which the Weekend FT will emphasise over and over again
during the coming months. The message needs to be rammed home, in part
because high real interest rates have given savers an easy life over the
last few years. But if the UK is ever to recover from its present economic
difficulties, the level of real interest rates must fall.
It takes time for a change in the economic climate to feed through into
savers' perceptions. Save &amp; Prosper commissioned NOP to ask 1,000 adults
their perception of the net rate of interest on Pounds 1,000 in an instant
access account.
The most popular answer - given by 34 per cent of those questioned - was 7
to 9 per cent and 12 per cent of respondents thought the net rate was over
10 per cent. Only 20 per cent correctly estimated that the net rate was
between 4 and 6 per cent.
In other words, many people are wildly over-optimistic about the returns
available from building societies. Eventually they will realise the truth;
the education process could be painful.
The advantage of building society investment is that it is simple to
understand. The alternatives are more complex. With the aim of guiding
readers through the new world, I offer a few simple rules.
You are on your own.
Do not assume that the financial services industry has your best interests
at heart. Companies are keen to get their hands on your money, so they will
highlight the most attractive elements of their products and downplay the
drawbacks.
In the vast majority of cases, the adviser or salesman will be paid by the
financial services companies, and not by you. It is in their interest to
recommend products which earn them commission; and it is against their
interest to recommend products which are commission-free. Some will be
scrupulously honest and resist these temptations - your problem is that is
hard to tell the honest recommendation from the hard-sell.
You should remember that advisers and salesmen have to earn their living,
just as you do. There can accordingly be no such thing as 'free' advice. It
is better that you pay a fee, so that it is clear the adviser is working for
you. This means giving money up-front, but it will probably be the cheaper
option in the long run.
Nobody knows the future.
Do not assume that there is some secret pool of knowledge shared by all
those who work in the financial services industry. Certainly, those who
advise you should be aware of all the rules and regulations which apply to
their field.
But they do not know the rate at which the economy will grow, where the
stock market will move, or the level of interest rates in one year's time.
Who could have predicted, at the start of 1992, that Britain would leave the
exchange rate mechanism, base rates would rise to 12 per cent and then fall
to 8 per cent, and that President Bush would be defeated by the governor of
Arkansas? Nobody who contacted this office.
The same strictures apply to journalists, of course. If I was so smart, I
would have made my fortune and be lying on my yacht in the sun, instead of
trudging over Southwark Bridge every morning. So treat newspaper share tips
with caution, and be highly suspicious of those who tell you, after careful
analysis, that the investment of the future is Taiwanese smaller companies.
Greater reward means greater risk.
This is the most important rule of finance. Too often, investors demand 20
per cent annual returns with no danger of loss of capital. It cannot be
done.
The gross yield on long-dated gilts is currently between 8.5 and 9 per cent.
The first option bond from National Savings is offering a gross 8.67 per
cent over one year.
Any product which offers a higher rate than this must involve some risk, if
only the credit risk that the company offering the product will fail. You
must decide what level of risk you can live with.
Spread your investments.
It is tempting, since it involves less effort, to give all your money to one
company. Frequently, institutions will offer premium rates to those
investing bigger sums. But the above rules highlight the flaws of this
policy; no one has the sure-fire recipe for investment success (and, even if
they did, they would be unlikely to share it with you). So hedge your bets.
Indeed, this rule takes us back to the premise of the article. Investors
were taking a risk by keeping all their savings in the building society,
even if they did not realise they were. The risk was that interest rates -
their income - would fall while their expenditure - as reflected by the
Retail Price Index - would continue to rise. That possibility has now
occurred.
For the foreseeable future, investors need to think of their savings as a
portfolio, with building society deposits forming only one element alongside
gilts and shares.

FT  07 NOV 92 / The Long View: A swing to the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST, SOME anniversaries. It is 500 years since Christopher Columbus
discovered America by mistake, and 200 years since the US dollar was
created. It is 60 years since the last elected Republican party US president
was rejected for his second term - Herbert Hoover in 1932, a victim, like
George Bush, of the nation's perception of his failure to tackle economic
difficulties. Now Bill Clinton inherits the legacies and responsibilities;
only history will tell if he is another Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Clinton's victory was almost a foregone conclusion and so the financial
markets have reacted calmly. In fact, the dollar appears to have bottomed
out some weeks ago, when it briefly dipped to DM1.40 for the second time
early in October. From there, it has bounced more than 10 per cent. As for
poor old sterling, the brief glory of the two-dollar pound late in August
has been extinguished by the cold reality of a current rate little above
Dollars 1.50, representing a 30 per cent leap for the dollar and one that
will gratify the devotees of the purchasing power parity theory of exchange
rates.
This turnround by the dollar against the European currencies partly reflects
the feeling that the peak of D-Mark interest rates has certainly passed, but
equally the growing opinion that the trough for dollar rates is being
formed, too. At present, the money market rate on dollars is just over 3 per
cent, on D-Marks, around 9 per cent. It would not be surprising to see those
rates converge quite close together over the next 12 months.
Published figures show moderately strong economic growth in the US, with a
provisional GDP growth figure of 2.7 per cent annualised for the third
quarter - albeit a pre-polling day statistic received with some disbelief by
the markets.
Now Bill Clinton is heading for power armed with spending plans which are
rather more credible than his compensating cost-cutting programmes. He
inherits, incidentally, a Federal budget deficit of Dollars 300bn-plus, or 6
per cent of GNP. The deficit remains a formidable obstacle and one which, on
the disaster scenarios, could conceivably start expanding out of control as
the debt burden compounds: Dollars 300bn here and Dollars 400bn there, and
pretty soon you have the darndest credit rating problem.
Long-term interest rates have therefore been moving rather differently from
those at the short end. The long bond yield hit 8 per cent in May and slid
to 7.2 per cent at the beginning of September but has subsequently risen to
7.7 per cent as the Clinton bandwagon has rolled confidently towards the
White House.
Meanwhile, the US stock market has continued to move resolutely sideways.
The pattern has varied somewhat across different sectors of the market, so
that the 30 blue chips in the Dow Jones Average tended to perform better in
the early part of the year, while the broader-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500
hit a high in September (almost coinciding with that of the long bond) and
has stayed very close to it.
However, the remarkable feature of Wall Street in 1992 has been its
steadiness; the gap between the high and low on the S&amp;P's 500 is a mere 8
per cent (against 22 per cent in the case of our own All-Share Index, for
example).
American stocks have, of course, been suffering from valuation problems. The
backward-looking price-earnings ratio on the S&amp;P's is still a formidable 27,
and although that continues to be artificially inflated by last year's wave
of restructuring provisions, the prospective 1992 p/e is a still offputting
19 or so.
Steady earnings growth of, say, 15 per cent in 1993 could bring that down to
16 or so, but the problem all this year has been the sheer difficulty of
presenting this projected earnings pattern as a justification for a surge in
prices.
Certainly, international fund managers have concluded that Wall Street is
overpriced. 'Where is the foreign investor?' complained the Securities
Industry Association last week, releasing figures that showed foreigners
sold Dollars 1bn net of US equities in the second quarter (though they were
substantial buyers of US Treasury bonds). British pension funds, for
instance, hold only 21 per cent of their overseas equity portfolios in US
stocks. A neutral weighting, in terms of market capitalisation, would be
more than twice as large.
The difference may not be so much between US and foreign opinion as between
amateur and professional investors. The record demand for US mutual funds
has provided the key feature of 1992, with equity funds notching up amazing
net sales of Dollars 50.9bn during the first eight months (although on
average investors have lost money on equity funds so far this year).
Bond funds have pulled in an even more formidable Dollars 81.9bn. But
because the basis of this demand for mutual funds appears be a flight from
low-yielding savings deposits, as the US banking system shrivels before our
very eyes, there are obvious fears about the consequences should short-term
interest rates rebound. On this reasoning, Wall Street may have nowhere to
go but down. If the economy recovers and earnings are strong, interest rates
will go up and the flow into mutual funds will be reversed. Alternatively,
if interest rates stay low, it will be because the economy fails to revive
and the earnings recovery which the market is discounting will fail to
happen.
One final anniversary. It is 21 years since the Bretton Woods agreement
broke up and the dollar left its peg of Dollars 35 to the ounce. Since then,
it has lost two-thirds of its domestic purchasing power and more than half
its value against the D-Mark and the yen. But the US is big enough for the
Americans to regard dollar weakness as a problem for foreigners, not
themselves. It will not be a problem for the immediate future, though, as
the markets nervously adjust to the Clinton presidency.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Lost lessons of Winston's recession: In 1925, Keynes warned
the Chancellor of depression. Has Lamont repeated Churchill's mistake?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT SKIDELSKY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN Maynard Keynes spent most of his professional life explaining how
Britain could avoid the distress and waste of high unemployment. His
disciples, who dominated economics after the Second World War, believed that
as a result of his work, the great depression of the 1930s need never happen
again. Yet British unemployment reached more than 3.1m in 1986. Now, six
years later, the dole queues are again lengthening and an end of the
recession is not in sight. Was Keynes's lesson neglected or has he proved to
be, in some sense, wrong?
To understand these contemporary questions one needs to go back to the
period before Keynes's work, the General Theory of Employment, Interest and
Money (published in 1936) - to the 1920s. It was abnormal British
unemployment rather than lack of demand in the world economy that he sought
to explain in A Tract on Monetary Reform (1923) and A Treatise on Money
(1930). Above all, he wanted to show that, by overvaluing the pound in 1925,
the Bank of England was forced to set interest rates too high to allow full
employment.
It is from this perspective that we should look at what Keynes has to offer
us. In the 1920s, Britain was in a self-induced depression, with the world
economy moderately prosperous. Similarly today, the issue is not the
collapse of the world economy, but the collapse of the British economy.
Indeed, while Keynes was writing his General Theory to explain how a closed
economy can run down, Britain was recovering from the world depression with
a cheap money policy. So the parallel is with the 1920s, not the 1930s: the
theme, the monetary mismanagement of the British economy.
Keynes's vision of Britain in the 1920s was of an arthritic, or perhaps
merely mature, economy suffering from a deflationary overdose inflicted by a
financial oligarchy, too proud and ignorant to attend to social detail. He
was well aware of the structural weaknesses of the British economy - the
incompetence of business management dominated by 'third generation men', the
obstructionism of the trade unions, 'once the oppressed now the tyrants' -
the general resistance to change. He was infuriated that monetary policy,
instead of trying create a favourable climate for overcoming these
weaknesses, made them lethal. When the government imposed its package of
economies on September 8 1931 in a last effort to keep Britain on the gold
standard, he exploded before a group of Labour MPs: 'I speak from a full
heart. The course of policy pursued so far has reduced us to a point of
humiliation one could not have conceived'.
At the same time, Keynes understood that stable exchange rates were good for
a large trading economy. The dilemma he faced was how to combine a monetary
policy geared to maintaining full employment (that is, relatively easy
credit) with membership of a fixed exchange rate system. Keynes was the
first to realise, or at least say, that exchange rates should reflect the
competitive power of national economies and not be used to force downward
adjustment of money costs. If so used, any system of fixed exchange rates
would break down. By overvaluing sterling in 1925, Britain destroyed the
gold standard system which it had created, just as by overvaluing sterling
within the ERM in 1990, Britain has come close to destroying the mechanism
so painfully constructed in the 1980s.
The reconciliation of the two requirements of domestic and international
stability required, Keynes thought, keeping the whole world in 'quasi-boom'.
This was the neglected lesson of the 19th century. Over that period, he said
in 1930: 'Prices were on the whole tending upwards, and allowing for the
sharp increase in efficiency which was going on all the time. There was
never any occasion to use bank rate to bring about a downward adjustment of
wages.'
The problem which dominated his lifetime was how to set Britain back into
the right starting position for this ascent to prosperity after the
catastrophic 'interruption' of the first world war. In the 1920s, this
seemed to him a problem of restoring the domestic equilibrium of wages and
prices, disrupted by the wartime and postwar inflation. This, he thought,
should be done before stabilising the exchange rate.
The defeat of the postwar inflation had left a legacy of over 10 per cent
unemployment. Prices had fallen faster than money wages, so that employers
had been forced to cut costs by reducing their workforce. Today, although
prices are rising, employers face similar pressures because wages have risen
faster. So in both periods, the purchasing power of wage earners (real
wages) rose. In 1922, Keynes said:
'The continuance of unemployment is to an important extent due to the fact
that we have got the level of wages out of gear with everything else. The
only way in which they will get into gear will be by an increase in the
level of prices'.
He wanted to get prices up to induce employers to take on more workers, and
the exchange rate down to ensure that the price of British goods did not
rise too much.
The Treasury and the Bank of England, however, took a similar view to that
enunciated by Norman Lamont, the present Chancellor, when he said on July 10
of this year: 'The way to success is to adjust your costs to your exchange
rate, not the other way round'. The monetary policy pursued by the
authorities throughout the early 1920s was dominated by their desire to put
sterling back on to the Gold standard at its prewar parity with the dollar
(Dollars 4.86). Employers would be expected to cut wages and prices
sufficiently to make export industries competitive at that rate.
The Treasury / Bank view of the 1920s was echoed in the Medium Term
Financial Strategy adopted by the Thatcher government in 1980 and in the
overvaluation of sterling in 1990. The assumption linking the two eras was
that if monetary policy is credible, business behaviour will adjust to the
monetary framework set by the authorities. In his evidence to the Macmillan
Committee Montagu Norman, governor of the Bank of England, said: 'I have
never been able to see myself why for the last few years it should have been
impossible for industry starting from within to have readjusted its
position'.
Keynes knew this was myopic. In March 1925, Winston Churchill, the
Chancellor, gave a dinner party, to which he invited Keynes and Reginald
McKenna, the two foremost opponents of the return to gold. They were to
battle it out with two Treasury officials, Lord Bradbury and Otto Niemeyer.
Keynes and McKenna stuck to the point that British prices had not fallen
enough to support the prewar value of sterling. Going back to gold at
Dollars 4.86 would overvalue the pound by 10 per cent, requiring a 10 per
cent fall in money wages. Bradbury and Niemeyer retorted that only returning
to gold at the old parity would stop Britain living in a fools' paradise of
inflated real wages. The gold standard, they said, was 'knave (ie
politician) proof'. In the end McKenna, a former Chancellor, gave way.
'There is no escape; you have to go back; but it will be hell', he said.
Keynes stood firm.
Keynes saw that the only way a policy of high interest rates can cause
prices to fall is by withdrawing from employers the financial means to
employ labour at the existing level of money wages. It means 'intensifying
unemployment without limit, until the workers are ready to accept the
necessary reduction of money wages under the pressure of hard facts'. He
suspected that the government would shrink from the logic of its policy.
Bank rate would be kept high enough to attract foreign funds to London and
retard domestic investment, but not high enough to break workers' resistance
to money wage reductions. The result would be to 'jam' the British economy
in a low employment trap.
'The fundamental blunder of the Treasury and the Bank of England' he wrote
in 1928 'has been due, from the beginning, to their belief that if they
looked after the deflation of prices the deflation of costs would look after
itself . . .
Unemployment will not decline unless businessmen have the incentive of
plentiful credit, high hopes and . . . a slight inflation of prices but not
of costs'. It was in this context that Keynes developed his plan for
loan-financed public works.
The forced devaluation of sterling on September 21, 1931 unlocked the
British economy. Interest rates came down, facilitating a housing boom;
employment recovered from the depressed levels of the world slump. But this
era of floating exchange rates was accompanied by protectionism, barter
agreements and restrictive trading blocks.
The end of the second world war provided the opportunity for the fresh start
which had eluded the world after 1918. Keynes evolved an 'ideal' plan for a
currency union to reconcile the advantages of the old gold standard with
sufficient national monetary autonomy to maintain full employment. There
would be fixed, but adjustable, exchange rates; creditor countries would not
be allowed to 'hoard' their surpluses; they would be automatically available
as cheap overdraft facilities for other countries at an international
clearing bank. The Bretton Woods agreement of July, 1944 fell short of
Keynes' hopes, being based on the different idea of an international
monetary fund.
Nevertheless, Keynes was convinced that internationalism was back in
business. In May 1944, he denounced the 'technique of little Englandism' as
inconsistent with Britain's tradition. 'With our own resources so greatly
impaired and encumbered, it is only if sterling is firmly placed in an
international setting that the necessary confidence in it can be sustained'.
Some morals of this tale are easier to draw than others. Keynes was right to
argue that international currency regimes, however desirable, will break
down if they become instruments of deflation. British experience under the
ERM and the gold standard support this.
If we want a liberal market order to survive, it must be consciously
stabilised. During the 1980s, when Western governments were recovering their
monetary virtue, the banking system went haywire, spurred on by the demand
for loans on the back of inflated asset prices. Keynes' belief that the
stability of the international economy depends on 'measures to control
capital movements' deserves close scrutiny.
The lessons for Britain are less clear. The problem of getting wages into
closer equilibrium with prices, after decades of inflationary expectations,
is more difficult than it was in 1922 or 1931. But this must happen if there
is to be a durable recovery in employment. The 1990-92 experience showed
that it is a hopeless business to get wage inflation to fall faster than
price inflation. But it is also difficult in a recovery to make sure that
wages rise more slowly than prices, which must happen if employment is to
grow. A policy on pay is inescapable.
Finally, it is more difficult to see what kind of international framework
offers Britain its best hope. If the world economy continues to falter, the
pressure towards economic blocs will strengthen: we can see them in embryo:
the EC, NAFTA, East Asia. If this happens, Britain would be faced with a
dreadful choice, since it can no longer organise an economic bloc of its
own. Its best hope would lie in co-ordinated efforts to expand the world
economy coupled with trade liberalisation.
It is the spirit, rather than the letter, of Keynes which applies today.
Keynes understood that market systems work best when underpinned by broad
agreement on aims and behaviour. This has been true of the successful 20th
century economies - the US, Germany, Japan. Underlying the monetary
mismanagement of the British economy has been a failure to agree on values
and institutions. So Britain oscillates between inflation and unemployment,
undervaluation and overvaluation. Today's challenge is to give Keynes'
vision of a middle way a new form for a new age.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Businesses fail at rate of 76 a day: Company collapses reach
their highest level since recession began
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS FAILURES in England and Wales have reached their highest level
since the recession started more than two years ago, with companies
collapsing at the rate of 76 a day.
Figures for the third quarter of 1992, published yesterday by the British
Chambers of Commerce, show that 7,014 companies were declared insolvent, an
increase of 21 per cent on the previous quarter and a 20 per cent rise on
the same period last year. Individual insolvencies rose to 9,470, an
increase of 37 per cent on the same period a year ago.
The failures represent one in 38 companies actively trading over the past
year. Such bleak statistics, based on insolvency figures prepared by the
Department of Trade and Industry, are a further blow to a government
desperately seeking signs of economic recovery. They will fuel speculation
that Mr Norman Lamont, the Chancellor, who has advocated a policy of
stimulating growth, might announce incentives for business in his Autumn
Statement next Thursday.
Interest rates have fallen 2 percentage points to 8 per cent since the
insolvency statistics were collected, but there is no evidence that the
reduction has improved consumer or business confidence.
Mr Richard Brown, BCC director of policy, said the failures were 'alarming
and underline the deep sense of instability in the business community'.
With more than 19,000 companies going into liquidation in the first nine
months of the year, it was not only badly managed businesses that were
folding, but good companies suffering from a loss of market and bad debts.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade secretary, said the figures showed 'an economy
in a free-fall towards slump with a government that cannot find a
parachute'. Since the election, 31,000 companies and individuals had been
forced into bankruptcy, but instead of giving the economy a kick-start, the
government had kicked the feet from under many businesses, he said.
For the 12 months to the end of September, the number of company
insolvencies was 24,219, or 2.6 per cent of active companies registered. The
total in 1991 was 21,827, compared with 15,051 in 1990 and 10,456 in 1989.
Industries with the largest number of liquidations over the last year were
construction, business services, metals and engineering, retailing and
transport and communications.

FT  07 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Spring Ram
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Slicing 27 per cent off a company's share price in response to an
exceptional item of less than 15 per cent of last year's profits may seem
excessive. But then the disclosure of irregularities at Spring Ram's
Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary could have been better handled. The seemingly
casual revelation that the company knew about the problem before publishing
last year's figures, yet did not draw shareholders' attention to it, hardly
reassures. Nor does the fact that when the hole proved larger than expected,
the management still kept mum.
Spring Ram is also a decentralised company, so fears of inadequate
management information and control have to be added to the disclosure lapse.
As a growth company with a premium rating, it can ill-afford to treat
shareholders in a cavalier way. Even if there are no other skeletons in the
cupboard, suspicions will take a long time to disperse.
There are concerns about the company's meteoric rate of expansion. Last year
stocks and work in progress grew by 72 per cent while sales rose only 34 per
cent. The management's view that this would allow the company to supply an
improving market must now be being tested. If the extra sales do not
materialise, stocks will rise further or this year's profits will be cut.
Then there is Spring Ram's gentle depreciation policy. There may well be
nothing seriously wrong. But investors have been burnt by too many falling
stars of late to take that on trust.

FT  07 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: UK conglomerates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is tempting to see Hanson's withdrawal from the contest for RHM as a sign
that times are truly difficult for conglomerates. All the more so since the
market evidently has reservations about the wisdom of Tomkins staying the
course. Less clear is how much this is simply a function of recession. In
these straitened times, predators cannot easily use their own paper to pay
for acquisitions. Nor can they readily dispose of the parts of any purchase
they do not want. Few targets are going cheap.
That may explain why an inactive Williams has underperformed the market so
far this year by 8 per cent, while Tomkins is trying to convince investors
it makes sense for it to be in food. It might have done better to desist.
Until it bid for RHM its shares had outperformed the market by about 20 per
cent this year. Now the premium is down to 3. At least Hanson has kept its
firepower intact.
One has to assume that when the cycle turns there will be less talk of
organic growth and negotiated strategic acquisitions. That said, the best of
the recovery may accrue to smaller conglomerates which can still add
substantial value with every deal. Hanson may be condemned to lasting
sobriety. It has outperformed the market by 7 per cent this year against 17
for BTR, the other conglomerate giant. BTR has Hawker Siddeley under its
belt, but doubtless the market is also looking at the two companies' spread
of businesses and how they are managed.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having side-stepped the cycle for so long it was about time Unilever felt
the impact of recession. Yesterday's third-quarter figures are solid enough,
but there is clear pressure on margins in US consumer products and the
outlook in Europe is far from encouraging, especially for industrial
chemicals. The benefits of restructuring in European foods will start to
flow through next year, but by then Unilever could be running to stand
still. Selling detergent in Argentina and ice-cream in Thailand, though,
remain growth businesses. Double-digit sales growth in 10 countries outside
Europe and the US prevented an ordinary set of results from looking
distinctly gloomy.
The growth prospects in Asia and Latin America may be enough to keep
Unilever busy for the time being, but history and the rude good health of
the balance sheet point to activity closer to home. Buying
Chesebrough-Pond's in 1986 and Faberge and Elizabeth Arden in 1989 helped
Unilever outperform the market, even when earnings growth in other sectors
was strong. With little more than Pounds 1bn net debt and strong cash flow,
there is certainly scope to add to the formidable portfolio of consumer
brands.
A stronger dollar may act as a brake on the shares, since US shareholders
could well see pedestrian earnings growth next year whatever Unilever's
operating performance. Even so, with immense resources and exposure to
fast-growing economies, it would be a brave bet on Unilever underperforming
the market despite yesterday's 3 per cent fall.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Like Mr Major, the UK equity market has survived this week's Maastricht
vote. Like him again, this does not necessarily mean it has much to look
forward to. With the FT-SE over 2,700, equities are looking dear in terms of
an historic multiple over 16. There is not much economic growth in the
offing, after all. Nor has Wall Street rebounded in salute to Mr Bill
Clinton. Instead Europe faces the grim prospect of a trade war which, if it
happens, will depress activity generally as well as inflicting hardship on
individual companies such as Guinness, Grand Metropolitan and Allied-Lyons.
What may be sustaining equities is the relative calm in the gilts market.
The yield gap is still just below 2. Although this measure is no longer such
a reliable indicator of value, it still puts equities in relatively
comfortable territory. The question for the coming week is whether that
comfort will be disturbed by the chancellor's Autumn Statement.
This could happen in one of two ways. An interest rate cut could undermine
sterling and hence gilts. As long as any cut is no more than 1 point,
though, that seems unlikely. The money markets are discounting such a move
and sterling is holding up. But equities have almost certainly factored in a
one-point cut. How much they are assuming on public spending is another
matter. Mr Lamont might fail to stick to the Pounds 244.5bn target. Or it
might be achieved only by sleight of hand with heavy reliance on
privatisation receipts, release of council house sale proceeds or unworkable
targets for public sector pay. If that were the case, gilts - and therefore
equities - would lose their lustre sooner rather than later.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Job cuts expected at Scottish Enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCOTTISH Enterprise network of economic development bodies in southern
Scotland is likely to make substantial staff cuts as a result of a reduction
in its budget expected in public spending plans for next year.
Mr Crawford Beveridge, chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, parent body
for 13 local enterprise companies (Lecs), has told staff the network of Lecs
and the parent body will both be reduced in size.
The parent body, known as Scottish Enterprise National, employs about 370
people and the 13 Lecs have about 1,000 staff in all. The 1992-93 Scottish
Enterprise budget totals Pounds 462.5m.
Staff of Scottish Enterprise National may be cut by between 80 and 100, with
about the same number of jobs being lost in the Lecs. Scottish Enterprise's
budget could be reduced by 10 per cent.
The possible cuts were denounced by Mr Tom Clarke, the shadow Scottish
secretary, as 'short-sighted and ludicrous'.
Mr Beveridge said decisions on the allocation of resources depended not just
on the money available but also on 'priorities for the network as a whole'
and on 'the increasing efficiency with which we carry out these tasks'.
Decisions will not be taken until after next week's Autumn Statement.
With government spending being tightly constrained by the Treasury, the
Scottish Office industry department which funds Scottish Enterprise wants to
preserve its road building programme, saying it is essential as the single
European market approaches.

FT  07 NOV 92 / PC prices set to rise after fall in sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES of personal computers in the UK look set to rise because of the
devaluation of sterling following Britain's exit from the European exchange
rate mechanism.
Up to 40 companies could announce price increases, despite the fiercely
competitive UK market. Some have already done so.
Elonex, the London-based company which is the sixth largest supplier of
personal computers in the UK, said yesterday it was raising prices by
between 7 1/2 and 12 1/2 per cent on a range of machines.
A desktop PC will cost another Pounds 100, a notebook computer Pounds 200
more.
Other companies are understood to have raised prices but refused to make the
increases public.
The computer industry buys components, chiefly from the US and the Far East,
in dollars, but sells them in the UK in sterling.
Mr Israel Wetrin, Elonex founder and chief executive, said: 'Do we stick
with lower prices and compromise on quality or do we absorb as much of the
extra cost as we can and raise our prices by as much as is necessary to
maintain high standards?
'Elonex has chosen the latter course,' he added.
Mr Jeremy Davies, managing director of Context, a UK-based consultancy which
tracks PC prices, said devaluation of the pound had forced PC suppliers into
one of two camps: those, such as Elonex, Viglen and Opus, which are
assembling PCs in the UK and face increased component costs, and others
including Compaq, Dell and Acer, which assemble outside the UK and are not
affected.
He said: 'This will accelerate the shake-out we have been expecting among PC
suppliers'.
Dell, the US-based pioneer in direct selling through telesales and newspaper
advertisements, said it would not raise prices. Opus Technologies, UK-based
supplier, refused to comment.
The price rises will be the first since the PC industry was riven by a price
war which began two years ago. Since then prices have been falling by up to
40 per cent a year.
In the past few months Compaq and IBM, the market leaders, have announced
low-cost PCs which will intensify competition in what one supplier described
as 'a grubby business today'.

FT  07 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow finds jobs figures a damp
squib
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
A REASONABLY positive set of October employment figures failed to set US
stock markets alight yesterday and share prices finished near their opening
values, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.78 at 3,240.06,
having spent the entire day no more than five points either side of
Thursday's close.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.76 at 417.58, while the
Amex composite was 0.57 higher at 383.26 and the Nasdaq composite 2.73
higher at 616.81.
NYSE turnover was 206m shares, and declines ran almost neck and neck at 893
to 865, respectively.
The keenly-awaited October employment report was a damp squib. Although the
27,000 rise in non-farm payrolls (49,000 if the effect of the special summer
jobs programme were excluded) and the one percentage-point decline in the
national unemployment rate to 7.4 per cent suggested labour market
conditions were moving in the right direction, the figures were not bullish
enough to produce much of a reaction from equity investors. Neither were
they bad enough to prompt another cut in interest rates from the Federal
Reserve.
Enthusiasm was also dampened by the reaction of the bond market to the jobs
data. The benchmark 30-year bond dropped three quarters of a point, pushing
the yield to 7.75 per cent, after the figures were released. Stock market
investors have been worried that the steady rise in long-term Treasury
market rates since the end of summer will slow the already sluggish economic
recovery.
Among individual stocks, McDonnell Douglas fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 55 7/8
after Moody's Investors Service, the big ratings agency, said it was putting
the company's debt under review for a possible downgrade.
Eljer Industries rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 10 5/8 after the company said
that an appeals court had upheld its decision favouring Eljer in a suit
filed by two insurance companies.
Woolworth firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 33 7/8 after the retailing group
revealed that it might sell some of its 500 stores in Germany.
Foodmaker dropped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 12 1/8 after the securities house,
Lehman Brothers, cut its rating on the stock because it believed the share
price may have peaked for the immediate term.
On the Nasdaq market, Food Lion plunged more than Dollars 3 to Dollars 6 in
early trading after an unfavourable television programme. The shares later
recovered some of their lost ground to end Dollars 1 lower at Dollars 8 1/4
in turnover of 8.8m shares.
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended the week sharply lower, depressed by a slide in gold
shares following a drop in bullion prices and renewed fears that Canada's
Bronfman family empire was once again in trouble.
Based on preliminary figures, the TSE-300 index fell 28.85 points, or 0.86
per cent, to 3,310.91. Declines led advances 321 to 249, volume of 39,442m
shares was above Thursday's 36.589m shares, and trading value was CDollars
337.3m against CDollars 366.1m. On the week, the index lost about 25 points.

FT  07 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Emerging markets face up to new
challenges - Investment media are evolving after five years of sometimes
spectacular growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARIDA KHAMBATA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the last several years, emerging markets as a group have outperformed
the developed markets of the OECD, often by spectacular margins.
Over the past five years, the International Finance Corporation (IFC)
emerging market indices show that returns of markets in Latin America and
Asia, measured in US dollars, have risen by 245 per cent and 41 per cent
respectively, compared with 34 per cent in the United States and minus 20
per cent in Japan.
The value traded on these developing exchanges in 1991 was nearly 39 times
the level of 1980. The total capitalisation of the 20 largest emerging
markets increased sevenfold and the number of listed companies doubled.
Capitalisation of these markets has risen from 6 per cent of their GDP in
1980 to over 25 per cent of their GDP at the end of the decade.
This growth can be traced to several inter-related factors. The
macroeconomic environment in many developing countries has improved
dramatically as governments have turned towards market-oriented policies,
often prompting increased foreign investment and repatriation of flight
capital. Furthermore, as corporate performance improved, both local and
foreign investors recognised that stock prices were undervalued on an
international basis.
Institutional investors and portfolio managers have begun considering
emerging markets as an entirely new asset category. They have channelled
more than Dollars 50bn of portfolio investment into these markets in the
past four years. It is now considered prudent to include them in global
investment allocation strategies - a truly significant financial
development.
Their performance in the past 10 years should be seen in the context of a
global trend - away from government control of economies and toward
market-oriented policies which encourage the private sector as the driving
force of economic growth. Last year alone, more than 450 companies in these
markets raised more than Dollars 28bn from share offerings.
The IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, has been working to develop these
markets since 1971. IFC's mandate is to promote economic growth in its
developing member countries. Unlike the World Bank, IFC focuses exclusively
on the private sector in these countries; it does not accept government
guarantees to protect its investments, and its financing is offered at
market rates.
In the capital markets arena, IFC's objectives include the enhancement of
financial institutions in developing countries, to give domestic savings
more mobility and to allocate them efficiently to productive investments.
IFC has invested in a wide range of companies, including commercial banks,
housing banks, leasing, factoring and brokerage companies, as well as
'contractual savings institutions' such as pension funds and insurance
companies. Often, the financial institutions financed by IFC are the first
of their kind in the host country.
After recent sweeping political and economic changes, the emerging markets
face new different challenges. Exchanges and their regulators are rapidly
gaining in sophistication. From Mexico to India to Egypt, markets are
implementing more effective regulatory environments, better accounting and
disclosure systems, advanced trading operations, and streamlined central
clearing and settlement procedures.
Emerging markets will still have crashes and scandals from time to time  -
as do their counterparts in developed countries. The key for developing
countries is to learn from mistakes and to continually make improvements in
trading and regulatory systems.
In the 1980s, collective investment vehicles such as country funds served as
a major private source of external finance, and IFC promoted more than two
dozen such funds. In contrast, the 1990s will see increasing numbers of
individual emerging market companies directly tapping the international
markets for capital, issuing both debt and equity to foreign investors.
Privatisation programmes are being adopted by many countries and are at
different stages of implementation. Once under way, they usually add quickly
to the size and liquidity of local markets. This could prove especially
important in Eastern and Central Europe, where the newly-privatised
companies are expected to become the core listings of emerging stock
markets.
What investors look for in emerging market companies is no secret; the same
rules apply in all stock markets. Among the most important criteria for
company selection are strong, competent and professional management; a
history of earnings growth or the clear potential for it; well defined
strategic and investment plans; liquidity in the stock market; and
transparent financial disclosure on a timely basis.
Ms Farida Khambata is Director of the Central Capital Markets Department at
the International Finance Corporation in Washington, DC, USA

<TEXT>
ALLEGATIONS that senior officials of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) tried to pay off an extreme right-wing political group to stop a
public campaign against the party depressed activity yesterday, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed down 161.78 at 16,869.81, up 0.6 per cent on the
week. The index moved between a high of 17,022.57 at the start and a low of
16,818.46 just before the close on position adjustments ahead of the
weekend.
Volume remained low at 190m shares against 186m. Declines led advances by
706 to 206 with 163 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
fell 12.41 to 1,275.96 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.20 to
1,021.71.
Investors remained inactive as 44 companies listed on the first section
announced interim earnings results. They were worried by prosecution
statements alleging that senior LDP officials tried to use gang links, money
and personal contacts to stop a negative campaign by a far-right party in
1987 against Mr Noboru Takeshita, the then prime minister.
Dealers took profits on speculative theme stocks. The nuclear fusion-related
Shoko, the most active issue of the day, fell Y20 to Y550, and Denki Kogyo
lost Y10 to Y951. Aids-related stocks were weaker after TSD, a software
company listed on the over-the-counter market, admitted that it had
misinformed investors that clinical tests of an Aids vaccine had begun in
Thailand, and that its Thai joint venture had started production of the
vaccine.
TSD was suspended from trading yesterday, following reports alleging that it
had given false information to prop up its share price ahead of the expiry
of its convertible bond exercise. The share, which had fallen to a year's
low of Y730 in April, surged to Y3,650 in September on the news. Mr Tsutomu
Matsuzaki, president of TSD, apologised for giving false information, but
denied allegations of stock price manipulation.
NEC fell Y17 to the year's low of Y656 on selling by foreigners on lingering
fears that its sales will be hit by cheaper US personal computers.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 205.66 to 18,297.93 in volume of 10m shares.
Roundup
THE region's sprinters slowed down yesterday as profit-taking emerged ahead
of the weekend.
HONG KONG's Hang Seng index touched a record intraday high of 6,401.73
before closing 32.76 lower at 6,315.01, up 0.9 per cent on the week.
Turnover eased to HKDollars 3.69bn from HKDollars 4.43bn.
Dealers attributed the early upturn to interest in Hong Kong Telecom, which
jumped 25 cents to HKDollars 9.60 after announcing a 16 per cent rise in
earnings late on Thursday.
SEOUL's gains were pared back by late selling but the composite index still
rose 13.63 to 644.94, up 5.7 per cent on the week, on record 1992 turnover
of Won819.22bn, up from Won771.83bn. The market was supported by growing
interest from foreign investors and increasing customers' deposits, which
rose to Won2.2 trillion on Thursday from Won1.4 trillion in mid-October.
KUALA LUMPUR paused for profit-taking and a minor technical correction, the
KLSE composite index closing 5.75 down at 654.60, 2.1 per cent higher on the
week.
AUSTRALIA reflected Westpac's revelations of previously undisclosed tax
liabilities as the All Ordinaries index finished 8.9 lower at 1,423.4,
fractionally down on the week.
Westpac finished at a nine-year low of ADollars 2.51, down 24 cents on the
day. News Corp fell 90 cents to ADollars 27.10, on profit-taking after its
82 per cent rise in first-quarter net profits.
TAIWAN dropped 1.7 per cent after the 2.5 per cent gain on Thursday, the
weighted index closing 60.80 lower at 3,532.61 for a 2.7 per cent fall on
the week.

FT  07 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Higher dollar takes the credit
for continental gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HIGHER dollar got the credit for gains in a number of bourses yesterday,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT edged up again, apparently encouraged by a further gain in the
dollar, but the share price effects sometimes defied logic as the DAX index
rose 6.23 to 1,487.16, a fraction lower on the week.
A higher dollar should benefit Germany's exporters, and Schering, in
pharmaceuticals, rose DM12.20 to DM736.50. But the big three chemical
companies were relatively flat and carmakers no more buoyant than the
average.
Conversely, a rise in the dollar should be bad news for steelmakers which
pay for their iron ore and transport in dollar terms, said Mr Michael Geiger
of County NatWest; but Mannesmann, after takeover rumours, Preussag
(following Thursday's earnings upgrade) and Thyssen all rose yesterday, by
DM5.70 to DM210.50, DM6 to DM330 and DM5.80 to DM 158 respectively.
Turnover fell from DM4.2bn to DM3.7bn. There was a suggestion that
short-covering, once again, was involved in the day's rises and that poor
economic data and depressed underlying sentiment was more clearly reflected
in retailing shares which mostly showed falls of some 1 to 3 per cent.
MILAN ended mixed as a leaked government document on privatisation, which
included a comprehensive list of companies scheduled to be sold off,
triggered heavy speculative trading in selected stocks. The Comit index rose
3.28 to 432.77, down 1.4 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at more
than Thursday's L177bn.
Of those companies mentioned in the document, the bank BCI rose L181 or 5.3
per cent to L3,625 while Autostrade preferred stock jumped L46 or 6.1 per
cent to L794. Sme, the state-controlled food company which has been touted
as a privatisation candidate but which did not appear in the leaked
document, rose L51 or 1.1 per cent to L4,871.
Speculative trading spilled over into the retailer Rinascente, settlement in
which was delayed because of an order imbalance early in the session
following rumours that its parent Fiat had agreed to sell it. Fiat denied
the rumors, but Rinascente's share price rallied 11 per cent or L595 to
L5,995.
PARIS was brought off the day's high by a series of basket trades around
midday. After an early high of 1,812.83, the CAC-40 index ended 11.08 down
at 1,793.62, for a rise of 2.9 per cent on the week. Volume was moderate at
FFr2.5bn.
Total dropped FFr5.50 to FFr239.50 as the oil company's disclosure that
restructuring and asset writedowns would reduce 1992 earnings by about
FFr600m took the market by surprise.
BSN dropped FFr22 to FFr1,002 on a downgrade by a leading broker, while LVMH
fell FFr160 or 4.3 per cent to FFr3,579 on fears that a trade war between
Europe and the US would harm its exports to the US.
BRUSSELS saw a further heavy fall in Delhaize which plunged BFr99 or 6.2 per
cent to BFr1,486 in heavy trading, reflecting a drop in the shares of its US
Food Lion unit in New York after the showing on US television of an
unauthorised film shot at the US chain. The Bel-20 index fell 11.68 to
1,134.47, but was little changed on the week.
AMSTERDAM was helped by a firmer dollar as the CBS Tendency index rose 0.8
to 103.4, up 1.8 per cent on the week.
Unilever fell Fl 2.00 to Fl 190.10, following its London price lower after
its third quarter results which, said dealers, were disappointing in
sterling terms.
ZURICH extended its show of relative strength as the SMI index rose 6.2 to
1,957.7, 2.4 per cent higher on the week. Strong demand for Nestle and Roche
boosted the index, while other export-oriented companies also benefited from
the dollar.
MADRID heard more peseta devaluation talk, but the strength of the dollar
lent support to ADR stocks and the general index closed only 0.76 lower at
199.16, slightly up on the week.
STOCKHOLM was also supported by the dollar as the Affarsvarlden General
index rose 1.7 to 724.2, up 2.4 per cent on the week.
HELSINKI dropped 3.4 per cent, but still showed a gain of 6.5 per cent on
the week as the Hex index closed 27.9 lower at 799.7. Banks fell sharply,
partly on an article in a business daily on the possible risk involved in
holding the shares. The banks and finance house index closed 112.5 or 25 per
cent lower at 335.6.

DERIVATIVES ended the week in a dull mood with dealers awaiting next week's
autumn statement and further news on a cut in base rates, writes Joel
Kibazo.
The December FT-SE future opened at 2,737 and after a brief squeeze was led
lower by 'locals' - independent traders - in thin trading.
Thereafter, the contract traded in a narrow range of 2,725 and 2,735, with
the afternoon proving to be as dull as the morning.
The premium was well below that seen in recent sessions, being between 5 to
15 points throughout the session.
December finished at 2,732, down 7 on Thursday's close and around 12 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 17. Turnover was
6,146 lots.
Traded options were equally featureless and volume was a poor 21,808
contracts. The FT-SE options 100 contract accounted for 4,556 of the total
and the Euro-FT-SE 100 option 826 lots. Asda was once again the most active
stock option with a day's total of 4,377 trades. &amp;

FT  07 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Tomkins buys up RHM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION by Hanson to withdraw its bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall (RHM)
yesterday prompted the biggest daily turnover in shares of the food group
for at least 10 years as Tomkins, which appears to have won through with its
Pounds 935m counter offer, piled into the market.
Dealers said that BZW, which has been acting for Tomkins, was crossing RHM
shares between institutions and the group at 260p. This compared with a
market bid price of 257p. Most of the business was done early in the day and
resulted in closing turnover of more than 67m shares. It is estimated that
the buying will have taken Tomkins stake in RHM to around 10 per cent ahead
of the issue of the two-for-one rights issue offer document on Monday.
Tomkins expects to raise Pounds 672m in one of the biggest ever cash calls
in the UK. By the close, RHM had eased 4 1/4 to 257 3/4 p and Tomkins had
fallen 2 to 226p on turnover of 8.2m. Meanwhile, Hanson closed 2 1/2 lower
at 229 1/2 p with 12m shares traded.
Unilever upset
Food and household products firm Unilever fell 29 to 1080p after
third-quarter figures that came at the bottom of the market's expectations
inspired analysts to cut forecasts.
Some analysts were particularly disappointed at the small increase in the
sterling dividend payment, up only 3 per cent to 5.2p. Mr Carl Short shaved
his full-year forecast by Pounds 33m to Pounds 2,005m and his 1993 figure by
Pounds 25m to Pounds 2,385m. However, BZW, which had had the lowest
forecast, was pleasantly surprised and upgraded its 1993 figure to take
account of improved currency rates. Reckitt &amp; Colman lost 10 to 625p in
sympathy.
Spring Ram sold
Building supplies group Spring Ram had a rough ride in the market for two
reasons. First, the stock came under pressure after Spring Ram was confirmed
as the bidder for Stag Furniture; secondly, the group said it had identified
financial irregularities at its Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary which will
cause Spring Ram to take an exceptional charge of up to Pounds 3.5m in its
current-year figures.
Spring Ram dropped sharply as the news filtered into the market. At their
worst, the shares touched 112p before closing 43 off at 113p. Turnover
reached 19m shares.
Specialists were surprised at the level of selling. One said news of a
probable extraordinary charge had been in the market for some time and had
driven the shares down to a low of 104p during the early part of September.
Stag Furniture shares shot up 39 to 158p
Shares in Calor Group saw more heavy activity and dipped 5 to 240p after a
reported denial by SHV, the privately-owned Dutch company which already has
a 46 per cent stake in Calor, that it would bid for the rest of the stock.
There was evidence in the market that a big buyer had been operating. A
series of big trades were revealed by the Seaq ticker, including blocks of
425,000 at 240p, 408,000 shares at 235p, 350,000 at 237 1/2 p, 1.1m at 240
1/2 p and 900,000 at 240p.
Turnover in Calor shares was the heaviest for at least two and a half years
and led oil sector specialists to take the view that SHV had been operating
in the market to increase its shareholding to around 48 per cent.
Hints that one of the big institutions had been switching out of Racal
Electronics and into Chubb produced some exceptionally heavy trading in the
two stocks. Racal dipped 2 to 154p on turnover of 5.3m while Chubb edged up
3 to 197p on 5.7m traded.
BICC rose 3 more to 266p after a visit and subsequent positive
recommendation made by Smith New Court, the securities house.
Talk of a dawn raid on Monday surrounded international conglomerate Lonrho
late in the afternoon and the shares jumped 5 to 77p. The Seaq electronic
trading system gave conflicting information but one page revealed a block of
5m shares dealt at 77p. This number of shares would be more than the total
average daily turnover. One suggestion was that 7.26 per cent stake holder
Genting, one of Malaysia's biggest companies, might be paving the way for a
bid.
Royal Insurance moved up a further 3 to 237p, with continued strong support
from one broking house said to be the major influence in the shares' recent
big rise.
Suggestions that CE Heath, the insurance broking firm, may cut its interim
dividend when it announces results on November 19, triggered a 19 fall in
the shares to 291p.
Fisons was knocked in early trade with the market focusing on a report in an
on-line specialist magazine saying that eye treatment Opticrom would not get
re-approval in the US this year. However, analysts said the information was
not new and Fisons recovered from to close only 6 lower at 216p.
Food retailer Argyll moved up 9 to 361p on heavy turnover of 10m shares as
investors were said to be looking for a home for their funds after moving
out of Sainsbury on the announcement of interim figures on Wednesday.
Sainsbury eased 2 to 489p.
Northern Foods rose 10 to 285p as some analysts argued that the stock was on
an undeservedly low rating.
Fears of a US trade war prompted Guinness to fall 10 to 516p and
Allied-Lyons to slip 10 to 640p. Both have heavy exposure to the US and
Lehman Brothers said that Allied had risen too far.
Reports that a group of executives had left Virgin Music, acquired by Thorn
EMI last March, worried some investors. Combined with profit taking, the
shares fell 16 to 817p, in trade of 2m shares.
Chemicals company Leigh Interests jumped 17 to 158p on revived interest and
talk of speculative buying. SG Warburg has the stock on its buy list and
believes the shares are cheap below 150p.
Strong two-way business in Vickers prompted turnover of 5.4m with the shares
losing 5 to 80p, as profit-takers gained the upper hand. A BZW
recommendation was reported in Howden Group, helping the shares firm 5 to
56p.
Office and photographic equipment distributor Gestetner jumped 18 to 156p,
making it the day's biggest rise in the market in percentage terms, on
speculation that it would soon receive a bid from Inchcape, 2 better at
499p.
Coats Viyella held firm on the eve of an analysts visit to Carolina to
discuss prospects for the company, the shares hardening a penny at 207p.
City of London chop house Simpsons rose 2 to 34p in early trading after
leisure, property and printing group Baldwin made an agreed offer for the
group valuing its ordinary share capital at Pounds 1.68m. Baldwin eased a
penny to 74p.

FT  07 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index holds on to 2,700 mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market held on to most of the high ground recaptured this week
despite some profit-taking yesterday. Trading volume remained high and the
second line stocks outperformed the FT-SE 100 list as the institutions
widened their investment range in the stock market.
The plans by the US government to impose punitive tariffs on some European
farm exports unsettled distillery issues which could be affected if the US
action is extended to other areas. But the broad range of the London stock
market was focusing on the British government's Autumn Statement, due next
Thursday, when the City of London hopes to see the first steps in the
official 'strategy for growth.' Some traders suggested that the
eagerly-awaited cut in base rates might also come next week.
Early gains, which put 4 points on the Footsie, melted away as profit-takers
appeared and the market spent the rest of the session in negative territory.
However, dealers stressed that selling pressure, largely concentrated on the
Footsie list, was never of any great significance. At least four trading
programmes were identified, and there were hints that a raid on the shares
of Lonrho, the international trader, was planned.
A loss of 10 points was stemmed when the market rallied at the Footsie 2,701
level and, despite a slow start to the new session on Wall Street, London
closed comfortably above the day's low.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,702.7 for a net loss on the
day of 8.4 points. Over a somewhat erratic first leg of the two week
account, the equity market has gained 44.4 Footsie points, or about 1.7 per
cent.
Seaq volume was again strong yesterday at 652.8m shares, only just below the
701.8m of the previous session. Retail, or customer, business in equities
jumped nearly 25 per cent to Pounds 1.5bn on Thursday.
London is waiting for a more definite response from Wall Street to the
outcome of the US presidential election. But confidence that the UK economy
will be stimulated has reappeared.
Mr Nicholas Knight of Nomura Research said yesterday that what lies ahead in
the UK stock market is 'too good to miss.'
Gilts remained firm, making little response to the issue of a Pounds 1bn
tranche of Treasury 2009 stock. Index-linked issues shaded lower.
Equity volume slipped lower ahead of the Maastricht vote in the UK and the
pressidential election in the US but is now moving higher again.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Clinton victory cheers white
metals - Week in the Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BILL CLINTON'S victory in Tuesday's US presidential election was given a
warm welcome in the New York platinum and silver markets, where traders
hoped the incoming administration might be able to stimulate the economy.
And that optimism spilled over on to the London bullion market.
Base metal traders, however, seemed to take little comfort from the prospect
of a new hand on the helm of the US ship of state and all the London Metal
Exchange contracts ended down on the week.
Though there were no clear fundamental factors to justify platinum's rally,
which took the London price to Dollars 366.50 a troy ounce yesterday
afternoon, up Dollars 12.35 on the week, technical explanations abounded.
The platinum market is traditionally firmer towards the end of the year,
dealers told the Reuter news agency, and that seasonal factor might have
been delayed by the US election. Chart patterns were looking bullish, they
added, and the New York platinum market's rise had broken 'key resistance'.
When the price slipped in early trading yesterday the dealers explained that
the market was 'consolidating in a technical correction'. The long term
downtrend had been broken on Thursday, they added, and if the price moved
above Dollars 370 an ounce an important reversal would be signalled.
Silver's post-election rally lifted the London spot price to 398.50 cents an
ounce at one point. Yesterday the price moved below the key resistance point
of 392 cents an ounce that had been breached on Thursday to close at 389.5
cents up 13 cents on the week.
Traders, however, were not dismayed. The market was 'completing a small base
pattern, underpinned in the 387-389-cent area', they told Reuter, adding
that that should support a test of stiff resistance around 395-400 cents and
a possible breakthrough up to 420 cents.
Gold did not join in with the platinum and silver rallies as the market
remained under pressure from forward producer selling. Large sales that
appeared to emanate from central banks were also weighing on the market. In
London the gold price closed yesterday at Dollars 334.05 an ounce, down
Dollars 4.95 on the day and Dollars 5.60 on the week.
The pound's continued weakness against the dollar helped the London Metal
Exchange's sterling-denominated copper price to reach the highest level for
more than two years at one point. But the fundamental gloom eventually
overwhelmed the currency factor and the cash price ended the week Pounds
54.50 down at Pounds 1,397.50 a tonne, which translated into a nine-month
dollar low of Dollars 2,148 a tonne, down Dollars 120 on the week.
Lead, the LME's other sterling contract, was even weaker. As the extreme
sluggishness of demand was underlined by a further 8,000-tonne rise in LME
warehouse stocks, to 195,575 tonnes, the cash price slipped to Pounds 294.50
a tonne, down Pounds 28 on the week.
Possibly more disappointing, however, were the falls in the zinc and nickel
markets, where moderately bullish developments appeared to be ignored.
The sustained uptrend in LME zinc stocks was reversed yesterday when a
5,225-tonne reduction took the total down to 382,525 tonnes. But the cash
prices lost another Dollars 19 on the day to end the week Dollars 70.50 down
at Dollars 1,022 a tonne.
The bullish news for nickel was Wednesday's announcement by Falconbridge of
Canada, the second biggest producer, that it was cutting output at its
Sudbury, Ontario, mines by 15 per cent to 38,000 tonnes next year because of
the price slump.
However, the announcement produced only a modest rise in prices that day and
by yesterday's close the cash quotation at the LME was down Dollars 480 on
the week at Dollars 5,590 a tonne, the lowest level since early 1988.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange cocoa prices reversed last week's
falls and moved on to fresh nine-month highs. Sterling's weakness played a
part but was responsible for only about Pounds 8 of the Pounds 47 rise that
took the March position to Pounds 752 a tonne.
Dealers noted that producers had mainly remained aloof, presumably waiting
for further price gains before being tempted into the market.
At the half-way point of talks in Geneva on reviving the moribund
International Cocoa Agreement the gaps between producers and consumers on
the price range to be defended and the amount of stocks to be withdrawn from
the market had been narrowed somewhat. But they remained dauntingly wide -
and the thorny issue of financing the agreement remained to be tackled.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Money Markets: Optimism on UK rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAUTIOUS optimism that European interest rates will be cut has dominated
money markets all week, and this was the note on which trading closed
yesterday, writes James Blitz.
There is now a clear expectation in the sterling market that UK base rates
will be cut in conjunction with Thursday's autumn statement. Dealers only
differ over the scale of the cut. Some argue that it will be as small as
1/2 a percentage point, and others, more daringly, punt on a 2 per cent fall
in base rates.
Whatever the differences, the optimistic mood brought 3-month money down
3/8 per cent on the week to a close of 7 5/16 per cent offered yesterday.
The December short sterling contract closed 20 base points up from last
Friday's close, at 93.54 yesterday. This prices 3-month money in December at
around 6 1/2 per cent, a level compatible with 6 per cent base rates.
The downward trend in money market rates is almost certain to continue in
the early part of next week. One commercial bank dealer expected 3-month
money to be at around 7 1/8 per cent, or even 7 per cent, by Wednesday.
In the French and German markets, too, there is a growing feeling that rates
will be cut soon.
The 25 basis point cut in the French intervention rate on Monday gave an
upward boost to French cash rates and futures all week. Three-month money
closed at 9 5/16 per cent offered yesterday, some  3/8 per cent down on the
week.
The December franc contract reached a high of 91.00 yesterday, some 20 basis
points up from Tuesday's opening level.
But, the French markets are expecting rates to come down slowly because of
the currency's membership of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.
Yesterday's close for the December contract prices is only 25 basis points
off the intervention rate this year. Dealers will be watching the Bank of
France's repurchase operations on Monday and Thursday for official movement.
The French market's caution is explained by the Bundesbank's recent
statements.
The German central bank has hinted strongly that it will be watching how the
German government targets the budget deficit and the public sector pay round
in the next few weeks, before cutting the discount rate.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Divisions over dollar rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dollar yesterday continued the slow rise against the D-Mark that has
accompanied Mr Clinton's election as US president, but doubts remain about
whether the currency's ascent is about to move into an even faster gear,
writes James Blitz.
This week, the currency has, in the words of one analyst, 'puttered
upwards'. After closing at DM1.5420 last Friday night, it broke a key chart
point of DM1.56 on election day, and closed in London at DM1.5940, up 1 1/2
pfennigs on the day.
In the short term, the dollar's progress may be in the hands of Mr Clinton
himself. If, for example, Mr Clinton were to choose Mr Paul Volcker, the
former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, as Treasury secretary, the dollar
could rise sharply because of his policy of raising US interest rates in the
1980s.
However, in the longer term, the dollar will respond to perceptions about
the upturn in the US economy, and here opinion is divided.
Mr Brian Fabbri, chief economist for Midland Bank New York, gave a
strikingly upbeat forecast for the US economy at a conference in London
yesterday. 'The economy is likely to grow more rapidly in 1993, and growth
should accelerate to 2.5 per cent from 1.7 per cent this year,' he said.
'The dollar should appreciate quite rapidly.'
However, Mr Neil Mackinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank in London,
is more subdued. 'Mr Clinton's election victory is unlikely to result in any
dramatic improvement in the economy for at least the next 6-12 months,' he
says.
He argues, for instance that the president-elect's stated aim of introducing
investment tax credits may sap investment in the short-term as companies
wait for the president's plans to be implemented.
However, Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation in
London, is a strong dissenter in a camp of his own. 'I can't get bullish
longer-term about the dollar,' he said yesterday. 'The next 10 pfennigs will
be downwards, and I don't rule out the possibility of new lows against the
D-Mark.'
He believes there is still much weakness in the US economy, pointing to
yesterday's sluggish rise in the non-farm payroll figure, up 27,000 in
October, as evidence. Mr O'Neill also believes that the market is ignoring
the D-Mark's residual strength. Shorter-term D-Mark interest rates remain
nearly 6 per cent above those for the dollar, and, he argues, the Bundesbank
will not ease policy quickly. 'People who think the D-Mark may have problems
have to think again,' he says.

FT  07 NOV 92 / International Company News: Woolworth eyes German disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WOOLWORTH, the US retailer, announced yesterday that it was considering
selling much of its important German operations, comprising more than 500
stores with annual turnover of more than Dollars 1.6bn.
The potential disposal does not include the company's expanding Foot Locker
business, selling athletic shoes, which it is building up as a major chain
across Europe.
Woolworth has had a significant presence in Germany for decades and the
country provides about one sixth of the group's total sales of Dollars 10bn.
Profits boomed following the reunification, with revenues leaping from
Dollars 1.18bn in 1989 to Dollars 1.66bn in 1990 and operating profits
soaring from Dollars 80m to Dollars 154m. However, in 1991 profits slipped
to Dollars 127m on revenues little changed.
The company said yesterday it was exploring various alternatives for its
general merchandise and specialty stores in Germany, including the possible
disposal of some or all of the operations to one or more third parties.
A spokeswoman would only say the company had the enhancement of shareholder
value as one of its strategic objectives.
Analysts said the disposal would free funds and allow Woolworth to
concentrate on its European strategy for Foot Locker, which is now the
company's most important single business in the US. The company has 134 Foot
Locker stores in seven European countries, including 27 outlets in Germany,
and wants to increase that to 1,000 outlets by the year 2000.
German operations which could be sold comprise more than 320 Woolworth
general stores and more than 180 specialty stores, including Rubin costume
jewellery, handbags and accessory shops; Moderna and Der Schuh shoe stores;
and Lady Plus clothes stores for larger-sized women.
The company is being advised by US investment banks Merrill Lynch and
Salomon Brothers. Woolworth shares rose Dollars  3/8 on the news to close at

Earlier this week Woolworth reported sharply improved third-quarter results,

big American divisions - the Woolworth general merchandise chain and Kinney
family shoe - have been shrinking.

FT  07 NOV 92 / International Company News: GM plans to allow some workers
to retire at 50
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors, which is in the throes of a major job and cost-cutting
programme, is offering early retirement incentives to North American
salaried employees, giving some workers the option of retiring at 50, 15
years ahead of the normal GM retirement age.
The company is also believed to be working on plans for a job buy-out
programme covering hourly paid workers.
This week's package, which was unveiled to employees on Thursday, is the
second salaried employee buy-out programme this year.
The first, which was in place until June, cut the retirement age to 53 and
was so popular that GM was able to shift its goal of cutting 20,000 salaried
jobs forward from the end of 1994 to the end of 1993.
The latest move lowers the retirement age in overstaffed units to 50 and in
areas that are not overstaffed to 52, provided that the individuals
concerned have 10 years of service with the company.
GM declined to say how many workers were covered by the programme. It
employs some 81,000 salaried staff in North America, down from around 91,000
at the end of last year.
The company's new top management team, which was named earlier this week
following the forced resignation of Mr Robert Stempel, GM's chairman, is due
to make an important strategy presentation to Wall Street analysts next
Thursday.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ADIDAS, the troubled German sporting goods group controlled by Mr Bernard
Tapie, the controversial French businessman, plans to raise up to DM150m
(Dollars 98.60m) from a refinancing package.
The announcement comes amid speculation about Adidas' future following the
collapse last month of the proposed Pounds 215m (Dollars 333.25m) sale of Mr
Tapie's controlling stake to Pentland, the UK consumer products concern and
a minority investor in Adidas.
Pentland's decision to pull out of the deal has fuelled reports that Mr
Tapie, whose plans to reduce his debts through disposals have been hampered
by the recent collapse of two other proposed sales, may be forced to find a
new purchaser for his 58 per cent stake in BTF, the German holding company
through which he controls Adidas.
However, news of the capital injection, to be effected through a DM50m
increase in nominal capital, was accompanied by the announcement that Ms
Gilberte Beaux, a close associate of Mr Tapie, had been provisionally
appointed president of Adidas to replace Mr Rene Jaggi.
Ms Beaux, a former banker, joined BTF two years ago at the time of the
Adidas acquisition. She has since represented Mr Tapie on the Adidas board.
Earlier this year Mr Tapie gated his Adidas responsibilities to her when he
began his short-lived career in the French cabinet.
Mr Tapie was forced to resign his cabinet post because of his involvement in
a fraud case.

<TEXT>
GREECE is to sell 35 per cent of OTE, the state telecommunications monopoly,
and will seek bids from international telecommunications groups later this
month.
The sale is part of the second stage of a privatisation programme which
calls for the transfer of up to 49 per cent of state shareholdings in
utilities and transport companies to the private sector.
The government aims to complete the OTE sale, which is expected to raise at
least Dr218bn (Dollars 1bn), by next spring. The buyer will also take over
management of OTE, according to the government's privatisation unit.
The sale will be followed immediately by a flotation of a further 8-12 per
cent of OTE on the Athens Stock Exchange. Details have not yet been worked
out, but the company's 28,000 employees are expected to be offered shares on
a priority basis.
The government has dropped its plan to raise additional funds through an
international flotation of OTE, but foreign investors would be able to buy
shares in the company on the Athens bourse, a privatisation official said.
Coopers and Lybrand, the international accountants, have already completed
an evaluation of OTE, funded by the European Community.
Several European telecoms companies have shown interest in OTE, the most
profitable Greek state enterprise with earnings last year of Dr55bn. Credit
Suisse First Boston is acting as the government's adviser on the sale.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AIR France, the French state airline, yesterday warned that it faced a
FFr3bn (Dollars 580m) net loss this year, more than four times the FFr685m
deficit it made in 1991, because of the deepening recession in the air
transport industry.
Mr Jean-Didier Blanchet, managing director, issued the loss warning at a
staff council meeting which followed the decision by all 14 Air France
unions to call a 24-hour strike on Monday November 23, the date of the next
board meeting.
The stoppage is in protest at the 1,500 extra job losses among the group's
45,000 staff announced last month. Mr Blanchet called the strike
'irresponsible', and warned that it would worsen the losses and could
irreversibly lose customers.
The latest job cuts, all among ground staff, bring to 5,000 the number of
employees to go in the two years to the end of 1993 and should trim FFr3bn
from the group's annual operating costs, according to Mr Bernard Attali, the
chairman. Unions are angered that Air France has warned that it cannot rule
out redundancies, for the first time in its history.
Management yesterday reminded unions that the group had no option but to
shed staff at a time when most of its competitors are making heavy losses.
Airlines are suffering from overcapacity, as the recession continues,
worsened by the fact that many of them took delivery of substantial orders
for new aircraft just when growth in air traffic ground to a halt.
Air France's loss forecast is far heavier than expected, coming after a
FFr1.8bn net deficit in the first nine months of this year.

FT  07 NOV 92 / International Company News: Saffa chairman hits out at
'unreliable' KIO managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kuwait Investment Office's most important foreign partner in Spain has
accused the KIO management of being 'unreliable' and 'more interested in
their own internal quarrels than running their companies'.
Mr Carlo Bonomi, chairman of Saffa, the Italian industrial group which took
minority stakes in two KIO subsidiaries in Spain in early 1991, warned that
losses on the holdings could wipe out his company's profits this year.
Saffa, Europe's second-biggest producer of cardboard for packaging, became
involved with the KIO following a complex deal in which it sold its paper
interests to the Kuwaitis in return for a Spanish cardboard mill, cash and
minority stakes in two KIO subsidiaries.
The shares in these two groups - Prima Immobiliaria, a property group, and
Ebro, a leading Spanish foods concern - have fallen steeply.
Failing a recovery before year-end, Saffa faces a significant write-down on
the value of its holdings, Mr Bonomi warned.
Saffa owns around 6 per cent of Prima and 5 per cent of Ebro, making it the
biggest shareholder after the KIO in both cases.
The Kuwaitis control more than 70 per cent of Prima and around 42 per cent
of Ebro. 'Prima's shares have plunged to around Pta600 (Dollars 5.55) now
from Pta7,600 when we came in, while Ebro has fallen to Pta1,000 from
Pta3,200,' Mr Bonomi said.
The collapse in Prima's shares stems from the withdrawal of Kuwaiti support
for various development projects currently under way, according to Mr
Bonomi.
'The assets are good, but development costs are high,' he said.
Mr Bonomi said Saffa had approached the KIO with a proposal to buy out its
stake in Ebro but it had received 'no clear answer'.
Attempts to group together with other minority shareholders in order to put
pressure on the KIO were complicated by the fact that shares in both Prima
and Ebro were widely dispersed, with few big institutional investors, he
said.
'The new management at KIO seem more interested in fighting with the old
management,' Mr Bonomi said.
The new KIO leadership, which has frequently accused its predecessors of
mishandling a Dollars 3bn investment programme in Spain, was not available
for comment yesterday.

FT  07 NOV 92 / International Company News: Saab says job cuts inevitable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S Saab Automobile expects to announce a major package of cost-cutting
measures, including heavy redundancies, before the end of this month, due to
a sharp deterioration in trading conditions.
The group will not confirm Swedish press reports that as many as 2,300 jobs
are to go at its Trollhatten plant, nearly a third of the workforce there,
but it does not deny that significant job losses are inevitable.
Saab, which is jointly owned by Saab-Scania and General Motors of the US,
reiterated yesterday that it plans to reduce its break-even production level
to 70,000 units from the current 100,000.
It says sales this year will amount to just 87,000 cars, the same as last
year, but well below the 101,000 target it originally set.
Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, who took over as chief executive in September,
has already promised further rationalisation, on top of the cuts which have
already taken place in the last two and half years.
The group is heading for a SKr2.2bn (Dollars 370.68m) loss this year - its
fourth consecutive year of losses - and is not confident of a return to the
black next year.
Crucial to its turnround prospects is the timing of the launch of its new
model, which it may now try to bring forward to the middle of next year.
Earlier this week, fellow Swedish motor vehicle group Volvo announced 4,500
job losses across its car and truck operations and the closure of two of its
three Swedish car plants.
Like Volvo, Saab has been badly hit by falling sales in its three key
markets, the US, UK and Sweden.

FT  07 NOV 92 / UK Company News: False accounting found at Spring Ram -
Shares fall by 43p after revelations in document for agreed offer for Stag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRING RAM Corporation, the kitchen and bathroom furniture maker which
became a favourite with City investors, yesterday fell from grace when the
company announced exceptional charges of Pounds 5.6m to cover 'serious
misrepresentation and false accounting' at a subsidiary.
Concern about the company's internal financial controls led to a collapse in
the shares, which fell 43p to 113p, wiping nearly Pounds 160m off the
company's market value.
The company said the former finance director of a subsidiary, Balterley
Bathrooms, overstated stock figures to boost profits since 1989. The problem
was discovered in February during a final audit and the director was asked
to leave.
Spring Ram made charges of Pounds 2.1m against last year's profits to cover
the overstatement and thought the problem had been solved. It said it was
advised by Arthur Andersen, its auditor, that the problem did not need to be
disclosed.
Mr Stuart Greenwood, group finance director, said the former director's
motives were not fraudulent. 'We set very demanding targets and he seems to
have been caught up in the success culture.'
But the company discovered from the end of April management accounts that
the overstatement had been more serious. Arthur Andersen were sent in again
in June and are still investigating.
Spring Ram revealed the charges yesterday as it announced an agreed takeover
of Stag Furniture Holdings, a furniture maker, at 160p a share in cash with
a loan note alternative. Shareholders representing 49.52 per cent of the
equity have accepted.
Stag shares rose 39p to close at 158p.
Panmure Gordon, the company's stockbroker, was told of the charges when
preparing the offer document and advised the matter should be released to
the market as soon as possible. Spring Ram said yesterday it had not
announced the overstatement earlier because its legal advisers told it to
delay until the full scope of the problem was known.
But the company was yesterday widely attacked by shareholders and analysts,
who said such price sensitive information should have been made available
much sooner. One analyst said the handling of the problem suggested 'naivity
or a cock up'.
He said: 'They seem to have spotted the problem all right. But you simply do
not release such matters tucked away in a bloody offer document.'
Mr Greenwood replied: 'With hindsight, it may look like we were plodding.
But we identified the problem and thought we had dealt with it. This is an
isolated incident and should not undermine people's confidence in our
ability to run the business.'
Profit forecasts for Spring Ram are hardly changed, at about Pounds 42m. The
maximum exceptional charge of Pounds 3.5m for the present year will be
cancelled out by an exceptional credit of Pounds 5.8m from the sale of four
non-trading subsidiaries last month. But several analysts said Spring Ram's
premium rating was lost.

FT  07 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Awkward questions facing Hanson -
Controversy surrounds withdrawal of predator's Pounds 790m takeover bid for
RHM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS an audible sigh of relief from Hanson's shareholders when the
Anglo-US conglomerate withdrew from the bidding contest for Ranks Hovis
McDougall, the UK milling, baking and grocery products group.
Many institutional shareholders feared that Lord Hanson, the eponymous
chairman, would pay over the odds to prevent his former employee, Mr Greg
Hutchings, chief executive of Tomkins, pulling off his recommended Pounds
935m deal.
'Notwithstanding the fact that another deal may have slipped through the
good Lord's hands,' said one shareholder, 'he was right not to increase his
(Pounds 790m) offer.' Another opined: 'His reputation for not overpaying is
more important than his ability to do deals.'
Yet Hanson's decision to withdraw from the bidding raises some awkward
questions for the group. Regarded as the consummate deal maker of the 1980s
it has failed to pull off many of its big deals in the 1990s.
Last year's purchase of a 2.8 per cent stake in Imperial Chemical Industries
pushed the chemical group into a much-needed restructuring. But apart from a
Pounds 40m profit on selling its stake, it did little for Hanson which
suffered one of the most forceful campaigns against a potential predator.
After recently pulling back from bidding for Canary Wharf, the
financially-troubled property development, Hanson's critics are asking
whether the group has lost its touch.
Mr Derek Bonham, Hanson's chief executive, says such criticism is misplaced.
'There are literally hundreds of deals that we have looked at over the past
few years which we have pulled back from. The public does not ever hear of
these deals.'
Mr Bonham draws a comparison between RHM and the failed bid for Powell
Duffryn, the distribution and storage group, the first hostile offer that
Hanson lost.
In January 1985 the group refused to raise its original all paper offer  -
which valued Powell Duffryn at Pounds 170m - and thereby lost the bid. 'We
would not overpay then and we will not overpay now,' says Mr Bonham. There
are, after all, many other potential deals.
RHM, however, was not just another deal. Hanson believed it had found the
perfect takeover candidate. As one of its advisers put it: 'This was not a
case of Lord White (chairman of Hanson Industries) throwing darts at a
number of potential targets to see what next to go for. Hanson's acquisition
team worked on RHM for months before launching its bid.'
The group broke with precedent by taking on outside consultants to look at
the baking and grocery products group.
LEK, the business consultants, which three years earlier looked at RHM for
Sir James Goldsmith, who was then the company's biggest shareholder, tried
to see whether Hanson could justify paying more than the 220p a share it
originally offered for the company. After an exhaustive search it underlined
Lord White's assessment that RHM was not worth more than Hanson's original
offer.
The failure to win the battle for RHM may tempt the conglomerate to pull off
the long awaited Continental deal that it has been promising.
Mr Robert Hanson, who was appointed to the board in September with special
responsibilities for Europe, believes there are many undervalued and poorly
managed conglomerates on the Continent. 'We have already looked at a number
of different European companies. It is only a matter of time before we buy a
big European group,' he said recently.
Yet the Continental deal has been foreshadowed before - by Lord Hanson  -
and never materialised.
The group's difficulty in making deals in the 1990s was one of the reasons
why its new management wanted to show that Hanson was not a rag-bag of
businesses held together by the two personalities which founded the group.
Mr David Clarke, chief executive of Hanson Industries, the group's North
American arm, first articulared the need for Hanson to concentrate on its
core businesses last year. He talked about the need for organic growth and
said Hanson should no longer be regarded as a seller and buyer of businesses
but as a manager on the lines of BTR, the industrial conglomerate.
The message has been well received by some analysts. Earlier this year in
the US Goldman Sachs, which in the UK acted for ICI in attacking the group's
accounting methods and management, issued a buy note, welcoming Hanson's new
strategy for the 1990s. At the time Hanson's p/e ratio was falling and its
yield rose significantly above the market average. More recently, County
NatWest published a note in the UK recommending that investors switch from
BTR into Hanson. It believes Hanson is well placed geographically for an
early return to growth (with more than half of its pre-tax profits generated
from the US and two-thirds of its UK profits from tobacco).
But more importantly it says Hanson's emphasis on organic growth and
expansion of core businesses contrasts favourably with BTR's stated
intention to make more profits from acquisition and disposal. While this
goes some way to addressing the problem Hanson has in pulling off deals, the
new strategy only really works in the US, where most of Hanson's core
businesses are based. These are Peabody Coal; Cavenham Forests; the
aggregates business Beazer USA; Grove Industries, the largest hydraulic
crane manufacturer in the world; and SCM Chemicals.
In the last six months, Peabody Coal, for example, has made two selective
acquisitions: a coal mine and reserves from Southern Ohio Coal and Costain's
Australian coal mining business. The UK core businesses, Imperial Tobacco,
and building products operations, made up of ARC and London Brick, do not
offer the same opportunities for expansion. This was one of the reasons why
Mr Bonham was so keen to buy RHM since he believed he could create a new UK
core business with the potential for expansion.
There is also a further problem with the new strategy. Organic growth, even
topped up with relatively small deals such as last year's Pounds 351m
recommended takeover of the debt laden Beazer, is not enough to contine the
unbroken record of profits growth on the same scale witnessed since Lord
Hanson started the business 28 years ago. The group is expected to report
the first fall in full year pre-tax profits when it announces its results
next month for the year to September 30.
Six years ago LEK, on behalf of an independent Imperial Tobacco which was
facing a hostile bid from Hanson, produced an analysis of the group's
performance which argued that to maintain its rate of growth through
acquisition Hanson would have to take over a Pounds 10bn company in 1990.
'At some stage,' Imperial said, 'the music has to stop.'
Hanson's supporters in the City are hoping the group will retain its
opportunistic edge to prevent it becoming an eventual candidate for an old
fashioned Hanson style break-up.

FT  07 NOV 92 / UK Company News: BET sells US textile business for Pounds
42m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BET, the business services group, yesterday sold Initial USA, its US textile
services business, for Pounds 42m as part of an on-going programme to
dispose of loss-making subsidiaries.
The group said National Service Industries, the textiles company based in
Atlanta, Georgia, had agreed to buy Initial USA's 11 plants and 19 service
departments in the central and south eastern US for Pounds 37m.
BET, meanwhile, will retain Pounds 5m in notes from other companies which
had bought parts of Initial USA in recent years and which should mature in
the next three years.
The US disposal reflects BET's decision to streamline its five divisions and
portfolio of 110 companies following a collapse in profits last year.
Yesterday's announcement also marked the biggest BET disposal since it sold
Biffa, the waste management company, to Severn Trent in 1991 and was the
first disposal since BET's Pounds 200m rights issue in August, which was
designed to restore order to the group's balance sheet.
Although Initial USA broke even last year on a turnover of Pounds 58.5m, BET
said it had suffered further setbacks in the recession and the group decided
to sell the company to raise capital for reinvestment elsewhere.
'BET is redeploying its resources away from under-performing businesses
towards those with better potential for the group,' Mr John Clark, chief
executive, said yesterday.
'Initial USA was not going to meet BET's corporate performance standards
because it was not large enough to fully exploit its potential in the
industrial market of the US,' he added.
By comparison, National Service Industries (NSI) reported a Dollars 426m
turnover in the last quarter of 1992 with a net income of Dollars 20.9m.
The sale of Initial USA, however, did not signal moves to scale back BET's
other textile businesses in countries such as France, Belgium, Spain and the
Netherlands where it dominates the market in renting and servicing textile
products.
'This move should not be interpreted as leading to a withdrawal from the UK
and continental European textile rental market to which we remain fully
committed,' Mr Clark said.
The group, which expects to sell a number of smaller subsidiaries in the
coming months, said its disposal programme should be completed by the end of
next year.

FT  07 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Hoskins rebels step up bid to remove Hoars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REBEL shareholders in Hoskins Brewery, the Leicester-based real ale brewer,
yesterday stepped up their campaign to remove Mr Barrie Hoar, chairman, and
his brother, Mr Robert Hoar from the board.
In a letter to shareholders, Mr Richard Cattermole, leader of the dissident
group, said the company's trading record under the present management had
been 'appalling'.
Since joining the USM in 1990, Hoskins' net assets had fallen from Pounds
4.1m to Pounds 3.18m. Shareholders had received no dividends, and none could
be paid until a Pounds 272,000 deficiency on reserves was eliminated.
Mr Cattermole, chief executive of Ryan Elizabeth, a pubs and hotels
operator, strongly criticised the recent sale of nine pubs - 'the lion's
share of Hoskins' freehold land and buildings' - at a book loss of Pounds
484,000.
'At a time when other small regional brewers are busily purchasing premises
on reasonable terms, it is inexplicable,' he said.
There was no clear strategy for the future prosperity of Hoskins, Mr
Cattermole added. 'It is surely time for a change in the management.'
Mr Cattermole said that if he and his associate, Mr Jeremy Lea, were elected
to the board at an extraordinary meeting on November 18, they would seek to
reverse the company's decline and expand its outlets and beer sales.
Neither would draw any remuneration from Hoskins until pre-tax profits had
been increased from last year's Pounds 83,000 to Pounds 250,000, and a
dividend had been paid.

FT  07 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Arthur Shaw makes inroads into losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ARTHUR SHAW, which serves the building industry, continued in loss for the
half year ended October 4, albeit at a considerably reduced rate, and is
passing the interim dividend.
After exceptional charges, the pre-tax loss was Pounds 124,000 compared with
a deficit of Pounds 523,000 in the preceding six months and a profit of
Pounds 113,000 in the opening half of 1991.
Losses per share came to 1.03p. Earnings last time were 0.86p and an interim
dividend of 1.3p was paid - but no final.
Mr Gordon Pearson, chairman, said the cost savings that had been made fell
predominantly in the second half.
Turnover in the half year was Pounds 8.05m (Pounds 7.79m) and the operating
profit came to Pounds 99,000 (Pounds 202,000).

FT  07 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Unilever rises 9% to Pounds 571m in third
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group, edged
back from Pounds 11.09p to Pounds 10.80p yesterday in spite of a 9 per cent
increase in third quarter pre-tax profits to Pounds 571m, against Pounds
525m.
The decline marked disappointment over the company's performance in North
America, where operating profits dropped from Pounds 108m to Pounds 100m at
constant 1991 exchange rates.
However, analysts said the overall return for the period to September 30,
struck on sales 3 per cent higher at Pounds 6.1bn (Pounds 5.92bn) had been
respectable. Pre-tax profits for the nine months rose 10 per cent to Pounds
1.46bn (Pounds 1.33bn) on sales 4 per cent up to Pounds 17.7m (Pounds
17.1bn).
'In trading terms this is a reasonable result, nothing special, but
certainly nothing to be ashamed of,' said Mr John Campbell of County
NatWest. Mr Campbell was maintaining his forecast of Pounds 2bn for the year
to December 31, based on the stronger-than-expected performance from the
Latin American and Asian operations.
The disappointing return from the US during the third quarter was put down
to extremely difficult trading conditions and a switch to longer term
contracts with ensuing lower prices in Chesebrough-Pond's.
The company also said a strong US consumer products business had been offset
by difficult conditions in the industrial products sector.
The contribution from the Asian and Latin American companies jumped by 22
per cent to Pounds 121m. The increase was achieved by strong growth in the
detergents and personal products ranges. The Japanese business continued to
incur losses, although less than last year.
Europe contributed Pounds 385m, against Pounds 373m, despite tougher
conditions in its two biggest European markets - the UK and Germany.
Cold weather in the third quarter hit ice cream sales, which had been
particularly good in the second quarter.
Unilever cut net debt to Pounds 1.2bn, against Pounds 2bn the previous year.
Gearing at the end of the period stood at 19 per cent (34 per cent) and
interest costs were Pounds 26m lower at Pounds 47m.
Net profits in the three months, at constant exchange rates, were 6 per cent
higher at Pounds 346m. However, using rates current in each period, the
increase was 8 per cent to Pounds 350m.
Earnings per share rose 8 per cent to 18.77p (17.4) in the quarter and by 7
per cent in the nine months to 48.84p (45.82p). The company declared an
interim dividend of 5.2p (5.03p) for UK shareholders and maintained the
Dutch dividend at Fl 1.48.

FT  07 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Ashley tumbles Pounds 7.6m into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASHLEY GROUP, which is changing its year-end to December 31, reported a
plunge from pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.7m to losses of Pounds 7.64m for
the 12 months to August 31, while turnover grew from Pounds 389.9m to Pounds
422.6m.
A second interim dividend of 0.375p has been declared, bringing the total so
far to 0.75p. In the year to August 31 the total was 1.95p.
However, Mr James White, chairman of the group which has interests in food
distribution in Spain, window blind distribution and plywood, pointed out
that Pounds 6.67m of the losses were incurred in the six months to February
29, 'a period of considerable difficulty'.
He added that interest payable for the 12 months expanded to Pounds 5.21m
(Pounds 1.4m), and that in the first six months there had been an
exceptional charge of Pounds 2.81m - relating to restructuring and the
Pounds 593,000 golden handshake for Mr Tony Butler, the former chief
executive - against a credit of Pounds 2.15m previously.
Mr White said the group had made 'sensible progress' in the second six
months. The main problem remained Digsa, the Spanish food retailer, which
turned in trading losses of Pounds 2.97m (profits Pounds 6.96m) on turnover
up at Pounds 386.7m (Pounds 357.6m).
Two regions, Zaragoza and Andalucia, performed satisfactorily; Madrid and
Albacete moved into the black in the second half, but Catalunya continued to
make losses.
The window blinds side made profits of Pounds 4.31m (Pounds 6.72m) on
turnover of Pounds 34.8m (Pounds 30.5m). Although the margin on sales was
about 14 per cent, the Glasgow plant was only operating at 60 per cent
capacity because of the depressed housing sector.
Gearing stood at 90 per cent as debt grew to Pounds 34.6m, mainly through
the needs for working capital in Spain, though Mr White said that should
start 'throwing off benefit' soon.
Losses per share emerged at 6.8p (earnings 7.5p), though 5.3p of that was
attributable to the first six months.

FT  07 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Baldwin agrees bid for Simpsons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BALDWIN, the holidays, printing and properties group, has agreed an
all-paper bid for Simpsons of Cornhill, valuing the owners of the famous
City chop house at Pounds 1.68m.
But the offer was condemned by a group of dissident shareholders who tried
to oust the Simpsons board at an extraordinary meeting in September.
The offer - already accepted by the Simpsons board and stockbrokers Raphael
Zorn Hemsley, which together represent more than 54 per cent of the capital
 -will reunite two of Britain's leading restaurant executives: Mr Roy
Ackerman, chairman of Simpsons, and Mr Sandy Singh, chief executive of
Baldwin.
During the 1980s the two worked together as joint chairmen of the Kennedy
Brookes restaurant chain which was sold to Forte for Pounds 173m.
'It is our intention to create a major force in the restaurant, catering and
leisure sector,' Mr Singh said yesterday. His view was echoed by Mr Ackerman
who expects 'similar growth' once Simpsons becomes a Baldwin subsidiary.
Details of the bid emerged two days after shares in USM-traded Simpsons were
suspended following Baldwin's approach. It has offered one 10p Baldwin share
for every two Simpsons, and full acceptance will mean the issue of 2.28m new
shares, representing 12 per cent of the capital.
A spokesman for the dissident group, led by Mr Robert Klapp, former chairman
of Select Appointments, claimed the offer would represent a considerable
loss for investors who paid 50p per share in Simpsons' Pounds 2m float last
year. Simpson's shares closed at 33p.
The board was wrong to accept when other bidders, including a leading
brewery, were also interested in Simpsons, the spokesman added.
Mr Ackerman dismissed the dissident claims and said they presented no threat
to Baldwin's offer.
In a separate development, Mr Singh confirmed Baldwin would also buy Leading
Guides, the publishing company owned by Mr Ackerman.
The company, which publishes Egon Ronay guides, was formed earlier this year
after Alfresco Leisure publications, of which Mr Ackerman was also chairman,
went into receivership. Mr Singh said Baldwin would be paying up to Pounds 1
a share for Leading Guides.

FT  07 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Revamped Maddox moves back into black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MADDOX GROUP, the electrical products and computer maintenance concern which
this year has undergone substantial changes, moved back into the black in
the first half of 1992.
A pre-tax profit of Pounds 325,000 compared with losses of Pounds 83,000 for
the six months to September 30 1991 and Pounds 312,000 for the preceding
nine months period.
Results excluded any contribution from Wakebourne, the computer maintenance
and systems support group acquired in August, which had changed the focus of
Maddox.
Mr Hugo Biermann, chairman, said the provision of maintenance services to
particularly the corporate PC market in the UK, had proved to be
exceptionally resilient, with growth of over 20 per cent in the last five
years. Maddox therefore intended to continue its penetration of this market
 -particularly in the UK.
While the group's distribution markets were still affected by recession in
the UK and US, Wakebourne was trading in line with the board's high
expectations. Mr Biermann said that this, together with the further
refocusing of the business towards computer maintenance, would allow Maddox
to produce a satisfactory result for the year. First half sales were Pounds
9.55m (Pounds 183,000) and earnings per share came to 0.21p (0.35p losses).
There was again no tax.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Letter: Case for increased public-sector borrowing and pump
priming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LIONEL GORDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Although the government has re-stated its determination to keep public
spending in cash terms at or below the planned ceiling of Pounds 244.5bn in
1993-94 in order to contain the public-sector borrowing requirement, there
is a good case to be made for allowing this ceiling to be raised - by up to
Pounds 5bn or so.
Every person made redundant creates at least a triple drain on the economy -
less tax receivable by the exchequer, greater social cost and reduced
purchasing power. This in turn makes it less likely that desirable
expenditures on health and education can be maintained.
It follows that the first imperative for the government must be, not to
'kick start' the economy (an absurd and unrealistic notion), but to make
sure that expenditures are directed to the twin and related goals of
improving the infrastructure and creating jobs.
I question the desirability of any cuts in public spending in the current
situation. It looks as though the recession will be the longest this
century. For the sake of the future we should maintain expenditure on
education and health, and increase that on transport and inner cities.
Investment spending is likely to have fallen 1.5 per cent this year compared
with 1991. The outlook for 1993 based on intentions surveys is bleak. There
are no signs of pick-up in the housing market and consumer spending
continues to be held back by high levels of debt and uncertainty over the
future. The boost to exports from devaluation may well be muted by
difficulties in our overseas markets.
What is needed is an increase in capital spending programmes to stimulate
economic activity, particularly in the hard-pressed construction sector. The
effects on employment and consumer confidence would be positive and would
offset any negative impact on the PSBR.
Why is pump priming an acceptable way out of recession in Japan but not
here? If the objection is that the Japanese can afford it and we cannot, the
answer is to fund pump priming by increasing income tax. That would also
answer the inflationary objections to public spending by reducing the
possibility of inflationary pressure from personal sector spending - not
that there is much danger of that at present. The result of higher taxation
is more likely to be lower savings. To increase income tax would, of course,
be a U-turn, but what is one more change of direction after so many?

FT  07 NOV 92 / Letter: Houses now more affordable - but confidence needs
boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER JONAS and Mr RICHARD PETTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We take issue with your leader, 'Around the UK houses' (November 3),
when you say that 'relative to average earnings, house prices remain quite
high by historical standards'. According to the latest figures published by
the Nationwide Building Society, the ratio between average house prices and
average earnings stood at 3.1 in the third quarter of this year. This key
ratio has been falling steadily, along with house prices, since it peaked at
4.7 in June 1989.
At its current level, the price/earnings ratio is below its long-run average
of 3.3 times average earnings, and below its average over the last five
years of 3.9 times. On this measure, housing is more affordable now than at
any time in the last nine years.
The lower price/earnings ratio is a necessary - but not a sufficient -
condition for a recovery in the housing market. There is currently three
years' worth of pent-up demand from first-time buyers who have held back
during the slump. They lack confidence to invest in a market which has seen
cataclysmic falls in value - and which shows no sign of having reached the
bottom.
Decisive action is needed now from the government, fundamentally to rebuild
confidence. This will not be achieved now simply by tinkering with interest
rates.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Letter: Witness to increasing arrogance of the media
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NOEL A DE BERRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Returning to Britain after some years, Ian Davidson ('British patience
runs dry', November 2) finds himself shocked by the volume and the violence
of criticism to which the government is subjected and suggests Mr Major is
in a class of his own in the depth and intensity of media criticism of his
administration.
As an adult resident of this country for the last 40 years I, too, am
shocked at its continuing slide into acceptance of media manipulation of its
mind, and I applaud Mr Major, Mr Smith and Mr Ashdown for ignoring the
amazing accusations made against their everyday ability by those who purport
to speak freely for the electorate. It was refreshing recently to read in
your paper that Mr Lamont does not feel he has to read it regularly.
We are witnessing, in this country particularly, an alarming (for some) and
increasing arrogance among the media, which has an avarice for a new
sensation a day to keep it going.
Unfortunately, a large part of the community continue to feed the media by
avidly reading, listening and watching; and applauding, it would seem, that
very sentiment.
We are witnessing and are powerless; unless your good journal and one or two
other media quality disseminators awake to publish comment on this rumbling
coup d'etat to our leadership and our very constitution by those who speak
and wave their hands but are unable to govern themselves (or themselves).
They are a terrible band of brothers who maintain that 'freedom of speech'
means anybody can say almost anything under its banner, but whose main aim
is to increase their audience and own sense of well-being.
In Britain the time for anger certainly appears to have arrived and we might
start by not condoning such media activity, by not purchasing it and by
speaking out against it when it appears before us.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to your article on sponsorship 'How to get the best from your
patron' (October 24).
A key point missing from your list of dos and don'ts is that sponsors and
beneficiaries should share business goals and objectives.
Successful sponsorship emerges from the satisfaction of both (or all)
parties knowing that objectives have been fulfilled. A frank exchange of
business goals at an early stage can help identify mutual and individual
objectives and the allocation and agreement of relevant responsibility. An
informal partnership then arises which can only grow in strength, awareness,
image and return if regularly reviewed.
The potential for sponsorship of the arts is enormous if only all parties
involved share their visions and views, and combine their skills and
experience accordingly.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Project still stuck on the shelf: The British Library's new
building has a troubled history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Brian Lang, the eloquent Scottish anthropologist who is chief executive
of the British Library, is a frustrated man. The delay announced this week
to the opening of the library's controversial new building beside St Pancras
station in north London has led to a reprise of stories about the project
which portray it as another great British disaster.
Cost overruns, bad project management, architectural design criticised by
the Prince of Wales, protests from users who are reluctant to leave the
historic British Museum reading room in Bloomsbury - it has a familiar ring.
Now problems with the paint finish of 300km of moveable shelving will delay
the opening of the library - set five years ago for March 1993 - by at least
18 months. But while Dr Lang describes himself as 'desperate' to get into
the building, he is equally frustrated by the negative publicity for the new
library.
'The building is a bold project, imaginative and full of flair,' he says.
'It will be a centre of excellence when it is opened, and one that the
nation can be proud of.'
Yet almost since its inception, the new British Library has been dogged by
controversy and financial problems. Conceived in a 1971 white paper, the
plans have repeatedly fallen victim to pressure on public expenditure.
No sooner had the then education secretary Shirley Williams given the
go-ahead to the first phase in 1978, than a change of government and intense
pressure on public spending led to delays and budget cuts. When work
eventually started in 1982, money was so short that only half of the first
phase was begun, creating a building that would have been all but useless
had the other half not been completed.
Each year thereafter, the Office of Arts and Libraries (OAL), doled out
whatever money it had managed to wring out of the annual public expenditure
round. Hardly surprising, then, that a 1990 report on the project from the
National Audit Office suggested that this annual drip feed had wasted
resources.
The same report also found that the early stages of building had been dogged
by a bizarre project management system which could only have been tolerated
in a non-commercial environment.
The money for the new library came from the OAL budget, but was spent by the
Property Services Agency, the government's property maintenance and building
wing. The OAL and the Library were supposed to be involved in managing the
project through a committee which did not meet for more than three years -
leaving the OAL with little authority or control over the project.
This was not an unusual arrangement for big public works at the time, but
the inevitable consequence was steeply mounting bills. The first phase had
originally been costed at Pounds 116m, but no overall budget was set for the
project. By 1986, the government was sufficiently worried about the cost to
set up a review which for the first time set a ceiling on the whole project
of Pounds 450m.
Of this, Pounds 280m was for the first phase, 140 per cent more than the
1979 estimate. Much of this increase, according to the National Audit
Office, was caused by rising building costs in the London property market
(some of which might have been curbed if the whole project had been put out
to tender at a fixed price from the outset). The NAO found that the real
increase in the cost of this phase of the project was just Pounds 25m - a 20
per cent increase in real terms which stands comparison with cost overruns
in other big civil engineering projects.
Following the review, new management structures were put in place, including
the appointment by the OAL of a project manager from the private sector.
Responsibility for accounting for spending on the project was shifted from
the Property Services Agency to the OAL, to strengthen client involvement
and accountability (a change now extended to all large building projects).
But just as the government began to get a grip on the management of the
project, two new rows created public relations disasters for the move to St
Pancras.
The first was a broadside from the Prince of Wales against the design of the
new building by architect Colin St John Wilson. In the BBC Omnibus
documentary, A Vision of Britain, the Prince said that the new reading room
looked like 'an assembly hall of an academy for secret police', while the
Victorian Gothic wonder of St Pancras station next door looked more like
what a library should be.
The second was a campaign by a vocal group of academics and writers to
retain the magnificent reading room in the British Museum, used by Karl
Marx, W B Yeats and Bernard Shaw among others. The Bloomsbury reading room
is only one of nine in London offering access to the library's users, and
the desire to concentrate all activities under one roof had been a strong
motive for relocating the 18m books to a single building.
This cuts little ice with aficionados of the British Museum's vast dome,
such as Professor Ben Pimlott, whose biographies of Hugh Dalton and Harold
Wilson were largely researched under it: 'I have yet to meet a consumer who
is in favour of moving. The bureaucrats don't realise that study requires an
ambience as well as machinery. But it's not just the forced move from the
great rotunda into an oversized public lavatory: the service and facilities
in the British Museum are more than adequate.'
Dr Lang disagrees strongly, citing the superior service which the library
will be able to offer at the new St Pancras site. Users will have
computerised access to all the library's stock in one place, with delivery
of books to the user's desk within 30 minutes, rather than the 90 minutes
now typical at the museum reading room. While plans to triple the number of
reading room seats have been considerably scaled back by the need to find
economies, there will be ample space, he says, for all who need to use the
library.
More important, the new building offers much better conditions for
conserving the stock, which includes valuable heritage items such as the
Magna Carta. The current storage facilities are often unsuitable for
preserving the printed word, with condensation running down the walls of
some rooms.
'We are showing thousands of people around the new building each year,' says
Dr Lang, 'and the reaction is invariably that it is a marvellous building
which greatly exceeds their expectations of what it would be like.'
All the more frustrating, then, that problems with the shelving should have
led to this week's delay in opening. For, once the new building is opened -
probably at the end of 1994 - much of the criticism can be expected to melt
away. Until then, Dr Lang must reconcile himself to further bouts of
frustration as this long-running epic moves to its final act.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Trade war - what it means to you: David Dodwell answers the
questions arising from the crisis in the Uruguay Round of Gatt negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL

<TEXT>
1. What difference has the Gatt made to my daily life?
More than you realise. The rapid growth of world trade since the end of the
second world war - much of which was made possible as a result of reforms
negotiated under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) - has
played a critical part in boosting incomes, jobs and national wealth, as the
charts show.
The rise in trade doesn't just mean a wider variety of goods on the shelf at
Sainsbury or K-mart, it also means lower prices from producers, who have to
be more efficient because of the competition they face through open trade.
For companies, improved trading opportunities have led world economic growth
over the past four decades. More than 50 per cent of the UK output of ICI,
Courtaulds and British Aerospace is exported.
Successive trade rounds under Gatt have cut average tariffs on manufactured
goods from over 40 per cent in the 1940s to less than 5 per cent today.
2. How - and how successfully - has the Gatt policed world trade?
Perhaps the most important single contribution of the Gatt is 'national
treatment' embodied in its 'most favoured nation' (MFN) principle. What this
means is that any trade concession offered by one country to another must be
extended to every other country. So if the Ivory Coast were to cut all
import duties on, say, trousers imported from Mauritius, then it would be
forced by Gatt rules to do the same thing for trouser-makers in every other
country.
Its next critical role has been to act as an 'honest broker' if two
countries have a trade dispute. Without this, small countries - particularly
those in the developing world - fear they could be bullied into
disadvantageous trade arrangements by larger nations.
The failure of the Gatt to find a solution in the present US-European
Community dispute therefore creates a crisis which goes to the very heart of
Gatt's credibility. By declaring sanctions against the EC - initially of
just Dollars 300m, but potentially amounting to Dollars 3.7bn - the US is
serving notice that it has run out of patience with the multilateral dispute
settlement system provided by Gatt. If it and other countries now proceed
down the route of bilateral dispute settlement, the law of the jungle will
follow. 3. What is the 'Uruguay Round'? Why is it named after an obscure
Latin American country and why has the negotiation dragged on for six years?
Of the eight negotiating 'rounds' since the birth of the Gatt in 1947, the
Uruguay Round, launched in the coastal resort of Punta del Este in Uruguay
in 1986, is by far the most ambitious.
It has embraced previously taboo areas such as trade in farm products and in
textiles and garments. It has also for the first time made demands on
developing countries, calling on them to open their markets to trade in
services, and to enforce strict laws on patent and copyright protection.
It has involved an unprecedented number of countries - 105 as opposed to
just 23 signatories to the first 'Geneva Round'.
This helps to explain why the round has taken so long - though it is worth
remembering that the Tokyo round took six years to complete (in 1974-1979).
Another headache has been recession in the major industrial economies, which
has made it tougher for national negotiators to ignore protectionist
pressures from industrial and trade union lobbies at home.
Nevertheless, by the end of last year agreement was reached on most of the
subjects covered by the Round, in the so-called Dunkel draft, named after Mr
Arthur Dunkel, Gatt's director general. Agriculture was the most important
exception.
4. Why should I care about the Uruguay Round? What difference would it make
if it reached agreement and what would happen if it collapsed? Would it help
to end recession?
Some of the reasons for caring should already be apparent. By reducing the
subsidies paid to farmers in the EC and US, a successful conclusion to the
Uruguay Round would mean lower food prices. Sugar prices inside the EC are
about three times the world price, for example. The phasing out of the
complex Multi-Fibre Arrangement, which sets quotas, and hence prices, for
textile products, would also mean cheaper clothing.
A successful round would boost export opportunities for every one of the 105
countries involved. For industrial countries, agreement would particularly
help chemicals and pharmaceuticals exporters (who are wary of selling to
developing countries at present because of poor patent protection) and
service-sector businesses such as banks and insurance companies.
For exporters in the developing world, agreement would increase prices for
farm exports ranging from timber to tropical fruits, and new opportunities
for textiles and garment manufacturers.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris
estimates that a successful round would add about Dollars 200bn a year to
world trade. It is impossible to say how many new jobs that amounts to, but
the increased business would certainly help the international economy
recover from its current recession.
If the talks collapse, then these potential gains will be lost. But worse, a
tit-for-tat trade war would lead to higher tariffs, higher prices, reduced
sales, lost export opportunities and lost jobs.
5. Who would bear the blame if these negotiations were to fail? Would it be
the fault of the French? And what about the US and the other hundred or so
participants?
As far as farm trade is concerned, neither the US nor the EC is blameless,
but it is hardest to find sympathy with the EC regime and the EC's
protectionist attitudes. The US has, to its credit, been on the liberalising
side of the argument. The EC has been dragged kicking and screaming in that
direction. This is so even though the EC farm subsidy regime costs Europeans
as consumers and taxpayers around Dollars 120bn a year. The French are the
main beneficiaries of the status quo and have resisted reform most fiercely.
But the French have support from farm producers across southern Europe. The
German government can also be blamed for refusing to use its weight inside
the EC to force the French to compromise. 6. Why does farm trade matter so
much in these negotiations? Have all the other issues been resolved?
It is baffling that farmers - who account for less than 11m people out of
Europe's 340m population - can hold the rest of the population to ransom.
The reason is that powerful lobby groups and the composition of electoral
constituencies give the agricultural community an exaggerated influence in
Europe's democracies.
The French have argued that farm trade could be dropped from the package -
as it was in past rounds. This is not possible because developing countries
who are being asked to open up their markets to our banks and insurance
companies say they will only do so if the industrial north in turn opens its
markets to their farm products.
It is also important to remember that the US-European Community farm row is
only one of the obstacles to wider multilateral agreement. If a deal had
been found on US-EC farm trade, Japan or South Korea - both of which are
refusing to open up their markets to rice imports - might have frustrated
progress towards a multilateral deal. 7. Why does an economic superpower
like the US care so much about an obscure farm product like soyabeans?
Oilseeds - which include soya beans, sunflower and rapeseed - may seem
obscure, but they are critically important. We are all aware of them as
cooking oils, but they are also used in animal feeds, and as lubricants in
industry.
Nor is trade so small. The US is the world's largest OECD producer -
accounting for 63m tonnes out of world production of 86m tonnes in 1991. It
is also the world's biggest exporter, selling over 18m tonnes last year. The
EC is the world's biggest importer (14m tonnes last year), and so is a
much-coveted market for US farm exporters.
The oilseed is also important symbolically: EC subsidies to oilseed
producers mirror subsidies across the farm sector. As the dispute has
dragged on, with the EC defying two Gatt rulings which condemned its subsidy
regime as a violation of its commitment of the early 1960s to provide
duty-free access for soyabeans, the impasse has also come to symbolise the
shortcomings of the Gatt dispute settlement system. This threatens the
reputation of Gatt itself and the multilateral trading system it stands for.
8. What is a trade war and why would it matter to me? Which companies would
be most vulnerable?
Trade war is death by a thousand cuts. 'Punitive tariffs' on one product are
matched by tit-for-tat 'counter-retaliation'. They would then spread to
other products. The first signs would the disappearance of certain products
from the shops and higher prices. Then jobs would be lost as
export-dependent companies started to lose business.
9. Will the world divide into regional blocs and, if it does, would that
make the Gatt just four dead letters?
There is a danger this could happen. The EC and the North American Free
Trade Area are already clearly defined trading blocs. In the EC 62 per cent
of exports last year were between member states. There are also moves to
create trade areas in Asia and South America.
But these trading areas are no substitute for global free trade. In 1991,
the US sold 36 per cent of its exports to the EC and Japan. Japan in turn
relies on the US or the EC for 48 per cent of its exports. In short, the
world economy is too interdependent for regional trading blocks to provide
save havens from a trade war.
10. What difference might the election of Bill Clinton make to world trade?
The first result of Mr Clinton's election was to undermine the credibility
of the current team of US negotiators. Just when talks were at a
particularly delicate stage, the US negotiating teams of the past six years
found they were about to be replaced. It is uncertain what mandate they will
have to speak for the US in the hiatus before Mr Clinton becomes president.
It is even more uncertain whether Mr Clinton's incoming team will share
their priorities. A decision at this stage to inject new demands into the
Uruguay Round could well be ruinous.
Mr Clinton steered clear of trade issues during the election campaign.
Democratic Party aides say this was deliberate, to keep his options open.
They say he is a free trader in principle, but one cannot ignore that his
victory was underpinned by support from powerful protectionist interests -
among them trade unionists and environmental lobbyists.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Leading Article: The parochial strain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THE long economic recovery of the 1980s, in which capital flowed ever
more freely around the globe, it was always on the cards that the 1990s
would be a more introspective decade. Tuesday's outcome of the US
presidential election, fought by the victor Mr Bill Clinton almost
exclusively on domestic issues, confirms that prognosis; and the
all-too-plausible threat of a trade war between the US and Europe, now acute
after the resignation this week of Mr Ray MacSharry as European negotiator
for the Gatt talks, accelerates the trend. Even the supposedly communautaire
Mr John Major, after squeaking home in Wednesday's Commons vote, appeared to
succumb to the parochial tendency in his own ranks when he announced that
final ratification of the Maastricht treaty would be put back until after
the second Danish referendum next May - a curious way to celebrate a
victory.
In the week after Hallowe'en the ghost of 1930s bilateralism is on the
loose, political leadership is a questionable commodity and the world looks
prey to a mean-spirited impulse. Yet the markets seem wholly unbothered by
the darkness of the picture. With the outcome of the US election largely
discounted, Wall Street is still at heady levels and the dollar has been
cheering from the sidelines. While US long bond yields crept upwards over
the week on well-justified fears of looser budgetary policy under Mr
Clinton, the resulting fall in bond prices is precisely the opposite of what
happens when markets confront a 1930s-style slump. In Britain, meantime,
gilts were similarly buoyant after Mr Major's victory, reflecting relief
that the government had not been blown further off-course.
Gatt fall-out
The insouciance may be overdone, at least where trade is concerned. After
years of tortured haggling and the inescapable brinkmanship that accompanies
all trade negotiations, the Uruguay Trade Round is no more than a blur in
the markets' perceptions. Apart from a sudden fall yesterday in those French
stocks which were judged to be potential victims of US retaliation, the
fall-out from the row over farm trade has been negligible. Yet the odds have
shortened considerably on a mutually destructive, tit-for-tat transatlantic
trade war.
That said, the parallels with the 1930s are inexact. The Federal Reserve
could hardly be accused of pursuing a tight monetary policy of the kind that
throttled the US economy in the Slump. Mr Clinton, the fiscal activist, has,
so to speak, arrived early on the scene: Franklin Roosevelt, author of the
New Deal, did not replace Herbert Hoover until early 1933, well after the
introduction of the Smoot-Hawley tariff.
There is, moreover, a striking trend towards fiscal expansionism worldwide.
The Japanese, despite political uncertainties arising over the latest
bribery scandal, are still intent on a fiscal boost of unprecedented
proportions. Despite some warlike rhetoric before next week's Autumn
Statement on public expenditure, Mr Major's government is not fiscally
puritanical.
As for continental Europe, the slide into increasing fiscal deficit has been
one of the more striking characteristics of the 1990s. Indeed, it is the
German people's reluctance to pay for unification, and the resulting
budgetary consequences, that provides the underlying economic explanation
for the tide of discontent about Maastricht that has been sweeping across
Europe this year.
Sterling escape
Against a background of recession at home and slower growth in the rest of
Europe, Britain's escape from the disciplines imposed by the Exchange Rate
Mechanism looks more convenient by the day. Sterling is back in its old,
comfortable position between the D-Mark and the dollar; and with short-term
interest rates coming down, Britain has a steeper yield curve - increasingly
like the one that helped generate an annualised 2.8 per cent growth rate in
the third quarter in the US. Since the forward markets are already pointing
to sterling interest rates of little more than six per cent within the next
year, the pound is probably less vulnerable to falling rates than some have
feared.
But Britain could still find itself caught in the cross-fire if the European
Community is foolish enough not to disengage from the incipient trade war.
And for large British multinationals, Mr Clinton's arrival spells trouble of
a different kind. The present arbitrage whereby they borrow in the US to
invest at higher returns in UK deposits, thereby generating UK profits that
reduce their advance corporation tax bills, has already been hit by the
rising dollar.
Those same multinationals may now fall victim to Mr Clinton's attempt to
find new sources of tax to mitigate his budgetary problems. If there is good
news this week, it is that Mr Clinton brings a message of hope to the
American people; and the world needs its remaining superpower to be strong
and stable. The worry for the markets is that it will take so much time to
establish whether the president-elect is up to the job.

FT  07 NOV 92 / The talk of 'this town': The prospect of a new
Camelot-on-the-Potomac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time in what another politician in another country would call
a very considerable number of years, there is a sense of anticipation in
this town. Washington DC, the nation's capital, whose real name actually is
'this town', is ready, even overdue, for a change.
For 20 of the past 24 years, the social tone has been set by Republicans.
President Nixon made furtive looks and hidden tape recorders all the rage,
while President Ford brought back a taste for English muffins. The Reagans,
of course, were pure west coast glitz, reeking money, and the Bushes a
somewhat dowdier Yankee version of the same, and this town was comfortable
with both until the Bush administration began to fall apart. The only
interruption was Jimmy Carter, of whom this town will only allow that he is
the best former president of the lot, a testament not only to his good works
but to the fact that he does not live here any more.
Logically, the welcome mat should be out for the Clintons, because this is a
very Democratic place. It voted for George McGovern, Walter Mondale and
Michael Dukakis, and on Tuesday gave only 9 per cent to the man with the
Pennsylvania Avenue address and 85 per cent to somebody whose only local
connection was three years as an undergraduate at Georgetown University,
which perches charmingly over the trendiest part of town.
Politics may be the life-blood of Washington, but it is not the only legal
substance coursing through its veins. Alongside the 'plum' book, which lists
the 3,000-plus political jobs now subject to the patronage of the new
president, there is the 'blue' book, a compilation of the most socially
respectable people in this town. It contains lots of political movers and
shakers, but it also runs to hundreds and hundreds of grand dames, lawyers,
lobbyists and consultants and even, a testament to changing times,
journalist types. All combine mysteriously over dinner tables and cocktail
parties (though not, mercifully for the true insider, over breakfast) to
pass judgment on whoever lives in the White House.
Not all of the above are on the far side of 50 years old, and neither are
the Clintons and Gores. There are other affinities, too. Mrs Hillary
Clinton, for example, comes to this town as the first First Lady ever to
possess a post-graduate degree. Washington is full of successful career
women, especially in the law firms, where it is not uncommon to hear it said
that she is more qualified to serve as attorney general than was Bobby
Kennedy, appointed to the post by his brother. But the social arbiters would
be horrified if this were to happen, simply because this is not what a First
Lady is here for.
This town has also begun to work out that these are not fried
chicken-eating, beer-guzzling, country music-addicted 'hicks from the
sticks' who are moving in from Arkansas. In fact, unlike Mr Carter's
Georgian mafia, many are not from Arkansas at all and quite a lot of them
already live here. The common characteristic of all the many interlocking
networks the Clintons operate - covering Georgetown, Oxford, Yale, the
Democratic Leadership Council, the loosely formed FOBs ('friends of Bill'),
and the annual Carolinian retreat group known as Renaissance - is that they
are all mostly composed of successful, professional people.
Jesse Jackson once unkindly dubbed the DLC the 'Democratic Leisure Club'.
Merely watching the golf bags and the expensive matched luggage sets being
unloaded from aircraft at its annual convention in New Orleans last April
proved the Rev Jackson's point. They might like to talk politics and
policies all night, but they will do it over good wine and decent food.
They also have short hair. Jean-Marc, a veteran local hairdresser as Gallic
as when he came here 20 years ago, is unworried that his creative art might
thus be stifled. 'With ze Republicans, a few people 'ad a lot of money. I
want a lot of people to 'ave a lot of money.'
Most other local business people concur. This town's economy is no longer
insulated from the general malaise. Two old Washington department stores
have recently gone under and the real estate market is seriously sagging.
Good housing here might cost three times as much as it does in Arkansas, but
if the new cave dwellers are coming from Los Angeles, Boston and New York,
or if they are already here, they will not notice much of a difference.
There will be high expectations in other ways for the Clintons. Some
keen-eyed observers, picking up on Kennedyesque inflections in some of the
president-elect's recent speeches, have begun to muse about a new
Camelot-on-the-Potomac. Frank Mankiewicz, who was Robert Kennedy's press
secretary, pointed out yesterday to The New York Times that Mr Clinton went
to Georgetown and Al Gore to St Alban's, the exclusive local private school.
In contrast to the Carter crew, 'these are not people coming to town
scorning Washington, or afraid that they'll be scorned'.
Probably the great single arbiter of Washington taste will not be scorning
them. Mrs Pamela Harriman (born to a noble English family, formerly Mrs
Randolph Churchill, formerly married to Leland Hayward, the Broadway
producer, and widow of that great statesman Averell Harriman) is much more
than the most charming and grandest of dames. She has for years been one of
the most effective Democratic fund-raisers and has been in on the ground of
many important party deliberations.
In Little Rock on election night, she was an early and outspoken Clinton
supporter, to the extent that there is even gossip that she will be
rewarded, bringing her wheel full circle, with the ambassadorship to the
Court of St James.
But, she was quoted yesterday, 'I haven't waited to get a president for 12
years then to leave Washington.' With friends like her, Bill and Hillary
Clinton can expect a reasonable honeymoon in this town, at least until the
political wheel starts grinding again in earnest.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Fees of Pounds 1m a week 'a scandal'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEES charged by the accountants and lawyers involved in winding-up Bank of
Credit and Commerce International are amounting to about Pounds 1m a week,
Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, told the Commons
yesterday.
Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, who has headed the campaign on
behalf of BCCI depositors and staff, described the liquidators' fees as 'a
scandal'.
He said: 'They are becoming rich on the victims' money while the government
stands by and watches.'
Mr Nelson emphasised the importance of the liquidators, and said that it
would be improper for the government to 'lean on them' in any way.
To date, he said, the liquidators' fees and expenses had amounted to about
Pounds 69m.
The fees to date include Pounds 28m incurred before the winding-up order on
January 14 this year, and a further Pounds 48m incurred since then, Mr
Nelson said.
Legal authorisation has been secured for the payment of fees up to April 15.
Since then, the liquidators had drawn on account fees which had yet to be
formally approved, but with the authority of the court and with the approval
of the creditors' committee.
Mr Nelson added that legal and other professional fees amounted to some
Pounds 22m.

FT  07 NOV 92 / CBI postpones 'putting the boot in': Michael Cassell says
business wants action from the government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry assembles tomorrow in Harrogate,
sagging under the weight of recession, but with high expectations that the
government is about to put the flesh on the bones of its strategy for
growth.
Last November, delegates attending the CBI annual conference in Bournemouth
complained about 'two lost years' in the struggle for economic progress. A
year later their allegiances and patience are stretched to breaking point.
Industry's despair over an ailing economy cussedly refusing to revive has
been heightened by the damaging uncertainty of recent political drift.
As a string of cabinet ministers take their turn on the CBI platform, and
with the Autumn Statement only days away, they will be left in no doubt that
business leaders are not interested in hearing more political platitudes.
Mr Howard Davies, who will be addressing his first CBI conference as
director-general, says: 'We have told the prime minister and the chancellor
that we are not yet in a slump, but that we soon could be. We have reached a
critical point.
'Perhaps now is not the time to put the boot in, but we have to make clear
we expect immediate action. For them to do nothing is not an option. It
would be inconceivable.'
The CBI will use the conference to announce its plan for reviving the
manufacturing sector, the outline of which was put to the prime minister
last week. Beside specific recommendations for action, it sets out the
ground rules for a new partnership with government which the CBI believes
ministers have already started to embrace.
The CBI wants to see some evidence of the new approach from ministers
arriving in Harrogate. In particular, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, will find himself on the spot.
Business has watched him engage in what Mr Davies calls a 'pretty
half-hearted' attempt to make his department a more effective conduit
between government and industry - but the CBI expects much more.
'So far we have got a draft prospectus for a programme of one-stop advice
shops,' says Mr Davies. 'But has he won any important battles yet?' A
conference announcement of a substantive policy change would, he says, help
provide the answer.
The CBI is particularly anxious to pin down Mr Heseltine on the question of
his expressed intention to 'intervene before breakfast' and wants a precise
definition of what the minister means.
'We do not want interference all over the shop,' Mr Davies stresses. 'We
want a working partnership and a proper dialogue.'
He is encouraged, if sceptical, about the commitment from Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, to examine all policy proposals in the light of their impact
on industry.
'We hope the Treasury understands what he said,' says Mr Davies. 'It means
they ought to be ready to discuss public expenditure priorities and the
balance of taxation strategy with industry.
'We are not suggesting the CBI should take over the Treasury, but we need
the chance to go back to first principles. Traditionally, there has been no
discussion with industry; we simply do not meet.
'In the early stages of the latest public expenditure round the Treasury did
its usual number. 'Infrastructure? - forget it] Training budget - watch
out]' That attitude must change and we intend to shamelessly exploit the
chancellor's pledge.' Industry believes the Autumn Statement offers the
government a last golden opportunity.
Apart from a shift from current to capital spending, a clampdown on public
sector pay and a linked cut of 2 percentage points in interest rates, it
also sees the case for a supplementary package of proposals to stimulate the
economy further. Expectations at Westminster are that something may be on
the cards.
'The government has to cut through the cliches about the need for
confidence. It needs a high-profile, dramatic announcement which proves its
change of approach,' Mr Davies says.
Evidence of a change of heart, says Mr Davies, might soon include lower
electricity prices for large users, improved Exports Credit Guarantee cover
and some 'sympathy' on investment allowances. Tax cuts, he says, should be
off the agenda.
He also favours a specific initiative aimed at stimulating the housing
market, possibly involving cash for housing associations to buy repossessed
homes. Lower interest rates alone, he says, will not revive a market in
which buyers believe asset values will continue to fall.

FT  07 NOV 92 / MPs renew attack on Bank's role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENEWED demands were made in the Commons yesterday for the resignation of Mr
Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, for failing to
act early enough against Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
During a five-hour debate on Lord Justice Bingham's report on the BCCI
affair MPs on both sides of the House protested that Mr Leigh-Pemberton, by
continuing in office, had not accepted responsibility for the inadequacies
revealed in the Bank's discharge of its supervisory role.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton was condemned by Mr Alistair Darling, from the Labour
front bench, and by Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman.
Mr Terence Higgins, Conservative MP for Worthing and a former chairman of
the Commons Treasury select committee, also emphasised that there had been
'a serious failure' in the regulatory mechanism operated by the Bank.
Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, dismissed demands for
Mr Leigh-Pemberton's resignation, insisting that the governor had behaved
'in a wholly proper manner'.
He said Mr Leigh-Pemberton had demonstrated that measures had been taken to
meet the criticisms made in the Bingham report.
Mr Nelson again refused to accept that the government should take
responsibility for compensating depositors with BCCI and staff because the
Bank had not closed it before July last year. While the Bingham report
criticised the timing of the Bank's decision to force BCCI to cease trading,
it had not found negligence.
Mr Nelson reminded the Bank's critics that some BCCI depositors would have
preferred it to continue trading after July.
He said the Bank's 'prime responsibility' was to protect depositors and that
this would not have been achieved by 'premature foreclosure'.
Mr Darling said BCCI had regarded the Bank as a 'soft touch - and I have to
say indeed it was'.
He argued that either Mr Leigh-Pemberton should have accepted the
consequences and resigned, or Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, should have
told him to do so.
Mr Darling accepted that Mr Leigh-Pemberton might well have asked Mr Lamont
why he had not resigned over sterling's devaluation following its departure
from the European exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday. Problems were
arising because of the failure of anyone in the government to accept
responsibility for their actions. Mr Darling added that this failure was
'debasing public life'.
He claimed that if the same people responsible for the regulatory functions
of the Bank were to continue in their posts, the question bound to be asked
was: 'When will it happen again?'
He said that those who had suffered losses believed they were entitled to
compensation because Mr Lamont stated in July last year that he would be
prepared to consider it if the Bingham report showed that 'blame' attached
to the Bank.
Referring to Mr Nelson's emphasis on the fact that there had been no finding
of negligence, Mr Darling said: 'I challenge anyone to say that the Bingham
report says no blame attaches to the Bank of England.'
Mr Nelson rejected calls from both sides of the House to end the Bank's dual
responsibilities for supervising the banking sector and for the management
of the government's monetary policy.
He said that the separation of the two roles would involve a great deal of
administrative upheaval and loss of continuity.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Family companies put in receivership

<TEXT>
THE BUSINESSES of the Kumar brothers, which include an 84 per cent holding
in Birmingham City Football Club, a chain of high-street womens' clothing
shops and a Manchester-based wholesale clothing operation, have been put
into receivership by the liquidators of Bank of Credit and Commerce
International.
BRS Kumar Brothers - owned by Mr Bimal Kumar, Mr Ramesh Kumar and Mr Samesh
Kumar - owes Pounds 6m to BCCI, secured on the company's assets. The money
was loaned by BCCI to help finance the group's expansion during the 1980s.
After BCCI was shut down last year the brothers split their businesses,
setting up a company called Kumar Bros International. This now has a Pounds
30m turnover from womens' casual fashions and owns the chain of shops, which
stretches from Leeds to Sunbury, Surrey.
Leonard Curtis and Partners, a firm of accountants appointed joint receivers
of BRS Kumar Brothers earlier this week, has now also been appointed
receivers of Kumar Bros International.
A High Court hearing will resume next week over ownership of former BRS
Kumar assets to determine whether the receivers can pursue BCCI's claims
against the new company.
Mr Charles McMillan, Manchester partner of Leonard Curtis, said yesterday:
'It is claimed that in July 1991 BRS Kumar Brothers transferred all its
trading assets and some of its liabilities into Kumar Bros International,
leaving behind only the deeds to the properties and the shares in the
football club.
'We have been appointed to realise the assets of BRS Kumar, but this will
not satisfy the creditors in full. We will continue to trade the businesses
in order to best preserve the assets for all concerned.'
Staff at the companies' Manchester headquarters yesterday claimed the
businesses were not in receivership. Warehouse staff said they were unaware
of what was happening, but feared for their jobs.
The Kumars took control of Birmingham City in 1989, with Mr Samesh Kumar
becoming chairman.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Voluntary exodus from pits at 2,976
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of miners applying for voluntary redundancy has risen to 2,976.
It is believed that most of the volunteers work at the 10 pits earmarked for
early closure.
There has been a steady increase in the number of applicants since the
government's announcement of its redundancy programme on October 13. The
latest figure from British Coal compares with a total of 500 miners who had
applied by October 23 and 1,000 who had applied by early last week.
British Coal said last night that it was 'not surprised' by the latest
figure. 'By any standard it's a generous redundancy scheme which is on
offer,' it said. 'There are older miners in particular who appear to be
taking up the offer.'
However, it stressed that it was too early to establish any definite trend
and that the situation could change in the coming weeks.
The caution appears to be based on reports that British Coal is receiving
from local managers that the uptake of voluntary redundancies is tailing off
since the out-of-court agreement on Tuesday between British Coal and mining
unions. British Coal has given an undertaking that in considering
redundancies it will not discriminate against miners opting to remain in
employment during the 90-day consultation period.
Local British Coal officials and union representatives said yesterday that
the agreement had acted as a break on many miners who had enquired about
voluntary redundancy, fearing they would lose out if they waited until the
end of the consultation period.
There is still wide variation between areas. Officials of the National Union
of Mineworkers said that one of the main haemorrhages of the workforce was
at the South Yorkshire pit of Markham Main.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Copyright plans spark concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S broadcasters are to complain to the European Commission over a
planned change to a draft EC directive that they believe would discourage
film and television production.
The legal affairs committee of the European parliament this week accepted an
amendment that would mean that the 'authors' of an audio-visual work should
be its creators.
UK broadcasters believe that the decision means the main copyright owners in
a film or television programme would be people such as the director and
scriptwriter rather than, as at present, the producer and broadcasting
company.
Mr Mike Chattin, industrial relations adviser of the ITV Association, said
yesterday: 'This reduces the status of producers and broadcasters and
profoundly changes how copyright is exercised.
'It will discourage investment in programmes and co-productions and lead to
more programmes being acquired from outside the European Community.' The BBC
and Channel 4 as well as ITV are concerned.
ITV believes that the amendment would change the UK concept of broadcasting
copyright - under which producers and broadcasters are deemed to be the
authors and to have first copyright - to the French definition of
authorship. This definition includes people such as directors,
scriptwriters, adaptors and music composers involved in the creation of the
programme.
The amendment to the draft directive on harmonising the term of protection
of copyright was proposed by Mr Leon Schwartzenberg, a French Socialist MEP,
who suggested that the 'Anglo-Saxon' law which identified the producer as
author was 'unjust'.

FT  07 NOV 92 / 6m homeowners 'in debt trap'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MILLIONS of homeowners are trapped in debt and there can be no hope of a
consumer-led recovery until the government takes steps to help them,
according to a survey released today.
NOP Corporate &amp; Financial, a market-research company, interviewed 35,000
people for the survey.
It estimates that more than 6m mortgage holders are in the debt trap. Of
these 1.5m have negative equity, where the size of their mortgage exceeds
the value of their homes. The rest - 4.5m - are suffering from reduced
equity, where the price of their home has fallen since they bought it.
Those in the debt trap are mainly in the 25-45 age band and were formerly
the country's main spenders. They are unlikely to lead a consumer recovery
because they have less discretionary spending potential than before, the
survey says.
In 1988 mortgage holders were spending on average nearly twice as much as
non-mortgage holders on discretionary purchases (excluding groceries). Both
groups have reduced discretionary spending since then, but the survey finds
that mortgage holders have cut back more than non-mortgage holders.
Non-mortgage holders show a greater propensity to save than mortgage
holders. Savings account for about 13 per cent of their expenditure compared
with 9 per cent for mortgage holders.
Success in reducing the rate of inflation is a 'Pyrrhic victory', says the
report, given high real interest rates and low monetary growth, which have
squeezed recovery.
Job losses and fear of unemployment remain the main causes of consumer
caution, it says. It doubts the possibility of a consumer-led recovery
unless the government initiates measures to alleviate the debt burden,
particularly for those with negative equity.

FT  07 NOV 92 / BBC agrees promotion curb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC will today stop promoting its magazines by showing glossy 'moving'
advertisements and by mentioning them in programmes.
The corporation has given undertakings to Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate
affairs minister.
The BBC will now be allowed to promote its magazines only with 'still' items
between programmes.
The items will be limited to the name, price, publisher and availability of
the magazine. That information will have to be accompanied by a 'general
statement' about the availability of magazines with the same broad content.
The change follows a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report that said the
BBC's use of free airtime to promote its magazines had distorted competition
among food, cookery, television listings and gardening magazines.
The MMC called for an end to 'moving' promotional items and restrictions on
'still' ones. Mr Hamilton went further by saying that competing magazines
also had to be mentioned.
Mr Hamilton said yesterday that in view of the commission's concern he had
asked Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, to continue to
monitor the effects on competition of on-screen BBC promotion of its
magazines.
The MMC inquiry stemmed from an investigation by Mr John Sadler into
cross-media promotion.

FT  07 NOV 92 / EOC rebuffed in part-timers case: Appeal court curtails
legal role of commission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EQUAL Opportunities Commission has no right to bring judicial review
proceedings against the government, the Court of Appeal ruled yesterday. Mr
Alan Lakin, legal adviser to the commission, said: 'This severely undermines
our position.'
The court said the commission - which has a statutory duty to enforce the
law and to promote equal opportunities - should concentrate on assisting
individual women to take cases through the industrial tribunal system, and
play an 'advisory' role to government.
The statement is a blow to the commission's strategy of mounting legal
challenges on issues which it believes affect large numbers of women.
The Appeal Court's statement came in a ruling, by a 2-1 majority, upholding
a High Court decision to reject a challenge by the commission to the
government over the rights of part-time workers - 90 per cent of whom are
women.
The EOC argued that the government was failing to comply with European
Community obligations to protect part-timers from less favourable treatment
than full-timers, particularly in relation to redundancy and unfair
dismissal.
Lord Justice Kennedy and Lord Justice Hirst agreed the challenge had not
been properly brought. Lord Justice Dillon disagreed, saying he would have
granted a declaration that the UK was in breach of Treaty of Rome
obligations and European law by providing less favourable treatment of
part-time employees working between eight and 16 hours a week.
The judges unanimously rejected the commission's claim that the criteria for
the calculation of redundancy pay discriminated against part-timers. The
commission was refused permission to renew its challenge in the House of
Lords. It is considering whether to appeal to the Lords directly.
The ruling means that, under national law, an employee working fewer than
eight hours a week remains ineligible for redundancy pay or unfair dismissal
compensation.
A full-time employee working 16 or more hours a week qualifies for
redundancy pay and compensation for unfair dismissal after two years of
continuous employment, while someone working between eight and 16 hours
takes five years to qualify.
Part-timers who have previously worked full-time are not given any credit
for periods of full-time work when their payments are calculated.
The commission failed to persuade the appeal court to intervene on the
grounds that all of this was contrary to Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome,
which lays down equal treatment for men and women at work, and the EC's
directives on equal pay and equal treatment.
The commission said the majority decision that the organisation had no legal
right to seek judicial review in this type of case was 'disturbing'.
Mr Lakin said: 'The commission believes its duty is to act on behalf of this
group of women by preventing them from having to go through lengthy,
expensive and stressful proceedings.'
The commission believes judicial review is the most efficient use of its
small legal budget of about Pounds 600,000 a year.
Last year it used judicial review proceedings to establish that women
serving in the armed forces may not be sacked for becoming pregnant.
The Department of Employment said: 'We have always argued that these
regulations are necessary to preserve job opportunities for women and to
minimise the burden on business.'

FT  07 NOV 92 / Shipper forces lower port tariff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATLANTIC Container Line yesterday forced lower charges on Mersey Docks and
Harbour Company in exchange for an agreement to keep using the Port of
Liverpool for four years.
Bilspedition, ACL's Swedish owner, wants to sell the loss-making shipping
line.
The deal includes Hapag Lloyd, with which ACL has a five-year cargo sharing
agreement. Other shipping companies have been making similar agreements to
try to counter the downturn in transatlantic trade.
ACL hopes more shippers will take space on its vessels to take advantage of
the lower charges. It says this should bring more volume to Liverpool to
help compensate for lower unit revenue.
Neither ACL or Mersey Docks would say how much Liverpool has had to drop
prices to keep its position as ACL's sole UK port for its weekly service to
the north American ports of Halifax, Nova Scotia; Portsmouth, Virginia;
Baltimore, Maryland and New York.
Mr Wieger Koornstra, ACL's executive vice-president, has negotiated lower
prices with Gothenburg in Sweden and is in talks with Le Havre in France. He
said there was an imbalance in cost-sharing between shippers and carriers
which could not go on.
Liverpool hopes partially to offset its tighter deal with ACL by exploiting
the port's developing role as a transatlantic hub redistributing cargoes to
and from the Iberian peninsula, the eastern Mediterranean and West Africa.
Mr Trevor Furlong, Mersey Docks managing director, said securing an ACL
deal, in the light of the recession and uncertainty, was critical to the UK
manufacturing industry - 45 per cent of which is within half a day's drive
of the port.
The port has reduced turnround time for trucks to 40 minutes to ensure
companies as far south as Coventry minimised transport costs. ACL's five
57,000-tonne container ships are each turned round within a single tide.
Mr Koornstra said the seaborne transatlantic trade balance favoured the US
with 20 per cent more eastbound cargoes.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Merged ITV group to shed 292 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MERGED ITV company Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television yesterday announced
the loss of 292 jobs, nearly a quarter of the combined workforce of the two
north-east of England television companies.
The company, formed in a merger earlier this year, said the job losses -
spread among engineering, administrative, facilities, programme-making and
house-services staff - would eliminate duplication of functions at its Leeds
and Newcastle upon Tyne bases.
Mr Ian Ritchie, deputy group chief executive and managing director of Tyne
Tees, said the 292 redundancies comprised 174 at Yorkshire, 115 at Tyne Tees
and three among sales staff in London.
He added that the job cuts were 'the end of it' as far as the restructuring
was concerned. 'The sole reason for this particular situation was the
merger,' he said. However, he could not promise that there would be no
further job losses among the 947 remaining employees.
The joint shop stewards committee at Yorkshire TV said: 'We are bitterly
disappointed that the company sees the need to reduce staff by so many at a
time when its order books are full, and at a time when YTV-made programmes
are enjoying very successful runs on the network.'
Yorkshire TV's agreed Pounds 30.4m takeover of Tyne Tees was approved by the
Office of Fair Trading and by shareholders in August. This created the
third-largest independent television company, after Thames and Central.
Yesterday's job cuts should save more than Pounds 8m a year, leaving aside
the one-off costs of redundancies. Although 25 programme-making jobs will
go, the company insisted that safeguarding programme quality was a prime
consideration.
It said it was investing Pounds 10m in new transmission arrangements,
programme development and enhancement of news, and would also boost its
network programme development budget.
The rationalisation includes the introduction of single transmission
arrangements, based in Leeds, for commercials. A single facilities division
and network programme operation will be created.
Casualties include the Yorkshire props department and Newcastle upon Tyne
canteen staff.
A total of 150 jobs are to go at Lonrho Textiles plant at Cramlington,
Northumberland, it was confirmed yesterday, Chris Tighe writes.
The company said the job cuts were being made to maximise the benefits of a
Pounds 24m investment over the last four years in new technology and
equipment.
The Cramlington site, a wholly owned Lonrho subsidiary employs 950 people
and specialises in production of household linens.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Lloyd's defers pressing its claims on Names / A look at
reaction to the insurance market's decision to bring in a six-month
moratorium on writs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S NAMES reacted with a mixture of consternation and confusion
yesterday to the insurance market's decision on Thursday to defer issuing
any new writs in pursuit of outstanding debts.
Mr Peter Middleton, the London market's new chief executive, says that no
more of the 3,500 letters sent to Names establishing their debts would be
converted into writs until April next year. Lloyd's says these debts total
about Pounds 360m.
He says the extra six-month moratorium would allow Names - the individuals
whose assets underwrite the market - more time to cope with 'temporary
insolvency' and to liquidate their assets without making such substantial
losses. A total of 549 of these Names have already paid what they owe since
receiving the letters but the news makes no difference to almost 200 Names
who have already been issued with writs.
Mr Richard Peacop, a Name with a writ, says: 'This is totally cynical. Six
months' delay is neither here nor there. It still leaves your neck hanging
over the block.'
In a letter to Mr Michael Freeman, a solicitor representing many Names
taking action to resist paying their cash calls, Lloyd's stressed yesterday
that its decision was designed to give more time to Names who had just been
notified of their debts. It was not a general amnesty affecting others who
have been aware of demands for longer.
The first legal action - a summary judgment in the commercial courts - is
not expected until March. Other appeals, including one to the European
Commission, will take considerably longer.
By the time the six months are up, Mr Middleton says that many other things
will have changed. Two panels he has created - one on open years and another
on errors-and-omissions policies, covering market indemnity - will report by
early next month and efforts 'significantly' to reduce the cost base of the
market will already be well under way.
Names already facing legal action are concerned that those given more time
will turn their backs and not offer funding and support to groups fighting
Lloyd's. They also believe there is a moral obligation on other Names to
help them, since any judgment will set a precedent which applies to them
all.
Mr Philip Dinkel, vice-chairman of the writs response group, which is
helping to co-ordinate the legal defence, remains confident that the cases
can nonetheless be effectively funded - and won.
Mr Freeman warns that, without additional financial support, preparation of
the defence cases could be jeopardised as the costs escalate.
Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, who met
Mr Middleton with four MPs just before the public announcement, remains
convinced that the new chief executive has generated a U-turn in the
approach of Lloyd's to Names.
Mr Middleton, by his own admission, is performing 'a juggling act'. He must
delicately balance the interests and human tragedy of Names against both the
needs of policyholders to be paid and the long-term reputation of the
market.
He already takes heart from a decline in the number of resignations from
membership, at 1,351 so far this year out of a total of 34,000, compared
with 3,166 by the same time last year. The number of new Names joining this
year is just 50.
One suggestion is that recent reports of mental stress and suicides have
propelled motivated Lloyd's into taking action. One Lloyd's Name killed
herself recently in Wales and Mr Fred Yeo and Mr Charles Bailey, two
Canadian Names, also took their own lives in recent weeks.
'It's tragic,' says Mr Middleton. 'We are human beings and we are affected
by what has happened. We are trying to do everything we can to help those
Names.'
Mr George Pakozdi, a dentist living in Toronto, Canada, who is a member of
the Lime Street members agency and knew both Canadians who committed
suicide, says he is convinced they were driven to suicide by pressure for
repayments from Lloyd's.
He adds: 'They had been healthy, well-adjusted men, but they could see no
future. There isn't a day that goes by when you don't get something from
Lloyd's. It seems it will never end. I hope something comes from their
sacrifice.'

FT  07 NOV 92 / Talks on Ulster's future move closer to collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS ON Northern Ireland's political future moved closer to collapse
yesterday with little agreement between the participants - and with apparent
last-minute difficulties over procedural arrangements.
A scheduled plenary session of all the participants failed to take place.
Instead Sir Ninian Stephen, the independent chairman, met heads of
delegations and said that no plenary would take place until Tuesday.
Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the unionist leaders, have said
that they will walk out of the talks after Tuesday, in effect marking the
end of the process. They object to the calling of an Anglo-Irish Conference
meeting the following week.
Sir Ninian is believed to be trying to draw up a 'heads-of-agreement'
document to salvage something from the talks process which started in April.
But the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party insists that such a
publication must have a meaningful content.
Another possible cause for the delay is that the unionists could have argued
that the calling of a general election in the Irish Republic undermines the
mandate of Irish ministers attending the talks.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, will make a statement to the
Commons when the talks end.
He has spoken of an 'intermission' before talks can be restarted, but it is
unclear how quickly unionists will agree. They want the 1985 Anglo-Irish
Agreement ended and agreed to talk only because its workings, including the
Anglo-Irish Conferences, have been suspended.
The Irish government is seeking an agreement which would in effect 'bridge'
the Anglo-Irish Conference meeting on November 16, and allow time for the
Irish election to take place and a new government to settle into office.
Only a brief outline of possible new institutions for Northern Ireland has
been agreed. Unionists and nationalists are far apart on the powers that new
institutions should have.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Hurd explains 'Euro-lunacies'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCARE stories about the European Community's actions or intentions are often
given screaming headlines in the British media while positive accounts about
Community action of real benefit to Britain are given little coverage, Mr
Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said yesterday.
Mr Hurd said in a speech in his Witney constituency that the EC was often
used as a whipping boy for the sins of others. Bureaucrats in local and even
central government frequently blamed unpopular regulations on imaginary
edicts from Brussels.
Mr Hurd listed three types of such stories. 'Euro-myths', he explained, were
amusing anecdotes which had no basis in fact. He gave as examples the
'Euro-lavatory', which was supposed to limit the amount of water that
cisterns could flush, and the banning of home-made jam, round cheeses and
the wearing of hairnets by fishermen. All these were false.
'Euro-scares' resulted from a misunderstanding of what had been agreed and
'Euro-lunacies' were genuine examples of unnecessary or intrusive Community
rules.
Some 'Euro-scares' arose from early EC proposals which were then amended or
where 'we subsequently negotiate sense into a directive', Mr Hurd said. One
example was the supposed EC move to ban flavoured crisps. The abandonment of
such proposals was seldom mentioned in the media.
Among the 'Euro-lunacies' Mr Hurd listed Community rules on maximum noise
limits for lawnmowers and cucumber norms which decreed that they should be
of a certain curve and colour.

THE High Court will rule on Thursday on whether the Mail on Sunday newspaper
committed contempt of court by disclosing details of the deliberations of
the jury in the Blue Arrow fraud trial.
Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney general, has asked the court to find Mr Stewart
Steven, its then editor, Mr Clive Wolman, city editor, and the newspaper's
publishers, guilty of contempt.
Mr Steven said in a sworn statement read to the court: 'I believed the

about the merits of jury trial in serious fraud cases at a time when
proposals were being made for replacement of such jury trial.'

FT  07 NOV 92 / Postal union backs 3.5% deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UCW postal workers' union is to recommend acceptance of a pay increase
for more than 140,000 postal and clerical workers that will increase the
Royal Mail's pay bill by 3.3 per cent, Lisa Wood writes.
If it is accepted this will be the first pay deal among public-sector
workers at less than the inflation rate. The deal is back-dated to October 1
and will stretch into the next financial year when the government is likely
to want a severe curb on public-sector pay rises.
The offer gives a basic pay rise of 3.5 per cent but the overall effect on
the total wage bill is lower because not all elements of pay are increased
by this.
The same offer is being recommended to the Royal Mail's 4,500 engineers.
Lecturers at new universities and colleges of higher education last night
accepted a pay increase of 3.9% and agreed to call off industrial action,
the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education said.

THE GOVERNMENT'S public-spending figure to be announced in next week's
Autumn Statement will not, after all, be Pounds 244.5bn - but that is not
because of another U-turn.
The cabinet had agreed to keep to the planning total for 1993-94 which was,
in July, stated as Pounds 244.5bn, but technical changes have meant the
figure has been revised, probably downwards.
The Treasury insists that the revision is merely due to changes in the way
in which particular items are classified.
Such modifications happen every year, but they are not usually highlighted
because the planning total is almost always exceeded. In the past few years
these technical revisions have raised the planning total by about Pounds
5bn.
This year the revision is an embarrassment to the government as ministers
have allowed the Pounds 244.5bn to become a symbol of the cabinet's
determination.
The Treasury had recognised that there was a political risk in allowing the
figure to become so well established, but officials advised that the change
would be too complicated to explain.
Any variation from the set figure while the discus-sions on spending were
continuing might also have suggested either a lessening of resolve if it had
been higher, or unnecessary cuts if it had been lower.

FT  07 NOV 92 / India blames foreigners for scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE CHAIRMAN of an Indian parliamentary committee, probing the Rs35bn
(Pounds 800m) Bombay securities market scandal, yesterday accused foreign
banks of starting the affair, warning they risk retaliation.
'We should seriously think whether they (foreign banks) should be allowed to
operate in the country and, if so, at what point and under what
circumstances,' said Mr Ram Niwas Mirdha, a former minister who has spent
three months investigating the affair.
He is the first high Indian public figure to condemn foreign banks over the
scandal, which has lead to about 20 arrests, caused heavy losses at leading
financial institutions and brought the resignation of a cabinet minister.
Mr Mirdha's views indicate that his committee's report this year will
strongly criticise foreign banks. That in turn could prompt demands for
sanctions against the banks. While the administration of Mr Narasimha Rao is
committed to opening up the Indian economy to foreign companies, a
deep-rooted suspicion of multinationals, including banks, pervades India.
Mr Mirdha said foreign banks had 'become the initiators of massive
violations of rules and regulations.'
Foreign banks had doubts about some of their activities. But instead of
asking regulators for advice they went to legal advisers 'to cover up their
tracks', said Mr Mirdha.
He added that 'lax all over' supervision by the Reserve Bank of India, the
central bank, contributed to the scandal. The affair suggested the
government should first install a 'proper regulatory framework' before
trying to expand and liberalise the financial markets.
'The policy of greater market-orientation of the Indian economy cannot work
if the market and market-related institutions are not strengthened,' Mr
Mirdha said.
His committee has heard that four foreign banks - Citibank and Bank of
America of the US, as well as Britain's Standard Chartered Bank and ANZ
Grindlays of Australia - dominated inter-bank securities trading. They
accounted for two-thirds of trade in the 14 months before the scandal
erupted. They have been accused of abuses including flouting guidelines on
forward trading, on handling cheques and on portfolio fund management.
The next few weeks could see intense argument over the affair as MPs prepare
for the opening of the winter session of Parliament on November 24.
None of the banks were available to comment yesterday on Mr Mirdha's
remarks.

Parliament gave the pro-reform government of Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka
an important victory yesterday, authorising higher sales taxes and deeper
spending cuts in a year-end budget revision, AP reports from Warsaw. The new
1992 budget was passed with an eye on regaining IMF support for Polish
economic reforms, endangered by a gaping budget deficit. The revised budget
widened this year's permitted deficit to Zl 82,000bn (Pounds 3.5bn), nearly
7.5 per cent of gross domestic product, instead of the 5 per cent previously
promised the IMF. But without the changes, the budget gap would have been Zl
20,000bn greater.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton yesterday made his first move since winning the US
presidential election on Tuesday by naming Mr Vernon Jordan and Mr Warren
Christopher to head the transition team managing the formation of his new
administration.
Mr Jordan, a lawyer, civil rights leader and former head of the National
Urban League, will chair the transition team, with Mr Christopher, who
served as deputy secretary of state in the Carter administration, in charge
of day-to-day operations.
Both men helped Mr Clinton with the selection of Senator Al Gore as his
vice-presidential running mate, and their appointment to lead the transition
team, in preference to some more overtly political aides such as Mr Mickey
Kantor, chairman of the Clinton campaign, is viewed as a signal that the
president-elect aims to take a pragmatic, issue-oriented approach to
governing.
Mr Christopher said the first priority was to set up an orderly process for
the selection of Mr Clinton's cabinet, which will take office following his
inauguration on January 20 next year.
He expected economic policy posts to be the first filled, reflecting the
initial priority of the new administration. Consideration would also be
given to forming an economic council similar to the existing National
Security Council.
Mr Clinton, who spent yesterday nursing his ailing voice and continuing his
telephone conversations with world leaders, has said he plans a 'laser'
concentration on the economy.
Senator George Mitchell, leader of the Democratic majority in the Senate,
added yesterday that he expected an economic programme in the first 100 days
of the new administration.
Mr Christopher, who has been suggested as a possible secretary of state or
attorney general, said he assumed his role in the appointment of the
government would rule him out for any prominent post in the future
administration.
He said he would not assume the same exclusion for other members of the
team, which will include Mr Kantor, Mr Henry Cisneros, former mayor of San
Antonio, former governor Madeleine Kunin of Vermont, and Mr Mack McLarty,
chairman of the Arkansas-Louisiana Gas Company.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Yeltsin struggles to calm N Ossetia flare-up: A week of
ethnic bloodshed that is the first outbreak on Russian soil since
perestroika
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WAY they tell it in the regional capital of Vladikavkaz, the trouble
started when an Ossetian tank accidently ran over and killed an Ingush boy.
As with ethnic conflicts everywhere, one thing led to another and now, a
week later, scores of Ingush houses have been set alight by the Ossetian
majority.
The week of bloodshed, the first on Russian soil since perestroika gave
birth to ethnic conflict in the Soviet empire, has produced shock waves both
in the mountainous region and Moscow.
Russian president Boris Yeltsin is trying to fend off hardliners who say
matters are spiralling out of control in Russia. Pre-emptively, he has
deployed 3,000 elite troops and police, suspended the north Ossetian
government and imposed rule from Moscow.
But on Thursday, when a new truce was supposed to be in effect, black smoke
rose in columns above burning Ingush homes in the district of Okyabrskaya,
in the Vladikavkaz suburbs.
The current fighting will eventually be stopped but the Moscow-backed
crackdown looks likely at this point only to push the well-armed Ingush
fighters underground and produce a guerrilla conflict in Russia's southern
belly.
In Vladikavkaz, local officials concede there is little if any room left for
compromise. 'They should be done away with once and for all,' said north
Ossetia's interior minister, General Georgy Kantimirov, of the Ingush
fighters. 'When we have no armed bandits around we will be able to keep the
peace.'
The conflict is territorial. The Ingush are pressing an ancestral claim to
part of north Ossetia - the Prigorodny region - plus half the capital of
Vladikavkaz. Stalin expropriated the land from them in 1944, saying the
Ingush had collaborated with Nazi Germany.
The Ossetians naturally object to such a transfer of their territory and
assert their own reading of the region's ethnic history. They say that
Russian Cossacks were there before the Ingush.
The stakes for settling the conflict soon are high, both in Moscow and the
Caucasus.
If Mr Yeltsin cannot demonstrate the ability to quell such trouble, he may
not only strengthen the hand of his hardline critics but also lose face with
the restive minorities of the federation's many other autonomous regions
squirming to escape Moscow's grip.
North Ossetia is only the latest hotspot in the explosive Caucasus region
and Russian officials fear the upheaval there could worsen.
Russia already has trouble in three autonomous republics there - Chechenia,
Ingushetia and north Ossetia - and is trying to broker a peace in fighting
between Georgia and its region of Abkhazia.
Meanwhile, the undeclared four-year war between Armenia and Azerbaijan has
deepened.
Mr Yeltsin, though he claims only to want to get between the combatants,
appears to have taken some risk by effectively siding with one Russian
republic - north Ossetia - over another, Ingushetia.
There already have been accusations that Chechenia, which is awash with
weapons, is giving arms to the Ingush.
The president of Chechenia, Mr Dzokar Dudaev, is openly hostile to Moscow
and in the past often made calls to arms against Russia.
There appears to have been no fighting so far in Vladikavkaz itself other
than a shoot-out on Thursday night among comrades on the Ossetian side in
the local Intourist Hotel in which several people were wounded.
In the surrounding district of Prigorodny, almost all the fighting has been
carried out by the north Ossetians, who have automatic rifles, bazookas and
some armour.
The Russian troops have established a puzzling kind of buffer-zone. Some
main roads are completely open to traffic while others contain numerous,
tightly-held roadblocks.
The Russian troops mostly stand around nervously near their armoured
personnel carriers as the bullets and artillery fly.
They do not seem to have orders to fight. A few days ago, the Ingush
attacked Russian interior ministry troops and, depending on who you speak
to, seized between two and 10 Russian armoured personnel carriers.
In one clash, the Ingush destroyed an APC with a bazooka, according to a
Russian task force spokesman. Dozens of Russian soldiers have been taken
hostage and an undisclosed number remain with the Ingush.
No-one knows how long the fighting will go on. Mr Yeltsin said his force
would remain one month, but the Russians in Vladikavkaz do not seem very
optimistic about the outlook for peace.
'Some families will keep these mental scars for the rest of their lives,'
said Mr Sergei Shoigu, Mr Yeltsin's deputy administrator in Vladikavkaz.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Brazil to raise Dollars 15bn in new taxes to combat
inflation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Brazilian government yesterday unveiled a long-awaited fiscal reform
package to raise Dollars 15bn through new taxes as a key part of its battle
against inflation, now running at more than 1,000 per cent a year.
The project, which involves constitutional amendments and requires
congressional approval, is aimed at covering a Cr110,000bn (Dollars 12bn)
hole in next year's public finances and at combatting mounting tax evasion
which has seen tax revenues fall 25 per cent in real terms over the last two
years.
The new economics team plans to show this to the International Monetary Fund
at the reopening of negotiations next month in an attempt to rescue a
Dollars 2.1bn standby agreement which has lapsed because of failure to meet
targets.
The principal new taxes to be introduced are:
a 0.25 to 0.3 per cent tax on all financial movements including cheques
a selective tax on fuel, electricity, cars, tobacco, beverages and telephone
calls
a 7 per cent aggregated value tax on the final price of products and
services.
These replace a tax on financial operations and a tax on industrial products
as well as various social security contributions and profit taxes which
companies have been challenging in court.
Half of all revenue raised through the new taxation scheme will go towards
financing domestic debt, and states and municipalities will be banned from
issuing new debt titles up to the year 2000.
The government also pledged to pay a 147 per cent increase to pensioners.
The project must be passed this year if the new taxes are to come into
effect in 1993. Officials admit their chances are slim because of limited
time before the Christmas recess.

<TEXT>
A CONSULAR Catch-22 has been set up for Bosnian war refugees seeking passage
to the UK. Enquiries were already flowing in to the tiny British embassy
located above a clothes shop in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, yesterday
after the announcement of visa requirements for most citizens of the former
Yugoslavia.
Holders of Croatian - or Slovenian - passports are not affected by the
measure. But Croatia currently has on its hands an estimated 332,000
refugees from the seven-month old war in Bosnia-Hercegovina, more than any
other country outside Bosnia itself.
The problem is that the British embassy is not being authorised to issue
visas. Those who missed the deadline by not starting their journeys before
midnight last night are recommended to apply for visas in Vienna or
Budapest.
And the problem with that is that the Austrian and Hungarian authorities,
themselves finding it difficult to cope with the large number of displaced
people, now require that entrants should be in possession of a visa to a
third country to gain admission. Some hopefuls evidently thought the issuing
of UK visas might provide an extra possibility for overland travel, but they
were rapidly disabused.
The measure was announced on Thursday by Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK home
secretary, in order to stop an 'uncontrolled flow' of migrants.
Britain is however offering to take 150 detainees, a figure which, including
dependants, could increase to about 600.
A UN official said this was 'not all that good, either' in comparison with
some other countries' efforts.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, some 7,000-10,000 heads
of families need to be moved from camps in Serb-held areas of Bosnia.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRESSURE on president-elect Bill Clinton to unveil a fiscal stimulus
early next year increased yesterday as disappointing jobs figures indicated
the economy was barely growing.
The Labor Department said the jobless rate fell marginally last month, to
7.4 per cent from 7.5 per cent in September. Non-agricultural employment,
however, grew by only 27,000, not enough to offset sharp falls in preceding
months and a derisory figure in an economy with 110m employees.
What little job growth there was, moreover, occurred mainly in service
sectors such as health care. Manufacturing employment dropped 56,000 last
month, raising the number of factory jobs lost since May to about 225,000.
The poor figures prompted speculation that the Clinton administration might
unveil a double-barrelled fiscal package early next year with immediate
measures to stimulate the economy, such as an investment tax credit,
balanced by spending curbs in later years to reduce the budget deficit.
Such a package would be crafted to cut upward pressure on bond yields, which
have risen significantly since polls first indicated a Clinton victory.
Mr Clinton, however, has offered few clues to his economic intentions since
his election victory, other than pledging to 'focus like a laser beam on the
economy' and to avoid measures that would disrupt market forces.
There was speculation yesterday that the Federal Reserve might cut
short-term interest rates again before the end of the year, if the economy
remains sluggish.
Economic signals remain mixed. Earlier this week spirits were lifted by a
rise in factory orders, an increase in the Purchasing Managers' Index and a
fall in weekly claims for unemployment insurance to the lowest level for two
years.
Recent weeks have also seen tentative signs of higher loan demand.
Yesterday's employment report, however, was a reminder that consumer
confidence is low because the unusually sluggish recovery is creating only a
trickle of new jobs.
Monthly employment gains in the 200,000-300,000 range would be expected in a
normal recovery.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Italy embarrassed by leak of plans for privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Giuliano Amato, Italy's prime minister, has called in magistrates to
investigate the leak of a highly confidential draft document outlining the
government's privatisation plans just days before they are due to be
delivered to parliament.
The proposals, revealed on an Italian news agency on Thursday evening,
suggest that Ina, the big state-owned insurance company, and Banca
Commerciale Italiana, controlled by the IRI state holding company, could be
privatised next year, along with a number of smaller holdings.
Other companies on the list include Italtel, the IRI-owned telephone
equipment group, and IRI's stake in Banca di Roma, now Italy's biggest bank
in terms of branches.
The plan also envisages sales of government holdings in a variety of
industries, such as food, retailing and telecommunications, where it
recommends the retention of minority stakes and guaranteed control, possibly
through a 'golden share'. Sales or international alliances for some other,
unspecified state-owned companies which are in poorer financial shape will
have to await further restructuring, according to the plan.
The privatisation document has been prepared by a team of six eminent
bankers and economists, backed up by two top civil servants in the treasury.
After being submitted to Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, the plans
were sent to Mr Amato, and circulated to the budget and industry ministers.
The leak, which is widely regarded as accurate, is an acute embarrassment to
the government. In spite of some limited leaks earlier this week, it has
managed to keep the lid on the privatisation proposals.
Leaking the proposals, which are much more specific than originally
expected, has already upset many executives of state-owned companies, who
have been surprised to find themselves on the privatisation list. Consob,
the country's stock market and companies watchdog, has also intervened, as
many of the companies concerned are already partly quoted. Yesterday share
prices of many of the companies concerned rose sharply.
Mr Amato is expected to meet Mr Barucci, Mr Franco Reviglio, the budget
minister, and Mr Giuseppe Guarino, the industry minister, for urgent talks
today, before discussion of the proposals in cabinet next week. Barring
further upsets, the document should be ready for parliament by the
government's November 14 deadline. According to the plan, the sales should
reduce the budget deficit by L7,000bn (Pounds 3.2bn) in 1993 and L20,000bn
in 1994-1995.
The privatisation proposals were immediately criticised by Italy's three
trade union federations because of feared job losses and a lack of
consultation. They also attacked the way the information was leaked.
The leak has also rekindled speculation of sharp differences between
ministers about privatisation. Mr Guarino is believed to be particularly
unhappy about elements of the plan and to have revived his now discredited
concept of creating a 'superholding' company to control public-sector
holdings as an alternative proposal.
The government has maintained that no action will be taken before the
document has been debated fully in parliament.

distinguishing himself in 1991 as the chief architect of a peace settlement
in Angola.
A lawyer who belonged to an extreme-left Maoist party during his student

In a report released before trade talks next week between the EC and Korea

The report said cars imported into Korea cost up to 41 per cent more than

imported cars worth over won 70m (Dollars 76,700). No Korean-made cars were
liable for this tax and Korea's car exports to the EC were exempt from duty
because of its developing nation trade status.
The Korean barriers are not confined to tariffs, the report protests. It
cites paperwork delays of up to five months, lengthy and obstructive vehicle
emissions and noise testing and lengthy customs delays as being among other
obstacles.
The report reflects concern of Europe's car makers at rapidly rising sales
volumes being achieved in the EC by South Korea. In the first nine months of
1992, Korea exported 563,330 cars to the EC while only 593 EC-made cars were
sold there.

A FEDERAL appeals court in Chicago has rejected an important 1991 ruling by
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that restricted the rights of US
television networks to earn big profits from the syndication of prime time
programmes.
The court decision could play havoc with the politically sensitive issue of
who earns the most from the Dollars 5bn annual market for the resale of
television shows.
Last year the FCC ruled the networks could own and syndicate, domestically
and abroad, 40 per cent of programmes.
That was a partial victory for the networks because they previously could
not syndicate anything domestically. The ruling followed a 20-year period in
which Hollywood studios which made the programmes were in a stronger
position as they had the exclusive resale rights.
Both the networks and Hollywood decided to appeal. The networks argued they
should be given the right to resell 100 per cent rather than just 40 per
cent of the shows while Hollywood argued the networks should not have any
rights.
The Chicago court ruling sent Wall Street analysts scrambling to interpret
its possible future financial impact. It remained unclear whether the matter
would continue in the courts, lead to a new FCC decision or be treated at a
political level once the Clinton administration takes office.
'The whole question is a football and when it bounces it could bounce in any
direction,' said Mr David Londoner, media and entertainment analyst at
Wertheim Schroder, the investment bank.

MRS Gro Harlem Brundtland, prime minister of Norway, last night resigned as
leader of the Labour party.
Her unexpected departure is likely to switch the party's focus from the
internal dissent, which has swelled to unprecedented proportions in recent
months, over the government's inability to stem a continuous rise in
unemployment, which now stands at a post-war record of 7.6 per cent.
Mrs Brundtland delivered her decision to 300 delegates at the Labour party
congress who had gathered in Oslo on Thursday to rewrite their political
manifesto.
The congress will end tomorrow after voting on whether Norway should reapply
for membership of the European Community. The country has applied on three
previous occasions, but in 1972 rejected membership in a bitterly divisive
referendum.
Although the proposal for EC membership is expected to be accepted, it has
alienated some regional party members, particularly in the north, where
unemployment is highest and where fears run deep over threats that
membership is said to pose to the region's main livelihoods of fishing and
agriculture.
Labour has suffered a sharp decline in popularity, partly because of its
record on unemployment and the likelihood of a vote in favour of the EC.
In an opinion poll published by the Oslo newspaper Aftenposten yesterday,
24.6 per cent of those asked supported the party, its lowest figure since
the 1920s. Two years ago, more than 40 per cent of those asked supported the
party.
Labour also now faces the task of naming Mrs Brundtland's successor,
although she had earlier pointed out the qualities of Mr Thorbjoern Jagland,
who was expected to be named vice-leader.
Mrs Brundtland said she had not discussed the resignation with even her
closest party allies, but based it on family reasons.
Her son committed suicide last month. Most of the Norwegian media did not
report his death, out of respect for Mrs Brundtland's privacy. However, she
stayed away from the public eye for only a week before returning to what
appeared to be business as usual.
'I can no longer be both the leader of the party and prime minister at the
expense of my family,' she told delegates in an emotional state she has
rarely demonstrated in public before.
Many of the delegates shed tears at the announcement but publicly stated
respect for her decision.
Mrs Brundtland has for 12 years led the Labour party through a
transformation which her critics claim takes it far from the ideology on
which it was founded.
She was elected party deputy leader in 1975 and became chairwoman in 1981.
She has been prime minister three times. In 1981, she was appointed by her
party. Her government lasted seven months until Labour was swept away in an
election wave of conservatism.
She returned to power in May 1986 when a Conservative-led coalition
resigned, but she resigned after setbacks in the 1989 national elections.
She formed her third government two years ago, after a centre-right
coalition collapsed.

THE British government decision to postpone final ratification of the
Maastricht treaty was greeted in Germany yesterday with alarm and dismay.
Senior officials fear that it will cast a new shadow over next week's
planned summit between Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, and Mr John
Major, the British prime minister - just when Anglo-German relations had
started to revive in the wake of sterling's withdrawal from the European
exchange rate mechanism.
'If the British are making their decision dependent on the second Danish
referendum, it is totally wrong,' one official said yesterday. 'To make the
future of Great Britain dependent on some emotional Danish voters is silly
and irresponsible.'
German dismay is clear for three reasons. In the first place, the British
decision will make it more difficult to insist that there shall be no
renegotiation of the Maastricht treaty to meet Denmark's objections.
Second, it will actually relieve the pressure on Denmark to vote in favour
of the Maastricht treaty when it finally comes to a second referendum next
year, because it will no longer be the last EC member left to ratify.
Third, it may stoke popular doubts within Germany about the treaty, and
strengthen demands to abandon the idea of a single European currency to
replace the D-Mark, or to have a referendum. Mr Kohl is absolutely
determined to resist both moves, but they are a severe embarrassment.
The German government put out a careful statement yesterday, expressing its
'regret' at the British decision to postpone ratification, because it would
mean that the treaty would not come into effect on January 1, 1993, as
intended.
At the same time, Germany politely but coolly welcomed the restated British
determination to implement ratification of the treaty during 1993.
For its own part, 'the federal government remains determined, like other
member states, to finalise its ratification process - as foreseen - by the
end of this year', according to Mr Norbert Schafer, the deputy government
spokesman.
The first suggestion of doubt about that aim was voiced by Mr Gunter
Verheugen, the Social Democrat chairman of the joint parliamentary committee
set up to ratify the treaty. He said the British decision should start a
full debate on whether the aim of European union remained realistic.
'We cannot simply carry on regardless,' he said yesterday. 'At least we
should have some clarity over whether European union is still realistic. The
British decision means that Britain is dependent on finding a solution for
Denmark, and there is no solution in sight.'
The delay should be used to canvass for wider popular support for the
treaty, he said, bearing in mind German opinion polls showing a growing
minority casting doubt on the ambition of European union.
Nevertheless, Mr Verheugen said he expected the German Bundestag to stick by
its ratification timetable, and complete the process before the Edinburgh
summit in December.
Mr Karl Lamers, foreign affairs spokesman for Chancellor Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union (CDU), was adamant that there must be no wavering on the
part of Germany. 'If we start to show uncertainty, it would be a
catastrophe,' he said.
'As for Britain hiding behind Denmark, it is simply not right. It is not
worthy of your country. Britain should be giving Denmark the lead, not the
other way round.'

DANISH politicians yesterday welcomed the British decision to delay
Maastricht ratification as strengthening Denmark's bargaining position in
talks over its future relations with the EC.
However, the British delay may sharpen other countries' dilemma over the
concessions which can be negotiated to try to clinch a Danish Yes in a new
Maastricht referendum next year.
'This emphasises that a solution to the Danish problem must be found,' Mr
Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, foreign minister, said yesterday.
Mr Ivar Norgaard, chairman of the Folketing's Market Affairs Committee,
indicated that, with two members failing to ratify until next year,
Denmark's negotiating hand would be strengthened. 'It puts pressure on us
all to reach an agreement ..and it puts the other countries in a position
where the alternative they face is an arrangement for 10 countries only, so
I think it is an advantage for us,' Mr Norgaard said.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen has visited London, Bonn and Paris this week to present
the Danish demands for special arrangement.
The demands are contained in a position paper backed by seven of the eight
parties in the Folketing.
The foreign minister said yesterday he has repeatedly heard that the Danish
requirements, if met, mean the treaty would have to be reopened.
'We have to point out that this is not what we want, and there is agreement
on this in the market committee,' he said.
The foreign minister said the government wanted political agreement for
special Danish EC arrangements in place before the end of the year.
'All that will be missing then will be the technical arrangement to make it
possible to submit legislation to the Folketing,' he said.
After that another referendum could be held on the treaty, in a bid to
correct the No delivered in June. Mr Ellemann-Jensen said, however, the
government had not promised the UK government a referendum could be held in
May.
'We have said that a referendum in May is possible, and that it is unlikely
to be any earlier. But this depends on whether there is an agreement on
Denmark's future in the EC,' he said.
The four key requirements are that Denmark should be free not to participate
in European defence policy; not to implement the third phase of the EMU; not
to implement co-operation on police and legal issues on a supra-national
basis; and not be committed to introduce union citizenship.

<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday voiced dismay at UK Prime Minister John Major's decision to
put off parliamentary ratification of the Maastricht treaty until after a
second Danish referendum next May.
The delay was 'very worrying' said Mrs Elizabeth Guigou, the European
affairs minister.
It risked undermining 'indispensable dynamism' in the whole process of
ratifying the treaty on monetary and political union in Britain and Denmark,
said Mr Daniel Bernard, foreign ministry spokesman.
'A more rapid British ratification would without doubt create a happy
dynamic to help the Danes ratify,' he said.
The foreign ministry accepted that Britain was entitled to some flexibility
on the timing of Maastricht ratification, but officials were privately
annoyed that Mr Major appeared to have withdrawn an assurance to President
Francois Mitterrand that the Maastricht bill would pass through parliament
by early next year.
Britain's delay is doubly irritating to Mr Mitterrand, for whom European
construction has been a constant priority. He took the biggest political
risk of his career by putting the ratification of Maastricht to a referendum
in September, in which victory was slim enough to inflict further damage on
an already weak and divided ruling Socialist party. Another dose of suspense
over the future of the treaty will hardly please the French president and
could well provide fresh ammunition for opponents of Maastricht in the
finely balanced French electorate.

FAILURE by the EC to signal soon its serious intent to reduce oil seeds
production may bring on a second wave of punitive US tariffs on both farm
and industrial products worth up to Dollars 700m (Pounds 451.6m).
Mr Steve Yoder, chairman of the American Soyabean Association, which made
the complaint at the heart of the trade action, said the administration had
decided to disrupt world trade as little as possible but 'to slowly send the
message that we are serious about the EC reforming its oilseeds policy'.
In announcing the Dollars 300m in 200 per cent tariffs on Thursday, Mrs
Carla Hills, the US trade representative, also published a list of
industrial products which could be targeted for the second phase in the
trade confrontation. The US claims damages of at least Dollars 1bn for lost
oil seeds sales. If the next tranche of punitive tariffs goes forward, the
additional sanctions will be placed on a Dollars 2bn list of farm products,
published last June, and a new Dollars 1.7bn list of EC industrial products.
The new 'hit list' includes tyres, perfumes and toilet waters, paper and
paperboard, ceramics, glassware, tubes and pipes, records and tapes, and
furniture.
'This government doesn't want trade war,' said Ms Carol Brookins, a
Washington agriculture consultant. 'But if there is counter-retaliation by
the EC, we could jump quickly into raising the stakes.'
The administration has scheduled a 30-day period of comment by potentially
affected industries on the new list of industrial goods.
Public hearings are scheduled for December 7. However, the whole public
comment period could be waived if the EC announced retaliatory measures,
according to Ms Brookins. In that case, the sanctions would be applied
forthwith.
Mr John McInespie, a trade analyst with a Washington law firm, said higher
tariffs on tyres could badly hurt German companies as well as the Goodyear
plant in Luxembourg. New tariffs on ceramics would hit hard Italy as well as
France and potteries in England.
'The Americans were quite clever in this,' Mr McInespie said. 'There are
American alternatives for every one of these (proposed targets). The
American consumer won't be even remotely inconvenienced.'

FT  07 NOV 92 / Trade War Fears: Gloomy Delors sees his star falling -
Lionel Barber sums up an awful year for the European Commission's battered
president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES DELORS has long been riding for a fall.
Imperious, intelligent, and unusually sensitive to criticism, Mr Delors has
made plenty of enemies during his near eight-year stint as president of the
European Commission. Toward the end of the 1980s, when his influence reached
its peak, Mr Delors could see off most challengers - even Mrs Thatcher.
But 1992 has been an awful year for Jacques Delors, a succession of
political crises within the European Community which culminated this week in
an squalid public row with one of his own Commissioners over the breakdown
of the Gatt world trade talks.
Mr Ray MacSharry, the Irish agriculture commissioner, has long been gunning
for Mr Delors. A blunt-spoken man with a healthy dose of personal political
ambition, Mr MacSharry is a skilled negotiator who was convinced that he
could reach a deal with the US on reducing farm subsidies - the single
biggest obstacle to a Gatt agreement.
Such a deal would have capped Mr MacSharry's four-year term as agriculture
commissioner, surpassing his own considerable achievement last May in
securing agreement between the EC member states to reform the Common
Agriculture Policy (CAP).
CAP reform, which will substantially reduce future EC farm production, was
in Mr MacSharry's mind the only basis on which there could be a deal with
the Americans.
The reason for this week's explosion is thus easily grasped: Mr MacSharry
believes Mr Delors - by allegedly interfering in the negotiations - is not
only acting as a surrogate for his native France, but is also questioning
the very CAP reform which he supported earlier this year.
Mr Delors declared himself 'outraged' by the charges of sabotage in London
yesterday. Privately, he has told close colleagues that he definitely
supports CAP reform and that he has never had any intention of undermining
Mr MacSharry in his role as one of the EC's top two Gatt negotiators.
At the same time, however, he is understood to be adamant that the outgoing
Bush administration has not made sufficient concessions on farm exports, and
that he would abstain in a future vote in the European Commission on a Gatt
deal on the present terms.
He may not have instructed Mr MacSharry to this effect, but he will
doubtless have made his feelings known.
Charges that Mr Delors is a French surrogate are overblown. He cites, for
example, his decision last year to abstain rather than support the
Franco-Italian bid for DeHavilland, the Canadian aircraft maker, which was
blocked by the full Commission. However, critics say this was an easy
choice: his vote was never going to be crucial because there was already a
blocking majority in place.
There is little doubt that Mr Delors is on some issues reflexively
anti-American. When he talks about the need for 'adolescent Europe' to be
able to say 'No to Big Brother',(America), he sounds as if he has just
finished reading Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber's Le Defi Americain  - but as
one Brussels wit put it yesterday: 'It is not the American challenge we
should worry about, it's the Japanese.'
The recent troubles in the Community, which began last June when the Danes
rejected the Maastricht Treaty on European Union, have undoubtedly led to an
eclipse in Mr Delors' power and influence. Once known as 'Mr Europe' because
of his personal role in prompting the creation of a single European market
and the effort to forge a single European currency, he has been eclipsed as
national leaders in Europe have gone their own separate ways.
Equally, his star has fallen as doubts have grown about the prospects for
monetary union for the Twelve. 'He must be asking himself: 'Was it all a
great mistake?'' says one Brussels diplomat.
The drift within the EC has led to a period of intense frustration. Mr
Delors feels marginalised. He would like to force leaders to discuss the
really important issues such as the need for a pan-European economic growth
package, further financial support for the poorer states to entice them to
stick to the path of fiscal rectitude - the so-called Delors II package.
Mr Delors has also reverted to his old habit of 'shooting from the lip'.
Last week, he issued a blunt warning to Denmark that it could not expect
legally binding exemptions from the Maastricht treaty. This week, he took
the unusual step on Dutch radio of naming Mr Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch
prime minister, as his preferred successor - even though his own term does
not expire until 1994. Such talk has provoked rumours that Mr Delors may be
about to quit.
Close aides say that Mr Delors feels bruised, but he is not about to leave
his post. Others who have spoken to the Commission president in the past few
days describe him as 'right up against the wall, his own wall'. By this they
mean his own sense of frustration at being turned, unfairly, into a
scapegoat for all the Community's ills.

AMERICA'S wine importers were in a state of shock yesterday after the US's
announcement on Thursday night of a 200 per cent tariff on European white
wine imports. The measure, if enacted, would treble the price of an average
bottle of French white wine, from Dollars 9 to Dollars 27 (Pounds 17.40).
Although California wineries stand to gain, in the short term, from the
effective exclusion of European white wines from the US market, they too are
hoping for a swift resolution of the trade dispute.
'This is not a positive development for the American wine industry,' said
the Wine Institute in San Francisco, a trade group representing California
wine producers.
The US wine-makers fear retaliation from Europe, which
is their principal export market. Last year, Dollars 49m-worth of
Left: checking white wines at a vineyard near Macon. France is seen as
intransigent.
American wines were sold in the EC, most from California.
The European white wines covered by the proposed import tariffs represent
about 7 per cent of the total US table wine market, according to the Wine
Institute.
If the tariffs are imposed, US wineries might increase their domestic sales,
but this could be balanced by a loss of sales in Europe if the EC
retaliates, the industry group fears.
But an aide to Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, yesterday held
out the prospect that the wine tariff - 90 per cent of the Dollars 300m
punitive package unveiled by the US - could yet be lifted before it takes
effect on December 5.
The decision to target white wines was aimed mainly at France, which has
average annual exports of Dollars 125m to the US. The French are viewed by
Washington as the most intransigent in the current round of trade talks.
But the US tariffs would have a devastating impact on Italian white wine
sales, which last year were Dollars 115m, and to a lesser extent on German
sales.
The decision to hit European white wine exports rather than red wines or
champagnes was made because Washington is trying to maximise the
persuasiveness of the tariffs on the EC while minimising the impact on US
interests.
In other words, US white wine is a more palatable alternative to European
whites than is US red wine. US champagne production is also minimal compared
to that of France.
The anguish of wine aficionados was evident yesterday. In New York, Dr Lucio
Caputo, president of the Italian Wine &amp; Food Institute, said he was 'very
scared'.
Mr Michael Aaron, the owner of Sherry-Lehman, a leading new York wine
merchant, said calls for white wine were pouring in yesterday morning. He
said a number of distributors could go bankrupt as a result of the decision.
One US official, in a jocular mood, said: 'Think of this as an educational
opportunity to get to know the delights of wines from California's Napa
Valley.'

FT  07 NOV 92 / Trade War Fears: British business upset by threat of trade
war - John Major is being urged to use his influence to end the stalemate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry reflected the widespread concern of UK
companies and warned of serious repercussions for UK business of a
full-scale trade war.
A CBI spokesman said expansion of world trade was now a top priority for
economies attempting to escape recession. A tariff war was 'the last thing
we need', he added.
The CBI particularly highlighted the threat to investment and employment
from a collapse of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). It
drew attention to the reported closeness of both sides in the negotiations
and urged them to reach agreement 'before it is too late'.
The British Chambers of Commerce said Mr John Major, the prime minister,
should use his EC presidency to call an extraordinary meeting of the council
of ministers.
'The breakdown in trade talks could prove to be one of the last nails in the
coffin of business confidence. It is vital, therefore that John Major uses
every influence to try to break the log-jam,' a spokesman said.
The US is Britain's third largest export market, after Germany and France,
worth more than Pounds 10bn annually. Britain is the highest overseas
investor in the US, with accumulated assets of Pounds 140bn.
The CBI also emphasised the inevitable knock-on impact of targeted punitive
tariffs. While the first proposed tariffs were directed mainly at French
products, the UK was also likely to suffer because of its involvement in
shipping, insurance and packaging sectors.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders echoed CBI concerns: 'We want
this solved as quickly as possible, because these situations can escalate
out of control literally overnight,' said Mr Roger King, head of external
affairs.
'We are watching the position very closely and we are still not sure that it
is going to happen.'
The first round of measures threatened by the US were aimed at French and
German wine, said Mr King, but the motor industry feared tyres might be hit
by later measures.
Some big car producers in the UK - Ford and Vauxhall - are subsidiaries of
American corporations, while Jaguar, the UK luxury car maker which exports a
substantial part of its output to the US is also a subsidiary of Ford.
'It would be strange if the US tried to have an impact on its major
subsidiaries in the UK motor industry by making their life difficult in this
country,' said Mr King.
The textile industry expressed hopes that it could escape punitive action.
Mr Colin Purvis, secretary-general of the British Apparel and Textile
Confederation, said: 'We deplore the fact that agriculture, which accounts
for 10 per cent of world trade, has been allowed to hijack the Gatt talks.'
He said textiles were not in the immediate firing line but if a trade war
developed every sector of industry was at risk. Clothing and textiles
accounts for about 5 per cent of world trade.
Mr Camille Blum, director general of Comitextil, which lobbies for European
textiles manufacturers in Brussels, said: 'The dangers are that when you
begin a trade war, you do not know where it will finish.'

FEARS that Japan will be the next to feel US trade wrath have inspired the
agriculture ministry to request that the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (Miti) tone down a statement supporting the US action against the
EC.
Miti has 'sympathy' for frustrated US trade negotiators on the troublesome
issue of oil seeds, while the agriculture ministry worries that Washington
will use similarly tough tactics to force Japan to open its rice market to
imports.
But officials at both ministries share a concern that the ruling Liberal
Democratic party (LDP) will be unable to react coherently to the trade
issue, as the party is stricken by a brawl within its largest faction and by
a fresh batch of allegations about its leaders' dealings with gangsters.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, had a telephone conversation
yesterday with US President-elect Bill Clinton, and later told the Japanese
parliament that he hoped his administration will be no more protectionist
than the Bush administration.
Mr Miyazawa and the Japanese government have tried to take a low profile
during the dispute between the US and EC, as no Japanese politician wants to
be remembered for presiding over the opening of the country's rice market.
The reluctance to get involved in the agriculture debate has frustrated
officials at Miti, which would like Japan to make an early offer on rice,
but the delaying of rice negotiations has delighted the agriculture
ministry, which is responsible for protecting the interests of politically
influential farmers' groups.
Officials at the two ministries said yesterday that a full-fledged trade war
would serve nobody's interests, though the agriculture ministry senses that
it will be under extreme pressure if the US and EC resolve their
differences, and attention turns to Japan.
'We are very neutral. We are not on the EC side or the US side, but we are
concerned by the tactics used by the US and we are worried they will try the
same thing against us. You can really see the powerful influence of US
farmers' groups,' a senior official at the ministry said.
Miti officials generally support the US action, though a public statement
from the ministry was altered after the Agriculture Ministry telephoned to
express its concern. Instead of open support for Washington, Miti said Japan
'can understand and see the point of the US position'.
Privately, Miti officials are confident the EC-US dispute will be fairly
quickly resolved and it will not deteriorate into a total trade war.
'You could be either pessimistic or optimistic, but I am optimistic. I think
there is now more pressure on the EC to make a concession and something may
happen fairly quickly,' a Miti negotiator said.
Another senior official said the Japanese government was confused by the
influence of French domestic political issues on the agriculture trade
debate.

THE more he feels buffeted around on the European stage, the more Mr Jacques
Delors must feel comforted by his continued high standing in the French
opinion polls. This took a slight dip during the referendum campaign, but
two polls in the past week, for instance, put him back in first place over
all other possible contenders for the French presidency, from he left and
right.
Mr Delors, of course, gains what he himself refers to as a prime
d'eloignement - he looks better for being outside the immediate snakepit of
French politics. If he were to enter the fray by making a run at the Elysee
Palace in 1995, or earlier if President Francois Mitterrand's health fails,
then his poll standing would surely drop in a country where some regard him
as a 'Belgian' for his years in Brussels.
But there are certain factors working for him. Mr Mitterrand may never have
thanked Mr Delors for being so obviously and publicly right as finance
minister in moving France towards economic austerity in 1983. But the
president is even less keen on Mr Michel Rocard, the man whom Socialist
party leaders want to succeed him. Indeed, Mr Delors's great strength is
that he draws almost as much backing from the centre-right as from the left.
This is largely because he combines Socialist credentials with a Catholic
concern for the unity of society in one of the few European countries not to
have a sizeable Christian Democrat party at its centre. This is particularly
relevant in the current row over European, and especially French,
agriculture. He has repeatedly railed against Anglo-Saxon 'ultra-liberalism'
of the kind that he claims would lead to the 'desertification' of the French
countryside, as happened to the countryside of Britain in the 19th century
and of America in the 1930s.
Such a philosophic stance, of course, would do him no harm at all, if he
came to try to put together a presidential bid. Whether he has the
organisational base to do so is another matter. Certainly, he is keeping his
hand in. This September he set up a discussion club with the neutral name of
Temoins (Witnesses) which gathered a number of younger Socialist leaders and
even ministers to debate their party's 'renewal'.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Trade War Fears: US move unsettles German coalition

<TEXT>
WASHINGTON'S decision to impose selected trade sanctions on the European
Community yesterday sharpened the divisions in Germany's ruling coalition.
Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, who has been critical of France's
obstruction to a trade agreement with the US, said Germany would still try
to push through the final offer made by Washington last Thursday.
'We must come together now. We are in the situation that unless there are
new impulses for the economy, we will enter a global recession,' he told
German radio. Mr Claus Hommer, the minister's spokesman, said Mr Mollemann
would not rule out a majority decision in the EC's council of ministers,
even if that means excluding France's participation.
However, a senior agricultural official in Bonn said it was unfair to single
out France as the sole culprit for the breakdown of the trade talks.
In a reflection of the clear split between the industrial and the
agricultural lobby on the one hand, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's support for
French President Francois Mitterrand on the other, the official said any
agreement forged between the US and the EC at Chicago would have been
impossible to implement.
He said the US had in fact taken a 'step backwards' in the sense that it had
insisted on placing a maximum tonnage on the amount of oil seeds French
farmers could produce, while the Community's reforms were based on setting
aside acreage.
Mr Kohl's office issued a statement expressing regret for Washington's
decision, adding that it would make the negotiations more difficult.
But the chancellor's critics, most notably Mr Otto Lambsdorff, leader of the
liberal Free Democrats and a former economics minister, said Mr Kohl had
failed to use his influence to urge the French government to accept the
terms negotiated by the US.
Mr Mollemann's criticism of France, and his call for pressing ahead with an
agreement, received backing from the Federation of German Industries (BDI),
the country's influential industrial lobby.
'The interests of the Commission should not represent any one country, but
that it should represent the economic interests of all its member states,'
said Mr Bernhard Welschke, a senior official in the BDI's foreign trade
policy department, in a veiled attack on France.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Councils face 1% limit on pay rises in spending squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL AUTHORITIES will be told next week that they must contain the increase
in their pay bills to just over 1 per cent if they are to make room for any
real increases in services.
As ministers confirmed that local authorities were one of the principal
targets of the spending squeeze in the Autumn Statement, the signs were that
the increase in council budgets will be limited to about 3 per cent.
Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, will seek to enforce the
clampdown with a 'capping' regime for council budgets. But there was
acknowledgement in Whitehall that in the south of England it will mean a
sharp increase in bills when the community charge is replaced by the council
tax in April.
Officials said a transitional relief scheme will provide a partial cushion
for households in southern England, but those with properties in the top
bands for the new tax would be expected to absorb increases of up to Pounds
300 a year before receiving rebates.
Across the country as a whole the typical household bill is likely to be
more than Pounds 600 against the Pounds 560 total this year for two
community charge bills.
Ministers are aware that the tax could prompt serious rebellion by Tory
backbench MPs, but will argue that the cabinet's decision to hold the level
of grants for local authorities was essential to protect capital programmes.
Subject to a final deal with the administrator of Canary Wharf, Mr John
MacGregor, the transport secretary, has won approval for the Jubilee Line
extension to Canary Wharf. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will present
the scheme as a model for co-operation on other public-private sector
projects.
Mr MacGregor had to accept reductions in London Regional Transport's other
investment programmes and cuts in his department's roads programme.
Mr Howard will also indicate that the squeeze on the standard spending
assessment, which provides the basis of central government finance for local
authorities, will be offset in part by a relaxation of the rules limiting
their use of capital receipts.
Ministers said that although the restrictions on accumulated capital
receipts would remain, councils would be permitted to spend a higher
proportion of future receipts.

<TEXT>
SHOULD he ever seek the French presidency, as it is rumoured he might, Mr
Jacques Delors, beleaguered president of the European Commission, was given
a dry run in presidential treatment yesterday.
Mobbed by television cameramen and crowds of students alternately jeering
and cheering, the hapless Mr Delors was almost physically carried into the
London School of Economics where he delivered the first Jean Monnet lecture.
Security services were a little sparse and Mr Delors must have wished for
the muscular presence of truncheon-wielding French CRS policemen to knock a
few heads together and clear his path. In the event, he was dumped
breathless, but still remarkably composed and good-humoured, on the podium.
It was not, of course, Mr Delors' learned expose of the history of monetary
co-operation that the scribes and picture- takers had turned up to hear.
They had smelled blood.
Mr Delors' visit to the LSE followed the reported allegation by Mr Ray
MacSharry, the EC's chief trade negotiator, that his boss had sabotaged an
agreement with the US to protect the interests of French farmers and, by
implication, his own ambitions for the French presidency.
Appetites were whetted even before the famous man's arrival by whispered
information from a harassed academic. The Foreign Office, he indicated, had
just telephoned to speak to Mr Delors. At the moment Mr Delors was about
leave for lunch with the LSE's director, it was divulged that Mr John Major
had summoned 'monsieur le president' to Downing Street.
The dry academic atmosphere positively crackled with electricity. The LSE's
political scientists are not often given such a taste of realpolitik.
On the substance of the row over Gatt, Mr Delors' tormenters went away
unsatisfied. Lost in a forest of microphones and pushing journalists, he was
heard to protest that he never interfered in the negotiations conducted by
Mr MacSharry.
'I give my advice, but afterwards, if the majority of the Commission do not
share my advice, I express my full solidarity with the commissioner in
charge of negotiating.'
Would he resign? Mr Delors looked bewildered. ' Why? I am in good health,'
he answered.
In Dublin, a tired-looking Mr MacSharry arrived for a quiet weekend at home
in the west of Ireland. Unfortunately his arrival coincided with the opening
day of an election campaign.
Long thought of as a candidate for the premiership and leadership of the
Fianna Fail party, a post could be up for grabs if Mr Albert Reynolds, the
prime minister, fails to win a majority in the election.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Alarm at Major's decision to stall treaty ratification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign and Parliamentary Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S EC partners reacted with growing alarm and dismay yesterday to Mr
John Major's decision to delay ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
Throughout European capitals, senior officials expressed fear that the
British postponement would inject fresh uncertainty into the future of
Maastricht, increasing the risk of sowing popular doubts about the treaty.
However, in London, the government added further confusion to the UK's
timetable by refusing to rule out ratification before a second Danish
referendum.
In Brussels, a senior EC official warned that the Community was close to
disarray as a result of the breakdown of the Gatt world trade talks, the
British delay on Maastricht and divisions between member states on how to
resolve Danish requests for exemptions from the treaty.
Morale in the European Commission sank further in the wake of Mr Ray
MacSharry's resignation as one of the EC's two Gatt negotiators on the
grounds that he was being undermined by Mr Jacques Delors, the European
Commission president.
Mr Major said on Thursday that the crucial third reading debate in the
Commons was likely to come in May after a Danish plebiscite had been held.
However, questioned closely about whether Britain would conclude work on its
Maastricht bill if Denmark postponed its referendum until later in the year,
the official yesterday refused to be drawn and said the inquiry was
hypothetical.
He said that Denmark was expected to hold its plebiscite in May and that the
UK intended to complete ratification in the current parliamentary session
which ends in a year.
'The prime minister has to be sure he uses the right tactics to get
Maastricht ratified,' the official said - suggesting that Mr Major is
anxious to mollify his continental critics while not pro voking fresh uproar
from opponents of the treaty within the Conservative party.
Most interpretations of the prime minister's remarks to the Commons on
Thursday were that he was insisting Denmark's position was clear before the
Commons voted.
His actual words, however, were predicated on the assumption that the Danes
did hold their ballot in May.
Tory opponents of the treaty will be furious if there is any attempt to hold
a third read-ing vote before a Danish poll.
Several dissident MPs are known to have supported the government in the
crucial debate on Wednesday on the understanding that the process will not
be concluded before the Danes have decided about the treaty.
The Foreign Office has been clearly dismayed by the concession Mr Major
offered to Tory backbenchers who threatened to vote against the government
on Wednesday. The move has embarrassed Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, who will have to explain the apparent further delay and the
reasons for it to next week's meeting of EC foreign affairs ministers.
The political fissures spreading through the EC are making it much harder to
reach agreements on several outstanding issues on the already crowded
Edinburgh agenda, notably the Delors II package which provides for increased
funding for the poorer southern European states.
It is also likely to prompt Spain to seek a delay in the planned enlargement
talks with Finland, Austria and Sweden, according to a senior EC official.
These are important to the British presidency, but they are contingent on a
Delors II package and ratification of Maastricht.

FT  07 NOV 92 / EC seeks to avert trade war: Prime minister and Delors urge
farm negotiators to settle dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR and Mr Jacques Delors joined forces yesterday in an effort to
avert a damaging global trade war.
After an emergency meeting at Downing Street, the prime minister and
European Commission president called for US and EC farm trade negotiators to
're-engage without delay' to settle a long-standing oilseeds dispute.
Negotiations to settle the dispute - which is at the heart of a wider US-EC
row over Europe's farm subsidy regime - have for two years blocked progress
towards a comprehensive world trade reform package that could stimulate an
additional Dollars 200bn (Pounds 129bn) a year in international trade.
Talks collapsed in Chicago on Tuesday as farm ministers from both countries
sought a last-ditch settlement ahead of President Bush's election defeat.
The US swiftly announced that it would slap 200 per cent tariffs on European
white wine exports and other farm products worth Dollars 300m if the dispute
were not settled in 30 days.
These sanctions are seen as an opening salvo in what could escalate into a
tit-for-tat trade war. A second 'hit-list', including industrial items like
tyres, paper, ceramics and furniture, has been drawn up.
In a further effort to defuse tension, EC trade ministers meeting in Brocket
Hall, north-east of London, are understood to have agreed not to respond to
US sanctions with any counter-retaliation list of US farm exports.
Senior UK officials also said they did not expect the EC Council of
Ministers, which is due to meet on Monday, to take any decision on
counter-retaliation.
Mr Major held a 20-minute telephone conversation with Chancellor Helmut Kohl
of Germany in which both agreed on the urgent need to complete a Gatt deal.
German reluctance to put pressure on France, where opposition to a deal is
greatest, is thought to have contributed to the present crisis.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has also been in close touch with
his EC opposite numbers in what is clearly a drive by the UK presidency to
maximise support for an accord and raise the pressure on Mr Delors and the
French government.
Mr Delors' talks with Mr Major were seen as a significant effort to calm a
storm stirred on Thursday by the angry withdrawal of Mr Ray MacSharry, EC
farm commissioner, from negotiations. In a letter to Mr Delors on his return
from the Chicago negotiations, Mr MacSharry accused the EC president of
trying to undermine his negotiating efforts, and of 'betrayal of trust'.
EC officials tried yesterday to make light of Mr MacSharry's withdrawal,
insisting that negotiations could continue without him.
It was suggested that Mr Frans Andriessen, the external affairs commissioner
responsible for the wider Uruguay Round trade negotiations, would take over
Mr MacSharry's role.
Some officials also say that compromise on farm trade will only be possible
when negotiators with a wider brief take over.
Challenged about his clash with Mr Delors, Mr MacSharry yesterday insisted
that 'there are always differences in any negotiating team'.
'As far as I'm concerned my only interest in this is that we do get a Gatt
agreement . . . everybody must make every effort day and night to bring it
about.
'I think the deal can be signed up in five minutes,' the former Irish
government minister said. 'I wasn't, then or now, prepared to go any further
than we were in Chicago . . . it is now a matter for the United States to
accept what is in my view a reasonable deal,' he added.
Contradicting Mr MacSharry's claim, Mr Ed Madigan, US farm secretary, said a
'substantial gap still remains between where we are and where we must be' if
settlement is to be reached.
As EC-wide efforts were under way to get talks back on course, Mr Arthur
Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
called an emergency meeting next Tuesday of the 108-country Trade
Negotiations Committee that supervises the Uruguay Round.
A Gatt statement said countries wanted to discuss 'the very grave situation
that has arisen in the round, and to consider what action can be taken to
alleviate it'.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Arts: Money-lust to music / Review of 'McTeague', William
Bolomb's first opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IS THE American opera entering a boom period? Signs are disparate, and not
necessarily indicative of a coherent larger pattern or trend; but certainly,
something seems to be stirring. New operas are being commissioned by the big
houses, put on with flair, and greeted with genuine audience interest and
enthusiasm.
The unexpected popular success of Corigliano's Ghosts of Versailles at the
New York Metropolitan a year ago was the starting point; early last month
Philip Glass's Columbus Centenary opera The Voyage had a splashy send-off in
the same theatre; and at the end of same month, Lyric Opera of Chicago
enjoyed a notably warm reception for the unveiling of its first large-scale
commissioned opera for 14 years - McTeague, music by William Bolcom,
libretto by Arnold Weinstein and film director Robert Altman, who also
served as the show's producer.
The common factors of all three operas are their largeness of scale, their
determination to find audience-wooing ways of blending drama and music, and
their lavish production schemes. McTeague is the most obviously American, in
subject matter and in its determination to adopt native accents in the
exploration of that subject matter. It is based on Frank Norris's novel
(1899) of the same name, a landmark in the development of the country's
literary movement; and it tells the Zola-like tale of a physically mighty
but slow-witted quack-dentist, brought up in cruel poverty, who briefly
achieves domestic bliss and a measure of social status in
turn-of-the-century San Francisco and then, falling into a web of greed,
intrigue and envy, loses it all.
The theme - the corrosive power of money-lust on personal and social
relationships - has in no way lost its sting: reading the book and then
encountering the theatre-work against a backdrop of the American election
caused all sorts of bells to ring. And, most 'American' of all, the composer
has attempted to make music-drama by drawing deep on the sound and style of
American popular music.
Gershwin (in Porgy), Blitzstein (in Regina) and Weill (in Street Scene)
managed to do this, in their very different ways; but more recently the line
of succession seemed to have passed to the musicals of Bernstein and
Sondheim. Bolcom, an important composer and - as recital pianist for his
wife, Joan Morris - performer of American songs, has mingled the categories
of 'popular' and 'serious' throughout; he would seem a promising candidate
for the re-establishment of the Porgy line.
His two-act, two-hour structure, though 'continuous' in its use of
orchestral linkage, is a succession of enjoyably bright-pointed numbers  -
arias, duets and ensembles, often fleshed out in the metres of contemporary
popular dance (waltz, rag, cakewalk) when not shaped in more conventional
Grand Opera forms, and flavoured by the barbershop-quartet or cowboy-octet.
All this is set within a modern-music frame: long-held cluster-chords, a
variety of dissonant orchestral melodramatics and much else drawn -
free-handedly but not promiscuously - from the higher altitudes of 'serious'
opera. The approach is clear-minded: a language of buoyant simplicities to
represent the main characters' emotions and aspirations, compromised and
gradually stained by the language of their darker sides.
In the richest moment of the opera, this musical duality fixes the
turning-point of the plot: the wedding scene of McTeague and Trina,
interrupted by the award of her Dollars 5,000 lottery prize - a passage of
flexibly achieved operatic comedy shaded with dark portents, and here
brilliantly realised by the conductor Dennis Russell Davies and the Lyric
Opera orchestra.
This is, one remembers, a first opera, and its weaknesses are condign: lack
of steady dramatic development, lack of narrative clarity, plethora of Good
Ideas that in practice prove to be not quite so good. The back-and-forth of
flashback device is cumbersome, the expanded treatment of Norris's Mexican
maid Maria as a comic nemesis figure likewise. And, given Bolcom's
imaginative resourcefulness in placing his dramatic layers, it is odd how
impermanently the melodic writing imprints the characters on our
consciousness.
McTeague seems to me an opera of moments - but beguiling ones, at least. I
wonder, though, whether a sparer, defter production style might have altered
the impression; Altman's was gauze-ridden, part deliquescently abstract and
part atmospherically 'period', and surprisingly lumbering. - Russian
set-designer Yury Kuper had risked too many ambitious scene-changes with all
their noise and clutter.
The strongest advocates for the show, apart from Davies, were the cast,
large in number and superlatively 'in the skin' of the drama - for this
Altman no doubt deserves a share of praise as well. They were led by the
baritone Timothy Nolen (a smooth-voiced, subtly dapper agent of doom), the
soprano Catherine Malfitano (singing with dark lustre, moving from Trina's
youthful freshness to her miserly obsessiveness in finely graded stages),
and the tenor Ben Heppner in the title role.
I proclaimed the beauties of Heppner's 1988 Melbourne Bacchus and 1990 Scala
Walther to the skies. In music that needs Wagnerian power, Straussian high
notes and a different sort of rhythm- and interval-etching agility, he
proved himself a magnificently clean, ringing-voiced singer; in addition, he
brought to the central character a tremendous physical presence. To say it
is all but impossible to imagine McTeague without him is to suggest the
splendour of Heppner's performance, and also, to a degree, the limitations
of the work itself.

THE Spanish government is disappointed at British Prime Minister John
Major's decision to postpone final ratification of the Maastricht treaty
until next year, government spokeswoman Rosa Conde said, Reuter reports from
Madrid .
In Palma de Majorca, Spanish EC Commissioner Manuel Marin was more critical,
saying that the British decision was a setback in European union that
discouraged its EC partners.
'We are not used to a head of government accepting a public commitment and
then to see an about-turn because of domestic politics,' he said during a
seminar on the treaty on European union.
He said he did not believe the present impasse, pending the decisions of
Denmark and Britain, would last beyond the first half of next year.
'Europe must be built through decisions by real leaders who accept an
internal political cost,' he said. The danger was that the Edinburgh EC
summit in December would take place with two member countries unable to work
normally with the rest, he added.

AN INQUIRY into manage-ent, computer operations and industrial relations at
the London Ambulance Service was ordered yesterday by Mrs Virginia
Bottomley, health secretary. It will last three months and be led by Mr Don
Page, chief executive of the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service.
The inquiry, the report from which will be published, is intended to restore

call system. It has been claimed that recent computer failures led to the
deaths of some patients.
Mrs Bottomley said in the Commons there was a need to 'identify the lessons

A TOTAL of 150 jobs are to go at Lonrho Textiles plant at Cramlington,
Northumberland, it was confirmed yesterday, Chris Tighe writes.
The company said the job cuts, caused by the closure of an old spinning and
weaving plant, were being made to maximise the benefits of a Pounds 24m
investment over the last four years in new technology and equipment.
The Cramlington site, a wholly owned Lonrho subsidiary employs 950 people

FT  07 NOV 92 / How To Spend It: In dark times, it's time for beauty /
Review of three exhibitions which celebrate the very best in craftsmanship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIMES MAY be tough but beautiful things, happily, are always with us. This
week three companies, Tiffany, Cobra &amp; Bellamy and The Worshipful Company of
Goldsmiths, all concerned with the nurturing of creativity, of fine design
and craftsmanship, fly their flags high and put on exhibitions where price
and practicality are not the guiding principles.
There is always the danger, in times like these, that those intricately
involved with making one-off beautiful things may lose the heart and the
spirit to do so. This recession is no exception: everywhere craftsmen are in
trouble - eager for work, able to produce original innovative things but
commissions are thin on the ground. Nobody, after all, in the strictly
practical sense, really needs beautiful things - the fact that they nourish
the soul, refresh the eye and uplift the heart is often forgotten. So, too,
is the fact that many of these craftsmen have acquired their skills long and
arduously and if they can no longer earn a living many may die out.
A visit to any of these three exhibitions is a treat for the eye - a
reaffirmation that that there is more to life than the daily grind. Few of
us will be able to afford to buy but all will, I think, be glad to know that
they are around.
COBRA &amp; Bellamy (small, dark and Greek, Veronica Manussis is the Cobra and
tall, blond and willowy Tania Hunter is the Bellamy) have had a long and
fruitful partnership exploring the more arcane reaches of the jewellery
world. Known primarily for being amongst the first to acknowledge the
inherent aesthetic qualities of period costume jewellery, they then
introduced Art Deco jewellery, with great panache and success, to a wider
public.
The shop the two friends started in London's Sloane Street has only been
going since 1980 but its influence seems to have been out of all proportion
to its size. Besides promulgating the virtues of period costume jewellery
and Art Deco, Cobra &amp; Bellamy also embarked, some seven years ago, on a
richly rewarding partnership with the Italian jewellery designer Barbara
Bertagnolli.
Her work is singular for uniting an uncompromising contemporary aesthetic
with very fine, high quality materials and workmanship. All the pieces are
hand-crafted and once seen her work is not forgotten - the strong
combination of sterling silver and applied 24 carat gold with rich,
colourful gemstones are the hallmark of her style. Today Cobra &amp; Bellamy
customers the world over look out for new Bertagnolli pieces to add to their
growing collections.
From Thursday 12th November until Saturday 28th November a special
collection of some 240 different pieces, every single one of which has been
completely hand made by Barbara Bertagnolli herself, will be on view and on
sale at Cobra &amp; Bellamy's Sloane Street shop.
The jewellery this time is stronger, bolder, larger than ever before.
Gemstones give the collection drama and colour - iolites, amethysts, rubies,
mooonstones, garnets, emerals, tourmalines, pearls, adorn rings, bracelets,
necklaces and torques.
But besides the jewellery there is also a wonderfully rich and witty
collection of accessories which have been adorned the Bertagnolli way - an
enbonised Victorian walking cane sports four emeralds and an iolite, a black
suede evening bag is embellished with pink and green tourmalines whilst a
pair of silk-lined suede gloves are each given drama with a rainbow
moonstone and an iolite.
Look out, too, for a series of small household pieces - magnifying glasses,
clocks, bookmarks, scent bottles, mirrors, pillboxes, all have been
individualised and turned into collectable objects of great beauty by
Barbara Bertagnolli.
Given that all the pieces feature sterling silver, applied 24 carat gold and
gemstones and that they are handmade and individual the prices cannot be
cheap. A bookmark is about Pounds 180, the one-off individual jewellery
starts at about Pounds 600 whilst larger pieces, like the necklace
photographed here (which rejoices in approx 3 carat's worth of emerald,
moonstones, citrines, a blue and a green tourmaline and iolites), is Pounds
5,400.
There is also a small collection of rings and ear-rings which are part of
what Barbara Bertagnolli calls her diffusion lines which work out
considerably cheaper. All are handmade but each design is repeated three or
four times. Rings start at Pounds 158, earr-rings at Pounds 180.
IT IS NOT only frock-designers that have been affected by a deep bout of
nostalgia - this week Tiffany takes a long and affectionate look back into
its history. For those of us who think of Tiffany as a quintessentially
modern store - certainly it exudes a very different air from the rest of its
Bond Street neighbours - it is instructive to see such a range of beautiful
pieces stretching way back into the last century.
Rosa Monckton, managing director of Tiffany &amp; Co, London, is particularly
thrilled at the arrival of the collection of historical pieces. 'This is the
first time we have been able to show our customer the finest jewellery from
the Victorian age through to the present day. We thought our customers would
like to know something of the history of the store. Though we opened as
recently as 1986 in London, the roots of the business go back to 1837 when
Charles Louis Tiffany opened his first store at 259 Broadway.'
From the beginning Tiffany developed a tradition of working with top
designers of the day and his son, Louis Comfort Tiffany, was the designer
behind the still sought-after Tiffany lamps.
Through the years the company worked with people such as Edward Moore, the
silversmith, with Schlumberger, the great designer of the 30s, with Claflin
in the 70s. Claflin it was who developed a new and interesting setting for
the single-stone diamond - whereas the tradition of the time was to use a
prong setting he found a way of using a two-dimensional setting which threw
a different light on the stone, a setting still used and much copied today.
The tradition continues with a close relationship between the store and the
work of Paloma Picasso and Elsa Peretti, two designers whose work one could
not imagine in any other Bond Street store.
Almost all the pieces on show are for sale, though just a few are museum
pieces that are there simply for the role they played in the history of the
company. Many of the pieces are as beautiful and as timeless as ever.
Prices, given that many of these are one-off collectors' pieces, do not seem
to me unreasonable. There is a 1910 pair of platinum and diamond lorgnettes
that would cost Pounds 1,000. Whilst nothing is priced in the hundreds there
is quite a lot of choice at under Pounds 2,000 and nearly 40 per cent of the
collection is under Pounds 5,000. There is, for instance, a most beautiful
Louis Comfort Tiffany necklace, made from nephrite jade and plique-a-jour
enamel with freshwater pearls; dating from 1905 it is a perfect example of
jewellery from the Art Nouveau period.
But if all those prices are beyond you, and for most of us they will be, one
of the great joys of Tiffany has always been that for under Pounds 100 you,
too, can buy a little Tiffany style. There are sterling silver Elsa Peretti
earrings for Pounds 85, the famous sterling silver T-clip Tiffany ballpoint
pen is Pounds 45, trumpet shaped champagne flutes are Pounds 10 each,
sterling silver dumbbell cufflinks are Pounds 25 each and a miniature
heart-shaped perfumed flacon is Pounds 50.
THE Goldsmiths' Hall, Foster Lane, London EC2V 6BN, hosts an exhibition that
I hope every city tycoon or patron or the arts who from time to time has to
commission something fine and beautiful will make a point of visiting.
The three artists whose work is featured all work in different fields. Brian
Asquith is a silversmith, George Daniels is a watch maker and Elizabeth Gate
a jeweller. Each of them is a master of their field.
George Daniels, for example, is said to be one of only three men in the
world who can make a watch entirely by hand. From fashioning the sheet metal
for the case, to the movements and the winder, every single piece is made by
Daniels alone.
His watches have become world-renowned, sought-after by collectors in the
know. They combine the precision skills of the engineer with the beauty of
the artist. His hand-made movements are more accurate than any quartz and
once regulated should need no more adjusting for at least ten years.
There is no shop where a George Daniels watch can be bought - his preferred
method of working is to make a watch in his own meticulous, time-consuming
way and when it is done to place an advertisement in The Times and sit back
and wait until it is sold. Prices vary, according to the complexity of the
model and the amount of time it has taken but it is, I am afraid, rather
like the luxury yacht - if you need to ask the price you cannot afford it.
However, we all can look, and I recommend a trip to Goldsmiths' Hall because
his timepieces are a rare and exceptionally exquisite commodity.
Brian Asquith, meanwhile, has taken over the whole of the white and gold
room at the Goldsmiths' Hall to show just what he can do. Here is the
standard fare of corporate gift-giving, transmuted into pieces of great
beauty. Here a goblet, there a candlestick, over there a chalice and right
beside it an official trophy. All have personality and charm and should give
many a potential patron ideas of what can be done.
For those who like Brian Asquith's work but are not in the market to
commission it is worth noting that he has produced a range of more
affordable domestic ware, all in sterling silver. Prices start at Pounds 75
for a napkin ring or a whisky measure, whilst salt and pepper mills would be
Pounds 1,000 a pair. There are also candlesticks, mirrors and goblets. For a
catalogue write to Brian Asquith Design Partnership, Turret House,
Youlgrave, nr. Bakewell, Derbyshire DE4 1WL. Tel: 0629-636204.
Finally, there is the work of Elizabeth Gage, a jeweller whose prices put
her pieces way beyond the reach of most of us but who nonetheless seems to
have a steady clientele. Ever since she produced her first famous
Byzantine-inspired rings she has drawn inspiration from history, mythology
and ancient cultures for her pieces. She uses stones beautifully - sometimes
combinations of tourmalines, spinels, black jade and amethysts, at other
times pearls, diamonds and other precious stones.
The pieces on show at The Goldsmiths' Hall range from a stunning necklace of
18 carat gold with pearls, tourmalines and diamonds and a detachable pin to
smaller, more affordable ear-rings, rings and pins. One of the hallmarks of
her work is producing pieces which can be worn during the day or at night -
very often by means of a detachable pin. Pieces are not for sale at the
exhibition itself but Elizabeth Gage has a shop and showroom at 20,
Albemarle Street, London W1 where the full range of her work can be seen.
The exhibition runs until November 20.

   WITH THE 1970s all the rage
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
so the message from the catwalks comes out loud and clear - it is a fine bit
of timing the Nice Irma's, that dearly loved London store of the '70s hippy,
looks even nicer today.
There is still a goodly sprinkling of Indian bedspreads, of quilted bags
that look as if they came straight from Mysore (and nothing wrong with that
either), of crewelwork cushion covers and Ikat prints, but there is also
marvellously priced ticking fabric (six different colourways) at Pounds 6.70
a metre and six different plaids (currently all the rage) at Pounds 7.50 a
metre.
Those who bought their '70s props from Nice Irma's will need no reminding
that the shop is at 46 Goodge Street, London W1P 1FJ. Those for whom Nice
Irma's is unknown have a treat in store. There is no need any longer to make
it to Goodge Street, for there is now a bright, well-produced full-colour
mail order catalogue which makes all its wares available to everybody,
wherever they may be.
From the beds and quilts to a range of very well-priced rugs (the smallest
at 24 ins by 36 ins is just Pounds 12.70, the largest at 60 ins by 90 ins is
Pounds 69) everything can be ordered from home without braving the
metropolis. There are all the usual Indian finds - the wrought-iron
candlesticks, the painted boxes, the gilt mirrors, the wooden artefacts, all
at very reasonable prices.
However, probably the best value of all are the fabrics, all of which come
from India, all hand-loomed or hand-worked. The range is wide, the prices
excellent and for those who quail at the prices of furnishing fabric in the
designer shops it is good to know that there is somewhere to go for fabrics
at well under Pounds 10 a metre. Nice Irma's also makes up cushions, blinds,
curtains, bedspreads and lampshades to order, at affordable prices.
Catalogues cost Pounds 2 from Nice Irma's, 46, Goodge Street, London W1P
1FJ.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Motoring: Ford gets it right second time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF only Ford could have got it right first time . . .
The launch of the Escort two years ago was a damp squib. There had been so
much hype about a Pounds 1bn investment in a new version of Ford's perennial
best-seller that, having driven it, one had to ask: where did all the money
go?
The body was all new but the styling was bland. The engines were the old
ones carried over. Handling was soggy, performance nothing to write home
about. The experts were distinctly underwhelmed.
Two years on, the Escorts and their booted counterparts, the Orions, have
had a modest facelift. A number of engineering improvements, minor in
themselves but cumulatively important, have been made. The twin-cam,
multi-valve Zeta engine, previously used only in up-market 1.8 litre Escorts
and Orions, now powers 1.6 litre models.
They have been transformed. This week, I test drove an Pounds 8,995 1.4
Escort LX - still with the single camshaft CVH engine - and it was the
improved build quality that first impressed. The whole car was rock-solid.
No creaks or squeaks. Excellent seats, light controls, a resilient ride and
so quiet there was more noise from the tyres than from the engine.
With a modest output of 71 horsepower and fairly high gearing, it paid to
use the 5-speed box freely and keep the fuel-injected engine spinning fast.
On the motorway, driven as though by a commission-hungry young rep in
pursuit of more orders, the 1.4 Escort was unfussed.
When I switched to a Pounds 11,550 1.6 litre multi-valve engined Orion, the
performance boost was obvious yet it delivered its 90 horsepower just as
quietly and smoothly. Though happy to run at high revolutions, the 1.6 Zeta
engine pulled so silkily at low speeds that I could trickle through villages
at less than 30 mph (48kmh) in top gear.
Power assistance (optional on the 1.4, standard on all 16-valve engined
Escorts and Orions) took the effort out of parking. Steering response was
satisfactory but I thought the Escorts and Orions lacked the sharp agility
of the new 3-door Citroen ZX hatchbacks I had driven a few days before.
There are seven Citroen ZX 3-doors, five petrol-engined and two diesels, at
prices from Pounds 8,500 for the 1.4i Reflex to Pounds 14,500 for a very
fast and sporting 16v.
My pick of the bunch was the Pounds 10,750 Furio, powered by a new 1.8
litre, 103 horsepower engine. You could call the Furio a warm, not hot,
hatchback. The insurance companies have smiled upon it. The Furio's group 11
insurance rating compares with a Ford XR3i's group 15, a Rover 216 GTi 16v
or VW Golf GTi's group 14, even though they all have much the same
performance.
So, apart from having a list price Pounds 2,000 lower than any of its
rivals, a ZX Furio will also save a typical owner several hundred pounds a
year in insurance premiums.
Citroen has increased its sales by 20 per cent this year to become the
fastest-growing motor manufacturer in Britain. In the 3-door ZXs, especially
the Furio, it clearly has another winner on its hands.
This sporty stablemate of the 5-door ZX does not have to be driven hard to
show its virtues. The engine develops its maximum torque (in plain language,
pulls hardest) at only 3,000 rpm. Its vigorous acceleration in fourth and
fifth gears is just what is needed in everyday motoring.
I also tried the range-topping ZX 16V which really is a hot hatchback. A top
speed of 137 mph/220 kmh and 0-60 mph/0-98kmh acceleration in eight seconds
are claimed.
It handled with an almost nervous responsiveness and still rode well, though
the suspension has been stiffened and the high-speed rated tyres are wider.
Like the less potent Furio, it pulled well at modest revolutions.
With a Pounds 14,500 list price and group 15 insurance rating, it will be
beyond the financial reach of many young drivers. But they should try the
Furio. I can see this warm hatch becoming a cult car; a mid-1990s'
counterpart of the original Golf GTi and Peugeot 205 GTi 1.9.

FT  07 NOV 92 / International Company News: Westpac shares at nine-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Westpac, the Australian financial services group, touched a
nine-year low of ADollars 2.44 on Australian stock exchanges yesterday as
the crisis surrounding the bank's financial position deepened.
On Thursday the bank announced that it would be unable to meet its forecast
of a 12 cents a share final dividend - made in a ADollars 1.1bn rights issue
prospectus - as a result of an unexpected ADollars 115m (USDollars 80m) US
tax liability.
Westpac has been officially queried by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX),
and the Australian Securities Commission has indicated it would re-open
surveillance of the bank's rights issue prospectus.
Westpac shares recovered late in the day to close 24 cents down at ADollars
2.51 after the bank assured the ASX it had not withheld information on the
US tax position. The ASX query resulted from comments attributed to
Westpac's chief financial officer, Mr Derrick Heywood, that the US tax
problems had first been detected in June.
This raises the question of whether Westpac should have disclosed the US tax
situation in its rights issue prospectus.
Mr RI Barrett, group secretary, said yesterday that investors had been fully
informed.
'A problem was detected in June 1992, and a further problem was detected in
September, both of which concerned transactions in non-US currencies and
accounted in total for a sum of the order of ADollars 25m which was not seen
to be material in the context of underlying performance as assessed by
management at that time,' Mr Barrett said.
'The matters which gave rise to Thursday's announcement concerned
transactions in US dollars. The issue which emerged on or about October 15
related to those US dollar transactions and was of a different character
from that considered in June and September,' he added.
Westpac, which made a pre-tax loss of ADollars 2.32bn for the six months
ended March, now plans to pay a final dividend of six cents a share for
1991-92. Its ADollars 1.2bn rights issue was heavily undersubscribed,
culminating in the resignation of five main board directors.

   From Ms VALERIE BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your conclusions regarding English Heritage's planned disposals
('Selling the Silver', October 31 and 'English Heritage cuts anger MPs',
October 27) are quite right. I am one of the 300,000 members of English
Heritage who will most certainly cancel my subscription if these plans go
ahead. I subscribe to English Heritage not to support those famous tourist
attractions such as Stonehenge, but to support the maintenance of the
smaller and lesser-known sites, such as the Roman Village and Harry's Walls
in the Isles of Scilly.
Sites such as these are often in remote rural areas, whose councils would be
unable to afford the cost of their maintenance. They are sites, integral to
the heritage of our islands, to which, by the very nature of their location,
one could not charge admission. It is these smaller sites that we expect the
government to fund, and not the large tourist money spinners that could be
turned into profitable concerns.
I suggest English Heritage has its priorities wrong. Prior consultation with
interested parties might have saved some of the furore that is now gathering
pace.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Sour taste in Bordeaux: Allied-Lyons' decision to sell
Chateau Latour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like other specialist businesses, the wine trade is flattered by the
intervention of multinational conglomerates, bemused by much of what they do
in its particular sector, and worried by any sign that they want to get out
of it.
The news that Allied-Lyons might sell Chateau Latour, the Rolls-Royce of
claret, comes as an affront to the wine world. A sale would be the latest in
a series of changes of ownership in Bordeaux, the world's largest wine
region, triggered by economic slowdown. Latour enjoys an unmatched status,
being one of four of the world-famous 'first growths' from Bordeaux's Medoc
region, the elite of a rigorous quality system introduced in 1855.
Under its new president, David Orr, who has spent most of his working life
immersed in Allied's wine interests, Latour has shown a return to form with
a 1990 that experts acknowledge is even better than those of Chateaux
Lafite, Margaux and Mouton-Rothschild, the other first growths that are
still French-owned and family-run.
The decision to sell such a corporate gem in a depressed market for both
wine and wine properties therefore baffles many observers. This is
particularly true since Allied acquired Latour when prices were at their
peak, in 1988. Prices have since started to flatten and in some cases fall.
Sale of the vineyard also seems inconsistent with the company's recent
spending spree on California wineries where prospects seem much less certain
than those of the great Bordeaux estate.
Allied's chairman, Michael Jackaman, is known to feel a particular affection
for Latour. But a change in the group's management strategy since Jackaman
and Tony Hales, the chief executive, took over last year, has prompted
allied to focus on international growth brands and on raising the return on
assets.
'Several people have bought properties here in recent years because they
fell in love with something, or mistakenly thought wine prices would go on
rising at 10 to 15 per cent per year indefinitely . . . Allied-Lyons is not
like that. It is a real professional,' says Mr Philippe Casteja, president
of the Conseil Interprofessionel du Vin de Bordeaux and proprietor of a
neighbouring but less grand property, Chateau Batailley.
Allied-Lyons is probably looking for a sale as part of its general strategy
of cutting debts and concentrating on its core activities, says Mr Sylvain
Massot, food and drink analyst at Morgan Stanley in London: 'Unlike
Champagne, Bordeaux has never really been a business suitable for big food
multinationals because it is more fragmented than Champagne and the
synergies with other drinks brands are less obvious.'
This is not an easy time for Chateau Latour, the smallest of the Medoc first
growths. The 1991 vintage was severely curtailed by an April frost and
proved a financial disaster throughout Bordeaux.
Latour will be hurt more than most by the current downturn in demand because
it tends to hold more of its own stocks than do its competitors. Rivals sell
a higher proportion of wine through independent merchants to offload the
cost of holding it, which Mr Casteja says is the single biggest component of
a Bordeaux estate's overall costs.
In addition, recent dumping of young vintages of Chateau Latour by an
Allied-owned British wholesaler, at prices low enough to undercut even
Latour's own in-house Bordeaux merchant, have hurt its image.
Most of Latour's competitors are producing a higher return on their owners'
invested capital. They either changed hands before Bordeaux estate prices
peaked in the late 1980s or they have been in the same family for
generations and mcuh of their assets were written down long ago. The most
recent Medoc first growth to change hands is Chateau Margaux, bought in 1977
by the Franco-Greek Mentzelopoulos family from its previous family owners,
the Ginestets for just FFr76m (Pounds 9.06m).
Any bidder would have to think hard before buying Chateau Latour for the
more than the Pounds 100m at which it was valued when Pearson, publisher of
the Financial Times, sold its 53.5 per cent stake to Allied Lyons for Pounds
58m in 1988.
Yet there are eager buyers for Bordeaux properties. Most interest has come
from French insurance companies, which have over the past decade picked up
around 20 Bordeaux wine businesses as steady long-term investments for their
property portfolios. The leader in this game is Axa, which is said to be
interested in adding Latour to its portfolio of Bordeaux chateaux, including
the neighbouring Chateau Pichon-Longueville. Only last June, the insurance
group's wine unit, Axa-Millesimes, bought a majority stake in Chateau
Suduiraut, a top Sauternes property.
If Latour were to revert to French ownership, after nearly three decades in
British hands, it would surely be forever. The Mentzelopoulos's bid for
Margaux was accepted by the French government - under its foreign investment
vetting rules of the time - in spite of a much higher offer from National
Distillers of the US.
Yet French foreign investment controls have since been relaxed, so
Allied-Lyons could make the most of offshore interest. It could well ask and
get a considerable premium from any non-French bidder - perhaps an eccentric
Japanese billionaire wine enthusiast, such as those who have already made
inroads in France and California.
So the Bordeaux wine trade is collectively holding its breath - and an awful
lot of unsold stock - in a difficult marketplace.
A few months ago, David Orr took a British fine-wine merchant out to lunch
at one of London's smartest restaurants. Knowing that Latour was
particularly well-promoted on the Gavroche wine list, with 13 different
listings from Pounds 135 to Pounds 990 a bottle, he asked the sommelier, as
part of his Latour sales pitch, how many bottles he sold in an average
month. He was visibly shocked by the answer that nowadays it would only be
three.

THE Building Societies Association, support from whose members is crucial to
the success of the new Personal Investment Authority, yesterday gave it
qualified approval. The association added that its members were still
deciding whether to join.
'Building societies welcome the establishment of the PIA,' said Mr Mark
Boleat, association director-general.
'Contrary to some suggestions, societies have not decided to reject the new
regulatory body. Those societies which are eligible (and most are not
because they are tied agents of life companies) will carefully consider the
detailed prospectus when it is issued before making a final decision.'
The association is the trade body for UK building societies and most of its
members earn additional income selling products such as endowment and life
insurance policies and unit trusts.
Life insurance companies have said they would not agree to join the PIA
unless banks and building societies also joined. Privately, both banks and
building societies have expressed little enthusiasm, saying they prefer to
remain members of other self-regulatory bodies.
The association fears that the PIA will extend its regulation into areas of
mortgage business and deposit-taking, and said those areas should be banned
from the PIA's charter. It also said that the proposed board of 30 members
was too large and that 15 would be more appropriate. Its members would want
to be 'prop-erly represented' on the PIA board.
NFIFA, the UK's largest trade association for independent financial
advisers, yesterday hit out at proposals from Mr Mick Newmarch, Prudential
Corporation chairman, for statutory regulation to replace the current system
of self-regulation.
Mr Garry Heath, NFIFA chief executive, said: 'Mr Newmarch is trying to
return regulation to the same basis that caused the Barlow Clowes and
Dunsdale scandals, both of which were perpetrated during the direct
statutory regulation of the DTI.'

FT  07 NOV 92 / What Future For Coal?: Miners shop around for jobs - The
hunt for work in the wake of the coal crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER miners Mr Peter Leonard and Mr Allen Hughes are waiting to hear about
applications for three jobs - working on London Underground's proposed
Jubilee Line extension, tunnelling through two mountains in Iran for a new
road and opencast mining in Malaysia.
The men, aged 35 and 49, were employed together as face worker and
chargehand at Sutton Manor Colliery in Lancashire which closed last year.
Since then they have not been idle - most recently they have worked for
private contractors on the South Yorkshire coalfields. However, they have
twice lost their jobs - after working knee-deep in water, doing what they
described as 'the hardest and dirtiest work in our lives'. It was 'first in,
last out' as contractors reined back on employees.
Last week they travelled 18 miles from their Liverpool homes to inspect the
vacancies advertised in a job shop run by British Coal Enterprises (BCE), a
subsidiary of British Coal. Set-up in the wake of the 1984-85 miners'
strike, BCE tries to find jobs for ex-mineworkers and support small
businesses in mining communities. These most often are not run by former
miners.
BCE can claim some tangible success in settling ex-miners in new jobs. This
has been won by the provision of training on the Job and Career Change
Scheme, along with counselling services, job shops and career services.
These services are available for up to six months after a worker has been
made redundant. BCE used to prefer applicants to have a job offer for which
the training was required - something focused on by critics, which has been
recently lifted.
BCE says that between March 1988 and October last year it operated 123
individual job clubs and career centres on 80 coalfield sites with 29,043
former employees registering for help, a majority of those made redundant in
the period. It also spent about Pounds 16m in the period. Of those, 22,128
became active job hunters - with 1,343 becoming self-employed, 4,602 joining
BCE training courses and 11,824 finding new jobs either by themselves or
with the assistance of the shops.
Jobs on offer in one BCE shop last week included vacancies for a security
guard, a warehouse operator, a cashier, a fitter and a senior engineer.
BCE has no detailed figures about the types of job taken by ex-miners who
use its services. Critics - including the Coalfield Communities Campaign,
which represents coalfield local authorities - claim many former miners find
it difficult to find stable well-paid jobs and that the level of training
received by former miners is low. Many ex-miners do not ask their former
employer for assistance.
Mr John Waddington, a counsellor at BCE's Leith job club in Lancashire,
where the last pit is scheduled to be closed next year, says many men go
straight into another job without the need for re-training.
'Mineworkers are very adaptable,' he says. Their skills are many, he adds -
including those of mechanics, electricians and welders. He also points to
the qualities associated with working underground - such as teamwork and
loyalty to the group.
Mr Waddington says BCE does not try to force individuals into changing
radically their job aspirations. 'The vast majority of people want to stay
in and around their communities and they just want another job,' he says.
'Money is of secondary importance and they are not likely to earn as much as
when they were down the pit.'
Former miners, he says, are not afraid of retraining, but few are interested
in long-term retraining for very different types of jobs. 'We try to
persuade people to retrain but very few want to,' he says.
The poor economic state of many mining areas is the dominant factor in many
men's search for a new working life.
Mr Leonard, soon after he was made redundant, went on a short BCE-funded
retraining course to become a mechanical digger operator.
'We used similar equipment in the tunnels and I thought I might get work on
the motorways,' he says. He was promised a job before he went on the course
but it fell through later.
'I could not get any other jobs driving a digger because they all wanted
experience,' he says. 'What is the point of re-training if there is not a
job at the end of it all?'
Whether the government's new initiative to help up to 30,000 miners in the
31 pits threatened with closure by British Coal will make any greater impact
on improving the job prospects and aspirations of men like Mr Leonard
remains to be seen.
Some Pounds 75m has been provided by the government over the next two years
to assist miners and their communities in areas worst affected by the job
losses.
The initiative, which will seek to offer a variety of employment services,
is being led by Training and Enterprise Councils in association with other
agencies including the Employment Service - which runs government job
centres - and BCE.
There is optimism among the agencies that a well co-ordinated effort could
make some impacts on these communities.
It remains to be seen whether all the parties can work effectively together
and whether, with the comparatively small budget, any achievement will be
significantly greater than that secured by BCE.

MR JOHN SMITH, Labour leader, tried to restore his European credentials
yesterday as he launched a fresh attack on the Liberal Democrats for voting
with the government in this week's debate on the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Smith used his speech to a Labour conference on Europe in Brighton to
insist that Britain had to be in the lead in Europe, saying: 'Let us play
our part in shaping the Europe of the next century.'
He justified Labour's decision to vote against the government by saying he
was not prepared to support a motion, 'which would have endorsed the
Conservative opt-out from a social chapter which the rest of the (European)
Community properly regards as vital'.
He said Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, was either 'not telling
the truth' or was 'an unashamed hypocrite' in suggesting that he knew three
weeks ago that the government would delay completing ratification of the
Maastricht Bill until after the second Danish referendum.
Mr Smith said Mr Ashdown had told the Commons he did not believe that
Britain should, 'shelter behind the skirts of the Danish people'. The
Liberal Democrats had backed, 'a discredited and bankrupt government that is
undermining our society, destroying our economy and wrecking our future in
Europe'.
His comments came at the end of a week in which relations between Labour and
the Liberal Democrats have worsened dramatically. Aides to Mr Ashdown denied
there had been any contact between the Liberal Democrats and the government,
but confirmed that the party had long believed the bill's committee stage
could last until April or May.
Conservatives have attacked Labour. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence
secretary, in a speech in Derbyshire last night, said that 'domestic
partisan interests - and an appalling lack of principle - have, once again,
been allowed to overshadow Britain's future in Europe'.
Mr Smith accused Mr John Major of failing to provide leadership, saying the
prime minister should have used Britain's EC presidency to initiate
Europe-wide action to counter recession.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Bearings plant to extend holiday closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE bearings manufac-turer NSK will extend the Christmas shutdown of
its biggest UK plant for the second year running.
Unlike many manufacturing companies, NSK has responded to the recession by
lengthening holidays rather than cutting jobs. In the past 12 months it has
extended the Christmas/new year, Easter and summer shutdowns at its bearings
plant in Peterlee, County Durham, which employs 700 people, by a total of 20
days. This nearly doubles the number of days on which the plant has not been
in production.
The lengthened shutdowns are in response to an estimated 20 per cent drop in
European market demand for bearings in the past two years. The steering
column and ball plants at Peterlee, which employ 110 people, are not
affected.
NSK Bearings Europe, announcing the five-day extension to this year's
Christmas shutdown of the plant and forge, yesterday indicated its
opposition to permanent plant closures or large-scale redundancies.
Mr David Smith, human resources manager at the Peterlee plant, said: 'We
believe that our strategy is much more conducive to the immediate and
long-term personal needs of our employees and we have achieved agreement
with union representatives on this over the last year.'
Like everyone else NSK was having to reduce expenditure, he said, but was
trying to do so 'within agreed and acceptable margins'. Long-term
developments and commitments, including secondment of staff to Japan to gain
new skills, were continuing.
'In short, for the sake of everyone in the company, we are continuing to
invest in the future,' he added.
Employees can choose to take the five extra days as paid holiday from their
entitlement for next year, which would not normally be available until May
next year.
The AEEU engineering and electrical union, the plant's recognised union
said: 'We welcome employers doing this instead of throwing people on the
scrapheap.'

A THAI conglomerate announced yesterday that it had signed a deal to

China's Guangdong province, in what it said was the largest Thai investment
so far in China, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok.
Soon Hua Seng group (SHS), an unlisted company which boasts of being the
biggest rice and tapioca exporter in the world, signed an agreement with the
state-controlled Forestry and Paper Mill Co of Shanwei City to plant trees
and build wood chip and pulp and paper plants which will eventually employ
4,000 people.
It was the latest in a series of moves by Thai entrepreneurs of ethnic
Chinese origin to invest in southern China; other Thai Chinese investments
in China include feedmills, property projects and banks.
Mr Kitti Dumnernchanwanit, president of SHS and a director of Bangkok Bank,
praised China's economic liberalisation measures and said: 'I am a Chinese,
but was born in Thailand. I always realise that for a human being it is a
must to bring progress and prosperity to his country of origin.'
SHS said it would start planting eucalyptus and acacia trees next year on
32,000 hectares of land to be rented from the Shanwei government.
Construction of the wood chip plant would begin in 1997 or 1998, and the
building of the pulp and paper factory would start in 1999.
Production was expected to start in about 10 years, and paper output
destined for China and for export markets would be about 120,000 tonnes a
year.
The company released no financial details, but said part of the total
Dollars 1bn investment would come from international financial institutions.
'The relations between China and Thailand are evident and no development can
sever or destroy them,' said Mr Prasit Kanchanawat, a former commerce
minister who is chairman of both SHS and Bangkok Bank.

AMNESTY International, the human rights body, yesterday expressed concern
about reports of killings of Unita officials and supporters by
government-armed civilians.
Amnesty said it was calling on the government to establish an impartial and
independent investigation of the allegations of gross human rights abuses.
The call came amid continued efforts by South Africa, the US and the United
Nations to bring Unita, the former rebel movement, and the government
together for peace talks after fierce street fighting in Luanda and several
other provincial cities in the past seven days.
Those efforts are being hampered by the fact that many of the most senior
and western-educated leaders of Unita, who have been responsible for
negotiating with the government during the past 17 months, have been killed
or are missing.
Unita yesterday appealed to the US to intervene to stop fighting in the
war-ravaged country, which it claimed had left 15,000 people dead.
Unita officials said the government launched a 'brutal pogrom' intended to
wipe Unita out of the cities.
Listed among the Unita fatalities are Vice-President Jeremias Chitunda and
Mr Elias Salupeto Pena, Unita's representative to the joint body overseeing
the peace process. A Portuguese correspondent in Luanda who saw the corpses
of both men said they had received bullet wounds to their heads fired from
point blank range.
Diplomats in Luanda said earlier this week that during the fighting armed
civilians went on house-to-house manhunts for Unita supporters and that the
streets of the capital were littered with corpses.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Food: An American foody in London - Eating Out / The latest
trends in US dining arriving with the new batch of burger joints and pizza
bars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITONS who think American dining begins and ends with burgers and pizza are
about to have their perceptions altered. Three American-influenced
restaurants have recently opened in central London, offering a more accurate
impression of how Americans dine than was previously available in Britain.
Another is supposed to be on the way.
The Criterion Brasserie, a co-operative venture between Bob Peyton's My
Kinda Town Restaurants and Rocco Forte's hotel chain, opened in Piccadilly
in September featuring American-influenced Italian cuisine.
In October, TGI Friday's, the US restaurant chain owned in the UK by
Whitbread, opened its 11th British restaurant, in Coventry Street off the
Haymarket. Mezzaluna, a popular New York Italian-American restaurant, opened
in the renovated Neal's Centre in Covent Garden last month, the brainchild
of American Neal Grossman. And sometime later this year, the much-hyped,
superstar-owned Planet Hollywood is supposed to finally materialise.
These restaurants are certainly American in their ubiquity. Londoners will
not able to walk down the street without seeing a new American restaurant
which is what it has been like in the US for the past decade.
Dining has become America's premier participation and spectator sport and
its conspicuous consumption of choice, with new restaurants opening  - and
lately, thanks to the recession, closing - at breakneck pace.
Many Britons consider TGI Friday's 'American Bistros' the quintessential
American restaurants. Since its opening in 1966, its British flagship
restaurant, tucked between the Covent Garden Piazza and the Strand, has
become the most popular TGI Friday's in the world, with queues stretching
out of the door and youths packed into the bar on weekends. Its 'new'
restaurant in Coventry Street about which, of course, there is really
nothing new - is just a five-minute walk away from the flagship store.
What Friday's sells is its version of the American dining experience - huge
portions of burgers, ribs, salads, desserts, and frothy cocktails served up
by friendly staff in a party-like atmosphere. TGI Friday's British prices
are, on average, twice as high as those in the US (potato skins with bacon,
cheese, and sour cream cost Pounds 6.85 in Britain, Pounds 3.54 in the US, a
bacon cheeseburger Pounds 7.50 in Britain, Pounds 3.45 in the US, and mocha
mud pie Pounds 4.75 in Britain, Pounds 2.05 in the US.)
This American must inform Britons, though, that TGI Friday's is not an
accurate picture of US dining. It's an indication of the restaurant-trend
time lag between the US and the UK. The loud and brassy chord Friday's is
striking with Britons is decidedly out of tune with its current American
image: serviceable, family-oriented, and outdated. Very 'early '80s.'
Over the past decade the sameness of chain restaurants such as Friday's has
gone out of style in the US. Now, the watchwords at US restaurants are
individuality and uniqueness. The force behind this trend is star chefs such
as Californians Wolfgang Puck and Alice Waters whose restaurants - Puck's
Spago in Los Angeles and Waters' Chez Panisse in Berkeley - put an emphasis
on freshness and quality of ingredients, novelty and authenticity of
preparation, and above all, the eccentric inspiration of the chef. Following
star chefs has become an obsession for many Americans, and dining almost a
religious experience, its disciples colloquially called 'foodies.'
Given American dining's past British success, it is no surprise that its
latest trend has found its way to Britain. But will fully-fledged American
foodyism really catch on in Britain?
In its purest form, probably not. The example of Columbus, Neal Grossman's
first restaurant, is instructive. The South Kensington restaurant, opened in
1990, was Grossman's attempt to introduce Wolfgang Puck-style 'California
cuisine' to Britain. Criticism of Columbus, and its menu which included such
items as monkfish ceviche with tequila and lime and eggplant teriyaki pizza,
swung from reverential to disgusted; it never found its audience and lasted
only 18 months.
Many industry experts question whether Grossman, a Harvard MBA with no
training as a chef, really belonged at Columbus' culinary helm. He thinks,
though, that the problem was the shock of the new: 'London couldn't handle
what we were doing with Columbus, but we paved the way so that the British
will be more receptive to American-style dining.'
With Mezzaluna, Grossman is wisely attempting a more recognisable and tame
concept - the New York-style Italian trattoria, one of the biggest American
restaurant trends of the late 80s which has already manifested itself in
Britain at such restaurants as Joe Allen's Orso in Exeter Street, Covent
Garden and The Blueprint Cafe in Butler's Wharf, east London.
True to the foody spirit, Grossman has brought over Marco Divina, the chef
from the original Mezzaluna in New York, and is giving him full charge of
the kitchen. There's an emphasis on lighter eating - 'almost no meat, just a
little bit of olive oil, and not a cream sauce in sight,' says Grossman -
and on reasonable prices. He expects diners to spend about Pounds 12.50 at
lunch and Pounds 17.50 at dinner.
'London has cheap-and-cheerful restaurants, and really serious and pricey
restaurants like the River Cafe and Lincontro, but nothing in between. This
city needs affordable, good quality food in an effervescent and entertaining
setting. That's what they'll get here,' says Grossman.
Like Mezzaluna, Bob Peyton's Criterion Brasserie is located in central
London in a recently restored historic building - Thomas Verity's 1874
neo-Byzantine Criterion Building in Piccadilly. And like Grossman's
restaurant, the Criterion features US-influenced Italian cuisine, and
emphasizes reasonable prices in a lively and stylish ambiance.
The strongest difference between the two restaurants is their owners'
visions of them. Unlike Grossman, Peyton says he does not buy the US
restaurant hype: 'The star chef is dead. Foodies are boring. Foodies are
people who live in America and have to 'ooh and aah' every time they see an
arugula leaf. That's not what 99 per cent of the people who eat are about.
That's not why I go out to eat.'
In spite of Peyton's protestations, his new restaurant does have a foody air
about it. Its husband-and-wife chef team, Gale Gand and Rick Tramanto, are
Americans with impressive culinary pedigrees who have put items such as
roast garlic squid with lemon oil, and charred beef carpaccio - if that is
not a contradiction in terms - on their menu.
The Criterion certainly draws on current US dining trends and will probably
go far in popularising those innovations in Britain. It is going to take
some time, though. The Criterion's most popular menu item in its bumper
first month of business? Steak and chips.

spokesman, will take on the Wales portfolio from Ms Ann Clywd.
Ms Clywd now occupies the shadow national heritage position which was
vacated by Mr Gould when he quit in October over Labour's policy on Europe.
The Labour leader has appointed Mr Gavin Strang, an agricultural scientist,
to take over the agriculture portfolio.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Scots CBI attacks A1 upgrading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE upgrading of the A1 road between Newcastle upon Tyne and Edinburgh to
dual carriageway throughout its length would be a 'white elephant', the
Confederation of British Industry in Scotland said yesterday.
Mr David MacLehose, director of the CBI in Scotland, told the Commons
Scottish affairs committee in Edinburgh that upgrading the 122-mile stretch
of the A1 'would yield minimum or negative returns on investment'. So far
only 31 of the 122 miles have been turned into dual carriageway.
The CBI was lukewarm because most Scottish exported goods originated in the
west of Scotland and used the A74/M74 from Glasgow to reach England
including east coast ports such as Hull. Mr MacleHose said it was vital that
the Scottish Office, responsible for roads in Scotland, completed the
project to upgrade the whole A74/M74 to motorway standard as soon as
possible.
In March, just before the general election, the government announced that it
would be 'desirable' for the 91 miles of single carriageway on the A1
between Newcastle and Edinburgh to be improved to dual carriageway.
Previously the Scottish Office had argued that traffic did not justify total
dualling. There is as yet no project to make the entire road dual
carriageway. Work on a number of other improvements is going ahead.
Mr George Kynoch, Conservative MP for Kincardine and Deeside, suggested that
it was desirable to spread the traffic load and double the number of routes
available to goods traffic. But Mr MacLehose told him that CBI Scotland saw
the priority elsewhere. 'It doesn't mean that we wouldn't like to see it go
ahead at some stage.'

TIME Warner, the US media and entertainment group, yesterday filed a lawsuit
against the US government and the Federal Communications Commission, seeking
to declare a cable television regulatory law unconstitutional, writes Alan
Friedman in New York.
The lawsuit claims the new regulations - passed in October, over the veto of
President George Bush - violate First Amendment rights of free speech. There
is increasing opposition to the law among US cable operators, who fear their
ability to charge higher rates to consumers will be hit.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Money Markets: European futures rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN cash and futures markets continued to reflect the cautious belief
that interest rates will be cut, with sterling and French franc futures
prices rising several basis points, writes James Blitz.
In the UK, the government's narrow victory in the parliamentary vote on
whether to move towards European economic union removed the one serious
obstacle to more reductions in base rates.
Dealers continue to assume that another cut will accompany the Autumn
Statement on November 12. The December sterling futures contract closed up 8
basis points at 93.54 yesterday, implying that three-month money will be at
6.5 per cent by the year-end. According to one clearing bank dealer, a move
to 6 per cent base rate would leave three-month money at about that level.
However, one discount house dealer argued strongly yesterday that the market
is too optimistic, and that a base rate cut is most likely to be of the
order of only  1/2 percentage point.
In favour of this, he argued that sterling is weak, the dollar has a lot of
pent-up strength, and a larger cut would push the pound down sharply; that
the authorities would be far wiser to leave the market wanting more cuts;
that the last cut reflected political panic rather than the government's
clear willingness to ease policy; and that the outlook for the Bundesbank
easing in the long term is increasingly uncertain.
French franc futures reflected the more cautious tone of a currency bound by
the constraints of the exchange rate mechanism. The French prime minister's
recent statement that more rate cuts are on the way continued to impress the
market. The March franc contract closed 7 basis points higher at 91.95,
implying that three-month cash will fall some 140 basis points in the next
five months. The rate for three-month cash has already dipped about  1/8 ,
to 9 7/16 per cent, in the last two days.
Activity in German markets was quiet. Call money eased slightly from
Wednesday's levels to between 8.80 and 8.90 per cent. The market was
unaffected by comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president,
about the need to keep credit conditions tight. 'It is not a good idea to
opt for a stimulative policy, only to brake again because inflation is out
of control,' he said.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Speculation on realignment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATION that another realignment of the European exchange rate mechanism
could take place before the end of the year dominated trading yesterday,
pushing the higher-yielding ERM currencies down against the D-Mark, writes
James Blitz.
Although tensions inside the ERM have eased considerably since the crisis of
early autumn, a shadow has continued to hang over the weaker currencies in
the system, the Spanish peseta, Portuguese escudo and Irish punt.
All three currencies remain close to their ERM floors against the D-Mark,
while dealers have continued to question whether their current rates are
competitive enough against the strengthened German currency.
Although German money market rates are coming down, there are fears that the
Bundesbank will not ease rates as quickly as the markets anticipate, keeping
interest rates in those countries with weaker European currencies
unsustainably high.
Yesterday Mr Helmut Schlesinger underlined the degree of restraint in
Bundesbank policy by saying that most countries had budget deficits that
were too big, and that the Maastricht criterion that deficits should be 3
per cent of GDP should be narrowed.
Speculation about new ERM parities was fuelled by a newspaper interview with
Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister, in which he said a further
realignment in the ERM would probably be needed before the end of the year
to restore stability. 'We are absolutely open to all changes of parities,'
he said. Later in the day, Ireland announced that it would be lifting all
its remaining exchange controls by the end of this year.
Both moves may suggest that pressure is being put on Germany to agree to a
realignment in tandem with the cut in official rates that is anticipated by
the end of the year.
The Italian lira's strong performance against the D-Mark has also led to
speculation that it could re-enter the ERM at the same time as a
realignment. The lira yesterday closed at L854.6 per D-Mark, some 15 per
cent above its September low.
Mr Solchaga's comments, and their implications for German rates, were cited
as one reason why the dollar rose to DM1.5845 yesterday, its highest level
since the historic low was reached on September 2. The dollar later ended in
London at DM1.5785, up around a pfennig on the day. In New York it finished
higher at DM1.5830.
Speculation on German rates also helped sterling. The currency was boosted
by the UK government's narrow victory in the vote on European union in the
House of Commons, but later fell back to close at DM2.4275, down  3/4
pfennig on balance.
However, the D-Mark appreciated against the weaker ERM currencies. The
peseta slipped to a close of Pta71.58 from a previous Pta71.17.

FT  06 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): AT&amp;T news and good jobs data
boost Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets overcame early declines and rebounded strongly in heavy
trading, aided by good jobs figures and news of AT&amp;T's big investment in
McCaw Cellular, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 20.80 ahead at 3,243.84, well
above its low for the day of 3,215. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.23 at
418.34, while the Nasdaq composite climbed 8.56 to 614.08. Turnover on the
New York SE was heavy at 219.7m shares.
Although prices opened lower, buyers quickly returned to the market in the
belief that Wednesday's post-election sell-off had been overdone. Investors
were aided by a better than expected weekly jobless claims report, which
showed that the number of people claiming state unemployment insurance fell
16,000 in the week ending October 24.
The market drew strength from the claims data, which suggested that today's
key employment report for October could beat expectations. Analysts expect
non-farm payrolls to have risen by between 25,000 and 50,000 last month, and
the perception is growing that labour market conditions may be improving
steadily.
Sentiment was also buoyed by Wednesday afternoon's announcement that AT&amp;T,
the country's largest telecommunications supplier, was spending Dollars
3.8bn for a 33 per cent equity stake in McCaw Cellular and an option for
voting control of the wireless communications company.
The deal, which will put AT&amp;T in direct competition with the regional Bell
companies for the first time since the Bell system was dismantled in 1984,
was greeted warmly by investors, who bid AT&amp;T stock up Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 44 3/8 on turnover of 4.8m shares. McCaw, traded on the Nasdaq
market, jumped Dollars 5 1/4 , or 20 per cent, to Dollars 32 in turnover of
8.6m shares.
Retailers were in the news following the release of their October sales
figures. The Gap dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 30 1/4 in busy trading
after reporting a 2 per cent rise in same-store sales, much smaller than
expected, and K-mart declined Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 27 3/8 on a
disappointing 2.9 per cent increase in same-store sales.
In contrast, Wal-Mart edged Dollars  1/8 higher to Dollars 62 1/8 on news of
a 16 per cent improvement in same-store sales and Woolworth firmed Dollars
1/8 to Dollars 33 1/2 on a 4.3 per cent rise in total domestic sales.
Philip Morris advanced Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 78 5/8 in turnover of 4.8m
shares after a high-profile and potentially costly smoker's lawsuit filed
against the company in New Jersey was dropped by the plaintiffs.
Canada
THE TORONTO market ended with a slightly easier bias after active trading
that was boosted by a large block trade in Westcoast Energy shares.
The TSE 300 index was 5.0 easier at 3,339.7 and declining issues led rises
by 306 to 254. Volume came to 37m shares valued at CDollars 366m.
Brascan said its third-quarter loss widened to 61 cents a share from 3
cents. The stock dipped CDollars 1/2 to CDollars 17 5/8.

FT  06 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Helsinki's surge confounds investors -
A rally was to be expected after a dismal three years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Helsinki Stock Exchange has put in an extraordinary run over the last
two months, with the Hex index rising by more than 50 per cent since its 5
1/2 -year low of 548 registered on September 4. On two consecutive days
earlier this week the index jumped by 5 per cent; after profit-taking
yesterday it closed 11 points down at 827.6.
After three years of steadily falling share prices, a rally was to be
expected. Most observers, however, have been caught out by the strength of
the surge, particularly as economic fundamentals have not altered that
dramatically. For many, the big question now is when the downward correction
will come.
Much of the impetus for the recent rally has come from a steep downward
trend in interest rates in the last month. The key three-month Helibor rate
has fallen from more than 16 per cent to 11.6 per cent.
The relaxation of monetary policy is the direct result of reduced pressure
on the markka, following the announcement of the government's austerity
programme on October 14. Until the measures were announced, interest rates
had to be kept high to protect the currency as international confidence in
the Finnish currency had been badly eroded by the government's decision to
float the markka on September 8.
Observers acknowledge that the stock market is anticipating an improvement
in the Finnish economy. 'This is more of a hope than a fact,' says Mr Juhani
Erma, head of the Finnish stock exchange.
Nevertheless, there are indications that the economy is at least on the
turn. The recent batch of eight-month figures from the corporate sector have
revealed reduced losses if not actual profits - at least for
export-orientated companies, which have benefited from the two devaluations.
At the same time the Finance Ministry has come out with a report that
suggests the economy is 'regaining its balance', spurred by an expected 2
per cent increase in GNP next year and a strong rise in exports.
Other factors are also at work. One is the liberalisation of the rules on
foreign share ownership which will take effect on January 1, 1993. This
move, which removes the distinction between free and restricted shares, is
expected to prompt a big increase in foreign buying, as international equity
portfolios are adjusted to the new situation.
Another factor is the planned overhaul of the tax system, which will improve
the attraction of investing in equities, while making it less advantageous
to have money on deposit in the bank.
One of the most striking aspects of the recent equity rally has been the
sharp rise in turnover. During the summer, trading volumes of just FM20m
(Dollars 4m) a day were typical. Recently, however, turnover has regularly
been in the FM50m to FM100m range.
The group to benefit most from the upturn has been the banking sector, which
has jumped 101 per cent over the last month. But it is a special case,
partly because bank share prices had fallen so low, and partly because there
is a highly speculative element to the current buying interest. It is
certainly no indication that the sector's problems are over.
Two other groups which stand out are metals, up 44.8 per cent this year, and
forestry, up 14.9 per cent on the back of improved international
competitiveness following the devaluations.
The cynical will suggest that it has all happened too quickly. No major
corporate reports or key economic indicators are due out in the next two
weeks, so it is hard to see where further sustenance will come from in the
immediate future. Some would say a relapse was inevitable, perhaps even in
the next few days.
The biggest cloud on the horizon is the current negotiations over 1993 wage
levels. It remains to be seen if the government's proposal to freeze wages
will be accepted by the unions, in view of the expected sharp fall in
disposable incomes as a result of the austerity package.
If the government has to back down to any significant extent, the markka
could once again be under pressure. That could force interest rates back up
and sink stock market confidence almost as fast as it has risen.

FT  06 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Special situations enliven
mixed day's trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY significant movements were restricted to special situations yesterday as
most bourses closed mixed, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was lifted by short-covering, and an earnings upgrade for the
steel and engineering group, Preussag. The DAX index ended 8.24 higher at
1,480.93 as turnover rose from DM3.6bn to DM4.2bn.
Deutsche Bank Research said that after Wednesday's analysts' meeting at
Preussag, it had revised its EPS forecast from DM27.50 to DM31 a share for
1991/92 and from DM25 to DM27.50 for 1992/93. This followed an earlier,
downward revision by the broker three or four weeks ago.
Preussag jumped DM9.50 to DM324.00 for a cumulative gain of DM20.50 this
week. The group has reduced its dependence on steel and engineering with
other divisions, particularly in telecommunications, which have been doing
considerably better than some people expected.
Mannesmann rose DM4 to DM204.80, and hit DM206 after hours in London on an
unlikely story that British Telecom might take it over. Analysts pooh-poohed
the story.
PARIS moved in a fairly narrow range after the rise earlier in the week took
the CAC-40 index above the 1,800 level. The CAC-40 index ended little
changed at 1,804.70, up 0.63. Turnover stood at FFr2.37bn, of which FFr1.7bn
was generated by CAC-40 stocks.
Rhone-Poulenc CIs rose FFr25 or 5 per cent to FFr527 on bargain-hunting
after their recent fall, linked to the fall in shares in its unit, Institut
Merieux International. There were also rumours that the non-voting CIs were
being supported by state-controlled institutions to enable the French
government to price its planned partial privatisation of Rhone-Poulenc at
FFr535-FFr540 for each new voting share.
Carrefour rose FFr15 to FFr2,410 in reasonable volume of 31,090 shares
following a positive meeting with some analysts.
MILAN ended lower as operators started to close their positions ahead of the
close of the account next week. The Comit index fell 9.09 to 429.49 as
turnover continued to drop back after the recent high levels. Turnover
yesterday was estimated at around Wednesday's L186bn.
In its latest market report, Kleinwort Benson recommends selling into
strength since it believes that the market's performance in the last month
has more than discounted the recent fall in interest rates and the recently
acquired government credibility. It adds that fundamentals remain negative.
Fiat slipped L107 to L4,441. After the close, car industry data showed that
Fiat's share of the domestic market fell to 43.8 per cent in October, down
from 46.2 per cent in October 1991.
BRUSSELS saw the food retailer, Delhaize, fall BFr120 or 7 per cent to
BFr1,585 in heavy volume of 152,900 shares. Dealers blamed the drop on a
fall in the shares of its US unit, Food Lion, ahead of the showing of an
unflattering film, shot secretly at Food Lion, on the ABC television channel
yesterday evening. Delhaize was also hit by news that unions in Belgium
might stage strikes in December in support of non-unionised Food Lion
employees. The Bel-20 index dropped 9.77 to 1,146.15.
AMSTERDAM closed mixed as more gloomy corporate news hit the market. The CBS
Tendency index closed at 102.6, up 0.3.
Philips dropped Fl 1.70 or 8.9 per cent to Fl 17.40 after announcing a
third-quarter loss of Fl 154m, following the release of its third-quarter
earnings. Its music and video recording subsidiary PolyGram shed 50 cents to
Fl 44.70.
KLM picked up 40 cents to Fl 22.50 after it announced a 12 per cent net
profit decline in its fiscal second quarter to Fl 170.1m.
Akzo added another Fl 2.10 to Fl 133.70 in the wake of its
better-than-expected third-quarter results announced earlier in the week.
ZURICH extended its rally to a fifth day as the higher dollar encouraged
domestic and foreign investors. In spite of profit-taking, the SMI index
ended another 10.0 higher at 1,951.5.
OSLO inched up 0.19 to 346.29, flattened by lower oil prices although the
stronger dollar lifted the shipping index by 5.30 to 317.68, and the
state-backed rescue for Elkem, the troubled metals group, left the latter's
A shares NKr3.50 higher at NKr17.50.

FT  06 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Insurer in block trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
COMPOSITE insurance group Sun Alliance featured as the market's most heavily
traded stock as US insurer Chubb sold a block of 47.5m Sun Alliance shares
into the UK market as its part of a mutual shift in shareholdings between
the two groups.
Under the terms of an agreed shift of strategic stakes, Chubb said it would
lower its holding in Sun from around 9 per cent to some 3 per cent, while
Sun Alliance's stake in Chubb would be reduced from the 9 per cent level
down to around 5 per cent.
Chubb's sale of Sun Alliance shares was undertaken by three broking houses,
SG Warburg Securities, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Three brokers were
said to have bought the Sun Alliance shares for 304p each and placed them
with various institutions at 308p a share.
Dealers said the stock was placed easily within an hour or so. Sun shares
dropped back to close 12 weaker at 314p, with turnover accelerating to reach
an extremely heavy 118m shares by the end of the day.
As its part of the deal Sun said it intended to sell 3.4m Chubb shares via a
secondary offering to US investors by the same brokers involved in the UK
sale of Sun shares.
The Chubb sale is the latest in a series of significant share liquidations
by Sun Alliance, which have raised around Pounds 484m for the insurance
group. Last week the group sold a block of 9.5m shares, or around 8 per
cent, in London &amp; Manchester, the life assurance group. In late September
Sun sold most of its 14 per cent interest in Commercial Union.
Cellular stocks busy
Confirmation that BT is selling its 22 per cent stake in McCaw Cellular, the
biggest of the US cellular phone companies, to AT&amp;T, taking a substantial
profit in the process, triggered a sharp rise in BT shares.
Other UK cellular stocks also made rapid progress, notably the Securicor
group of companies, as the stock market grew more confident that BT may soon
move to acquire the minority 40 per cent holding in Cellnet, the UK cellular
group. BT already owns 60 per cent of Cellnet.
The steep rise in BT also helped shares of Vodafone improve as institutions
began to revalue UK cellular phone businesses.
BT 'old' shares opened sharply higher at 393p, after terms of the McCaw/AT&amp;T
deal were revealed, but later turned back to close a net 5 1/2 up at 382p.
The 'new' shares opened at 293p but came off to close 5 ahead on balance at
278p. Turnover in the two stocks reached 10m and 11m shares respectively.
Securicor shares extended Wednesday's excellent performance, closing a
further 57 stronger at 925p.
The more widely traded Securicor 'A' stock ended 58 higher at 620p after
very heavy turnover of 1.6m shares. Security Services jumped 57 to 520p.
Vodafone, the other UK cellular phone company, climbed 13 to 391p.
Telecoms specialists viewed the McCaw sale as a good deal, with one analyst
pointing out that BT had emerged with a profit and could now move towards
acquiring outright control of Cellnet. 'McCaw was a big mistake by BT and
they have been allowed to get off the hook with a profit, and the means to
effectively swap their holding in McCaw for the rest of Cellnet,' said an
analyst.
BAT strong
A follow-up to strong results and reassuring legal news helped BAT
Industries put on one of the best performances in the FT-SE 100 Index
yesterday. The shares were up 15 for most of the day and jumped a further 8
in late afternoon trading to close 23 ahead at 937p after 3.3m traded.
The tobacco and insurance group's good business prospects prompted profit
upgradings by many brokers. County NatWest raised its forecasts to Pounds
1.55bn from Pounds 1.5bn for 1992 and to Pounds 1.8bn from Pounds 1.7bn for
1993. Analyst Mr Simon Willis added that if the average sterling exchange
rate was adjusted to Dollars 1.50 the 1993 figure would rise to Pounds 2bn.
Then, in the afternoon, news broke that a smoking liability case hanging
over US group Philip Morris had been withdrawn. Analysts had been sceptical
for some time that the plaintiff would be able to sue successfully.
Nevertheless, the possibility had cast a pall over tobacco companies with
business in the US, and one sector specialist said: 'If BAT had not been so
strong in the past few days it would have risen a lot more than 8 points on
the news.'
Rothmans International also benefited from the news, closing 13 higher at
620p.
BP's third-quarter figures came as a pleasant surprise to the market, with
replacement cost profits of Pounds 172m at the top end of expectations.
'This is a step in the right direction,' said Mr Nick Clayton at Smith New
Court, although the analyst added: 'There is still a very long way to go.'
Strauss Turnbull, a long-time bear of BP, said: 'The debt is still rising,
the shares are a sell.' BP stock settled 2 higher at 225p and turnover
reached 13m shares.
Other oil issues came under renewed pressure as oil prices continued to lose
ground.
Expectations that Hanson would withdraw its bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall in
the face of the higher Tomkins approach proved correct.
However, Hansons' announcement came too late to affect share prices. Hanson
and Tomkins rose 3 apiece to 232p and 228p respectively. RHM eased a
halfpenny to 262p.
Pharmaceuticals group Smith &amp; Nephew saw its heaviest turnover for at least
five years, with Smith New Court said to be buying between 9m and 10m shares
on behalf of an institutional client. Large blocks of shares recorded at
157p and 158 1/2 p on the Seaq electronic ticker suggested that the
marketmaker had taken on stock at the lower price and placed it at the
higher. The shares appreciated 4 1/2 to 157 1/2 p on final turnover of more
than 17m.
Dollar-earning pharmaceuticals were held back by the Clinton factor. Glaxo
eased 3 to 819p, SmithKline Beecham 'A' drifted 4 to 536p and Wellcome was
taken back 9 to 1009p.
ICI fell in early trading on news of a fire at one of its plants in
northwest England. However, the stock recovered, helped by news that its
paints unit had bought a network of trade branches in France to expand its
European decorative paint business, and ended a net 8 firmer at 1048p.
Chemicals group Croda International was held back as Hoare Govett withdrew
its buy stance on the stock. Croda closed a penny lower at 214p.
TI Group gave up 15 to 292p on reports that Hoare Govett had become the
latest broker to reduce its current year profits estimates. The broker is
said to have advised investors to switch out of TI and into VSEL, which
closed 8 better at 463p, also boosted by an order from British Gas.
Industry figures showing an 8 per cent rise in October car sales helped Lex
Service add 7 at 220p. Bid speculation continued in APV, helping the shares
gain another 4 to 102p, with Siemens, the German heavy engineering and
electricals group mentioned as a possible suitor for APV.
A combination of a profits downgrade and a stock overhang sent Weir Group
into retreat. The shares closed 20 down at 514p.
Among leisure stocks, Rank Organisation was in demand on speculation that
the company would soon announce a deal to sell its 15 provincial hotels and
one in London to a private operator for around Pounds 65m. The shares jumped
19 to 619p in trade of 1.5m.
Compass Group gained 4 to 459p after the company announced two acquisitions.
Analysts said the purchases indicated that Compass was unlikely to restart
talks to acquire Forte subsidiary Gardner Merchant. Shares in Forte
responded by easing 4 to 158p.

FT  06 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities advance in higher volume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RELIEF THAT both the presidential election in the US and the Maastricht
debate in the UK are now over and done with brought the buyers back into the
London stock market yesterday. Gains in the dollar stocks were restrained by
Wall Street's reluctance so far to make a definite response to President
Clinton's success at the polls.
But firmness in domestic issues signalled the stock market's belief that,
now that its Maastricht proposals have won parliamentary support, Mr John
Major's Conservative government will introduce measures to restimulate the
UK economy. A batch of significant corporate developments also helped the
equity market.
The FT-SE Index gained 19.4 to 2,711.1. But the market made a slow start,
dipping 10.3 in early trading as London shied away from the near 30-point
fall overnight in New York's Dow Average.
Share prices rallied quickly, however, when the stock index futures opened
for business, and although trading volume was light at first, the Footsie
had climbed by more than 21 points by midsession.
London faltered a little in the afternoon and increased turnover towards the
close indicated that some investors had taken the opportunity to cash in on
the morning's profits. The New York stock market made another sluggish start
but brightened later, to show a gain of 7.56 on the Dow as London closed for
business.
Strategists appear to have divided into two groups; those who have
confidence in prospects for the re-stimulation of the economies of the
leading industrial nations, and those who fear that the UK stock market has
been overbought and could be due for a sharp correction. The two groups
showed their hands yesterday in conflicting strategies in the equity and
stock index futures markets.
Among the international stocks, oil shares steadied from the depression
caused by fears that President Clinton may tighten environmental
requirements. However, there was only a mild response to trading results
from British Petroleum. Attention was focused on the telecommunications
sector by the news that BT (British Telecommunications) will sell its 22 per
cent stake in McCaw Cellular Communications, of the US. Traders immediately
began to seek a new target for BT in the cellular phone market.
A firm dollar helped many overseas earning stocks. BAT Industries, which
reported profits this week, came in for renewed speculative support, and ICI
regained more of the ground lost over the past fortnight.
But the multi-national drug stocks lagged behind the market as worries over
the new US President's likely policies towards medical funding resurfaced.
Glaxo, the front-runner of the sector, rallied in late dealings, however, as
London grew more hopeful regarding the outlook on Wall Street.
Among domestic stocks, there were gains in the retail and store sectors,
which continued to look for early cuts in UK base rates. Banking shares also
found buyers again after trading uneasily over the past few trading
sessions.
In late dealings, the stock market's hopes for recovery in the domestic
economy were encouraged by the disclosure that UK car sales rose by 8 per
cent in October, the first sign of hope from a struggling industry.

<TEXT>
RELIEF over the UK government's success in the Maastricht debate led to
renewed speculation about a cut in base rates and boosted activity in the
derivatives market, writes Joel Kibazo.
A poor opening of 2,717 for the December FT-SE future contract was quickly
followed by selling, which sent the contract to 2,713 as dealers focused on
a dull overnight performance for Wall Street and Tokyo stocks.
This proved to be the day's low as speculation about an interest rate cut
gained the upper hand and led to a recovery in the fortunes of December. The
session's high was reached just after lunch when December traded at 2,745,
before profit-taking caused a brief loss of momentum.
A quick burst of buying at the end of the day saw December finish at 2,739,
up 11 from the previous session and around 12 points above its estimated
fair value premium to cash of about 17. Turnover was almost 8,000 contracts.
In traded options, total volume of 28,309 lots was mildly below Wednesday's
figure, although turnover in the stock options remained high. Asda was the
most actively traded stock option again, on 3,842 lots, with the July 35
puts the busiest series. This was followed by BP, which yesterday reported
third-quarter results. It traded 3,735 contracts. Some 1,284 lots were dealt
in British Aerospace. BT and Grand Metropolitan were also busy.

FT  06 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls marginally
in futures-related activity
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices were influenced by futures-led activity and small-lot trading,
the Nikkei average falling marginally in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The index lost 33.61 to 17,031.59 after fluctuating in negative territory
for most of the session, recording a day's low of 16,903.01 in the morning,
and a high of 17,122.67 just before the close on arbitrage buying.
Volume edged up to 180m shares from 153m, reflecting some buying from public
funds and investment trusts. Declines led advances by 462 to 420, with 174
issues unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section stocks slipped
5.48 to 1,288.37. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was off just 0.48 at
1,031.59.
Mr Yasuhiko Jinza, manager of stock investments at Nippon Life, the leading
life assurer, said that while a US economic recovery through fiscal spending
could be good for Japanese exporters, Mr Clinton's calls for a tougher
stance on trade were a cause for concern.
Institutional investors remained on the sidelines. Rumours that the Ministry
of Finance and the Bank of Japan had made inquiries about share prices
prompted speculation that financial authorities were eager to stop excessive
selling. Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said buying orders by trust
banks were raised to the 17,000 level from 16,500, also indicating support.
High-technology blue chips were weaker on concern about earnings due to
currency fluctuations. Hitachi receded Y10 to Y728 and Fujitsu Y6 to Y551,
but Toshiba gained Y5 at Y603 on foreign buying.
Speculators returned to theme stocks related to nuclear fusion. Shoko, the
chemical wholesaler, was the most active issue of the day, forging ahead Y61
to Y570. The company trades in deuterium, a chemical used for nuclear fusion
experiments. Aisin Seiki rose Y20 to Y1,160 on the same theme.
Pharmaceutical issues were lower on profit-taking, but Sankyo defied the
trend, advancing Y30 to Y2,300 on forecasts of firm growth.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 23.74 to 18,503.59 in volume of 11.3m shares.
Aoyama Trading, a men's clothing retailer, rose Y110 to Y7,540 on hopes of
an increase in sales of its cheaper office worker suits.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets were mostly stronger yesterday.
HONG KONG finished at a record high but profit-taking brought it back
considerably from its intraday peak. The Hang Seng index closed 22.40 up at
6,347.77, after 6,397.27.
Turnover rose from HKDollars 3.53bn to HKDollars 4.43bn. HSBC gained 50
cents at HKDollars 66 on a rerating by UK funds.
TAIWAN closed sharply higher in a rebound from recent losses. There were
reports that financial authorities were considering removing a ban on
selling of shares bought earlier on the same day.
The weighted index ended 87.36, or 2.5 per cent, higher at 3,593.41.
Turnover expanded to TDollars 10.22bn from Wednesday's thin total of
TDollars 6.92bn.
SEOUL was pushed up by a hectic buying spree centred on financial shares and
the soon-to-be-liberalised Kepco. The composite index climbed 12.31 to
631.31. Turnover rose from Won601.47bn to Won771.83bn.
Kepco, due to be opened to foreigners partially later this month, closed
limit-up.
KUALA LUMPUR ended well below the day's highs on profit-taking. The
composite index was finally a net 1.02 up at 660.35, its sixth consecutive
record closing high. Turnover soared to a record 429.1m shares from 331.4m.
JAKARTA saw continued interest in banking shares, as foreigners returned to
the market. Bank Bali appreciated Rp75 to Rp3,500, but the index was flat at
304.5.
AUSTRALIA dipped in morning profit-taking, rallied on a rise in the domestic
dollar, and closed flat with the All Ordinaries index just 1.2 higher at
1,432.3. NEW ZEALAND had brewer Lion Nathan up 9 cents at NZDollars 3.75 on
higher profits as the NZSE-40 index put on 8.55 at 1,380.75.
BANGKOK's banks and finance and securities houses closed off intraday highs
as the SET index added 6.16 at 963.03, but turnover was the third highest
ever at Bt20.31bn. SINGAPORE volume rose from 183.22m to 229.79m shares,
against a March 1991 all-time high of 269.16m, as the Straits Times
Industrial index shed 4.81 to 1,416.65.
BOMBAY fell 4.5 per cent after Tata Iron and Steel, a market leader,
announced a 66 per cent drop in first-half profits. The BSE index fin-ished
131.35 lower at 2,794.83. Tata Steel plummeted Rs43.75 to Rs260.

FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Leeds down after provision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BAD debt provision of Pounds 105.3m dented profits at Leeds Permanent, the
UK's fifth biggest building society, during the year to September 30.
Pre-tax profits fell almost 20 per cent to Pounds 152.7m (Pounds 190.2m).
The society said that the provision, up from Pounds 44.3m in 1990-91,
reflected the effects of recession and rising unemployment on the housing
market.
A further consequence was a deduction of Pounds 38.3m (up from Pounds 13.6m
in 1990-91) to reflect irrecoverable interest.
However, Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew, said he was convinced these figures would be better than average for
the sector. 'The provision increase was what I expected,' he said. The Leeds
was reporting on a financial year that included the difficult fourth quarter
of 1991.
The society said the number of repossessed properties on its books had
increased from 3,000 to 4,000. The number of long-term arrears cases had
grown, but short-term arrears had decreased by 22 per cent.
'I don't have to tell you that it wasn't a good year to sell mortgages,'
said Mr Mike Blackburn, chief executive, 'completions were down from around
114,000 in the previous year to just under 100,000.'
'It is perfectly clear that when the market improves it will do so slowly,'
he added. 'We are not optimistic that 1993 will be much better, and all our
business planning has been based on very conservative assumptions of future
market activity.'
Nevertheless, operating profits (before provisions) increased from Pounds
234.5m to Pounds 258m over the year. Assets increased from Pounds 16.2bn to
Pounds 18.3bn. The Leeds merged with the Southdown Building Society during
the year, adding 37 new branches and 150,000 customers in the process.

FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Compass buys Travellers Fare for Pounds 32m
 -Caterer to take Casey Jones and BR sandwich into the workplace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH Rail sandwich, already a cultural icon, is poised to leave the
station platform and enter the workplace.
Compass Group, the catering and hospitals company, yesterday announced it
was paying Pounds 31.7m for Travellers Fare, which sells sandwiches and
other refreshments at stations and airports and was originally bought out by
management from British Rail in 1988.
Mr Francis Mackay, Compass' chief executive, said the company was interested
in developing the retailing brands established by Travellers Fare. These
include hamburger outlet Casey Jones, Upper Crust sandwich shops and cafes.
Compass intends to market these outlets, usually clumped together in 'food
courts', to contract catering clients like hospitals, universities and
private companies.
'We want to take the brands into these places, improve the throughput and
lift margins,' he said.
Travellers Fare operates nearly 300 oulets and employs 3,000 people. Pre-tax
profits in the year to March 31 were Pounds 3.6m from turnover of about
Pounds 80m. The 1988 buy-out was led by venture capital groups 3i, CINVen
and Charterhouse Development Capital.
About half of sales come from branded outlets, with the rest from Quicksnack
kiosks at smaller stations. Travellers Fare only operates fixed-site
outlets, while British Rail does on-train catering.
In a separate transaction, Compass is buying Letheby &amp; Christopher, caterer
to leading events like Ascot and Glyndebourne. Compass will pay Pounds 7.3m
for the company, which is being sold by First National Finance Corporation.
Letheby &amp; Christopher made pre-tax profits of Pounds 600,000 in the year to
October 31 from turnover of about Pounds 20m.
Compass is funding the purchases through existing bank facilities. Net
borrowings will increase from Pounds 34m to Pounds 72m. This will bring
interest cover down from eight to five times, according to Mr Mackay.
He said the acquisitions were likely to be earnings neutral this year.
Management would be retained to run the companies as distinct units within
Compass.
According to Mr Mackay, British Rail sandwiches will not be served at the
Institute of Directors, another Letheby &amp; Christopher client.
Compass has expressed interest in the overseas portion of Gardner Merchant -
the Forte contract catering arm it recently failed to acquire. But Mr Mackay
said yesterday it was 'very unlikely' it would buy any part of Gardner
Merchant. It is understood Forte is considering a management buy-out bid for
all of Gardner.

FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Putting a reputation on the line - Greg
Hutchings, the man behind the latest RHM bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GREG Hutchings has a very clear idea of what the conglomerate he has been
building for the last nine years is in business to make. It is not bicycles
from Tomkins' Murray operation in the US; it is not hand guns at Smith &amp;
Wesson; and it will not be cakes or bread should his Pounds 935m bid for
Ranks Hovis McDougall be successful.
'What we are trying to do is create a better product than other companies.
The product is better capital growth and dividend growth,' says the 45
year-old Hutchings. 'Our investors are our customers.'
To drum home this message Hutchings has been criss-crossing the City with
evangelical zeal preaching the Tomkins gospel to institutional investors.
After initial concern, many are born again believers or at least swinging
round to give him the benefit of the doubt. It is therefore all the more
surprising that he is so shaken and angered by dissenters in the flock.
One adviser said Hutchings was 'outraged', another that he was 'stunned',
when Tomkins' share price dropped 20 per cent last Thursday after he
announced the recommended bid and accompanying rights issue.
His former boss, Lord Hanson, yesterday said he would not increase his own
Pounds 790m bid as Tomkins' bid was already too high.
Hutchings put together his strategy 11 years ago after a clinical analysis
of what the stock market craves and how best to feed that craving. 'It is
better to pay a low price for something that is average and improve it than
to pay a high price for something that is growing very fast,' he says.
Mature businesses spread across a broad spectrum offered the lowest risk way
of providing growth.
In a sense he and Tomkins are a creation of the City. The investors fund his
deals and he sings their tune or, as he says, recognises that 'every quarter
the fund manager has to report to a man above him.'
A normally affable man, his composure has, however, been upset during the
bid; he testily rejects criticism he thinks is coming from some quarters
that Tomkins' impressive earnings and dividend growth has been achieved
'with mirrors.'
He steadfastly refuses to make any comments about Lord Hanson, having had to
live with the headline 'son of Hanson' since he arrived in the City. But
like it or not, comparisons are inevitable between the old and the new
masters of the takeover game.
When discussing Tomkins, however, he is usually relaxed, almost clubby. It
is a manner that many older captains of industry would simply not be able to
carry off.
Probe his strategy, however, or question whether making commodity bread or
branded groceries is really the same as selling bicycles and hand guns and
Hutchings becomes distinctly prickly.
Advisers say Hutchings, though a good listener, is simply not used to his
approach being questioned as rigorously as it has been since the bid.
The share price fall may have grated for another reason. Hutchings is
intensely competitive, and not just on the hockey field or at the table
tennis table. As one adviser says, 'he has a tremendous rivalry with
Williams Holdings.' For a long time there were two charts on Hutchings'
Putney office wall - one for Tomkins, one for Williams. Hutchings denies it
was there and says he is sick and tired of the comparisons.
The origin of this rivalry stems from the two groups' climb to FT-SE 100
status in the mid 1980s. The two have since parted company, with Williams'
star in relative decline after its failed bid for Racal Electronics last
year.
But they share common origins. As one Hutchings' adviser says, 'Hutchings
was one of the 1980s young turks - there were the Abdullahs at Evered; there
was Williams Holdings; there was Suter and David Abell. They were all small
acquisitive companies paddling around with high p/e's and they all had to
make a big jump.'
The jump that took Hutchings into the big time was the acquisition in 1986
of Pegler Hattersley, a huge Pounds 190m buy relative to Tomkins' then size.
One Hutchings characteristic that came through strongly during this bid, and
started to distinguish him from other young turks, was the meticulously
prepared presentation of his case to institutional shareholders.
This approach has not changed. Always the emphasis is on the strength of
management. Until now, he has successfully argued that this is why Tomkins
is rated at a premium to the market rather than as a group comprising mature
companies.
His presentational skills did not, initially at least convince Mr Ian
Duncan, the financial brain who is a crucial element of the Tomkins success.
Now Tomkins' managing director of finance and 'Greg's harshest critic as
well as his greatest fan,' Duncan had the opportunity to hire Hutchings but
turned him down.
'I had just started as the group finance director at Pentos in 1981,' he
says. 'Greg had a nice shiny MBA and wanted to get into corporate finance.
He had not got any experience but there was something about the guy. I told
him you are one of the few MBAs who looks like you will go off and buy a
company and run it but in the interim I suggest you go off and get some
experience.'
While Hutchings has clearly borrowed Hanson's clothes - in the way he buys
and manages mature companies, squeezing cash and keeping a tight control on
investment - there are important differences.
Tomkins, for example, has sold less than Pounds 10m worth of businesses
since 1984 while it has spent over Pounds 750m on acquisitions. But this is
where non-believers part company, questioning whether Tomkins actually grows
businesses after the initial phase of stripping out costs and installing
better financial control.
Hutchings says there is ample evidence to the contrary. The approach has not
changed since his first acquisition in 1984 of Ferraris, a run-down car
pistons distributor supplying a declining market. Firstly, new reporting
systems were put in and management incentives were increased. More
importantly, in the second phase, the management was encouraged to find new
markets. Ferraris is still growing, Hutchings says.
Hutchings' sensitivity is perhaps understandable. 'I love Tomkins and there
are people who are out to destroy it,' he says. For a conservative man who
is a self-confessed worrier, the RHM bid constitutes the biggest risk since
he bid for Pegler Hattersley five years ago. And then, he had a smaller
reputation on the line.

FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Fall in asset sales behind decline at
Burtonwood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURTONWOOD Brewery, the Cheshire-based real ale brewer, reported a 34 per
cent contraction in profits for the half year to September 26.
However, Mr John Dutton-Forshaw, chairman, was quick to point out that the
fall, from Pounds 3.05m to Pounds 2.02m, was entirely attributable to a
sharp reduction in asset disposals. Trading profits showed a 17 per cent
increase to Pounds 2.01m (Pounds 1.72m).
The 142 properties leased from Allied Breweries at the start of this year
contributed to a 14 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 25.7m with a similar
advance in volume. The group is still seeking to expand its estate either
through purchases or further leasing deals.
Reflecting the reduced contribution from asset sales, earnings per share
fell from 12.1p to 7.2p. If the sales were excluded, the earnings outcome
improved from 3.4p to 5p.
The interim dividend is maintained at 0.7p.

FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Ex-director moves to oust Hoskins chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DENNIS Bailey, a former non-executive director of Hoskins Brewery, the
Leicester-based real ale brewer, will today call on shareholders to support
moves to oust Mr Barrie Hoar, the company's chairman, and his brother, Mr
Robert Hoar, from the board.
Resolutions to remove the brothers have been tabled for an extraordinary
meeting on November 18.
Mr Richard Cattermole, chairman of Ryan Elizabeth, a pubs and hotels
operator, and a Hoskins shareholder, and his associate, Mr Jeremy Lea, are
seeking election in their place.
In a letter to shareholders today, Mr Bailey, who has an 8 per cent stake in
the company, says: 'If the resolutions fall, I fear that our investment will
be at further risk and the share price may fall again.'
Hoskins' profits record and lack of dividends had demonstrated that the Hoar
brothers had not been competent managers, Mr Bailey says. 'It is time for
change.'
In his letter, Mr Bailey says Mr Barrie Hoar was 'running Hoskins as if it
were a family business and not a public company'.
He adds that 'a misleading and false impression' of his own role at Hoskins
was given by Mr Hoar in a letter to shareholders last month.
He denies taking any active part in deals involving the acquisition of
Netherton Ales, and of Tatlocks, a catering company, both of which resulted
in losses, or of proposing the acquisition of Edencorp Leisure, now in
compulsory liquidation. In each case, Hoskins had been independently
advised, Mr Bailey says.
'It is in my view fair to say that in reality most decisions, both major and
minor, affecting Hoskins appear to be made by Mr Barrie Hoar and Mr Robert
Hoar,' he adds.
Mr Bailey says he resigned from Hoskins a year ago after a series of
differences with the Hoar brothers over their business conduct.

FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Chubb Corp and Sun Alliance in mutual stake
sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUN ALLIANCE and Chubb Corporation, the UK and US composite insurers,
yesterday sold the bulk of their stakes in each other. Sun Alliance said the
move was aimed at reducing its exposure to equities, and insurance equities
in particular.
Sun Alliance sold 3.4m Chubb shares in a secondary placing in the US
yesterday for roughly Pounds 180m, reducing its stake in the company to
roughly 5 per cent from 9 per cent.
Chubb sold 47.5m Sun Alliance shares for Dollars 225m (Pounds 145m) through
SG Warburg Securities, Morgan Stanley Securities and Goldman Sachs Equity
Securities (UK), lowering its 9 per cent stake to 3 per cent.
As a result of the sale, Chubb will have an after-tax gain of Dollars 50m in
its fourth quarter earnings.
Ms Gail Devlin, senior vice president at Chubb, said that the company wished
to reduce its exposure to sterling investments in line with its re-duced
liabilities in the currency.
Both companies, which have had cross-holdings in each other since the early
1980s, emphasised that the share sales reflected financial management
decisions and would not affect business relationships between the two
companies.
Over the past few months, Sun Alliance has been shedding its stakes in other
UK composite insurers. In September, it sold a 14 per cent stake in
Commercial Union for Pounds 280m and last week sold an 8 per cent in London
and Manchester for Pounds 24m, reducing its exposure to insurance shares by
roughly Pounds 500m.
Analysts noted that Sun Alliance's investment portfolio carries an unusually
heavy ratio of equities and property relative to shareholders' funds.
As of December 31 1991, Sun Alliance held equity and property investments
equal to 181 per cent of shareholders' funds, with most other insurance
composites having ratios of 120 to 140 per cent.

ARACRUZ Celulose, the world's largest eucalyptus pulp company, posted net
profits of Dollars 9.1m for the first three nine months, against Dollars 90m
losses a year ago.
Mr Mauro Molchansky, the company's chief financial officer, attributed the
improved performance to a recuperation in world pulp prices, a reduction of
local sales tax, an increase in production and economy of scale due to the
coming on stream of a Dollars 1.3bn expansion project.
Gross operating revenues for nine months were Dollars 345m, up 44 per cent
and production was 33 per cent up at 760,000 tonnes. 'We are now running at
full capacity and expect to hit 1m tonnes this year,' Mr Molchansky said.
Exports took more than 87 per cent of sales.

FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: By-word for glamour that fewer
people can afford / A look at the business difficulties confronting Porsche
at the top end of the car market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN spite of Porsche's frequent insistence that there is no reason why it
should end up as a subsidiary of BMW, Daimler-Benz or Volkswagen - the three
most likely buyers should the troubled German sports car maker be sold - the
omens are not positive.
Porsche, once a by-word for success and glamour, is encountering serious
business difficulties.
The car industry worldwide is feeling the effects of recession, but Porsche,
at the top end of the market, is more sensitive to the downturn than most. A
Porsche has become an extravagance which increasingly few people are able to
afford.
The scale of the family-owned company's problems was confirmed last week
when Porsche announced losses for the year to July of DM65.8m (Dollars
43.20m) compared to a profit of DM17.1m in 1990-91.
Turnover fell to DM2.7bn from DM3.1bn, while the number of cars sold during
the year slipped to 23,060 from 26,486 and export sales dropped particularly
sharply, by 26 per cent to 11,656.
Porsche last year sold fewer than half the number of cars sold in the
mid-1980s, when demand peaked at just short of 50,000 vehicles a year.
Porsche made clear that on all fronts - profits, orders and sales -
conditions had deteriorated since the beginning of the business year, and
were likely to carry on getting worse. The outlook for the home market is
deteriorating as the German economy weakens, while the appreciation of the
D-Mark will make it even harder for Porsche to sell abroad.
It seems likely that the company will sink further into losses this year,
serving to stir up speculation that the Porsche and Piech families which own
its ordinary shares and most of the preference shares, will be tempted to
sell Porsche outright.
Analysts say that there would be considerable industrial logic behind such a
move: that Porsche is simply too small to carry on competing in a world
dominated by large vehicle manufacturers. Its cars, critics say, are
old-fashioned and expensive - especially in competition with Japanese
manufacturers who have aggressively targeted the expensive end of the sports
car market.
However, a sale, according to the company's official statement last
Thursday, remains out of the question and Porsche is busily mapping out a
strategy to ensure its survival as an independent company.
The question of how to respond to the difficult business environment has
claimed one victim: the outspoken Mr Arno Bohn, frequently at odds with the
families who own the business, stepped down as chief executive at the end of
September due to what were cryptically described as differences of opinion
over business strategy.
Mr Bohn's successor was the less well-known Mr Wendelin Wiedeking, head of
production at Porsche until his elevation to the top job. His strategy is to
cut Porsche's cost-base by 30 per cent by 1995. To this end, the company is
cutting 1,850 jobs during the course of the current business year - almost a
quarter of the workforce.
It is thought that Mr Wiedeking has drawn up his plans with the view to
surviving a worst-case scenario, with sales falling from their depressed
levels to fewer than 20,000 units.
His background in production means that he is an ideal person to see through
a tough rationalisation programme which will focus on production costs. But
is he any more than a caretaker chief executive whose job it is to groom
Porsche for a sale?
If Porsche were a publicly-owned company, it is highly unlikely that it
could have remained independent until now. Its strong brand name could well
have attracted a buyer irrespective of current difficulties. The large
German car companies have made clear that they would be willing buyers
should Porsche come up for sale.
However, Porsche is privately owned by individuals who do not have to base
their investment decisions on short-term profit considerations. Moreover,
the Piechs and the Porsches - descendants of the company's founder, Mr
Ferdinand Porsche - do not even have to rely on this company as their only
source of income.
The family owns a car distribution business which is one of Austria's
largest private companies. Prominent family members have interesting and
remunerative jobs - Mr Ferdinand Piech, for example, is chief executive of
VW's Audi subsidiary.
Although the family is sufficiently fragmented for there to be different
views about the wisdom of a sale, analysts think it unlikely that they would
want to sell the company - emotional considerations apart - at a time when
they would not get the best price for it.
Another consideration is that the company is not in any obvious financial
difficulty: it had no debt and net cash of DM600m at the end of its last
financial year.
This will be eaten into in the months and years ahead, but the cash cushion
ensures that a crisis sale is out of the question.
The families will probably try to preserve the company's independence until
1995 at the very least, when a new range of sports cars will be introduced.
In the meantime, they will keep their fingers crossed, in the hope that the
worst case scenario for survival does not turn out to be too optimistic.

QUEBECOR, the holding company for the Peladeau family's publishing, printing
and forest products empire, unveiled third-quarter profit of CDollars 16.1m
(Dollars 12.9m) or 27 cents a share, up from CDollars 6.1m or 13 cents a
year earlier. Revenues rose 8.8 per cent to CDollars 623m.
Nine-month earnings were CDollars 85.3m, or CDollars 1.42, up from CDollars
17.2m, or 36 cents, a year earlier.
Revenues were CDollars 1.8bn, up 5.5 per cent. The period included a
CDollars 48.5m special gain equal to 81 cents a share.
Quebecor's printing arm continues in an expansion phase, planning takeovers
in Europe and possibly another acquisition in the US.
The latter, if successful, would bring Quebecor Printing within sight of
becoming North America's biggest commercial printer.
Repap Enterprises, one of North America's top four coated paper producers,
suffered a net loss of CDollars 34.5m (Dollars 27.8m) or 41 cents a share in

<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL Corporation, the US property-casualty insurer whose shares
plunged in late-September because of the impact of recent catastrophe
losses, reported a Dollars 142.1m deficit after tax in the third quarter, to
end-September. In the same period of 1991, Continental made a net profit of
Dollars 20.5m.
In September, Continental warned it would take a Dollars 120m pre-tax charge
to cover the cost of leaving both the reinsurance business and writing
insurance for small foreign companies. A further Dollars 200m pre-tax outlay
was expected to cover losses from Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki, plus the cost
of reinstating catastrophe reinsurance.
Continental cut its dividend, and said it would lock in more than Dollars
100m of realised capital gains, to help protect its capital base. On the day
of these announcements, Continental's chief operating officer, Mr William
Thiele, left the company to pursue other interests.
The results generally reflected these moves. Continental said its
discontinued operations produced a loss of Dollars 156.5m, after the Dollars
120m charge. The on-going operations made a pre-tax profit of Dollars 20.9m,
down from Dollars 42.8m a year earlier. The decrease resulted from the
hurricane-related losses and costs, with higher realised capital gains
offsetting much of the damage. The insurer's total realised capital gains in
the third quarter were Dollars 166.4m, against Dollars 32.1m in the third
quarter of 1992.
Loews Corporation, headed by Mr Laurence Tisch, saw third-quarter after-tax
profits in the three months to end-September fall to Dollars 128.6m from
Dollars 205.4m a year ago, on revenues of Dollars 3.42bn compared with
Dollars 3.36bn.
Loews incurred a charge of Dollars 109.7m at its CNA multi-line insurance
subsidiary, due to insurance claims from Hurricane Andrew. After-tax profits
for the first nine months of the year stand at Dollars 601.5m, against
Dollars 632.1m last time.
Mr Saul Steinberg's Reliance Group Holdings, the investment and insurance
company, reported a Dollars 1.3m profit after tax in the third quarter of
1992. It said results had been depressed by Dollars 41.7m of pre-tax losses
relating to Hurricane Andrew, which cut net income by Dollars 27.5m.
However, the tiny profit marked an improvement on the Dollars 126.3m loss
seen in the same period of 1991.

PARAMOUNT Pictures moved quickly to name a new studio head to replace Mr
Brandon Tartikoff, who resigned last week citing family obligations.
Ms Sherry Lansing, the best known woman in Hollywood film-making, was
appointed to the newly-created position of chairman of the Paramount's
motion picture group.
The 48-year-old Ms Lansing first made her name in the early 1980s when she
served for three years as president of production at 20th Century Fox.
Before that she had been a senior vice-president at Columbia Pictures.
Paramount said the appointment of Ms Lansing reflected a structural change
in the Paramount Pictures organisation.
Mr Tartikoff had headed both film and television activities. But the company
has now named Mr Kerry McCluggage as head of the television division. Both
he and Ms Lansing will report to Mr Stanley Jaffe, who is president and
chief operating officer of Paramount Communications, the parent company.
Mr Jaffe is an old friend and business partner of Ms Lansing's.
Until he joined Paramount in March 1991, he and Ms Lansing had a joint film
production deal with Paramount called Jaffe/Lansing Productions. Elton John,
the British-born pop star, has signed a publishing contract estimated at
Dollars 39m with Warner-Chappell Music, a division of Time Warner. The
12-year deal includes the rights to all songs written since 1974 by Elton
John and Mr Bernie Taupin, his collaborator, plus songs from the next six
albums.

FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Public outcry fails to fend off
bid for BNZ - The pain caused by Australia's takeover of a neighbour's
financial icon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Australia Bank (NAB) yesterday emerged triumphant in its NZDollars
1.5bn (USDollars 787m) battle to buy the Bank of New Zealand (BNZ), marking
the end of the most bitter and controversial takeover in New Zealand's
history.
NAB announced last night it had secured 90.27 per cent of the ordinary
shares, a day ahead of the final deadline. This narrow victory, just 0.27
per cent over the threshold allowing it to acquire the remaining shares
compulsorily, ends a chapter in the turbulent history of the country's
biggest bank. To the last, minority shareholders in BNZ battled to keep the
bank in local hands.
All week several shareholders staged pickets outside bank branches, seeking
to stop the sale. Thousands of other small shareholders sought to halt the
deal by refusing to accept NAB's 80 cents a share offer.
Two US funds, the Wisconsin Investment Board and Grantham Mayo van Otterloo,
with a combined 3 per cent holding in BNZ, encouraged the protesters by
saying they were unlikely to accept the offer.
Controversy over the sale of BNZ was inflamed by Mr Winston Peters, an MP in
the a ruling National party. Armed with documents tabled under parliamentary
privilege, he alleged wrong-doing by BNZ directors and others involved with
the bank from 1988 to 1990.
Letters to newspapers, callers to radio talk shows and public opinion polls
suggested a majority of New Zealanders wanted an inquiry into the bank which
the National Party government is refusing to allow, despite a pre-election
promise to do so.
Most critics said they did not want BNZ sold, while others expressed concern
that the sale would see the country's banking dominated by four Australian
banks - ANZ, Westpac, NAB and Commonwealth - and two British banks -
Countrywide and National Westminster. Only one bank remains in New Zealand
hands, Trust Bank, a grouping of regional banks effectively excluded from
the main Auckland market.
An often acrimonious extraordinary meeting, forced by dissident shareholders
last Friday, showed the depth of feeling among the 1,500 shareholders able
to attend the marathon five-and-a-half hour meeting. Many targetted their
frustration at director Sir Michael Fay, a representative of Fay, Richwhite,
and Ms Ruth Richardson, the finance minister. It was their decision in June
to sell their combined 82.9 per cent holding to the NAB that sparked the
uproar.
However, the BNZ has been no stranger to controversy in the past. Launched
by Auckland entrepreneurs in 1860, there were early accusations of
impropriety in land deals.
In the late 1880s, BNZ was involved in property and other speculation,
requiring a rescue with the injection of taxpayers' money. Oddly the same
thing happened 100 years later.
But successive governments maintained a share in the bank until it was
nationalised by the Labour government in 1946. In 1986, a reformist Labour
government sold 17 per cent to the public for NZDollars 1.75 a share.
The shareholders who bought these shares spearheaded the latest campaign to
keep the bank in local hands, arguing that improving profits showed it was
on a road to recovery.
Small shareholders have had two shocks recently: one in 1989 when BNZ
revealed heavy losses following the 1987 crash. However, the bigger one came
in September 1990, when the bank was forced to raise NZDollars 1.5bn from
the government, Fay, Richwhite and other sources to cover large unexpected
losses in Australia.
Last week's extraordinary meeting revealed for the first time how grave the
Australian problems had been. As part of the 1990 rescue, BNZ set up Adbro,
a separate company to handle the 'bad bank' loan portfolio, while BNZ itself
became a 'good bank' and continued to trade.
About half the bad and doubtful debts in Adbro, which has a total of
NZDollars 2.7bn in debts, will never be recovered.
The Adbro issue dominated the extraordinary meeting, as a leading group of
dissidents argued that NAB's offer of 80 cents a share was artificially
depressed by overly conservative accounting of the potential recoveries from
Adbro.
Mr Paul Kocourek of Booz Allen and Hamilton, the international management
consultancy, revealed how much of the financial crisis in September 1990 was
due to the BNZ's ill-judged foray into Australia between 1985 and 1988, when
it sought to become a leading player there.
He said that much of 77 per cent of increased provisioning needed between
March and September 1990 was due to problem Australian loans, which
accounted for only 20 per cent of the bank's lending.
Mr Kocourek said hardly anyone had seen the magnitude of Australia
recession, while hopes for an improvement in the New Zealand economy did not
materialise. This meant an increasing number of companies were unable to
repay interest and principal on their loans.
'Not only did more loans go bad, but the value of the collateral
underpinning them deteriorated substantially,' he said. Property prices in
Sydney and Melbourne fell by an average 40 to 50 per cent.
He said that, while the board could be criticised, very few commentators
expected the collapse in Australia to be so severe. Only a year earlier
independent valuers had been forecasting a maximum 5 per cent drop in
property values.
The provisioning in September 1990 forecast recoveries at NZDollars 1.07bn,
or 40 per cent of the debts that were put into Adbro. Since then, the bank
had recovered NZDollars 622.4m, about 58 per cent of the expected recovery
level. Mr Kocourek said further recoveries in Adbro are forecast at
NZDollars 456m.
Responding to suggestions that the bad debt provisions were too high, which
suggested that the BNZ was being sold too cheaply, he said there could be no
certainty about the provisioning levels, but his judgment was that they
fairly reflected the value of the bad loan portfolio.
He said that, of the total bad debt recoveries, 60 per cent would come from
Australia and 40 per cent from New Zealand. Provisioning was based on the
expectation of only modest economic growth over the next several years, and
could change if the Australian and New Zealand economies became 'Asian
Tigers'.
NAB's determination not to pay more than 80 cents a share, or to offer a
share swap, did not ease the way for it to buy the BNZ. Nor did it lessen
the controversy over the loss of a national institution, popularly called
the 'peoples' bank' to Australian control.
Most New Zealanders harbour deep-seated suspicions about their bigger
neighbour, and clashes both on and off the sporting field are legendary.
Now that it has succeeded in its takeover, NAB will need to mount a big
public relations effort. It has said it intends to keep BNZ's name and
identity, emphasising that it will allow BNZ the same measure of autonomy
they permit the banks it controls in Britain and Northern Ireland.

TOYOTA Tsusho, the trading arm of the Toyota Motors group, suffered its
first fall in unconsolidated sales and profits for six years in the first
half to September, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo.
Pre-tax profits fell by 12.3 per cent to Y7.4bn (Dollars 60m) from the same
period last year, while its sales fell 7.1 per cent to Y1,040.8bn.
Toyota Tsusho blamed the fall on a steep drop in Japanese demand for
machinery and steel. It said, however, that exports of cars remained strong.

CITIZEN, the leading Japanese watch and electronics manufacturer, yesterday
warned that the Japanese business environment would become increasingly
severe in the second half of this fiscal year after reporting a 26.7 per
cent fall in pre-tax profits in the six months to September.
Citizen said that despite the Japanese government's emergency spending
package announced in August, the company was planning for increasingly harsh
business conditions in the second half.
The company said it expected sluggish consumer demand and industrial
investment in Japan would be compounded by slow growth in export markets in
Europe and the US. This partly reflected the recent rise in the value of the
yen which has undermined the competitiveness of Japanese exports.
Citizen, which makes industrial machinery, personal computers and portable
televisions as well as watches, reported a 25.6 per cent fall in operating
profits to Y5.8bn (Dollars 47m) in the six months to September compared with
the same period last year.
Pre-tax profits fell 26.7 per cent to Y7.5bn on a 1.6 per cent increase in
sales to Y123.8bn. Net income per share was 7.8 per cent down at Y14.7 but
the company maintained its interim dividend at Y4.
Citizen's business divisions reported widely differing results. The watch
division, which accounts for about half the company's turnover, fell from
Y62.6bn in the first half of last year to Y62bn this year. Sales of luxury
watches were particularly badly hit which reduced the average price per unit
sold.
Sales of industrial machinery such as computer numerically controlled
machine tools fell by 40.8 per cent to Y9bn.
Information equipment sales were 21 per cent up, largely thanks to Citizen's
miniaturised notebook computers and higher floppy disk drive sales. This
offset a decline in computer printer sales in Europe and north America.
Electronics equipment revenues rose by 23 per cent to Y17.3bn largely as a
result of increased sales of liquid crystal displays and portable colour
televisions.

NEW World Development, the Hong Kong-based property development to hotels
group, announced a 102 per cent leap in net profit to HKDollars 2.36bn
(USDollars 305.3m) in the year to June 1992, up from HKDollars 1.17bn the
year before.
Around HKDollars 1bn in earnings came from sales of office and residential
properties, and HKDollars 1.4bn from rental income on its property
portfolio.
New World has been one of the more aggressive investors in southern China,
building up a sizeable land bank for development, in addition to its
construction of the Guanzhou northern ring road, a toll road linking Huizhou
with the border city of Shenzhen and two power plants in Zhujiang.
'The outlook for overall economic development in China is particularly
bright. There exists a crying need for industrialisation, land development
and infrastructure in the Mainland,' said Mr Henry Cheng, managing director.
New World also owns the Ramada hotel chain, which manages 101 hotels
worldwide. Hotels continued to suffer from the worldwide recession, but
properties in Hong Kong and China are beginning to see improvements.
The company holds 47.5 per cent of Asia Television, the colony's second TV
channel; Mr Cheng said the outlook was more encouraging, but significant
losses are still being incurred.
A final dividend of 47 cents has been recommended, making a full-year payout
of 68 cents - a 36 per cent increase.

<TEXT>
TATA Iron and Steel (Tisco), India's largest private-sector company,
yesterday reported a sharp fall in half-year net profits to Rs502.2m
(Dollars 17.6m) from Rs1.04bn, despite a 28 per cent rise in sales.
Mr Russi Mody, chairman, attributed the poor results to 'steep cost
escalations outside the company's control' and the impact of the sharp
devaluation of the rupee.
Sales advanced to Rs15.37bn from a revised Rs12bn for the same period of
1991, despite the recession in the Indian steel industry.
The news of lower profits depressed company's share price 14 per cent to
Rs266 a share, and was part of the reason for the fall in the Indian stock
market yesterday.
Mr Modi said inflation had meant higher labour costs and substantial
increases in railway freight, power and petroleum prices.
Imported raw materials had become more costly due to the 22 per cent
devaluation of the rupee. Mr Modi, did not give any full-year projections.
The group plans a Rs30bn expansion and diversification programme, to be
completed by 1994, to raise production capacity from 2m tonnes to over 2.7m
tonnes. It also plans to commission two power plants, thermal and
diesel-operated, to augment inadequate power supply.
Tisco's performance in the coming years will depend on its ability to
maintain supplies of raw materials like iron ore and coal from captive
sources, and capacity utilisation.
With the decontrol of steel since January this year, the company will be
better placed to choose the most profitable product mix.

KANEBO, the Japanese fibre and cosmetics maker, yesterday reported a sharp
fall in unconsolidated interim sales, due to a slump in the natural fibre
market and an increase in costs.
For the six months to September, Kanebo posted a 45.2 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits to Y2.8bn (Dollars 23m) on a 0.7 per cent decline in sales
to Y262.6bn. Net profits fell 36.7 per cent to Y775m.
A 3 per cent rise in cosmetic sales to Y79.2bn was offset by an 8 per cent
fall in sales of natural fibres, such as cotton and wool, to Y34.1bn. Sales
of foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals remained virtually unchanged at Y25.2bn
and Y10.5bn respectively.

FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Westpac halves its prospectus
payout forecasts
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTPAC Banking Corp-oration, a leading Australian bank, has been forced to
halve prospectus forecasts for its final dividend because of an
unanticipated tax charge of about ADollars 115m in its US operations which
will reduce second-half operating profit.
News yesterday of the dividend downgrade, from 12 cents to 6 cents a share,
continued the crisis which has dogged the bank since it shocked financial
markets in May with a ADollars 2.32bn (USDollars 1.65bn) pre-tax loss for
the March half.
This forced the bank into a ADollars 1.2bn share issue which was heavily
undersubscribed, culminating in the resignation in October of five Westpac
directors. The prospectus for that share issue made the 12 cents-a-share
final dividend forecast which has now been revised.
Yesterday's downgrade also claimed yet another Westpac executive, with Mr
Anthony Walton, chief general manager with responsibility for the Americas
and Europe, offering his resignation. Westpac said yesterday Mr Walton had
informed the board he had relied on 'assurances from his senior management
that all tax matters had or were being addressed'. He also said 'if the
board wished, he would offer to leave'.
'The board has asked Mr Walton to continue in his executive position into
the first quarter of 1993 to work out an orderly transition. It has also
accepted his resignation as a director and acknowledged his outstanding
contribution to the bank.'
Westpac directors said they regretted that the final dividend rate
previously forecast was no longer possible.
'The tax charge (which is still subject to final audit) follows recognition
of a liability for additional US income taxes and related penalties and
interest of the order of ADollars 115m related to third party interest rate
and currency swap contracts and forward currency contracts assigned
between's Westpac's New York branch and certain non-US branches in 1991 and
1992,' they said.
'The value of potential tax benefit carried forward that could partly offset
the ADollars 115m liability is ADollars 40m. This would only be realised to
the extent that profits would be recorded on future interbranch
transactions. The extent, if any, to which this deduction would be realised
cannot be predicted.'
Westpac said the underlying performance of the bank had remained steady in
the September half. Operating profit after tax was 'in line with earlier
expectations' even though it 'absorbed further write-downs in the value of
listed shares and adverse movement in the actuarial value of staff
superannuation fund surpluses'.

<TEXT>
HONG Kong Telecom-munications, a subsidiary of Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK,
announced net profits of HKDollars 3.17bn (USDollars 410m) for the six
months to September, a 16 per cent increase from a year earlier.
The results were above market expectations, with the bulk of growth coming
from calls to China. China now accounts for 44 per cent of international
turnover and accounted for 26 per cent of total international revenues.
Hong Kong Telecom has the monopoly of domestic and international phone calls
in the colony, but its dominant position is coming to an end with the
domestic network opening up to competition in 1995 and the government
forcing the company to lower its international tariffs from next year.
Baring Securities is estimating 15 per cent growth in net profit for the
year to March 1992, but if the tariff cuts are enforced from January 1,
rather than the end of the fiscal year, it predicts only 12 per cent growth.
Earnings growth will be reduced to single digits in 1994.
Mr Michael Gale, chief executive, said recent meetings with Chinese
telecommunications executives led him to expect further explosive growth in
revenues with China. Call tariffs to China will not be affected by next
year's reductions, which will focus on North America, Europe and
Australasia. Average tariffs will be reduced by 8 per cent.
Turnover was up 19 per cent to Dollars HK10.54bn at the interim stage. The
company declared a 20.3 cent dividend, in line with its profit increase.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO leading US insurance groups yesterday unveiled only small dips in
third-quarter profits despite the impact of Hurricane Andrew on their
underwriting results.
American International Group (AIG) recorded an after-tax profit of Dollars
344.6m in the three months to end-September, down 8.6 per cent on the
Dollars 376.8m seen in the same period of 1991.
This included realised capital gains of Dollars 26.8m and brought the
group's after-tax income for the first nine months of the year to Dollars
1.18bn, a 2.7 per cent increase on the same period in 1991.
AIG said the adjusted underwriting loss in the general insurance operation
for the third quarter was Dollars 149.5m, compared with a deficit of Dollars
34.5m in the same period of 1991.
But net investment income rose by 8.2 per cent Dollars 311.3m; operating
income from the life side increased by 15.7 per cent to Dollars 156m; and
the financial services operations boosted profits by 39.4 per cent to
Dollars 99.6m.
General Re, the largest reinsurance company in the US, reported after-tax
profits of Dollars 139.8m, down from Dollars 161.6m, with realised gains
contributing Dollars 66.4m, compared with Dollars 22.6m.
The group said the combined underwriting expense ratio for the domestic
property-casualty companies in the third quarter was 113.8 per cent,
compared with 102.1 per cent, and losses from natural disasters had added
about 12 points to the combined ratio during the three-month period.
However, Mr Ronald Ferguson, chairman, added: 'Excluding catastrophe losses,
underwriting results in the third quarter continued to improve even though
they remained unsatisfactory.'
The third-quarter results mean General Re is posting after-tax profits of
Dollars 506.1m in the first nine months of the year, including realised
gains of Dollars 144.5m.
This compares with Dollars 472.5m, with realised gains contributing Dollars
71.9m, in the same period of 1991.

MITSUBISHI Motors, the Japanese car maker, yesterday reported a fall in
non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the six months to September due to
higher costs, foreign exchange losses and losses on long-term stock
holdings.
Pre-tax profits fell 27 per cent to Y18.3bn (Dollars 149m) on a 1.6 per cent
rise in sales to Y1,237.0bn. Net profits fell 26.5 per cent to Y10.7bn.
The company said domestic sales, which rose 0.9 per cent to Y656bn, were
supported by the popularity of recreational vehicles. Exports also rose 2.4
per cent to Y581bn.
The slump in the Tokyo stock market hurt Mitsubishi's stock portfolio, and
the company incurred evaluation losses of Y1.8bn. The company's cash on hand
and deposits at banks at the end of September fell 42 per cent to Y49.2bn.
For the year to March, Mitsubishi expects pre-tax profits to fall 7.9 per
cent to Y46.5bn.
The company had previously forecast Y51bn in pre-tax profits for the year,
but was forced into the downward revision by an expected Y1.8bn in stock
evaluation losses and Y2.5bn in foreign exchange losses.

SHARES of PWA Corporation, holding company of Canadian Airlines
International, lost a quarter of their value in early trading yesterday amid
signs that the fight for survival between Canada's two main airlines is
nearing a climax.
PWA's share price plunged as low as CDollars 1.20 from CDollars 1.63 on the
Toronto stock exchange following reports that the embattled company may have
little choice but to file for protection from its creditors.
Air Canada, PWA's arch-rival, this week rejected terms for a merger between
the two airlines. Although a merged carrier would have a virtual monopoly on
domestic routes, it would have an unmanageable debt load of close to
CDollars 8bn (USDollars 6.4bn).
Air Canada's investment advisers, RBC Dominion Securities and Bunting
Warburg, advised it against the deal.
Air Canada said yesterday that 'we would still be interested in a merger,
but on different terms'. The spokesman said, however, that discussions had
not been resumed.
As part of its desperate rescue search, PWA renewed talks this week for an
alliance with American Airlines of Dallas. Such a deal would include
American becoming a big minority shareholder in Canadian Airlines, possibly
in partnership with a group of PWA employees.
Airline sources said that another option open to PWA was to raise cash and
shrink its business by selling its valuable international routes, notably
those across the Pacific, to Air Canada.
Mr Rhys Eaton, PWA's chairman, said he hoped to resolve the company's future
by mid-month. Meanwhile, the board of Continental Airlines, the bankrupt US
carrier, meets today to choose between the bids from two groups of
prospective buyers, one led by Air Canada. Continental is expected to
announce its decision in New York on Monday.
The Canadian airline industry's troubles have taken a heavy toll on PWA and
Air Canada shareholders. PWA shares traded at a peak of CDollars 29.50 in
1987, shortly before the company over-extended itself by buying the charter
airline Wardair.
Air Canada shares changed hands yesterday at CDollars 2.90, a fraction of
the CDollars 12 price at which they were issued to the public when it was
privatised in mid-1989.

McCAW Cellular Communi- cations, the wireless telecommunications group which
on Wednesday announced plans for an important alliance with American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, yesterday reported improved third-quarter operating
results but a Dollars 77.7m net loss.
AT&amp;T, the largest long-distance telecommunications group in the US, is
negotiating to spend Dollars 3.8bn on a 33 per cent stake in McCaw, the
country's largest cellular telephone service company.
Shares in McCaw, which were suspended before Wednesday's news, soared
Dollars 5 1/4 to close at Dollars 32 on the Nasdaq market yesterday, while
AT&amp;T fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
McCaw has expanded extremely rapidly over the last few years, thanks both to
the organic growth of the cellular industry and acquisitions. However, its
takeovers have loaded it down with a heavy debt burden, which have kept its
bottom line in the red.
The AT&amp;T deal would involve a Dollars 2bn injection of cash for new shares
and allow it shrink the Dollars 5.3bn of borrowings on the balance sheet.
Net revenues for the third quarter attributable to its cellular interests
totalled Dollars 332.2m, up from Dollars 256.5m in the same period of 1991,
while cash-flow (income from operations before depreciation and
amortisation) from cellular interests grew 44 per cent to Dollars 155.4m.
Net revenues for the group as a whole totalled Dollars 448m, up 28 per cent.
The net loss of Dollars 77.7m, or 43 cents a share, compared to net income
of Dollars 77m, or 39 cents a share, in the same period of last year on a
one-time gain of Dollars 243m due to the sale of cellular properties.
Lin Broadcasting, a cellular company in which McCaw has a 52 per cent
interest, reported a net loss of Dollars 23.2m, or 45 cents a share,
compared to a loss of Dollars 42.2m, or 82 cents, for the same period of
1991.
McCaw said the number of cellular subscribers in its markets and those of
Lin rose 37 per cent to 2.04m between September 1991 and 1992.

WESTPAC Banking Corp-oration, a leading Australian bank, has been forced to
halve prospectus forecasts for its final dividend because of an
unanticipated tax charge of about ADollars 115m in its US operations which
will reduce second-half operating profit.
News yesterday of the dividend downgrade, from 12 cents to 6 cents a share,
continued the crisis which has dogged the bank since it shocked financial
markets in May with a ADollars 2.32bn (USDollars 1.65bn) pre-tax loss for

This forced the bank into a ADollars 1.2bn share issue which was heavily

'The board has asked Mr Walton to continue in his executive position into
the first quarter of 1993 to work out an orderly transition. It has also

cash cost was Dollars 241 per oz, against Dollars 243 per oz.
Debt was reduced by Dollars 136m through the sale of a new convertible
preferred issue.

INTERIM results for the six months to end-September from three subsidiaries
of the South African Breweries (SAB) group reflect the deteriorating
business climate in the country.
Although Plate Glass and Shatterprufe Industries (PGSI), the
recently-acquired glass and wood group, and Amalgamated Beverage Industries
(ABI), the country's main bottler and distributor of Coca-Cola, both managed
respectable profit increases, OK Bazaars, one of the country's three main
supermarket chains, saw attributable earnings fall by 72 per cent.
The pressure on consumer spending is reflected in the 4 per cent growth in
turnover at OK Bazaars to R2.54bn (Dollars 875m) from R2.44bn during the
same period in 1991 - a reversal in real terms of about 10 per cent.
Private consumption expenditure will decline this year in South Africa for
the first time since 1985.
Operating income at OK fell to R58.6m from R75m, while attributable earnings
dropped to R2.48m - including a R1.6m loss applicable to outside
shareholders - from R8.93m. The dividend was cut to 10 cents per share from
37 cents, on earnings which fell to 20 cents from 71.9 cents per share.
Although also reliant on the beleaguered consumer, ABI gave some indication
of why it enjoys such a favourable rating on the Johannesburg stock exchange
 -a price/earnings ratio of 26.4 - by lifting earnings per share by 15 per
cent to 19.2 cents.
The dividend was lifted to 8 cents per share from 7 cents.
PGSI lifted earnings per share by 10 per cent to 138 cents from 126 cents.
Turnover rose to R1.35bn from R1.01bn.

<TEXT>
CHRISTIANIA Bank, Norway's second-biggest bank, yesterday reported a sharp
reduction in nine-month net losses to NKr785m (Dollars 122.8m) from
NKr7.32bn last year, helped by a 20 per cent reduction in operating costs
and an increase in net interest income.
However, Christiania warned it will seek up to NKr1.44bn in fresh state
capital to enable it to comply with the minimum 8 per cent capital adequacy
rule by the end of the year.
The bank said that at the end of September its capital ratio was 5.3 per
cent.
'The government bank insurance fund has confirmed that it will assist the
bank to meet the capital ratio requirement at the end of 1992,' Christiania
said.
Government-appointed bank fund officials are due to meet at the weekend to
discuss changes to Norway's troubled banking industry and further state cash
transfers to the banks. It is widely expected the state will have to inject
NKr3bn to NKr4bn into the ailing bank sector.
Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, met bank fund officials to seek
further state support of between about NKr2bn and NKr3bn after receiving a
NKr5.9bn injection last year.
Fokus Bank, Norway's third-biggest bank, is expected to call on the state
for up to NKr2bn in fresh support.
Christiania said that nine-month credit losses had been reduced to NKr1.86bn
from NKr5.79bn last year and that net interest income rose to NKr2.29bn from
NKr2.07bn.

SAGA PETROLEUM, Norway's biggest independent oil company, has reported a
NKr41m (Dollars 6.41m) decline in nine-month net profits to NKr661m due to
lower crude oil prices and higher oil exploration costs. Group operating
revenue rose by NKr671m to NKr3.86bn as operating profit slipped by NKr94m
to NKr903m.
Saga said exploration costs rose by NKr85m to NKr243m in the period. The
group said that it would consider writing down the value of its 12.4 per
cent shareholding in Elkem, the troubled Norwegian metals producer, in
connection with 1992 accounts.
Saga said Elkem's shares had been booked at NKr75 a share, but Elkem
yesterday announced details of a rights issue in which the par value of its
shares will be written down to NKr20 a share from NKr50.
Saga said petroleum production had risen to 3.2m barrels of oil equivalent
from 2.5m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS Corporation, the international publishing and film group controlled by
Mr Rupert Murdoch, has continued its strong recovery by more than doubling
net earnings in the September quarter.
Newspaper, magazine and television results rose strongly, and the company
yesterday declared a 101 per cent lift in operating profit to ADollars
216.1m (USDollars 154.30m) from ADollars 107.5m in the period. The result,
in spite of a 2.6 per cent fall in revenue to ADollars 2.59bn from ADollars
A2.66bn reflecting the sale of businesses, was mainly due to two factors:
Net interest fell to ADollars 206.2m from ADollars 255.5m following reduced
borrowings and lower interest rates, asset sales, capital raisings and
refinancings;
The result included a large turnround - to an ADollars 36.1m profit from an
ADollars 39.6m loss - from equity accounted investments, including BSkyB in
the UK and Ansett Transport Industries and Pacific Magazines and Printing in
Australia.
Newspapers enhanced their position as the biggest earners, with operating
income up to ADollars 164.3m from ADollars 122.9m. Magazines and inserts
followed with income up to ADollars 96.1m from ADollars 80.1m, and
television income rose to ADollars 72.9m from ADollars 52.3m.
However, income from the HarperCollins book publishing division fell to
ADollars 82.0m from ADollars 101.7m and filmed entertainment income was down
to ADollars 15.8m from ADollars 48.5m.
The US remained the main profit centre, although operating income fell to
ADollars 246.2m from ADollars 269.2m. Fox Broadcasting and Fox Television
increased earnings, but profits fell at Twentieth Century Fox Films.
Australian and Pacific Basin income also declined, to ADollars 76.6m from
ADollars 89.7m, but adjusted for the float of 55 per cent of the company's
magazine and commercial printing operations, profits in Australia and Hong
Kong rose 16 per cent.
UK income rose to ADollars 109.6m from ADollars 61.3m, with newspaper
profits up 35 per cent on higher operating margins, reflecting the first
full quarter's benefits from operating and printing plant efficiencies and
lower newsprint prices. The 50 per cent-owned BSkyB turned a loss into a
profit. Weekly revenues exceeded Pounds 6bn (Dollars 9.3bn), with more than
80 per cent from subscriptions.
Directors indicated that Pacific Magazines and Printing performed ahead of
projections in spite of a soft advertising market, and the 50 per cent-owned
Ansett Transport Industries returned to profit through better yields.
The News result followed a tax provision of ADollars 30.8m, compares with
ADollars 8.0m, and depreciation of ADollars 57.6m, against ADollars 58.1m.
It excluded an abnormal loss of ADollars 22.4m mainly reflecting unrealised
foreign exchange losses. News shares closed at a 1992 high of ADollars 28 on
Australian stock exchanges yesterday, up 20 cents.

FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Philips hit by decline in
consumer electronics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   EINDHOVEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOWNTURN in the consumer electronics industry pushed Philips, the Dutch
electronics group, into a loss of more than Fl 150m (Dollars 88m) in the
third quarter, prompting the company to consider making restructuring
provisions that are likely to depress full-year results.
The company's shares fell heavily on the news, closing down Fl 1.70 at Fl
17.40
Philips, which has gradually scaled back its 1992 forecast over recent
months, said it could no longer make a profit prediction because it does not
yet know the size of the provisions it will need to take in the key consumer
electronics and components divisions. Until now, Philips had said net
profits from normal business operations would be about half the previous
year's Fl 981m.
The company also said that it would not be paying an interim dividend,
though it declined to comment on a possible final dividend. Philips has not
paid a dividend for two years.
Results in the quarter swung into a net loss of Fl 154m from a net profit of
Fl 188m in 1991, reflecting the continued difficulties besetting the
consumer electronics division and the knock-on effects for the components
division, which makes the group's television tubes. The downturn also hurt
associated companies such as Grundig of Germany and MEC, Philips' components
joint venture with Matsushita of Japan.
Mr Henk Appelo, finance director, said that business areas unrelated to
consumer electronics, such as lighting and professional products, put in a
better performance than a year ago. 'This is evidence to me that Operation
Centurion is working,' he said, referring to the wide-ranging restructuring
campaign unveiled two years ago by Philips' president, Mr Jan Timmer.
Mr Appelo said he was confident that Philips would produce a profit in the
fourth quarter, when results are traditionally stronger because of Christmas
sales of consumer products and end-of-year purchases of capital goods.
Philips would be taking 'clear and tough' measures in consumer electronics
and components and examining the future of loss-making areas of these
businesses. But Mr Appelo repeated earlier company statements that Philips
had no plans to sell entire divisions or to withdraw from consumer
electronics.
'Our problem is an industry-wide problem with which we are grappling, just
as other manufacturers are,' he said.
In the first nine months, net profit from normal business operations
totalled Fl 102m against Fl 510m a year earlier. This figure would have been
Fl 850m higher if it had not been for the consumer electronics-related
businesses. Other areas produced a Fl 400m improvement so far this year.
Mr Appelo said price erosion in consumer electronics had 'stabilised' at 3
per cent in the third quarter. Group turnover in the first nine months fell
by 3 per cent to Fl 38.5bn.

FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: KLM tumbles 11.6% in second
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines reported an 11.6 per cent decline in net profit for
the second quarter and cautioned for the first time that it expects to post
a loss for the whole of 1992-93.
It blamed the downturn during the traditionally strong summer months of July
to September on the lower dollar, continued losses at its 20 per cent-owned
Northwest Airlines of the US, and narrower margins due to fierce fare wars.
Net profit fell to Fl 170.1m (Dollars 100m) in the second quarter from Fl
192.5 a year earlier, reducing first-half net profit to Fl 208.5m from Fl
328.4m. The result was better than many analysts had predicted, and KLM's
shares closed slightly higher at Fl 22.50 compared with Wednesday's close of
Fl 22.10.
The adverse effects of fare wars and currency movements were expected to be
'reinforced' in the second half of 1992-93 ending March 31. Despite
prospects of continued traffic growth and the positive influence of the
airline's cost-cutting efforts, KLM said it saw an unspecified loss for the
full year.
In KLM's second quarter, turnover rose by 6 per cent to Fl 2.29bn, but costs
increased by 7 per cent to Fl 2.06bn, causing operating profit to fall to Fl
232.8m from Fl 242.6m a year earlier.
Financial charges nearly doubled to Fl 105m from Fl 55.6m, reflecting an
increase in long-term debt, higher interest rates, lower interest income and
added interest expenses resulting from the consolidation of KLM's stake in
Air Littoral of France since January 1.

The State Property Agency's managing director, Mr Lajos Csepi, yesterday met
Mr Charles Kovacs, head of BZW's Hungarian office. Afterwards, the SPA
issued a statement that 'due to miscommunication, the true intention of the
SPA board was not clearly communicated to BZW which led to steps taken by
BZW which were found objectionable by the SPA'.
BZW had sent out prospectuses for Kobanyai to international brewers, which
the Hungarian authorities wanted excluded for competition reasons.

FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Elkem rescue package to include
rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELKEM, the troubled Norwegian light metals producer, yesterday announced
details of a state-backed rescue package which includes a rights issue to
raise NKr580m (Dollars 91m).
Trading in the group's shares was suspended briefly on the Oslo bourse
yesterday pending details of the plan, but the A-shares closed 25 per cent
up to NKr17.50 on the news.
The company is making a one-for-two rights issue with the two leading
shareholders, Saga Petroleum, the biggest Norwegian independent oil company,
and Orkla, a domestic branded foods group, underwriting NKr390m of the issue
while the Industry Ministry plans to guarantee up to NKr190m.
The state will effectively acquire a stake in Elkem of just under 22 per
cent. Orkla owns a 29.9 per cent stake in the company and Saga Petroleum
12.4 per cent. The banks involved are Den norske Bank and Christiania Bank,
Norway's two biggest banks.
The company has been forced to write down the face value of its shares to
NKr20 from the current NKr50 which means its share capital will increase to
NKr865.6m from the current NKr700m, after the write-down and the new issue.
The rights issue would be made at a price of NKr20 a share and underwriters
of the issue have demanded that the new shares receive preferential
treatment for up to three years against a possible write-down of the stock.
'After this period, all shares will be treated equally,' Elkem said.
Another condition demanded is for the group to acquire new bank loans of
NKr550m, including extension of a NKr300m credit facility which expires in
1992. Yet another condition for the rights issue and the loan is that the
state postpone repayments of a NKr270m loan used to acquire a 45 per cent
stake in Norsk Jern Holding, a domestic steel producer, and unspecified
loans acquired to upgrade environmental standards of plant.
Elkem will have to pay principal on these postponed loans. The state's
participation in the package will have to be formally approved by parliament
and therefore a date for the rights issue has not yet been set. Elkem is due
to have a board meeting today to finalise details of the arrangements. It
said that it is holding negotiations to cut employees' wages.

SWISS BANK Corporation, Switzerland's second-largest bank, yesterday
forecast profit growth for 1992 would be flat.
Mr Walter Frehner, the chief executive, said: 'We expect consolidated net
profit for the full year, including extraordinary profit, to be close to the
1991 results'. The group had net income of SFr1.03bn (Dollars 735m) last
year.
Mr Frehner, who is to become chairman next April, held out the prospect of
'clearly higher earnings' in 1993, as interest and inflation rates subsided
and many industrialised economies began to recover.
The bank has embarked on projects to cut costs and improve revenue from its
Swiss branch network. Provisions this year were likely to be 'only
negligibly lower' than last year's SFr1.45bn.
SBC posted a 7.7 per cent drop in gross operating profit to SFr1.24bn in
first-half 1992.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson's decision to pull out of the bidding for RHM leaves it in the
awkward position of appearing definitively to have lost that magic touch
with hostile deals. But its choice was not enviable. The agreed offer from
Tomkins is certainly full. Had Hanson topped it, it would have been hard
pressed to justify the price on commercial grounds. RHM's brands are
lacklustre and Tomkins itself, as the likely acquirer, may find it has
bitten off an indigestible morsel in milling and baking.
RHM's ability to exact a price higher than that originally offered by Hanson
is not a particular commendation of its rather feeble defence. It owes more
to the fact that conglomerates still feel the need to scrabble around for
the occasional deal, even though real opportunities are remarkably thin on
the ground.

<TEXT>
Still hemmed in on all side by the banks, Mr Rupert Murdoch is clearly
determined to make the best of what he has got. Squeezing a 35 per cent
increase in first-quarter profits from UK newspapers during an advertising
recession is impressive work, even allowing for the benefit of lower
newsprint costs.
The lack of an obvious buyer for the group's remaining weak performers -
such as Ansett - must be all the more frustrating for that. Equally, Fox
films remains a wild card, since its contribution turns on its ability to
produce blockbuster movies on the scale of last year's Home Alone. With no
clear sign of recovery and some drag on earnings, News Corp will find the
heady pace of earnings growth difficult to maintain.
By raising Dollars 1.5bn in equity and long-term debt since the year end,
though, Mr Murdoch has tilted the balance of power away from the banks. His
eagerness to gain an investment grade credit rating suggests more bond
issues to pay off bank debt. High interest costs will rule out anything
ambitious for the time being, but News Corp will at least have a free hand
to invest in its main businesses without the bankers' rubber-stamp. On the
evidence of yesterday's figures this will be freedom enough to keep
shareholders sweet.

FT  06 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: UK car sales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 8.2 per cent rise in October UK car registrations compared with the same
month of 1991 is simply too good a figure to represent the start of a trend.
True, there are structural reasons to expect some demand. Cars put on the
road in the boom that followed the end of the last recession are now about
10 years old and heading for the scrapyard. Those sold at the peak of the
market in 1989 are approaching the end of their normal fleet life. But there
have been blips in the statistics before, and dealers are certainly not
displaying the sort of excitement which suggests October's figure may be
repeated soon.
Part of the explanation may well be an unusually large amount of pre-sale
registration by manufacturers anxious to offload existing models before the
new rules on catalytic converters enter force in January. As for other
sales, it is not known at what price they were transacted. Lower interest
rates are unlikely to kindle much additional retail demand given the
prevalence of below-market financing packages. Nor, in the absence of a
general revival of confidence, are buyers in much of a rush to beat
devaluation-inspired price increases.
That leaves much of the trade struggling for lack of margin. Vauxhall's
price increase announcement yesterday smacks more of desperation than of a
firming market.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No one who owes Dollars 16bn can feel all that expansive, so Mr David Simon,
BP's new chief executive, is right to be cautious about the company's
revived performance. While the third-quarter figures show an improvement,
that owes much to lower interest and tax charges. At the operating level
conditions remain difficult, particularly in refining and chemicals. And
while asset sales are going according to plan, debt will fall only slowly.
With most of the debt denominated in dollars and the US interest rate cycle
near its low, interest charges may also fall more slowly than loans
outstanding. BP still faces a long haul.
Meanwhile, the valuation of the shares depends on which set of investors is
in the driving seat. To US fund managers BP looks a better bet than some
domestic energy stocks. Their buying has supported the share price since the
dividend cut. However, even their patience may be tested because much of
their holding was bought before sterling began its slide against the dollar.
UK fund managers still have little reason to favour the stock while it
yields less than Shell.

FT  06 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: BT hangs up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BT can breathe a huge sigh of relief that its investment in McCaw Cellular
has been placed without gallons of red ink. McCaw increasingly looked like a
cul-de-sac for BT, so it must also be satisfying that AT&amp;T's strategic
thirst prompted it to pay twice the market price for BT's stake. Yet, McCaw
has cost BT money once financing costs are factored in.
The sale has also resurrected fears about BT's international strategy.
Constrained by the regulator at home, the company has looked overseas for
growth opportunities. But having set its face against minority participation
in foreign privatisations, it is not clear where the large-scale
opportunities lie. Nor is the company's wish to participate in the growing
UK cable television and entertainment market likely to be granted in the
near future. Even the purchase of the remaining 40 per cent of Cellnet or
development of its systems integration business would not give BT a new
strategic direction.
With many of the avenues for expansion blocked, investors may start to focus
on BT's cash generation. Privatised with a strong balance sheet, the company
has lower gearing than most telecom companies. Indeed, with the proceeds of
the McCaw stake and a strong cash inflow from operations, BT may have net
cash within three years. Shareholders may put it under increasing pressure
to brave the wrath of the regulator and return more of the cash, rather than

FT  06 NOV 92 / King Hussein urges reforms in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMMAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KING HUSSEIN of Jordan has distanced himself from the regime of President
Saddam Hussein in unprecedented terms, saying there must be change in Iraq.
He also spoke for the first time last night about his cancer condition. In a
television address to his people, the 56-year-old king made pointed
reference to fears he might be dying, saying 'a vibrant nation cannot be
measured by the life of an individual'.
King Hussein - who has been on the throne for 40 years - returned home in
September after cancer surgery in the US.
Last night he said he would need more tests to confirm he had been cured.
'One recognises that every living soul will meet its destined end,' he said.
'When the time comes no hour could be postponed or brought forward.'
One diplomat in Amman observed: 'After his personal doctor had said that the
problem had cleared up, the fact that he has to have further tests is not
good news . . . it will stir up much talk.'
In an interview in Amman with the Financial Times, the king insisted his
opposition to the US-led war to oust Iraq from Kuwait - a stance that won
him popular acclaim at home - was 'well justified'. However, he said he was
now worried that Iraq faced the threat of fragmentation and 'has moved
towards becoming almost a pre-industrial state'.
'In that context, I would like to be absolutely clear that I am not, nor was
I ever, ready to link Jordan, or myself . . . to the possibility of an
association with a group in power that might eventually go down in history
as partially responsible, if not totally responsible, for the destruction of
Iraq, or its fragmentation, and the real disaster that would follow in terms
of this region.'
During his television broadcast the king, in an apparent reference to Mr
Saddam, cautioned against 'tyranny' and 'ambitious renegades', but otherwise
made no direct mention of Iraq.
His remarks echoed the frustration felt by senior Jordanians that Baghdad
has given scant credit to Jordan for the international isolation it suffered
during the Gulf crisis and has ignored Amman's appeals for changes in
policy.
'There has to be a realisation of what is at stake. There has to be change.
I don't think anyone can bring that about but the Iraqi people themselves
and hopefully they will be helped to attain that,' the king said.
Respect for human rights, pluralism and democracy were required as a
'guarantee against the shocks taking place'.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Union reform bill will abolish wages councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WAGES COUNCILS, which set minimum pay rates for 2.5m low-paid workers, will
be abolished under a bill published by the government yesterday. Women in
industries such as catering and retailing will be most affected by the
measure.
The bill will also impose further curbs on trade unions which will have to
give employers seven days' notice of industrial action. Full postal ballots,
open to independent scrutiny, will be required.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, claimed the bill would
strengthen the employment rights of individuals and increase the
competitiveness of the economy by removing obstacles to the creation of
jobs.
Employers were split over the bill. The Institute of Directors and the
Confederation of British Industry welcomed it, while the Institute of
Management criticised the government over the 'insensitive timing of the new
bill' which will go before parliament on November 16.
Mr Roger Young, director general of the IoM, said: 'In the middle of a
recession the government surely have higher priorities than abolition of
wages councils and new union curbs.'
The Trades Union Congress said the government was 'putting the boot' in to
the nation's poorest workers by abolishing the councils which were set up by
Winston Churchill in 1909.
The TUC is seeking legal advice and threatening to take the government to
court for an alleged breach of European law, claiming the abolition of
councils will discriminate against women who make up the majority of workers
covered.
Mr Garfield Davies, leader of the Usdaw shopworkers union, many members of
which have their wages set by the councils, said the government would harm
the economy by forcing down the wages of people already on the poverty line.
Publication and first reading of the Trade Union Reform and Employment
Rights Bill surprised trade unions. Mrs Shephard said last week that the
bill, expected to be brought forward this autumn, was being postponed on
technical grounds until later in the year. The bill has now been squeezed
into the parliamentary timetable.
The legislation, on which Tory MPs are united, could be a morale booster to
a party divided on other issues. In addition the government may feel it
wants to be sure of the new powers relating to strikes and public services
before the full impact is felt of any pay squeeze in the public sector.
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's employment spokesman, said: 'This will be good for
unscrupulous employers, but bad for everyone else. To make up for wages
which will now be cut, money will have to be paid back in benefits.'

FT  06 NOV 92 / MacSharry quits Gatt role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RAY MACSHARRY, the European Community's agriculture commissioner, has
resigned all responsibility for Uruguay Round negotiations, he confirmed
yesterday.
Mr MacSharry, who remains in charge of EC agriculture, is understood to
believe his efforts to secure a breakthrough in protracted Gatt talks with
the US were being undermined by Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president.
He wrote to Mr Delors informing him of his decision on Wednesday, on his
return from the last round of ultimately fruitless negotiations in Chicago.
Asked to confirm a report in the Financial Times that Mr MacSharry was
relinquishing his Gatt mandate to Mr Delors, the Commission president's
spokesman said at midday yesterday: 'This does not correspond to reality.'
By yesterday afternoon, however, all Gatt inquiries were being directed to
Mr Delors' staff. Mr Delors' spokesman was not available for comment.
The move was the latest twist in the increasingly bitter rift between the
two men over the Uruguay Round negotiations. Mr Delors, and the French
government, have accused Mr MacSharry of going beyond the mandate he
received from the Council of Ministers for the talks.
Yesterday, Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, French agriculture minister, said in a
radio interview that Mr MacSharry had gone 'beyond his mandate', although he
later said the commissioner had 'respected his commitments'. He said in the
French national assembly, however, that both he and Mr Delors had told Mr
MacSharry that he was going beyond his mandate.
Mr MacSharry insisted yesterday that 'the negotiations that are being
conducted are in the context of the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) reform,
and any provisional issues I have agreed (with the US) are within the impact
of the CAP reform.'
The CAP reform, agreed by the 12, including France, in May and passed into
law in July, imposes severe price and production cuts on EC farm output. Mr
MacSharry, and Mr Frans Andriessen, external affairs commissioner, believe
the cuts sought in the Uruguay Round are less stringent than those the 12
have already agreed.

FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Westbury returns to to the black with
Pounds 2.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTBURY, the Cheltenham-based housebuilder, returned to profit in the six
months to August 31, mainly due to a reduced interest burden following last
year's Pounds 20.7m rights issue.
The shares gained 12p to 80p.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.56m compared with losses of Pounds 1.14m.
Despite the improvement, the interim dividend is cut by 46 per cent to
1.75p; the company said the final would be reduced in proportion.
Interest costs fell to Pounds 583,000 (Pounds 2.83m) and net borrowings fell
from Pounds 25.4m to Pounds 13.5m, leaving gearing at 14 per cent.
Mr Richard Fraser, chief executive, said recent interest rates cuts were
welcome but had yet to feed through into confidence in the housing market.
Westbury sold 1,115 new houses during the period, only slightly below last
time's total. Average sales prices fell about 2 per cent to Pounds 61,131.
But incentives, which are not reflected in the sale price, of up to 5 per
cent of a property's value maintained pressure on margins.
Turnover fell more than Pounds 4m to Pounds 64.5m but tighter cost controls
improved operating profits 44 per cent to Pounds 3.63m against a depressed
comparative period.
Earnings per share were 3.5p (losses of 2p), giving dividend cover of 2
times.
The company said it would aim to improve that ratio to about 2.5 times.

FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Sharp fall in returns on assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETURNS on assets made by Britain's 1,000 largest companies have fallen
sharply in the past two years, according to a survey by Director magazine.
Profits as a percentage of assets fell from 14.5 per cent in 1989 to 11.5
per cent in 1990 and 9.8 per cent last year, well below the 15 per cent that
companies should make to cover what they are paying for borrowed funds.
Margins have come under pressure from two sides: as profits have fallen, the
value of assets has risen. With average returns at present levels, a number
of board rooms are going to have a struggle to justify their long-term view
of their company's future, the magazine said.
The difficulties caused by inadequate margins are particularly marked among
smaller companies - those with turnover of less than Pounds 500m. Pre-tax
profits fell from 15 per cent of assets in 1989 to just 7.8 per cent in
1991.
Among larger companies, with sales of more than Pounds 500m, profits are
also in decline. Not one of the top 18 companies in the Director table could
point to a consistent record of improving margins on assets over the past
five years, the magazine said.
Ford and British Aerospace had shown a negative return on assets, while BAT,
the tobacco and financial services group, made only 4 per cent in 1991 and
BP, the oil company, made only 5.4 per cent.
A small group of large companies had maintained healthy returns however. GEC
had made 24 per cent; BTR made 23.5 per cent; Unilever made 22.7 per cent;
Marks and Spencer made 19.8 per cent and J Sainsbury 19.5 per cent.
Some service companies with very few assets made very high returns,
including Alexander Proudfoot, a management consultancy, which made 230 per
cent.
Foreign-owned companies recorded sharp falls in returns. Half of these
companies in the Director 1,000 table made profits of less than 8 per cent
of assets.
Even those foreign-owned companies with higher returns had experienced sharp
declines. Vauxhall, the motor group, fell from 140 per cent to 39 per cent
and NCR, the electronic equipment group, fell from 129 per cent to 50 per
cent. In contrast Polygram, the record group, made a 430 per cent return.

FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Bellway's 40% rise beats expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELLWAY, the middle-market housebuilder, yesterday issued a plea to the
government to 'keep faith with the industry' in advance of the public
spending cuts likely to be announced in the Autumn Statement next week.
Mr Alan Robson, finance director, said any cuts in the government's con-
tinued support of grant-aided housing 'would stop our expansion'.
A significant and growing part of Bellway's business is with housing
associations and urban renewal programmes.
The company announced pre-tax profits ahead of analysts' expectations, with
a 40 per cent rise to Pounds 13m for the year to July 31, against Pounds
9.3m.
The advance was struck on sales 20 per cent higher at Pounds 129.9m and was
boosted by a Pounds 1.2m gain in interest receivable to Pounds 2.1m.
Operating profits rose 29 per cent to Pounds 10.8m.
At the moment the outlook for the current year was good, with sales running
ahead of 1991-92. 'All the fundamentals are now right,' said Mr Robson.
'Interest rates are very reasonable, affordability is good. We are just
waiting for confidence to pick up and unemployment to go down.'
The final dividend is increased from 7p to 7.5p for a total of 11.5p (11p).
Earnings per share advanced from 13.8p to 18.1p.
The shares, which have risen strongly from 195p in September in anticipation
of the results, closed 8p higher at 261p yesterday.
Mr Robson said Bellway had sold 1,841 homes during the year, a 20 per cent
rise on the previous 12 months. The average price increased by Pounds 1,000
to Pounds 68,000.
He said the group's strength in the middle to lower-priced end of the market
had protected the company. In the north of England and the Midlands, Bellway
sold 1,017 houses at an average Pounds 73,000. Last year the group sold 777
at Pounds 72,000.
A different mix in the homes offered helped the average price in the south
of England jump from Pounds 65,000 to Pounds 73,000. Bellway sold 488 houses
last year compared with just 366. Much of the improvement came from strong
housing association business.
The only area of decline was in the urban renewal division, where sales fell
from 375 to 366.
COMMENT
This is a careful, but canny, company. Over the last two years, Bellway has
been working quietly to build up its land bank with bargain priced property.
It now boasts 7,000 sites with planning permission, against 5,500 last year.
Cash balances of Pounds 20m mean it will continue to add to this. Benefits
should really begin to feed through this year and next as the more expensive
property purchased in the 1980s sells through. Nit-pickers might seize on
the increasing competition in the housing association sector, but that will
not have a serious effect on Bellway. Forecasts for the current year are
about Pounds 15m and the multiple of less than 13 looks attractive in both
the short and medium term - even with the recent share price rally.

FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: High-Point tumbles Pounds 3.2m into the red
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCEPTIONALS, including restructuring and redundancy costs, pushed
High-Point, the international construction consultancy and management group,
into pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.18m for the year to May 31. Profits in the
previous year amounted to Pounds 1.74m.
The share price tumbled from 150p to 98p.
Mr Ian Reeves, chairman, had warned at the interim stage, when the company
slipped into losses of Pounds 64,000, of the deterioration in the general
business climate.
He said yesterday that conditions had worsened in the second half.
Accordingly, the company had undertaken a review of project work in progress
and debtors in circumstances where clients had suspended or delayed further
works or shown signs of liquidity problems.
Also included in the review were clients in countries where political and
economic changes meant the company was unable to secure prompt payment.
Substantial provisions had accordingly been taken and were included in the
Pounds 1.92m exceptional charge.
Turnover declined to Pounds 55.6m (Pounds 58.7m) and operating profits fell
from Pounds 4.28m to Pounds 1.04m. Interest charges were reduced from Pounds
2.54m to Pounds 2.33m and Mr Reeve reiterated the company's plan to sell
certain businesses in order to reduce debt and reposition the group.
Looking ahead, he expected conditions in the current year to remain
difficult and said the group would continue to overhaul structure and costs.
Although rationalisation costs continued to affect the current half he
expected improved operating profits for the year.
Losses per share came through at 53.5p (earnings 24.4p). The final dividend
is omitted (4.95p) leaving the total at 1.3p (7.5p).
Rationalisation costs were affecting the current half but improved operating
profits were expected for the year

FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Brent Walker sells water stake
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brent Walker, the betting, pubs and property group, has sold its 80 per cent
interest in Carmarthen Water, the Welsh natural mineral water company, back
to its original owners supported by a consortium of property, hotel and
distribution partners.
Beryl and David Davies founded the company and its Prysg brand of spring
water was the first to gain natural mineral water status in Wales in 1986.
Brent Walker acquired the stake in April 1988, re-branded it in a new bottle
and marketed it in its own outlets.
Mr James Rackham, of Winefare, the drinks distributor and one of the new
investors, said annual sales totalled about 650,000 litres, equivalent to
about 0.1 per cent of the UK bottled table water market. Annual turnover was
about Pounds 2m. The company has net assets of about Pounds 670,000.

EFG, the garden leisure and horticultural group, made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 29,000 in the 27 weeks to August 2, compared with losses of Pounds
2.07m for 26 weeks last time.
However, relatively low seasonal activity in the second half was likely to
lead to 'a not insignificant loss' for the full year. Last year the deficit
was Pounds 3.06m.
Directors believed the capital base required strengthening and gearing
needed reducing. Various options were being reviewed for raising additional
capital from existing shareholders and possibly from a third party.
Turnover dropped from Pounds 20.2m to Pounds 12.7m. Extraordinary debits of
Pounds 1.22m left the net attributable deficit at Pounds 1.19m (Pounds
2.08m). The extraordinaries included a Pounds 1m provision for withdrawing
from landscape contracting.
Earnings per share were 0.19p (losses 12.55p).

It has been bought by a consortium of senior management led by Mr Eric
Anderson, who was the principal shareholder in Willig when TDG originally
purchased the company.
The extraordinary provision of Pounds 15m made in 1991 for losses on TDG's
withdrawal from the US covered the deficit on disposal of Willig.

FT  06 NOV 92 / BP profit beats analysts' forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum, the UK oil group, pleasantly surprised the City by
disclosing a replacement cost profit of Pounds 172m for the third quarter,
up from Pounds 129m in the same period last year.
The figures were well above analysts' forecasts of between Pounds 100m and
Pounds 120m. BP shares rose 2p to 225p.
On a historic cost basis, which does not take into account oil price
changes, profits fell Pounds 39m to Pounds 117m.
'These are pleasantly surprising results, and it's a long time since you
have been able to say that about BP - at least without immediately being
able to drive a double-decker bus through the figures,' said Mr Fergus
MacLeod, analyst with County NatWest in Edinburgh.
Mr David Simon, BP chief executive, said BP was set to achieve the goals he
outlined in August, when the company halved its dividend and wrote off
Pounds 1bn of restructuring costs and assets.
'We believe we have got the financial position under control,' he said.
BP was on target to achieve Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 972m) of disposals this
year, and was confident of Dollars 1.5bn and Dollars 2bn of disposals next
year, he added. The cost-cutting programme was progressing 'satisfactorily',
and together with a cut in capital expenditure next year to Dollars 5bn
would allow BP to start paying off debt, he added.
The company paid back Pounds 351m of debt in the third quarter, although
with 85 per cent of BP's debt in dollars, the stronger dollar meant gearing
was virtually unchanged at 88 per cent.
The third quarter result was helped by lower taxation and interest charges,
and currency movements added Pounds 36m to profits, but provision was made
for an expected loss of Pounds 85m on the sale of BP's holding in the
Olympic Dam mine in South Australia.
Earnings per share were down from 2.9p to 2.2p, with the third-quarter
dividend at 2.1p.
Exploration and production enjoyed a 'resilient' performance, boosted by the
UK Miller field and the Kutubu field in Papua New Guinea, which came on
stream in June.
Refining and marketing increased its profit from the second quarter through
improved margins in marketing. However, the chemicals division showed a
profit only thanks to Pounds 22m of divestments.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Hanson pulls out of RHM contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo/US conglom-erate, said yesterday it would not increase its
Pounds 790m offer for Ranks Hovis McDougall, effectively withdrawing from
the bid contest for the UK milling baking and grocery products group.
The decision gives Tomkins, the British conglomerate with a rival
recommended Pounds 935m bid, a clear run at RHM.
It also raises some awkward questions for Hanson. Regarded as the consummate
deal maker of the 1980s, it has failed to pull off a number of big deals in
the 1990s.
Hanson's bid will not be formally withdrawn until November 13, the first
closing date for its original offer.
But unless Tomkins unexpectedly withdraws by the end of next week, another
potential target will have slipped through the hands of Lord Hanson, the
eponymous chairman.
Over the past two years Hanson has pulled back from bids for PowerGen, the
electricity generator, Imperial Chemical Industries and Canary Wharf, the
troubled property development.
Hanson's bid for RHM was the first time it had gone hostile since 1986 -
when it successfully took over Imperial Tobacco. It will be only the second
time it has lost a hostile takeover battle.
Mr Derek Bonham, Hanson chief executive, said: 'It is only 1992. We are
still looking at many deals. Wait and see what happens. But frankly, our
shareholders come first: we do not overpay.'
Hanson decided not to increase its offer for RHM after receiving a reply
from RHM's financial adviser, Morgan Grenfell, detailing information passed
to Tomkins.
A Hanson adviser said Morgan Grenfell's letter did not reveal any
significant information on RHM that Hanson did not know when it made its
hostile bid last month. 'If Hanson thought it was worth 220p a share in
October it could hardly say it was worth more than the 260p plus a dividend
of 9.54p from RHM (being offered by Tomkins) the following month,' said the
adviser.
Mr Bonham said that after looking at all the numbers Hanson could not see
how RHM was worth the price being offered by Tomkins.
'We took the view that RHM's baking problem was not just cyclical but
structural as well. The brands were poorly based while half the volume of
the grocery products are in RHM labels which do not carry a premium.'

FT  06 NOV 92 / Sugar goes ahead with plan to take Amstrad private
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN SUGAR, chairman and founder of Amstrad, the computer and satellite
equipment manufacturer, yesterday formally proposed to take the company
private again by buying back the 64 per cent of shares that he does not own
at 30p per share.
The Pounds 112.7m needed to fund the buy-out would be funnelled through
Amshold, a new holding company chaired by Mr Sugar. The money would come as
follows: Mr Sugar, a Pounds 19.5m loan; Amstrad, a Pounds 50m loan; and
Lloyds Bank, a Pounds 43.2m advance.
The share price is less than half the 80p at which he sold a 7.5 per cent
stake in the company in March 1991 to institutional investors. Amstrad
shares closed 1p up at 29p.
The announcement was greeted by the group's institutional investors with a
mixture of suspicion and resignation.
'There is always a lot of suspicion when listed companies are taken private
by their management,' said one investor who voiced concern that Amstrad did
not have any independent non-executive directors on its board.
Mr Sugar said yesterday that shareholders were unlikely to receive a better
deal. Since his preliminary announcement in September, there has been no
other bid on offer.
'The sceptics think that I am being opportunistic and trying to get
something for nothing,' Mr Sugar said.
But 'there is a lot of necessary action that has to be taken with regard to
Amstrad'.
Whether shareholders agreed to the buy-out or not, Amstrad would have to
shrink, which meant small profits for an unforeseeable future.
In response to criticism that he was buying back shares at a much lower
price than he had sold them last year, he said shareholders saw strong rises
in Amstrad shares immediately after he sold shares in 1983, 1985 and 1987.
'On balance the winners have been the shareholders,' he said.
In a letter to shareholders Mr Sugar admitted Amstrad's mistakes. It had not
been able to come up with a hit product to follow its highly popular
low-priced personal computer.
At the same time, as the company grew on the strength of its success, it had
failed to adopt a coherent international strategy and management structures
and systems appropriate to its size.

FT  06 NOV 92 / AT&amp;T plugs into a new market: Martin Dickson explains why
the industry giant wants to spend Dollars 3.8bn for a 33% stake in the
largest cellular telephone company in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The communications market is a boiling sea of change,' declared Mr Robert
Allen, the undemonstrative chairman of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, in a
recent speech. On Wednesday he added a tidal wave of his own with the
announcement that AT&amp;T is negotiating to spend Dollars 3.8bn (Pounds 2.3bn)
on a 33 per cent stake in McCaw Cellular Communications, the largest
cellular telephone company in the US.
Part of the stake would come from the purchase of British Telecom's 22 per
cent stake in McCaw for Dollars 1.8bn.
The proposed deal, likely to be sealed in the first half of next year, would
also give AT&amp;T the option of eventually taking voting control of McCaw, a
Seattle-based company which has grown rapidly from humble origins, thanks to
the entrepreneurial spirit and vision of its chairman, the youthful Mr Craig
McCaw.
If the alliance goes ahead it will represent a dramatic plunge by AT&amp;T, the
largest long-distance telecommunications company in the US, into the rapidly
growing cellular telephone market, and will bring it for the first time into
competition with the so-called 'Baby Bells'.
These seven regional telephone companies, which are major players in the
cellular sector, were spun off from AT&amp;T in 1984 when AT&amp;T, affectionately
known as 'Ma Bell', was dismembered in an anti-trust court settlement. The
rump of AT&amp;T was left to fight it out against competition in the
long-distance and international markets and equipment manufacturing. The
Baby Bells, with their local monopolies, were barred by the courts from
entering the long-distance, information or manufacturing businesses.
However, over the past eight years, this neat structure has been gradually
eroding, thanks to technological, competitive and political change.
The emergence of wireless communication, and cellular in particular, has
started to reduce the effectiveness of the Baby Bells' monopoly of local
telephone wires. So too has the growth of entrepreneurial companies using
new fibre optic circuits to link local business customers directly to
long-distance providers.
The Baby Bells, for their part, have been trying to get the 1984
restrictions on their activities removed, but so far have only succeeded in
parts of the information services industry.
The McCaw deal would erode the wobbly structure even further. 'This is a
major, major move in terms of the destabilisation that is going on,' says Mr
Victor Schnee of New Jersey-based Probe Research.
As such it could run into opposition from the Baby Bells, even though Mr
Allen insists there are no legal or regulatory impediments to a deal going
through. 'Is this a wireless approach to putting the Bell system back
together again?' asks Mr Al Boschulte, head of cellular operations at Nynex,
one of the seven babies.
The Modified Final Judgment, the court agreement which broke up the old
AT&amp;T, does not prevent AT&amp;T going into the local telecommunications
business, as long as it does not buy assets of the Baby Bells. Nor does the
Federal Communications Commission, which oversees the industry, seem likely
to object to any transfer of licences involved.
Opponents could try to raise anti-trust objections with the Justice
Department, either on the grounds that this is an alliance between the two
leading service providers in their respective markets, or because AT&amp;T,
which invented cellular technology, is a leading supplier of cellular
equipment. The laissez-faire Bush administration might give these arguments
short shrift. But the anti-trust policies of the incoming Clinton team are
not known.
An alternative tactic for the Baby Bells might be to use the McCaw deal as
ammunition before the courts and in Congress for them to be allowed to enter
the long-distance and equipment manufacturing businesses.
Whatever the upshot, analysts regard the AT&amp;T-McCaw pact as favourable for
both parties. Wireless communications is the fastest-growing area of the US
telecommunication industry, expand-ing at a rate of 30 to 40 per cent a
year, in spite of the recession.
The sector was established in the early 1980s as a patchwork of local
licensees and has been consolidating ever since. McCaw has been one of the
most aggressive acquirers, driven by its chairman's vision of creating a
'seamless national wireless network' to allow cellular subscribers to
communicate easily with other parties anywhere in the US.
Mr McCaw has long argued that the wireless revolution will eventually allow
individuals to have their own portable personal, telecommunications numbers,
allowing phone, fax, video and handwritten communications wherever they are.
AT&amp;T evidently shares this view.
The proposed alliance will give them a strong position to advance this
revolution and profit by it. For McCaw, which has been financially stretched
by takeovers, the deal means being able to reduce its heavy debt burden,
while getting access to AT&amp;T's research and marketing resources and a
long-term licence to use the AT&amp;T name.
For AT&amp;T, the deal means not just a stake in a fast-growing company, but
should also boost its own revenues, with additional traffic being directed
into its long-distance network.
This could spell trouble for its biggest rival in the long-distance market,
MCI Communications, which ironically sold its cellular interests to McCaw in
1986.
Sprint, the third largest long-distance carrier, also sold its cellular
interests in the 1980s, but is now trying to get back into the market
through a Dollars 2.8bn takeover of Centel, an independent Chicago-based
local telephone company which is also the 10th largest cellular provider.
That deal, like the AT&amp;T one, underlines the rapid blurring of America's
telecoms boundaries.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Guess who Australia's forthright premier Paul Keating has now dubbed
'unrepresentative swill'. No, not the British monarchy, but the Australian
senate whom, for good measure, he also called 'pansies'.
The term tripped off his razor-tongue when he was defending his refusal to
let federal finance minister John Dawkins give evidence to a senate inquiry
into claims that the government concealed breaches of borrowing regulations
by Victoria's former Labor leaders.
Keating is a long-standing critic of the senate, deeming it unrepresentative
because it consists of equal numbers of members from each state, regardless
of population. And the nub of his speech was that members of the house of
representatives, such as Dawkins, are not constitutionally responsible to
the upper house.
As so often, however, the point he wanted to make has been smothered by the
row over the language he used in expressing it. Senate opposition leader
Robert Hill demanded Keating's resig-
nation saying he was the most personally offensive Australian Prime Minister
ever. That's quite a charge in a country where 'scumbag' is acceptable
parliamentary language.

Even Britain's Europhile MPs might think again about 'closer union' with
continental neighbours after seeing a survey of 20 nations' habits, made by
the IP group.
True, it assures us that attending to personal hygiene is typically the
third most time-consuming daily activity of Europeans, after sleeping and
cooking. But nearly one in 20 don't include personal hygiene in their day's
routine at all. On the other hand, when the average European grooms the car,
the job takes no less than 86 minutes.
Brits are supreme in two particular occupations. They spend more time each
day watching tv (four hours 13 minutes) than any of their counterparts, and
less time working.
The most enviable Europeans seem to be the Danes. Not only do they claim to
have the most satisfying love lives in Europe, but no less than 95 per cent
pronounce themselves happy with their daily lot - Maastricht treaty or no.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What a rotten week for Thatcherites. Besides watching the UK government edge
through Britain's commitment to moving towards economic and monetary union,
they've seen the US elect a president promising fiscal stimulus to speed
recovery.
But none of it daunts Sir Alan Walters, Lady Thatcher's ex-adviser and still
an arch-exponent of her economic philosophy, who was in biting mood at a
lunch hosted by market analysts IDEA.
Airing his expectation of British moves to rejoin the exchange rate
mechanism after France's elections next spring, he said re-entry would
probably again be made at the wrong rate 'and we'll be back on that
roller-coaster at the most unpropitious moment of the economic cycle'.
As for Bill Clinton, 'I don't know what lies behind that pretty face. But
whatever it is, it certainly hasn't come out yet.'
He added that his fear is that the new president leans towards protectionism
which, in Walters's view, is now the most worrying feature of the world
economy. 'There really are shades of 1931 in the air, and Mr Clinton has
only one saving grace: a great capacity for learning.'

FT  06 NOV 92 / Observer: Grand Met's German guru
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Gertrud Hohler cannot find any women she thinks good enough to
work for her Berlin-based corporate communications strategy consultancy. So
she should get on famously with Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief
executive of Grand Metropolitan, who has just invited her to join the board
as his fifth non-executive director.
Sir Allen, readers will recall, was quoted (he now says misquoted) in June
as saying any woman joining his board would need 'an operation' to come up
to the standards of his four other illustrious non-execs. 'That was before
he met me,' Hohler says serenely.
The Paderborn literature professor-turned-communications strategy guru is
the result of a 14-month search for a continental European, and preferably
female, dimension to a board which Sir Allen believes is in danger of
becoming an 'Anglo/Irish/American club'.
Author of 14 books - the latest entitled 'Rules of the Game for Winners' -
she has just caused a stir in Germany by appearing in American Express's
'famous card-member' campaign; she is pictured in a book-lined room, with a
besuited man lying flat on the floor in front of the desk.
Her views on German management can be on the irreverent side. A consultant
for Deutsche Bank for three years during the Alfred Herrhausen era, she
merely rolls her eyes heavenwards when asked about employee relations at the
bank. By contrast, the 1988 holder of the City of Aachen's Anti-Deadly
Seriousness Award enthuses about the more relaxed and flexible approach of
her prospective British colleagues.
Big on concepts such as 'emotional added value', most of Hohler's oeuvre has
been read by Grand Met non-exec David Simon, the fluent German-speaking
chief executive of BP.
But is she not perhaps a touch too theoretical and abstract for the
straight-talking no-nonsense Sir Allen?
'I am highly theoretical too. I'm just so quick I look practical,' he says
modestly.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Agricultural superpower throws weight into war: Paris and
Brussels are at odds over world farm trade talks and how to respond to US
demands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Who really conducts the European Community's negotiations on world farm
trade - its executive commission in Brussels, or France, its one
agricultural 'superpower'?
It was probably inevitable that, in the first multilateral Gatt negotiations
for more than 30 years to tackle the issue of farm trade, this question
would arise sometime. And now, in the wake of this week's collapse of US-EC
talks in Chicago, it has.
Overall, the Community is blaming the defeated Bush administration for
failing to deliver its side of any possible farm trade bargain in the Gatt.
Mr John Gummer, the UK farm minister who currently presides over the EC
Council of Ministers in this sector, left Chicago highly critical of
American intransigence.
But through the smoke and fire of this transatlantic battle, fierce
recriminations have broken out between Paris and Brussels, reflecting a
similar struggle inside the European Commission itself.
Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, France's agriculture minister, yesterday went on
French radio to accuse Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC farm commissioner, of going
'beyond his mandate' in some of the concessions the latter tabled in
Chicago. Mr Soisson modified this to say that Mr MacSharry had 'respected
his (EC) commitments', but only after he, Mr Soisson, had telephoned him in
Chicago to remind him of these commitments.
Later in the day, Mr MacSharry resigned as the Bush administration announced
its intention to impose tariffs on Dollars 300m of European imports from
December 5. His resignation reflected a long-simmering dispute within the
European Commission whose president, Mr Jacques Delors, has been criticised
for adopting a less-than-enthusiastic attitude towards a deal with the US.
Before resigning, Mr MacSharry hit back at suggestions circulating in Paris
that he had strayed beyond this summer's reform of the Common Agricultural
Policy (CAP) and that he had been on the point of caving in to most US
demands. 'The negotiations that are being conducted are in the context of
the impact of the CAP reform, and any provisional issues I have agreed are
within the impact of the CAP reform', the EC commissioner said.
Mr MacSharry recalled his long fight against the US demands for cuts in
subsidised EC grain exports, its attacks on the EC's income supports to its
farmers, and its refusals to accept limits on American cereal substitute
shipments to Europe and to give the EC a 'peace clause' against the kind of
transatlantic farm trade war that broke out yesterday.
Under the Treaty of Rome, the Commission is the Community's sole negotiator,
and France is just one government among 12 in the Council of Ministers which
initiates and concludes any EC negotiation, Mr MacSharry stressed.
But that is precisely France's problem at the moment. It clearly hates being
just one of 12 back-seat drivers in a negotiation that concerns it so much.
Disliking the course along which Mr MacSharry appeared to be taking the
Community charabanc and unable to grab the steering wheel directly, France
is evidently pleased the vehicle has stalled.
Mr Soisson expressed himself happy the Chicago talks had foundered, because
France 'would have opposed' their upshot. In contrast again to its EC
partners, France seems not to want any resumption of Gatt farm talks until,
as Mr Soisson put it, 'the Clinton administration settles in'.
This may well be realistic, though President-elect Clinton has reminded the
world that until January 20 the US has only 'one president', the outgoing
George Bush, to deal with, particularly on the urgent Gatt issue. Yet,
France's weak Socialist government has its own reasons to play for time - to
do nothing to add to its considerable unpopularity before next March's
parliamentary elections. It believes that a Gatt deal, on any terms that
Americans - Republicans or Democrats - could easily swallow would seal its
political doom next spring.
Part of the French government's problem is tactical. It has sold CAP reform,
with great difficulty, to its farmers as a 'shield' against further American
demands in Gatt. But there are genuine difficulties in gauging the CAP
reform's impact on future EC exports. Mr MacSharry estimates it will cut EC
grain exports to 19-20m tonnes by 1997-98 (compared with more than 30m
tonnes in 1991-92). Paris smells a Brussels' sell-out to the US here,
because, using different assumptions, it forecasts that CAP reform will of
itself result in a smaller reduction in cereal shipments.
But the real problem is pure politics. One senior French official privately
admits the power of France's farm lobby to be 'out of all arithmetic
proportion' to its electoral or economic importance, quickly adding that US
farmers exert the same disproportionate clout in Washington. France's 1m
working farmers may contribute 16 per cent of the country's exports, but
they account for only 6 per cent of the electorate. Yet, as every tourist
knows, much of France's population is spread out across the country in small
towns and villages, making up the treasured monde rurale whose well-being is
dear to the French psyche. This monde rurale, including all those whose
livelihood depends indirectly on farmers' incomes, makes up nearly 20 per
cent of the electorate.
Their political loyalties, too, are very effectively divided. While about 80
per cent of country-dwellers vote for the political right - making a likely
right-wing government next year unlikely to soften France's stance in Gatt -
there is, particularly among smallholders in the south, also a tradition of
supporting the radical and communist parties.
For a Socialist party, which now depends on Communist support to keep it in
power even until next March, this is very important. In June, the government
of Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy came within three votes of falling to a
censure motion over CAP reform, because the communists voted against the
government. That is not an experience Mr Beregovoy wants to repeat over
Gatt, where the communists - more than any other political grouping - can be
counted on to vote against anything they sniff might be in the American
interest.
Precisely for fear of being seen to do Washington's handiwork, France's
manufacturing sector and, even more, its service sector - both of which
could expect to do well out of an overall Gatt deal - barely raise their
voice against the farm lobby. The French patronat piously repeats the
virtues of a Gatt accord, but does not put pressure on the government.
Over time, this will change. CAP reform will, according to government
forecasters, reduce the number of French farmers to 700,000 by 1996, and to
half a million by the year 2006. But no one expects the Uruguay Round to
last that long.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Letter: Personnel directors should raise profile to reflect
reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER M BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Wellcome's demotion of its personnel director (Letters, November 3) is
unusual. We have recently completed a comparator of directors' earnings in
very large groups for the remuneration committee of a major plc. This shows
that while most executive directors on the main board are the chairmen or
CEOs of subsidiaries or divisions, of the functional directors on the main
board, personnel ranked second only to finance.
However the Institute of Personnel Management, which has a large public
sector and academic membership, has not done enough to raise the profile of
its senior private sector members and I am not surprised at the investment
analysts' response to Wellcome's action. As I pointed out at the IPM's
recent conference, the institute has submitted no evidence to Cadbury stage
1 or 2, plays no part in helping members achieve non-executive appointments
and is hardly heard in the debate on main board remuneration.
This is a pity as there are major issues of principle as well as practical
politics involved in the current director pay round. There is more to
leadership in the board remuneration area than doing 'what the other fellow
does' to justify an inflationary upper quartile salary spiral. Remuneration
committees need independent advice and institutional support as they assess
the right response to slimmer profits and collapsing executive bonus
schemes.

<TEXT>
Philip Rawstorne ('OFT is promised pub checklist', November 3) is incorrect
when he states that regional brewers Boddingtons and Devenish have closed
their breweries. The Boddingtons brewery was sold to Whitbread, since when
it has never been busier. And Devenish's Redruth brewery was bought by its
management and now produces beer both for the local pub trade and the
national take-home business.
Rawstorne is correct to point out that beer prices in pubs have continued to
rise faster than inflation and that the major brewers' grip on the UK beer
market has increased. The long-term supply agreements negotiated by the
major brewers with many of the new pub companies need Office of Fair Trading

A practice is developing among the water, electricity, telecommunications

These monopolies are buying small and medium-size contractors and

the consumer, undetected by the watchdogs.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Letter: 'Comprehensive' economists table excludes most
accurate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof R E ROWTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is very surprising that in the evaluation of economic forecasters
contained in the Financial Times (October 30) no mention whatsoever is made
of Prof Wynne Godley. This evaluation is described as 'the most
comprehensive effort since the recession started to rank economists
according to the accuracy of their growth projections'.
Your tabulation puts the actual change in GDP at -2.4 per cent in 1991 and
 0.9 per cent in 1992, making -3.3 per cent in all. In a survey of forecasts
published in the FT on May 7 1991, Prof Godley's forecasts were almost
exactly right, being -2.7 per cent for 1991 followed by -0.9 per cent for
1992, making -3.6 per cent in total.
All the other forecasts, without exception, covered by your assessment show
an increase in GDP in 1992 and in the two years 1991 and 1992 combined. I
find it mystifying that Peter Marsh should remark in his commentary:
'Although even the top-ranked forecasters were some way out in their
projections, the analysis provides insights into who was on the right
track.'
Instead of being completely ignored, Wynne Godley should be put at the head
of the list. I realise that your survey covers forecasters in operation
regularly since the beginning of 1990. This arbitrary criterion excludes
Prof Godley because his articulated forecasts have been published regularly
only since the beginning of 1991. But this is no excuse for ignoring Godley
when, as the author of your survey must know, his forecasts have been so
much better than those you do include and praise.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Letter: Balance in education should be the priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DOMINIC DIBBLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, On examining your survey of post-16 education in England and Wales
('The FT-1000', October 31), I was struck by the following thought: why is
it that we place such enormous emphasis upon the academic performance of
schools and sixth-form colleges, and yet so little emphasis upon the extent
to which these institutions develop children emotionally?
I would suggest that one of the main aims of educators at all levels should
be to bring about the balance between reason and emotion which exists in a
healthy individual. However, our present approach to education seems to
place a fairly low priority upon this arduous yet extremely worthwhile task;
instead, the main focus of attention appears to be the training of the
intellect. In doing so, we not only risk creating unbalanced individuals,
but we may also be stifling the creativity which can flourish when children
are allowed to follow their desires through the free play of the
imagination. There are of course honourable exceptions to this trend, such
as the Waldorf Schools, the Small School set up by the Schumacher college,
etc - but these are few and far between.
It seems that the importance of placing greater priority upon emotional
development as a goal of education cannot be over-emphasised, as the dangers
of a one-sided intellectual approach can be seen in the legitimising of such
practices as man's domination over woman, and humanity's domination of the
environment. In order to re-establish the needed balance in these crucial
areas, we should recognise that the balance must be struck within each one
of us; and there can therefore be no better place to start than in the
education of future generations.

Artificial neural networks, comprising layers of interconnected neurons,
have become a unique tool for processing complex financial data because they
can be 'trained' to recognise patterns and discover relationships within
them.
Now Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management, working with University
College, London, has developed a prototype stock forecasting system using
neural technology.
Its accuracy at forecasting the FT-SE 100 share index (the Footsie) is
typically above 80 per cent, reaching 93 per cent on a number of occasions.
This compares with about 50 per cent accuracy for traditional forecasting
methods.
BZW's team, headed by Frank McGroarty, has spent two years with Professor
Philip Treleaven and Siew-Lan Loo of UCL's computer science department to
optimise the neural network specifically for the Footsie. A prototype system
has been installed at BZWIM. Professor Treleaven: UK, 071 380 7288.

A blue-green herb known by the Chinese for nearly 2,000 years to hold the
key to treating malaria is giving up its secrets to modern medicine, thanks
to collaboration between Chinese and Australian researchers.
Two University of Sydney researchers, Richard Haynes and Simone Vonwiller,
have devised a chemical process that promises to boost significantly the
production of the anti-malarial drug derived from the qinghao plant
(Artemisia annua).
It uses qinghao acid, a more abundant precursor of the plant's active
compound, qinghaosu, to produce three to four times the quantity of
anti-malaria compound that would be synthesised by nature in the equivalent
number of plants.
The process is being developed by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer with the university

FT  06 NOV 92 / Technology: Driving down a different road - As the final
race approaches, John Griffiths explains why Formula One offers few lessons
for the car industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Britain's Nigel Mansell starts practice in Adelaide today for the final
round of the 1992 grand prix world championship, it will be his last session
at the wheel of his Canon-sponsored Williams-Renault FW14B  - a car which he
describes as so technologically advanced that, after further improvements
this winter, 'even a puppet will be able to drive it'.
Considering that he has been the beneficiary of most of this technology in
his successful pursuit of this year's world championship, many see his
remark as yet another graceless parting shot at Alain Prost, the French
former world champion who will replace him on the Williams team next season.
Technologically, says Mansell, 'Formula One is going into the space age'.
The Williams-Renault car has a mass of on-board, computer-controlled systems
such as active suspension, a fully automatic gearbox programmed not to let
its driver blow up the engine, and a traction control system to provide
maximum acceleration off the grid and out of corners. It is technical
sophistication to match advanced aerospace technology.
'It takes tens of millions of dollars to get where I've just left in Formula
One and I think that's totally wrong,' says Mansell, who next year will race
a different class of car in North America.
Mansell may believe that the technology race is bad for grand prix as a
sport, but Renault, Honda, Fiat-owned Ferrari, Yamaha, Goodyear and the
other manufacturers of road-going cars, engines, tyres and other equipment
feel differently.
They justify their involvement largely on the grounds that technology
pioneered on Formula One cars cascades down into road cars, to the benefit
of ordinary users in terms of performance, safety or efficiency.
Over the years it has been a persuasive argument. Disc brakes, for example,
evolved from racing. Ordinary motorists owe a debt to grand prix for the
synthetic rubber compounds which provide their tyres with levels of grip,
handling and durability which would have seemed unattainable 20 years ago.
But just how much of the Formula One racing technology now being undertaken
is relevant to the roadgoing vehicle industry is increasingly open to
question.
Even the fuel multinationals which pump large sums of money into grand prix
have had difficulty justifying the relevance of 'witch's brew' fuels for
grand prix cars. These fuels provide as much as 60 or 70 extra horsepower
but some are so lethal that protective suits have had to be worn by people
fuelling the cars.
Fisa, the world governing body of motor sport, is banning the fuels. But oil
group Elf Aquitaine is taking legal action in a bid to get the ban reversed.
That such fuels are widely accepted as costing up to Pounds 100 a litre -
roughly Pounds 25,000 per fill-up - is indicative of how far financial
considerations are put aside.
Some technology is even flowing the other way - out of road cars and into
grand prix. Next season, Prost at Williams will be using anti-lock brakes
for the first time, despite the fact that such ABS systems have been used on
road cars for much of a decade.
The problems of using ABS on a grand prix car are complex because the system
has to deal with the huge weight/speed differentials of a vehicle which has
so much aerodynamic force that it could theoretically run upside down across
a ceiling at more than 130 miles per hour.
The remoteness of grand prix from the mainstream vehicle industry is at
least partially responsible for keeping some of the world's leading
manufacturers out of Formula One.
Jacques Calvet, Peugeot Group's chairman, explains: 'I would prefer to find
a championship which is closer to ordinary cars than grand prix racing. We
like to accept challenges which improve our road cars - like rallying and
sports cars.'
Indeed, so dynamically capable have grand prix cars become - when thay
accelerate, stop and corner they produce forces of up to five times gravity
 -that some of the technology is being reversed. Next year the cars will use
rear tyres that are three inches narrower, for example, in an attempt to
increase braking distances and give more scope to driver ability.
It is also becoming a moot point whether, against the background of world
recession, the businesses which fund the grand prix teams - such as Philip
Morris through its Marlboro brand - and which have no vested stake in motor
industry technology will continue footing the bill when they could compete
with lower-technology cars at a fraction of the grand prix price.
It is this factor which, Fisa president Max Mosley believes, may soon lead
to the wilder technology flights of Formula One being reined in.
'In the long term, it is not realistic to expect a sponsor to pay for
electronic suspension,' he said. 'The only people who would pay for that are
the motor industry, and only if it's useful to them. If we don't stop
spending money on things that are completely useless, sooner or later we'll
go out of business.'
Mosley's concern, however, is not just with financial practicalities in
terms of technology. He believes that over the next decade motor sport is
going to come under increasing attack from environmentalists and that grand
prix will have to pay more attention to areas like emissions  - currently
not even on the agenda - if it is to escape censure. Even then, he
acknowledges, there is the problem of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas
which is an inescapable product of combustion.
Financial pressures are such, however, that the technology-limiting process
may already be under way. At a meeting just before the Japanese grand prix a
fortnight ago, members of the Formula One Constructors Association listened
to proposals for an engine speed limit, and for electronic control systems
to be confined to ignition and fuel systems.
Costs and the environment have already been cited by Honda as reasons for
leaving Formula One and scaling down motor sport involvement. Mazda is
withdrawing from the Le Mans 24-hour race next year - which it won in 1991,
the first time by a Japanese manufacturer - and is cutting back other racing
activities in favour of participating with more production-based cars.
Such thinking lies behind the motor sport strategies of General Motors, the
world's largest vehicle maker, which eschews Formula One as being too remote
from its mainstream business.
Mike Nicholson, GM motor sport executive, suggests that the supposed
technical spin-offs are questionable even lower down the motor sport ladder.
'Feedback from the competition programme into the road car, via the rapid
and innovative technological developments needed to remain truly competitive
and reliable, is often cited as justification for motor sport. It was,
without doubt, a very important factor years ago,' he says.
'But the modern car is such a well-developed and refined machine as it comes
off the production line that there is now less-relevant feedback. This
justification, therefore, loses its validity to a large extent. This is
particularly so at the higher levels of the sport where the cars are so
highly developed that it is at times difficult to relate these to their road
car origins.'
The most telling indication that image and politics play a more significant
role than commercially relevant technology was evident at the Japanese grand
prix.
Honda, exiting from grand prix this season, built specially powerful engines
for the race in order to put on a good show for the home crowd. But Renault
had anticipated Honda's move and built its own super-fast engines in order
to prevent Honda obtaining even pole position. In terms of 'usable'
technology, neither manufacturer's practice engines would have lasted the
race.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Delors and Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMISSION of the European Community is in disarray. Nowhere is this
more evident than over the collapse of the trade talks with the US, which
may yet lead to an out-and-out trade war.
Mr Ray MacSharry, the European Community's redoubtable farm commissioner,
has done an admirable job. Even though he comes from a country far more
dependent on farming than France, which is the most outspoken opponent of a
deal, Mr MacSharry has brokered an innovative farm policy reform for the EC
and has also made a serious effort to reach agreement with the US over farm
trade.
Yet now he has resigned his position as negotiator. His justification for
this decision, taken on the day the US announced its retaliation over the
EC's failure to resolve the oilseeds dispute, is that Mr Jacques Delors, the
EC's president, has informed him that the deal being reached would prove
unacceptable. Yet Mr MacSharry himself believes that a reasonable deal could
have been done with the Americans.
If this is true, it is impossible to understand what Mr Delors thinks can be
gained. How might a bitter round of tit-for-tat retaliation and
counter-retaliation over oilseeds be in the interests of the Community? How,
above all, might failure be justified when the differences between the two
sides seem small in themselves and trivial in relation to what is at stake?
Mr MacSharry must be told to complete a deal. Given the small differences
remaining between the two sides, no conceivable deal could be worse than no
deal at all. If Mr Delors is not prepared to allow Mr MacSharry to do his
job, then his obstinacy should be tackled by the EC council as a whole.
Mr Major's credibility as president of the EC has been much damaged. But he
did put his good faith to the test this week and won. Now he should do
everything he can to pull the EC back from the brink of a pointless and
destructive trade war.
If it is established that Mr Delors has indeed personally discouraged an
achievable deal, his future must be placed in question, notwithstanding all
his achievements. His term is due to last another two years, but he himself
has already stated his preference for Mr Ruud Lubbers, the prime minister of
the Netherlands, as his successor. Mr Lubbers may be needed well before
1994.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Mr Clinton's long haul
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SLOW recovery may have won Mr Clinton the presidency. But it is not the
main economic problem that he will face. To his credit, Mr Clinton has
recognised that it is the long-term performance of the US economy which most
needs improvement. What he has not yet done is make clear to the American
people how painful the choices they face will turn out to be.
Under Mr Bush, the US economy grew at less than 1 per cent a year, far below
the rate of growth of 3 per cent recorded during the Reagan years. As a
result, real income per person stagnated between Mr Bush's election in 1998
and his rejection this week. Yet this is only a part of the sad story of Mr
Bush. As Mr James Annable noted in the FT on October 19, after deducting
elements of consumption that contribute little or nothing to well being,
consumption per person grew by 10 per cent in the first Reagan term and by 9
per cent in the second. Under Mr Bush, by contrast, such 'feel good'
consumption declined by more than 2 per cent.
The irony is that poor Mr Bush bore little responsibility for the discomfort
of the American people. The underlying cause of the stagnation was the way
in which the Reagan years had superimposed debt-financed consumption upon a
slow rate of underlying economic growth.
Between mid-1973 and mid-1992 real income per head in the US rose by a
little over a quarter. It has taken the US these 19 years to achieve an
improvement in overall living standards previously managed in eight.
Moreover, income per head has declined for a significant proportion of the
population because of growing inequality.
What is more, aggregate consumption grew by 30 per cent in real terms during
the Reagan years, while total GDP rose by about a quarter. The difference
was partly explained by a reduced investment rate, down from almost 17 per
cent of GDP in 1980 to 16 per cent in 1988. It was also explained by
increased borrowing from abroad, this being the consequence of the increased
borrowing by both the government and of many individuals and firms. But
under Mr Bush private borrowing virtually stopped, the inevitable result
being a sharp decline in the overall rate of economic growth.
The increased indebtedness of the 1980s was a grievous fault and grievously
has Mr Bush now answered it. But it is also a story of the past. The private
sector balance sheet adjustment is occurring, albeit slowly, and the US
economy is also recovering. The 2.7 per cent annualised increase in GDP in
the third quarter may flatter the underlying trend, but it shows the US is
not in a deep recession. Mr Clinton does not need to put much of his effort
into 'jump-starting' the US economy.
What is far more important is the rate of growth of the economy in the long
term. This depends not on fiddling with aggregate demand, but on the growth
of the capital stock, both physical and human. The people of the US will get
richer only if they save more and learn more.
The gross savings rate in the US has declined from 17 per cent in 1980 to
less than 12 per cent in the first half of 1992. Two percentage points of
the decline can be explained by lower private savings. The big change,
however, is an increase in the rate at which savings are being absorbed by
government, from just over 1 per cent of GDP in 1980 to just under 5 per
cent in 1992. No less important is the quality of US education for the
bottom half of the ability range. Yet just as the 'dissaving' by government
can only be remedied by a combination of cuts in spending and higher taxes,
so reform in education and training demands equally painful structural
reforms.
Mr Clinton has rightly focused on the problem of long-term economic
performance, not just on the immediate malaise. The US needs more saving,
higher skills and a willingness to meet the best the international
competition has to offer. What Mr Clinton has not yet shown is that he is
prepared to make the tough choices. For the choices are, indeed, politically
difficult and the pay-off as long term as the problems are deep-seated.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Ahead, but frightened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Curiously, Mr John Major was nearly the winner this week, and Mr John Smith
the loser. The prime minister came out better because, owing to a
combination of circumstances, he won - just - a parliamentary motion upon
which everyone knew he had staked his office. The leader of the Labour party
came second because he had manufactured excuses to vote against his own
long-held principles, and lost. Mr Major took some of the shine off his
victory yesterday by confessing that he had agreed to postpone the third
reading of the Maastricht bill until after the second Danish referendum.
No final conclusions can be drawn from this little history. There will be
more tense votes over the lifetime of this government. Some may come before
Christmas, some next week. Mr Smith need not always lose. The chamber has
become uncharacteristically volatile because of an extraordinary
constitutional development: the elective dictatorship is no longer very
dictatorial. In its place we see the frightened administration. This is a
type of executive that those with long memories can easily recall. It is
frightened of its own party, frightened of the whole house, frightened of
public opinion.
Some regard this development as inevitable, given the government's low
majority of 21. The 1974-79 Labour government, which in its later years lost
its majority altogether, was such a frightened administration that it
forfeited its ability to govern. But a low majority is not the whole story.
Britain has become accustomed to a legislature composed of three national
parties plus assorted representatives of the Celtic regions. They all
usually fall into line, either behind the government or as a united
opposition. Now we must adjust to four main parties, two of them
Conservative, plus six varieties of nationalist. The nine parties not bound
by ties of loyalty to the government may combine and regroup in ways that
cannot always be foreseen.
The second, unofficial, Conservative party accounts for about a 10th of the
Tories. It is tightly organised and strongly motivated. Its leaders sit in
the Lords. It will not vanish as a result of its defeat on Wednesday. Some
senior ministers explain the Thatcherites' vociferousness by recalling that
the Tories have been in power since 1979. At the beginning of their long
reign putative rebels might have held fire, even if the government had then
had a low majority (it did not). After what is already an unnaturally
extended period in power the emergence of organised factions within the
ruling party is perhaps inevitable.
This is not all loss. An obstreperous parliament is a joy to behold. It
makes ministers sweat. It brings politicians before the public eye. It
provides low-cost drama on the TV. There are moments not to be forgotten, as
on Wednesday night when Sir Edward Heath looked straight across the chamber
at Mr Smith and told him that 'for the sake of the plaudits from some of his
backbenchers', he had forsworn his integrity - and the discomfiture of the
Labour leader was immediately apparent to the whole house.
As it happens Sir Edward went too far. Mr Smith did not irrevocably lose his
reputation for probity. He merely allowed it to be scratched a little. Next
time he may have the foresight to work hard for an alliance with the Liberal
Democrats well in advance of a crucial vote. Like the prime minister he,
too, must learn to think of himself as leader of one of 10 parties in a
fractious house. The era of simple two-party adversarial contests is
suspended. Yet those of us who have been doubtful about Mr Smith's
performance as leader so far must recognise that he has hardly got his feet
under the table in his new job. He has performed brilliantly in other roles.
He may yet do so in this one.
One difficulty is that, like Mr Major, the Labour leader appears to be
behaving like a mere party manager. Neither has shown much true leadership,
in the sense of moving slightly ahead of the prevailing redoubts and
pointing out where to march next. The prime minister has had to attempt the
management of two parties at once, his own and his predecessor's. He has in
recent weeks looked like the rider of a pair of horses veering in opposite
directions. Even his dogged persistence about being at the heart of Europe
has been compromised: he speaks of what Britain will not do for the European
Community not of what the EC will do for Britain.
Mr Smith is naturally concerned to maintain Labour's unity in spite of
serious underlying divisions, particularly over Europe. These are
potentially as harmful to his party as their equivalents are to Mr Major's.
That is why the prime minister is in the stronger position. His authority
may be minimal. The list of potential causes of trouble - public spending
curbs, the council tax, the Maastricht bill - is long. But all nine
opposition parties must unite if the government is to be brought down, as
opposed to merely frustrated. Mr Smith will find that difficult to arrange.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Ardent author of a revolution: Nigel Lawson's memoirs as
chancellor under Mrs Thatcher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigel Lawson was a Treasury minister for nearly nine of the 10 1/2 years of
Margaret Thatcher's term as prime minister, financial secretary for two
years and a bit and chancellor for six years and four months. He was second
only to Lloyd George as the longest-serving chancellor of the century. In
between, he was energy secretary for 21 months from 1981-83.
His book* is, he says, 'not an autobiography, but a ministerial, and in
particular a chancellorial, memoir'. It is not 'an essay in the higher
economic scholasticism', but 'an account of the period, and of my part in
it, as I saw it and see it'.
Two things call for judgment, the book itself and Lawson's record in high
office. The book is quite simply a great achievement, grippingly readable,
fascinating, lucidly organised and meticulously produced. I read it in my
garden on a sunny Saturday morning; and it was not until eight hours later
that the cold, hunger and the dusk finally broke my riveted attention. The
story itself is absorbing; the writing is plain and muscular.
It is several books in one - a political memoir and a record of economic
policymaking during an exceptionally controversial decade. But it is, too, a
manual for ministers, for civil servants and for students of government.
It is, thirdly, a set of theses, including two main economic ones: that a
profound, lasting and benign transformation of the British economy was
accomplished in the 1980s, despite its messy ending; and that British
membership of the EC's exchange rate mechanism (or European Monetary System
as Lawson prefers to call it) is the best basis for monetary policy, which
alone is the correct weapon of macro-economic stabilisation (except perhaps
in a slump). Equally, membership of economic and monetary union (that is, a
European single currency) would be a fatal mistake.
And finally the book is a devastating chronicle of the progressive
deterioration of the prime minister he served: 'The picture she liked to
present of herself as a uniquely doughty fighter against inflation was . . .
largely mythical'; 'profound hostility to raising interests rates or
maintaining any kind of sterling target'; 'never objected to lower interest
rates'; 'came increasingly to believe that she was the government and had no
need of allies . . . these traits led to the isolation and behaviour pattern
that contributed to her eventual downfall'; 'the two ministers (Geoffrey
Howe and Lawson) who . . . had probably done most over the previous 10 years
to roll back the frontiers of socialism, very often against Margaret's
cautious hesitation . . . were now at the top of her blacklist'; 'increasing
numbers of . . . voters saw her as disagreeably strident, excessively
authoritarian and unbearably bossy'; but also that 'the achievements of the
Thatcher era will survive its messy disintegration' and, despite all, she is
still 'one of the greatest prime ministers this country has known'.
However superb the book the record is another matter. Lawson's own view is
clear: he was an (at times, the) originator and chief executor of an
intellectually driven political revolution - including inventing the word
'Thatcherism' - which transformed Britain and, indeed, the world: 'The tide
of ideas, which I had first invoked in my 1986 party conference speech, was
flooding into areas that I had never then envisaged.' It was a source of
inspiration not yet acknowledged by Mr Gorbachev.
As to Britain, Lawson defines his 'economic theme . . . that free-market
Toryism proved both a success in the UK and a beacon to much of the rest of
the world and that my own stewardship, whatever its shortcomings, was an
important part of that success'. And the success was that 'the reforms have
indeed improved the economy's long-term growth potential'.
Hundreds and hundreds of pages describe the genesis and details of those
reforms. Only two pages (pp. 976-7) examine the question of whether the
medicine which the doctors were so convinced would restore the health of the
patient actually did so.
The inescapable conclusion is that, however strong the faith, the healing is
not confirmed by the evidence. Specifically, the non-oil GDP (Mr Lawson's
preferred measure of total economic output) rose by an average annual 2 1/4
per cent during the Howe/Lawson cycle (1979-89), compared with 3 per cent in
the 1964-73 cycle and  3/4 per cent in the 1973-79 cycle.
Only one question matters: did the potential output of the economy (when
operating at the lowest level of unemployment consistent with stable
inflation) rise faster after the reforms than it did before?
When it is borne in mind that every proper measurement for any reasonable
period prior to 1973 puts GDP long-term growth at between 2 and 3 per cent a
year, the only significant thing to come out of Lawson's table is the very
low number -  3/4 percentage point - for the 1973-79 cycle. The simplest
explanation of that is given in another of Lawson's tables (p 281), namely
that the 1979 'peak' was hardly a peak at all, compared with the 1973 and
1989 peaks, in terms of the percentage utilisation of the capacity of the
economy as measured by the CBI. There is no suggestion whatever in these
figures of any historic improvement at all in underlying growth performance.
To make that even remotely plausible would require some worked-out and
corroborated hypothesis that capacity growth itself had nose-dived in the
late 1970s, completely at odds with its remarkably stable trend throughout
the rest of the post-war years, and that this trend would have continued but
for the 'Thatcher miracle'. For this there is no systematic evidence
whatever.
None of this is in any way affected by the arguments, which nonetheless
exercise Lawson himself greatly, over the causes of and responsibility for
the late 1980s boom and the consequent plunge into recession. He is entirely
candid about his regrets over diagnosis of its origins, which include Mrs
Thatcher's primary responsibility for what he sees as the pivotal error at
the end of 1985 and throughout 1986 - namely her refusal to enter the ERM in
November 1985, and the ensuing de facto devaluation of the pound during
1986.
This acknowledged error is evidence neither for nor against the 1980s
miracle thesis. The only qualification of this goes to weaken the evidence
of 'miracle'. To the extent that some of the output recorded in 1989, and
therefore of the growth between 1979 and 1989, should be deducted as having
been a 'mistake', the recorded growth exaggerates the achieved underlying
growth, although some analogous adjustment of the 1979 figure should also be
made to the extent (less than in 1989) that this too was a mistake.
After throwing in the general world slowdown in achieved growth after the
1973 oil price explosion, Lawson claims that 'Britain's growth performance
in the 1980s emerges quite creditably'. Even if true, which is dubious, this
falls a long way short of corroborating the claimed success of 'a great
adventure . . . to rescue Britain from economic and political decline'.
As to his passionate advocacy from 1985 of British membership of the ERM,
there does seem to be a profound internal inconsistency in Lawson's
thinking, quite apart from the oddity of a six-year chancellor's central
policy idea being something that he was never able to implement, even
partially.
His overriding reason for wanting the pound to be in the exchange rate
mechanism was not to suppress short-term fluctuations in floating exchange
rates, which may cause some nuisance to trade, but to reinforce and guide an
anti-inflationary monetary policy both by forcing governments to keep
interest rates high enough and by encouraging low inflationary expectations
by those who set pay and prices.
He scorns, as only he can scorn, a Foreign Office plan for joining the ERM,
but envisaging 'automatic realignments in order to cope with the different
inflation rates in different member states - which rather destroyed the
point of joining in the first place'. The 'point' is that the adopted parity
should be seen to be and should, at least by intention, be immutable in
order to drive inflation down to zero or at least to the lowest in Europe.
But, when Lawson comes to explain his passionate hostility to Emu and a
single currency, he writes, 'locking into a single currency and thus
depriving member states for all time of the possibility of adjustment
through devaluation should not require any growth of regional assistance
whatever . . . But politically . . . the demands for increased regional
assistance would be very strong indeed . . . (which) also feeds the
centralising appetite of the European Commission'.
He is absolutely right about this; but the problem and the political
pressures would not arise for Lawson if he did not believe that unadjusted
competitiveness problems lead to unemployment and depression, and that the
possibility of devaluation is therefore essential.
Lawson in fact believes that the correct answer to these political demands
is for the economy to adjust its competitive deficit through devaluation.
But, if he believes in an ERM with realignments, as he clearly does, then he
cannot pray in aid of the anti-inflation argument for membership, which
depends on outlawing realignments.
And, if he believed in outlawing realignments, which he does not, he could
not argue against Emu, which is the ERM without realignments. And if,
finally, he believes in realignments, but only in extremes, he can hardly
disdain Messrs Major and Lamont for carrying matters to extremity or argue
that ERM membership will prevent turbulence in the foreign currency markets.
And if he does not disdain them for thus mishandling ERM membership, he has
difficulty in meeting the argument that Black Wednesday demonstrated that
the policy was fatally flawed, not just in the timing of entry, but in its
basic concept because it depended on an overriding political commitment to
an economically and financially undeliverable result.
Meanwhile, everyone should be obliged to read before next Thursday's Autumn
Statement Lawson's recollection of the cabinet's follies exactly 10 years
earlier: There was 'an unwise decision made by the cabinet in the autumn of
1982 to encourage the nationalised industries and local authorities to
increase their capital spending. The view was that, given the persistence of
high and rising unemployment, the government should listen more seriously to
the demands from the construction industry for more capital investment. . .
I was concerned at the signal Margaret's message was bound to convey that
the period of public spending stringency was over. To make matters worse,
the spending forecasts on which Margaret's uncharacteristic and ill-advised
exhortations were based turned out to be false, as she was duly furious to
discover.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH government's employment green paper, designed to curb the power
of an already enfeebled trade union movement, seemed a hangover from the
Thatcherite 1980s when it was first published last year. But now, after nine
quarters of recession and with the abolition of the wages councils tacked
on, the employment bill looks even more anachronistic.
The bill may still make good politics, providing Tory backbenchers with some
light relief from seeing the finances of trade unions put under pressure.
And there are elements of the bill which make good sense, in particular the
strengthening of the rights of individual trade union members. Yet in
deciding now to abolish the wages councils the government is taking a risk.
Attempting to reduce the wages of low-paid workers, at time of depressed
confidence, rising unemployment, and with the public sense of injustice
already aroused by the miners debacle, is not the most politic of actions.
In any case, the evidence does not suggest that the low levels set by the
wages councils have a significant negative employment effect, as the
government claims. By contrast, Labour's relatively high national minimum
wage would certainly have cost jobs. There is, in fact, a case for a system
of low but flexible wage floors as a way of preventing unscrupulous
employers from paying below market wages. The main weakness of the current
system is that, since 1986, the industry minima have been set nationally
rather than regionally.
Abolishing them now, in the current depressed economic climate, is likely to
do little more than reduce the wages of some low-paid workers, while
increasing the amount of family credit paid to those low-income households
that are adversely affected.
This government is showing again a rare taste for the wrong battles. Yes,
the UK faces great labour market challenges which require political
leadership. But trade union power and the wages of the low paid are low down
the list of problems. The government needs to devise strategies which can
reduce unemployment while keeping the real wage growth of above-average
earners under control when recovery comes. So far, on these issues the
government has had little to say and less to offer.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Arts: Just Between Ourselves - Middle class manners are
parodied in the theatre this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
People often speak of Alan Ayckbourn as if he wrote only one kind of play: a
social comedy about the precarious awfulness of lower-middle-class life.
Actually - especially in the last 10 years - Ayckbourn has turned his comic
talent in many directions. In some plays, he has shown himself to be one of
those rare artists who can portray real evil. In others, he has gone beyond
the comedy of nervous breakdown into the odd poetry of actual derangement.
Elsewhere he has dramatised man's inhumanity to woman.
His 1976 play Just Between Ourselves, now at the Greenwich Theatre, is
fascinating, for its points in all these directions. Dennis lives with his
wife Vera and his mother Marjorie. He can always laugh at everything - not
least Vera and her depression. He spends his spare time on disastrous
do-it-yourself in the garage. The fact that he cannot mend a kettle
successfully has no bearing on the fact that he blithely, laughingly,
constantly, insists upon Vera's incompetence. And, when he makes a new
friend, Neil, they use each other merely as sounding-boards for their own
closet (garage) misogyny.
It is astonishing how Ayckbourn makes this, in the first place, hilarious.
This is one of his more exquisite studies in the Comedy of Excruciation.
And, like all his work, it is an object-lesson in construction. Brick by
brick, he painstakingly piles one unfunny detail upon another; and, for many
long minutes, we seem to be watching not a comedy but a miniature hell of
pettiness and insensitivity. Then, suddenly, he brings all his ingredients
together, switches on a light, and lets the comedy erupt and climb. We soon
see that we are watching a comedy of psychological collapse; and yet we can
only laugh.
Then Ayckbourn takes us past nervous breakdown. In his final scene, he
exposes all the inhumanity that has been apparent in the whole set-up; and,
having shown us the funny side, he never flinches from reminding us of the
unfunny. It is his peculiar brilliance that he ultimately steers the play
out of comedy without losing his audience's respect.
Robin Midgeley, the director, paces and times everything to perfection.
Susan Jameson and Robin Nedwell, playing Vera and Neil, are so consistent
that their slightest move intensifies the play. As Dennis, the leading but
most repellent role, Martin Jarvis gives an expert if slightly over-emphatic
performance. And, though everything Rosalind Ayers does as Neil's wife Pam
works, her characterisation is not quite robust enough to convince.
The great performance, however, is Liz Smith's as Marjorie, hell bent on
keeping her son as Oedipal as possible, and determinedly revenging herself
on his wretched wife. Of course, she has a field-day with lines like
(remembering her late husband) 'He had a very deep and wonderful
understanding of suffering' but she also makes us guffaw as she draws out a
line like 'Yes, I might as well have a sandwich . . .' even before adding
the crowning sadism of the sequel '. . . seeing as she hasn't made cake.'
Greenwich Theatre until December 12.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Arts: The Tender Husband
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Richard Steele, MP (1672-1729) was, according to Dr Johnson, 'the most
agreeable rake that ever trod the rounds of indulgence.' He co-founded the
original Spectator, Tatler and Guardian, invented the periodical essay, and
wrote a clutch of overlooked plays. The Magnificent Theatre Company has
revived The Tender Husband in a fine, fizzing production, now at the
Watermans Arts Centre.
The Tender Husband (1705) parodied middle class manners in an increasingly
bourgeois society; it looked back to Moliere, but introduced types later
used by Sheridan and Goldsmith.
Clerimont, the tender husband, has indulged his wife's capacious spending,
but now wants to shame her into frugality. His penurious younger brother,
condemned to an army career, settles on Biddy Tipkin, a rich, air-headed
romantic. But her ward, Hezekiah Tipkin, Lombard Street banker, wants her to
marry a wealthy West Country squire called Humphrey Gubbin, who in turn
loves Lucy Fainlove, the very woman whom Clerimont has disguised as a man
with hopes of compromising his wife. The tangle is cut by Samuel Pounce, an
obsequious lawyer: 'The Pounces will always have money, if there's any in
the world.'
The plot turns on love, money and opportunity. Nothing survives Steele's
Whiggish scrutiny: banking, country life, fashion, law, literature. The
play's principles remain simple: ''Tis by knowing what a man thinks of
himself, by giving him that, you may make him what you will.' Moral
questions never arise, for Steele speeds the action and forms his characters
by circumstance.
The directors, Lucie Fitchett and Ben Crocker respond to Steele's paciness.
The plain set and parody period costumes are a delight, with quilted cherubs
on Biddy's frock, and interlocking numbers on the banker's dress-coat. The
acting should deliver the satire with less fuss. But those who find the
right tone are Harriet Keevil as the sexy Lucy Fainlove, John Conroy as the
machinating Pounce and Simon Holmes as the bankrupted Clerimont shackled to
a connubial horror in organza.
Steele himself was a tender husband. He met his second wife at the funeral
of his first, and made sure he was always in touch. On February 16, 1716 he
wrote her this one-line gem: 'Dear Prue: Sober or not I am ever yours,
Richard Steele.'
Watermans Theatre, Brentford (081 568 1176) until November 14. Then on tour
to: Stamford, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Hexham, King's Lynn, Crewe, Blackpool,
Hemel Hempstead and Bury St Edmunds. Ends December 5

FT  06 NOV 92 / Arts: Sensuous sculpture - The sexuality of Victorian and
contemporary sculpture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pandora is the pivotal figure in two complementary sculpture shows in Stoke
on Trent. According to Hesiod, Zeus created Pandora, the first woman, as a
punishment for man's theft of fire. Hephaestus fashioned her out of clay,
Athena breathed life into her, and the other gods were invited to endow her
with every charm: hence Pandora or 'all-gifted'.
Hermes, however, gave her flattery and guile; and she was given a jar - not
a box - which she was forbidden to open. Curiosity apparently overcame her
and the vessel was opened, releasing all the evils and diseases of the world
from which man had hitherto been free. Only Hope was left crouching inside
the lid.
Harry Bates' marble Pandora represents the quintessence of late Victorian
art. The kneeling Pandora is indeed physical perfection, the gentle curves
of her bare flesh seem soft and yielding; her thigh voluptuously dimples
under the weight of the fateful casket. She is the paradox of the 'beautiful
evil' or 'deadly delight' of Greek myth and early Christian writing - and
here she is in like company.
The siren Circe and the temptress Eve also find a place in Reverie, Myth,
Sensuality: Sculpture in Britain 1880-1910, and with them the charge of
sexual frisson jumps up a volt. In Mackennal's bronze statuette Circe stands
erect, her arms and fingers outstretched, exercising her power to turn men
into swine, a metaphor for lust. So shocking were the cavortings of the
enslaved men depicted around the base that the sculpture was partially
swathed in red baize during its exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1894.
Sir Thomas Brock's monumental marble Eve is not the triumphant temptress,
but the sinner burdened with shame. Her head hangs low and she is too
wretched to even hide her nakedness. She stands exposed and vulnerable - and
every inch as invitingly tactile as Bates' Pandora. The other side of the
Victorian obsession with the virtuous and wicked woman emerges in
Reynolds-Stephens' Guinevere, showing the disgraced queen's redemption
through prayer and good works. The pervasive mood of these pieces is
contemplative, with the idealised human figure the most expressive metaphor
of mood and feeling.
This handsome survey reveals various aspects of the radical 'New Sculpture'
which emerged in Britain during the 1870s, a subject unjustly neglected
until a decade or so ago. These sculptures can be seen as three-dimensional
manifestations of the art of Rossetti, William Morris, Burne-Jones, Albert
Moore, Lord Leighton and GF Watts. Indeed Leighton and Watts were
painters-cum-sculptors, and Alfred Stevens was architect and designer too.
The movement's leading lights, Alfred Gilbert and George Frampton, pioneered
the use of polychromy in sculpture.
One of the primary aspirations of the New Sculptor was to expand the domain
of sculpture. Efforts were made to improve standards and to bring sculpture
back into the home. Gilbert produced numerous editions of bronzes in various
reduced sizes. Revealingly, the considerable succes d'estime enjoyed by the
New Sculptors did not guarantee financial security. Sir Alfred Gilbert was
bankrupted. The plaster model of Sir George Frampton's 'Mysteriarch' serves
as telling evidence of the difficulty sculptors faced in persuading a patron
to translate a model into expensive marble or bronze.
The Pandora myth provided the point of departure for a series of sculptures
and videos by the contemporary artist Rose Garrard which mark a neat
transition to the second show at Stoke, Traces of the Figure. All nine
contemporary artists make reference to the human body, albeit obliquely.
Subjectmatter is similarly ambiguous and unspecific, but the sexuality
implicit in the earlier work is now defiantly overt. This sexuality,
however, tends to be stripped of any eroticism. Deacon's 'The eye has it'
seems like a giant, trouser-tailed spermatozoa embarking on its journey;
Helen Chadwick similarly presents in triptych form a pair of fried eggs
flanked by barely visible organisms. Cathy de Monchaux both encases and
lines lead and steel tubes in lusciously soft red velvet.
More disturbingly, nature is relentlessly red in tooth and claw. Hermione
Wiltshire adds a cross-section to the hosier's dummy leg that shows the
blood, bone and muscles inside the real thing. Helen Chadwick's blown-up
images of the human scalp and a seething crown of worms that are horribly
suggestive of suppurating wounds, unsavoury bodily fluids and of mortality.
Of greatest presence is Alison Wilding's imperious construction draped with
black cloth. In this context, it stands like a funeral bier awaiting a body.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Arts: Forever Yours Marie Lou
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You recognise the scene at once, yes? All-too-closely-knit Welsh family,
locked into poverty. Papa Leopold fearsomely concerned with having the right
kind of peanut butter (smooth, not crunchy), and a selfish animal in bed;
weary mother Marie Louise - herself one of 14 siblings - pregnant with only
her fourth child; daughter Manon imitating her somnambulistic Roman Catholic
piety, sister Carmen finding a tacky kind of liberation as a
Country-and-Western chanteuse.
Not familiar? Well: the trouble is that this well-travelled 21-year-old play
is by Michel Tremblay, French Canada's leading playwright. Forever Yours
Marie Lou is one of his earliest plays, but like all of his work it is set
in a social and linguistic milieu which is as specific as could be. As
rendered in Welsh-English by the young Thin Language Theatre Company, it
becomes almost a surrealist exercise, unmoored to anything in real history
or life.
There are two reasons why Marie Lou struck a resonant chord which echoes
still for both French- and English-Canadian audiences. One is that it
captured the 1960s turning-point as it felt in Quebec, where within half a
generation that province stopped being a priest-ridden, wilfully 'backward'
community and joined the thrusting modern world. Almost overnight the Quebec
birthrate dropped from its traditional teeming high to Canada's lowest
(below replacement-level): and to get a book that was on the Index - Joyce,
Gide, Cocteau - from your local library you no longer had to ask for it in
English.
The other reason why the play has enjoyed so many productions is that its
poetic structure is fresh and sharply original. Though most of the action
takes place in the family kitchen/dining-room, it tacks continually between
a 'now' where the orphaned daughters argue over their family past, and an
earlier 'then' (at least ten years ago) when they were brutally subjected to
it. In that same room we witness the old parental rows and feel the
children's reactions and their older selves' bitter recall in ghostly
interpenetration. The grownup sisters' dialogues should alternate fluidly
with the horrid childhood scenes.
Sadly, the Thin Language product was far too clumsy with that
backward-and-forward switching to make it work. The script stammered
painfully - where a dialogue from one time should smoothly override one from
another, there were sudden, hiccoughing stage-waits. No dramatic rhythm or
pace; often, no clear indication of where or when these things were
happening. The stage-lighting might have helped but didn't, despite simple,
well-meant efforts by the technicians.
Though the storm-or-threatening forecasts prompted character-sketches along
the right lines, they registered here as shallow, unlocalised stereotypes,
never very funny or very moving. Native Forever Yours Mary Lou types might
relish the cynical tones of personal indictment, loud and unsparing, with
apologies only when caught out; but the Thin Language team recreates too
little sense of a real, stifling mini-world to trigger sympathetic responses
from the rest of us.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Arts: Crime against Swan Lake - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Given publicity which reads: 'They tried to ban it, they alleged risque sex
scenes - next week you can see it', ballet audiences might suppose that they
were being lured to a cross between Vampire Lesbians of Sodom and the Kama
Sutra. But no] It is Northern Ballet Theatre's way of alerting us to the
charms of their Swan Lake. And, for once, I can agree with the publicity:
'they' should try to ban it. Not for any risque sex scenes - the production
has the erotic potential of a meringue - but for the sheer naughtiness of
asserting that this night out with the boys has anything much to do with
Swan Lake as a masterpiece of classical ballet.
Igor Stravinsky declared that a crime against a work of art started with a
crime against its text. NBT's staging, which I gather has wowed audiences in
the regions, recasts the traditional narrative so that it involves a
political coup, rejects all the accepted Ivanov/Petipa choreography, and
re-orders and (more excusably, given NBT's restricted means) re-orchestrates
Tchaikovsky's music. The resultant production - hectic in manner; desperate
in step - is entirely consonant with the policy of Christopher Gable, NBT's
director, to provide highly flavoured ballets for his largely regional
public.
My objections will be dismissed as those of a 'purist' - a term of
opprobrium in matters such as this, which I take as the highest of
compliments - who believes that Swan Lake, as shown by the Mariinsky or
Royal Ballets, has a noble identity owed to sublime lyric and bravura
choreography born of a superb dramatic score. But public appetite for
ballet's sacred titles, if not for a ballet's choreography, means that
managements know the truth of the dictum 'give them anything, but call it
Swan Lake'. Hence NBT's need for those two four-letter words, and the
necessity to turn the piece into the brawl that is on view at the Royalty
Theatre this week.
I sympathise with Gable's belief in dance drama, and in his wish to show
audiences that ballet can be directly and vividly communicative. He wins his
public with every staging. But I deplore the brutalisation of Swan Lake, its
miserable choreographic text by Dennis Wayne, its roller-skating bear, its
cohorts of swans who look like the deported drabs in Manon's third act, and
its meretricious dramatics. Above all, I despair at its absolute denial of
the power of classic academic dancing under the banner of one of classic
dancing's greatest achievements.
Northern Ballet Theatre is at the Royal Theatre this week with Swan Lake

FT  06 NOV 92 / Costain expected to cut 300 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 300 jobs are expected to be lost at Costain as part of a campaign
to cut overheads by 30 per cent in the group's UK engineering and
construction division.
The move will swell the growing tide of redundancies in the recession-hit
construction industry - where more than 400,000 jobs have lost since summer
1989.
The construction and engineering division is to become Costain's largest on
the completion of the sale of its profitable Australian coal-mining business
for Pounds 123m to Peabody Coal, a subsidiary of Hanson, the Anglo-American
conglomerate.
As a first step Costain will close its engineering and construction division
headquarters in Woking, Surrey, and move staff to the group's headquarters
in south London. About 70 jobs are expected to go as a result.
The group also plans to rationalise its regional construction businesses
operating from a network of local offices. A further 250 jobs could go as a
result.
The redundancy package is expected to cost the group Pounds 800,000 for the
closure of the Woking office and about Pounds 3m for the rationalisation of
the division as a whole. Costain is expected to make savings of Pounds 8m a
year from the rationalisation.
The move is the latest in a series of actions by the group to generate cash
to reduce large borrowings. The number of UK-based employees, mostly in
engineering and construction, has fallen by 1,400 to 2,900 in the last 18
months.
Contractors have appealed to the government not to cut spending on large
infrastructure projects. They have warned that unemployment in the industry
will soar if projects like the Pounds 1.6bn extension to London
Underground's Jubilee Line are postponed.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Trachtenberg case curbs lifted: Former Maxwell financial
adviser charged with failing to answer SFO questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE High Court yesterday lifted reporting restrictions on the hearing of an
extra charge against Mr Larry Trachtenberg, former financial adviser to
Robert Maxwell.
Mr Trachtenberg, it can now be reported, has been accused of failing to
answer questions put to him by the Serious Fraud Office under section two of
the Criminal Justice Act which empowers it to remove the right to silence.
The hearing began two weeks ago at Clerkenwell Magistrates Court in London.
The lifting of restrictions follows a succession of court battles between Mr
Trachtenberg, charged with theft and fraud over the Maxwell affair, and
newspapers including the Financial Times.
Mr Trachtenberg had argued unsuccessfully that reporting of the case would
prejudice his main trial, on the theft and fraud charges. The trial is due
to start in early 1994, when he will appear in the dock alongside Robert
Maxwell's two youngest sons, Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell, and Mr
Robert Bunn.
During Mr Trachtenberg's appearance at Clerkenwell, Mr Bill Waite, an SFO
lawyer investigating the Maxwell affair, said substantial assets appeared to
have been misused.
But he went on: 'I am not sure you can say with any certainty that there has
been financial gain by any of the parties under investigation.'
He also said that more charges were expected to be brought against Mr
Trachtenberg before his trial. The six theft and fraud charges currently
against him are only 'sample' charges.
Soon after his arrest in June, Mr Trachtenberg was served with a section two
notice by the SFO, compelling him to answer investigators' questions, the
court heard. Mr Trachtenberg attended a meeting but, having taken legal
advice, refused to answer key questions. He denied breaking the law,
claiming it allowed people with a 'reasonable excuse' not to answer
questions and that he had such a reasonable excuse.
The issues on which Mr Trachtenberg refused to answer questions included:
His personal assets outside the UK including a Swiss Bank account and a
Jersey trust account.
The previous owner of his London house.
How he first met Robert Maxwell.
His role as commercial director within the Robert Maxwell Group.
The purpose of London and Bishopsgate Holdings, a company within the Maxwell
empire, of which he was a director.
The purpose of First Tokyo Trust, of which he was the company secretary.
Liechtenstein stiftungs (foundations) related to Robert Maxwell and his
family.
The Maxwell foundation and movement of assets to it.
Mr Trachtenberg told the SFO that it was unreasonable for him to be
interviewed after he had been charged and when he was expecting more charges
to be brought against him. The SFO would be requiring him to present his
defence before it had assembled its case. This shifted the burden of proof
from prosecution to defendant, he argued. He told his interviewers: 'It is
my belief that the SFO would be motivated by the desire to obtain
information to help convict me.'
Mr Alan Suckling QC, for the SFO, told the court that carrying out
interviews under section two after a person had been charged was within the
law. A recent test case in the House of Lords, that of Mr Wallace Duncan
Smith, had ruled that this was within the SFO's powers.
Mr Waite, who had tried to interview Mr Trachtenberg, said the SFO's
intention had been to obtain information relating to its general
investigation into the Maxwell affair, not just Mr Trachtenberg's
involvement.
Mr Trachtenberg had not been interviewed before his arrest, but the SFO had
enough evidence to justify charging him, he argued.
He told the court that there were significant differences between his case
and that of Mr Smith. The case continues today.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Magistrate says move in public interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THESE reports will be the guardian, rather than the foe, of justice and the
public interest,' said Mr Christopher Bourke, the magistrate in the case of
Mr Larry Trachtenberg, when he lifted reporting restrictions on the case,
John Mason writes.
His comment went to the core of the protracted legal argument over whether
the media should be able to fully report the court hearings.
Mr Trachtenberg, backed by the Serious Fraud Office, argued that the
hearings would attract widespread press coverage and that this might
prejudice his main trial, due to start in early 1994.
Mr Trachtenberg and the SFO pressed for restrictions to be imposed which
prevented the publication of any details which identified Mr Trachtenberg
personally or made any reference to the Maxwell affair.
They argued that public interest in the general question of defendants
refusing to answer section two questions after they had been charged could
still be served by anonymous reporting of the basic issues.
However, lawyers for newspapers argued that such limited reporting was
against the broad public interest and unworkable in practice. It could also
lead to rumour and confusion, since readers might think the trial concerned
the other defendants in the Maxwell case.
They also cited the decisions of the judges in the Guinness and Blue Arrow
fraud trials who had ruled that the public interest in the full reporting of
the first trials outweighed any possible prejudice to subsequent trials.
Mr Bourke initially applied the reporting restrictions, but lifted them two
weeks ago pending Mr Trachtenberg's appeal to the High Court for a judicial
review. Mr Trachtenberg's application was refused yesterday.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Management: BBC produces a comedy of errors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-predicted crisis at the BBC came not, as expected, in news and
current affairs or drama. It was the comedy department, famous for
programmes such as Porridge and Dad's Army, that really stuck the boot in.
The department gave way to the temptation of a cheap deal and decided to
take all BBC comedy programmes outside the corporation for editing and post
production.
It was just the sort of crisis that the critics of Producer Choice, the
controversial new policy that will allow BBC producers progressively to buy
in services from the outside world, had predicted. Work was going outside
the corporation for short-term financial reasons and away from BBC staff -
leaving the accountants to sweep up the double charging problem and point to
the need for further redundancies.
The centre simply had to move quickly to deal with such a crisis. A
competing in-house bargain offer was quickly produced and the desertion of
BBC comedy was nipped in the bud.
This crisis involved mythical comedy programmes such as Bexley Heath Blues
rather than genuine hits like One Foot In The Grave. It was a moment of high
drama in a management simulation called Fast Forward in which senior BBC
figures such as Jonathan Powell, controller of BBC1, and his BBC2
counterpart, Alan Yentob, played themselves.
The simulation created by the Office For Public Management, a consultancy
set up to help harassed managers cope with change, squeezed three years'
experience of Producer Choice into two days.
The aim of Greg Parston and Laurie McMahon of the OPM was to put maximum
pressure on Producer Choice until the system crashed. Then potential
problems could be anticipated and dealt with.
With the exception of blips like the activities of the comedy department and
a Harry Enfield Christmas Show that didn't make it on the air until Easter,
Producer Choice failed to crash.
'It was almost as if, short of them deliberately wrecking it (Fast Forward),
it would be very difficult to crash,' says Laurie McMahon. He watched,
fascinated, as BBC producers, programme commissioners and resource managers,
each dressed in different coloured T-shirts, gradually shed their
institutional inhibitions and behaved, if not entrepreneurially, at least in
an autonomous way.
'Fast Forward is like a flight simulator, except that in this case it's
flown by about 20 pilots and about 50 cabin crew,' says McMahon. He believes
that because they were able to 'fly it' and make sense of the experience,
there should be no fundamental problems with Producer Choice. 'They've made
the managerial leap out of the institutional way of thinking about things
into a much more relaxed and managerial view of life,' he adds.
The points now emerging from the Fast Forward debriefing include the need:
to tie in clearly programme commissioning with the strategy of the
corporation;
to reach clear agreement on underspending to avoid everyone trying to
squirrel money away for a rainy day;
to emphasis the fact that quality is paramount at all stages and avoid
becoming totally cost driven;
to realise the importance of production planning in coping with uneven cash
flows.
For Powell, the conflicts exposed boil down to one fundamental issue -
short-term versus long-term. The radical new relationships between what
will, in effect, be separate businesses, fully-costed and expected to break
even, will have to be carefully managed to ensure that in-house skills and
resources are not decimated in pursuit of short-term savings.
'I think it can be managed as long as people are clear what they are trying
to do,' Powell says.
Throughout the simulation, the concerns about Producer Choice were used to
draw the learning out. Michael Starks, responsible for implementing Producer
Choice by spring 1993, believes that, by playing the game, producers
realised that decisions about quality and price were in their hands.
Now the inevitable has happened. Fast Forward is seen as such a success that
everyone in the BBC from news and current affairs, to regions and radio
wants one.
Despite all the fun and games and elegant simulations, the introduction of
Producer Choice is definitely no laughing matter. Estimates of a potential
overspend at BBC Television Centre in the run-up to implementation of
Producer Choice are heading towards Pounds 45m.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Management: From buckyballs to CNN - Christopher Lorenz
examines the latest thesis of guru Tom Peters, that all companies must
become as fast, flat and flexible as top service organisations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MAY come as quite a surprise to the employees of several investment
banks, a telecommunications utility and an industrial hose maker to learn
that their organisations are seen as models which every company should
emulate in the future.
Television stations, advertising agencies, computer software houses, even
management consultancies - all have been lauded by various writers in recent
years as thriving on just the sort of informality, reduced hierarchy, rapid
responsiveness and project-based organisation which most people consider
necessary to competitive survival for almost every industry in the future.
But investment banks, telecoms carriers and hose makers? Not to speak of the
odd railway company, hand tool manufacturer, and giant engineering group?
Absolutely yes, according to Tom Peters, that tub-thumping American business
evangelist whose books, In Search of Excellence (1982) and Thriving on Chaos
(1987), sold millions and helped mould the attitudes and expectations of
untold numbers of managers and other employees in the US and Europe.
After an interval of five years, while he has stomped noisily around the
seminar and conference circuit in Billy Graham fashion, churning out
articles, newsletters, TV programmes and videos, Peters is back in hardcover
this month with a real vengeance. His new blockbuster, modestly titled
Liberation Management: Necessary Disorganisation For the Nanosecond
Nineties*, weighs in at an enormous 834 pages (22 of them merely displaying
its contents).
In spite of the time it takes to read (as I found to my cost this week), the
book could well become as influential in the next couple of years as
Excellence and Chaos.
As it makes clear via a flood of revealing case studies, Peters considers
that the sort of fast, flexible and flat - or flattish - organisation that
will prosper in the 1990s and beyond is epitomised to various degrees by
Goldman Sachs and other investment banks, by MCI, an ultra-lean
telecommunications carrier, and even by Titeflex, a humdrum hose offshoot in
Massachusetts of Britain's TI group. Peters also eulogises over revitalised
companies such as Union Pacific Railroad, the tools arm of Ingersoll Rand,
and ABB, Europe's most-admired engineering multinational.
Though several of these are manufacturers, Peters argues that they are just
as 'knowledge-based' as the sort of professional service organisations which
he posits as models.
The service organisations to which he gives particular praise include CNN,
Ted Turner's TV network, EDS, the systems integration group founded by Ross
Perot, and McKinsey, Peters's former management consultancy employer, as
well as a bevy of international advertising, design and 'event'
consultancies, notably Britain's Imagination group and part of the
Anglo-American IDEO design agency.
In one sense, Liberation Management is a comprehensively illustrated, racily
written compendium of almost every advanced management practice which has
begun to take root in recent years: not just 'delayering', high-involvement
and responsibility (or 'empowerment'), learning organisations, networks and
so on, but also vertical disintegration and 'outsourcing', total quality,
and fast development and production - which Peters says are part of the
'fashionisation' (ephemeral nature) of everything today.
The book also examines cross-functional teams, constantly shifting project
structures, and even the latest buzz phrase to grip industry, 'process
re-engineering'.
Underlying everything is Peters' advocacy of three basic principles:
breaking organisations into the smallest possible, 'independent' units;
giving every employee a businessperson's strong sense of revenue, cost and
profit; and getting far more involved than ever before with the customer.
But the compilation-like nature of the book does not mean that it lacks
originality. Peters not only relates the principles to each other more
effectively - and colourfully - than some of their original formulators, he
also provides plenty of insights of his own.
One is that the degree of control in flat, networked organisations often
outstrips that found in traditional bureaucracies. This is because of
several factors: project structures tend to focus members on tasks and keep
deadline pressure high; team members are motivated not to let down their
mates; customers are usually close at hand; and there is constant feedback.
Another insight is that the 'pecking order' found in project-based service
organisations such as McKinsey and EDS is very different from the
hierarchies or layers in a bureaucracy. Broadly speaking, anyone can talk to
anyone else and whom you 'report to' depends largely on the situation.
A third is that in these days of rampant subcontracting the construction and
maintenance of a company's 'core competences' does not necessarily mean
assembling a cast of thousands.
More controversial, though fundamental to his argument, is Peters'
insistence on the 'marketisation' of everything - including head office
staff roles. He urges adoption of a rule that every element of an
organisation, even staff and other support functions, demonstrates its
'fitness to compete' by selling a substantial share of its products or
services to the outside world. 'Allow market forces to blow a gale inside
the firm,' declares Peters. Though this may cut many a staff function down
to its appropriate size (often zero), it could also tempt a company to lose
control over core competences which need to remain proprietary.
Similarly, Peters does not come completely to grips with a question that
nags leading companies today: how to foster technical and other skills in a
'horizontal' organisation which has abandoned its previous 'functional'
specialists, and converted almost entirely to multi-disciplinary project
teams. Peters touches on solutions adopted by EDS and others, but does not
explore them fully.
Such cavils aside, Peters' rampaging new tome will delight more people than
it maddens, and instruct almost everyone. Where else, after all, could you
find between two covers a discussion of the organisational implications of
'buckyballs' - Buckminster fullerene carbon molecules, named after the
geodesic domes of American architect Buckminster Fuller, which are able 'to
have the bejesus beaten out of them and bounce back'? At the same time,
there is a case study from CNN's front line and a celebration of the work of
the market economist Friedrich Hayek. The only pity is that the covers of
the book are so damned far apart.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The criteria used to judge property companies vying for Stoy Hayward's
annual award for financial reporting excellence highlight the need for
improvement in many areas of disclosure and treatment. Few property
companies come anywhere near scoring top marks in all areas.
The criteria have changed slightly over the three years of the award, but
the main categories have not. They include:
Introductory information. It should include a table of contents which is
comprehensive and detailed; financial highlights in summary at the front;
and a statement of company objectives including the types of business.
It should also include a record of performance over at least five years,
using indicators such as gross and rental income, value of total sales of
real property, value of all non-real property asset sales, total development
expenditure, pre-tax profits, dividends per share and net asset value.
Earnings per share should be shown in total and split between rental and
trading income.
Chairman's statement. There should be information on the economic and market
conditions over the past year and a forecast for the coming year; how the
company's results have been affected by market conditions; problems which
have materially affected the company's results; and significant investments
during the previous year.
There should be details of the strategy adopted by the management for the
coming year; a forecast of results in the next 12 months with an analysis of
the principal internal and external risks faced by the company; and a list
of the areas of business in which the company will be active in the future.
Accounting policies. The panel supports the capitalisation of interest - by
which interest payments are charged to the balance sheet and not taken as a
cost on the profit and loss account. It does not see it as an example of
'creative' accounting. However, there should be a clear statement of the
policy adopted and the amounts to be used. It believes companies should not
capitalise for more than one year after a building is finished, and that any
amounts capitalised should be net of tax relief.
Completed investment properties should be held in the accounts at their open
market value at the date of the balance sheet. Property investment companies
should have a full external valuation every year. The treatment of any
unrealised gain or deficit on revaluation should be shown.
There should be information on any property transfers between fixed and
current assets. The property should be transferred at book value. Investment
properties should be shown in a separate capital profit and loss account on
disposal, or shown as an extraordinary item.
How profits are taken on long-term projects prior to completion should be
disclosed. Profit should not be taken unless the outcome of the contract can
reasonably be foreseen - because the property has been pre-sold and
contracts exchanged.
Any goodwill - the difference between the price paid on an acquisition and
its net book value which is shown in the accounts - should be justified and
its accounting treatment explained.
Profit and loss account and notes. Income and expenditure related to
property investments, trading and other activities - including joint
ventures and listed and unlisted securities - should all be separately
identified. Trading income should be analysed by sector and location.
Balance sheet and notes. Property held for investments and property held for
dealing, and how much of each is under development, should be separately
itemised. There should be additional details by location, type, tenure, age
and rent review.
Borrowings - including the ability to alter the form of any loans and the
interest rate structure - should be shown, along with the timetable for
repayment, and the significance of those loans held in foreign currencies.
There should be details on deferred tax and potential capital gains payable.

FT  06 NOV 92 / The Property Market: A time for transparency - Efforts to
improve the sector's accounting practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If property companies are waiting anxiously for signs of an upturn in demand
for space, readers of their accounts are just as eager for indications of
improvement in the state of their financial reporting. While the accounts of
businesses in many sectors leave much to be desired, practices followed by
property companies - and property-related items in all companies' accounts -
certainly come near the top of the list of those in need of reform.
The huge increase in rents and property values, and the great expansion of
development during the late 1980s, led to the emergence of many new and
different types of property companies. Accounting standards were hard
pressed to keep pace then. But the subsequent property slump has made
reliance on accounting figures more important than ever, given the growing
need to assess the financial health of the sector's many strugglers.
'Accounting Matters', a weight document on the impact of new accounting
standards recently issued by James Capel, the securities house, puts the
current situation bluntly: 'The scope for improving the quality and
usefulness of property company accounts is considerable. Much work still
needs to be done if (they) are going to show a more accurate statement of a
company's financial position.'
Stoy Hayward, the accountancy firm, has chosen to accentuate the positive,
encouraging improvements in financial reporting by sponsoring an annual
property accounts award for the last three years. This year's winner is to
be announced next week. The aim is to ensure that all property companies
accounts are examined with an eye toward improving current practice.
The scoring system for selecting finalists (see side-bar) is ambitious by
any measure. Yet it is discouraging that few companies achieved more than
about half of the total available marks.
Mr Derek Purdy, from the Department of Economics at Reading University, who
helped analyse companies for the judging panel, says one thing that
surprised him this year was that 'some of the accounts of the bigger
companies were not as bad as I thought'. The smaller companies were more
disappointing.
As Mr Peter Darnell, a partner in Stoy who sits on the panel, says: 'There
has been only very marginal improvement in the last two years. It is still
very disappointing.'
There now appears to be some prospect for real improvement. The Institute of
Chartered Accountants of Scotland, for example, recently issued a paper
calling for the reform of SSAP 19, the accounting standard on investment
properties.
More practically, the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the newly-formed
policing arm of UK accounting standards, has this year made its presence
felt with at least three rulings on property-related matters.
Its judgment in February that Forte, the UK hotel group, was in compliance
with accounting standards even though the company did not depreciate its
properties seemed to endorse existing widespread practice among many
businesses with property assets. But that ruling was followed last month by
a reprimand against SEP Industrial Holdings which seems to have restored the
balance by reiterating that SSAP 12, the accounting standard on
depreciation, is still in force. Both companies argued that the value of
their properties had been maintained. The difference was that properties can
only escape depreciation if they are regularly revalued, which Forte had
done.
Perhaps the most significant sign of reform is the review panel's recent
action against Trafalgar House, which is being forced to reduce last year's
pre-tax profits by Pounds 83m and shareholders' funds by Pounds 20m. This
reflects the panel's ruling that the company's practice of switching a
series of development properties held as current assets in the balance sheet
to fixed assets was unacceptable.
That principle has already been made mandatory for other companies through
one of the guidelines recently approved by the urgent issues task force of
the Accounting Standards Board (ASB).
Despite this recent activity, the James Capel document argues that the ASB's
agenda has yet to touch on the most important issues affecting property
company accounts. Issues such as off-balance sheet finance and
capitalisation of interest, for example, have yet to receive adequate
attention.
In the meantime, Capel says that last week's financing reporting standard
from the ASB on the structure of the profit and loss account - which
virtually abolishes extraordinary items - will actually add to confusion
over the disposal of investment property.
The process may have started, but it will probably be long after the next
property recovery before the sector's accounts show marked improvement.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL TIMES has won the Texaco/Industrial Society Industrial
Journalism of the Year Award, the first time that it has been won by a
publication rather than an individual.
The award judges said the FT was 'enormously strong', and 'in a class of its
own'. They praised the all-round excellence of the FT's reporting and
reporters across a broad range of topics, shown by the success of FT
journalists in the specialist categories of the awards.
Ms Rhiannon Chapman, director of the Industrial Society, said the paper was
'no longer just the thing that all those people who used to wear bowler hats
read on the Tube'.
David Goodhart, labour editor, won the Europe Industrial Journalist of the
Year Award, while reporters Bronwen Maddox, Lisa Wood and Diane Summers all
received commendations in the national newspapers category. John Thornhill,
packaging and retailing writer, was commended in the environment category.
The FT's Pounds 750 prize is being donated to the award scheme which
commemorates David Thomas, the resources editor of the FT who was killed on
an assignment in Kuwait last year.
Channel 4 News won the television programme award for industrial journalism
and BBC Radio 4 won the radio award. Michael Smith, labour editor of The
Observer, won the national newspaper industrial journalist award.
John Authers of the Financial Times has won the Unit Trust National
Journalist Award made by the Unit Trust Association. This is the second year
in succession that the FT has received this award. Paul Nuki of the FT
publication Financial Adviser was awarded the title Technical Journalist of
the Year.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Millions lost by MoD: Spending watchdog lists errors over
use of flight simulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTRY of Defence has lost tens of millions of pounds by failing to
use flight simulators instead of aircraft in training, according to a report
published today.
The National Audit Office, the public-spending watchdog, points to errors
including the mothballing of a Pounds 25m simulator for the Harrier GR7
because of delays completing the site in Germany which will house it.
Storage is costing Pounds 95,000 a month.
It concludes: 'There is an urgent need for the development and maintenance
of databases on the cost and effectiveness of current methods of training
including simulators.'
Simulators are used to cut the cost of training pilots. The operating costs
of simulators are about 10 per cent those of aircraft - which use fuel, need
extra maintenance and can be damaged by trainees.
The three armed services have so far spent more than Pounds 450m between
them on simulators and intend to spend a further Pounds 700m over the next
decade.
However, the watchdog points out that some of the simulators do not do their
job. The simulator for the Tornado GR1 fighter aircraft, for example, 'does
not realistically represent the experience of low flying'.
Another simulator, the Air Navigation Trainer at RAF Finningley, 'is so old
that interest has been expressed in it by the Science Museum'.
Many of those that do work are not used enough, the watchdog continues. On
average, simulators are used for less than five hours a day, compared with
the 14 hours available. The report notes that simulators used by British
Airways are used for 20 hours a day.
The report adds that the MoD now recognises that simulators should be
developed alongside aircraft and that both should enter service at the same
time.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Switch in food retailing forecast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HIGH STREET food retailing is set to make a comeback, according to a
research report from stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson.
The study suggests that the relative costs of running high street foodstores
are again becoming favourable for the big grocery chains which have drifted
to out-of-town sites.
Changing trends in demographics and travel, the growing importance of
offering frequently purchased fresh foods, and the current availability of
cheap sites are all adding to the attractions of running high street stores,
the report says.
It adds, however, that so far Tesco is the only one of the biggest three
chains to have developed a 'fully-articulated strategy to address new town
centre opportunities'. Tesco's Covent Garden Metro store in London is seen
as the flagship of a nascent high street chain to compete with Marks and
Spencer's niche foods business.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Self-assessed tax plan is launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL INDIVIDUALS not taxed at source will be able to assess for themselves
the amount of tax they should pay under radical proposals launched yesterday
by the Inland Revenue.
The self-assessment system, described in a consultation document issued
yesterday, considerably broadens the scope of the system from proposals last
year which simply mooted the system for the self-employed.
Under the new version all other personal taxpayers receiving extra income -
such as freelance payments, interest on investments, casual work or rent on
a room - would be able to assess their own liability for tax. Income would
be taxed for the current year.
Those whose entire income is taxed at source through pay-as-you-earn schemes
would not be affected by the changes.
Taxpayers could still ask the Revenue to calculate their tax liability if
they wished.
For those using self-assessment, the Revenue would merely audit a small
number of tax submissions, while accepting payments on liabilities which
taxpayers had calculated themselves.
The current tax system requires taxpayers to submit details of their income
and assets, which is then assessed by the Revenue which calculates the tax
to be paid.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said in a foreword to the document: 'The
proposals would make the personal tax system simpler and fairer. But they
would involve considerable changes for taxpayers, tax advisers and the
Inland Revenue.'
The proposals would not be introduced until the 1995-96 tax year at the
earliest, and then in a transitional form - with full introduction planned
for 1996-97.
The Revenue said the consultative document issued last year on
self-assessment for the self-employed - those with schedule D tax returns -
had been widely welcomed and there had been strong support to extend the
system to other taxpayers.
It has asked for submissions in response to the proposals by January 31.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Standard fees for criminal legal-aid work
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Lord Chancellor's plans to introduce standard fees for criminal
legal-aid work in magistrates' courts would result in a 'significant
reduction in the availability of criminal legal-aid services to the public',
the Law Society warned yesterday.
The society, the solicitors' ruling body, said that a survey of law firms in
England and Wales involved in criminal legal-aid work showed that 32 per
cent of the 1,021 firms that responded would scale down their commitment to
criminal practice if the proposals were introduced in their current form.
Fourteen per cent said they would permanently withdraw all their staff from
24-hour duty solicitor advice schemes at police stations and 11 per cent
said they would withdraw some of their staff. In addition, 15 per cent would
withdraw all staff from magistrates' court duty schemes.
The society said the impact of such withdrawals would threaten the viability
of some schemes and could force others to collapse.

HIGH STREET food retailing is set to make a comeback, according to a
research report from stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson.

decades drifted to out-of-town sites.
Changing trends in demographics and travel, the growing importance of
offering frequently purchased fresh foods, and the current availability of
cheap sites, are all adding to the attractions of running high street
stores, the report says.
Although grocery chains such as J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway will
continue to press ahead with heavy out-of-town programmes, they may
increasingly look to add incremental sales from high street stores. This
would enable them to maximise their substantial investments in establishing
brand franchises and distribution networks.
However, the report says that so far Tesco is the only one of the big three
chains to have developed a 'fully-articulated strategy to address new town
centre opportunities'. Tesco's Covent Garden Metro store in London is seen
as the flagship of a nascent high street chain to compete with Marks and
Spencer.
Food prices at all the big supermarket chains are 'remarkably similar',
according to a report from the National Consumer Council, which suggests
there is little competition between the stores.
'It is also clear that the major multiples gain significant advantages from
their market power through lower supply prices which are not totally passed
on,' it says.
The Safeway supermarket chain said there was 'intense competition' in the
industry.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Commercial lease reform is urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANGES in the law governing the renewal of business leases to reflect the
state of the commercial property market were called for yesterday by the Law
Commission, the government's standing body on law reform.
The commission put forward proposals to improve the workings of part two of
the 1954 Landlord and Tenant Act which gives business tenants the right to
renew the leases of the premises they occupy.
The commission recommends that tenants should no longer have to launch
routine court proceedings simply to safeguard their renewal rights.
The present procedure lays down a tight timetable for lease renewals. Unless
a new lease is agreed within four months of the notice bringing the current
lease to an end, the tenant must start court proceedings or lose his renewal
rights.
Court applications are made in a large number of cases, then withdrawn when
the parties subsequently reach agreement. More than 20,000 applications were
made in county courts last year, but only 20 per cent went through to final
judgment. The commission says that this waste of time and money could be
avoided by allowing landlords and tenants to agree extensions of the
negotiating period.
Landlords at present can apply to the court for the rent to be increased
during protracted renewal negotiations, but tenants have no right to ask for
a revised rent even if the market level has fallen.
The commission wants tenants to have equal rights to allow the legislation
to respond to a market in which rents have dropped sharply. In return,
however, tenants should no longer be entitled to a discount on interim rent
where the eventual renewal of a lease is not in doubt.
Mr Trevor Aldridge, QC, a law commissioner, said the recession made the 1954
act even more important. 'There is strong pressure in the market for shorter
leases of commercial property,' he said. 'This means there will be more
renewals under the present procedures. The changes will save time and
money.'

FT  06 NOV 92 / Shephard stresses rights of individuals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS GILLIAN SHEPHARD, employment secretary, yesterday said that the Trade
Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill would strengthen the rights of
individuals and remove obstacles to the creation of new jobs.
The bill is broadly based on the green paper published last year by Mr
Michael Howard, the then employment secretary.
It abolishes wages councils, the statutory bodies that set minimum rates of
pay for 2.5m workers, and incorporates new provisions based on a proposed
European Community directive on pregnancy. Abolition has been foreshadowed
several times by Mr Michael Forsyth, a junior employment minister.
The green paper received a lukewarm reception from most employers'
organisations. Employers are divided over abolition of wages councils while
the Trades Union Congress has lobbied hard against the move.
The legislation is a logical extension of the framework established by five
employment acts during the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher's time as prime
minister.
Together with the Trade Union Act of 1984, the laws drew unions into a
tighter legal framework. The 1984 act provided for secret ballots before
strikes. The new act will consolidate this by compulsory postal ballots at
all union elections.
The bill contains 34 clauses covering:
Union executives and ballots: The clauses tighten procedures for the
election of union executives.
Unions will have to notify all candidates in an election whether it is
willing to provide them with campaigning assistance and, if so, how much.
Financial affairs of unions: Clauses tighten the way unions conduct their
financial affairs, such as requiring information about the salary and
benefits of each member of a union executive. Presidents and general
executives will be included in the return to an in-dependent certification
officer.
There will be increased monitoring of union activities contained in earlier
acts and unions will be brought closer in line with what is required of
companies.
Union subscriptions: The automatic 'check-off' of union dues is to be more
closely regulated.
Employers will not be able to deduct union subscriptions from a wage unless
the worker authorises this in writing every three years. Unions fear that
this - one of the most controversial parts of the bill - could adversely
affect their depleted finances as members might reconsider membership if
regularly reminded of the cost.
Industrial action: Several clauses strengthen the current restrictions on
how unions can behave.
They will have to conduct postal ballots and must inform employers seven
days before holding a strike.
In addition, the ballot before any call to strike will have to be
independently scrutinised.
Unions will have a tight timetable in which to call strikes. At present,
industrial action must start within 14 days of a ballot result. Placing it
before independent scrutiny could pose timescale problems. Postal ballots
could lead to lower rates of partici-pation.
Maternity rights: All women will have a new minimum entitlement to 14 weeks
continuous leave.
At present only women with two years' continuous service are entitled to six
weeks at 90 per cent of pay and a further 12 weeks on maternity benefit.
Existing rights in relation to dismissal on grounds of pregnancy will be
amended.
This will mean that laying off a woman at any time from the start of her
pregnancy to the end of her maternity leave will be deemed unfair unless
unconnected with her condition. Previously women could be dismissed for
reasons 'connected' with pregnancy.
Health and safety: The act offers protection against dismissal arising from
victimisation.
This would cover workers who, in conditions of imminent danger, seek to
protect themselves and other employees. Wages councils: Part 11 of the Wages
Act 1986, under which 26 wages councils fix minimum basic and overtime rates
of pay, will be repealed.
Industrial tribunals: The jurisdiction of industrial tribunals will be
extended to cover claims for breach of employment contract. Employment
lawyers consider this to be long overdue. At present wrongful dismissal
claims are brought before the High Court.
Choice of union: Workers will have the right to join the union of their
choice. This strikes at the heart of one of the main roles of the Trades
Union Congress - regulating and policing flows of people from one union to
another.
Under the TUC's Bridlington rules on inter-union disputes, affiliated unions
are prevented from taking dissatisfied members from other unions.
Unlawful action: Individuals deprived of goods or services due to an
unlawful strike will be able to pursue high court proceedings to restrain
wildcat action. Lawyers see this as a litigator's paradise while employers,
such as British Rail, have greeted the proposal coolly.
Employment protection: A clause on this amends the Transfer of Undertakings
(Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981, which implements the European
Community's Acquired Rights directive, Catherine Milton writes.
The clause will be felt most by companies taking on contracts to provide
public services.
They will normally not now be able to cut the pay and conditions of staff
who transfer to the public sector without negotiations. This is likely to
reduce savings from contracting-out.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Councils warn of rise in tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL authorities claim government plans to tighten the collection of
business rates could lead to unexpected increases in next year's council tax
bills.
The Local Government Chronicle says today that the plans have 'angered
council treasurers', who fear that council tax bills will be significantly
higher than original government estimates of between Pounds 267 and Pounds
800.
The business rate is set by the government, but councils collect it.
Under proposals set out in a consultation document, councils deemed by the
Department of the Environment and the district auditor not to be diligent in
collecting rates will be liable to make good the shortfall.
Councils pay their business rate revenue into the national non-domestic
rates pool, which bears all the costs of non-collection.
The consultation document proposes that councils should no longer be able to
adjust their payments to the fund for non-collection 'where collection of
debts has been jeopardised by poor collection and enforcement performance'.
The Department of the Environment said the change was necessary because
claims by councils for non-collection would no longer be audited before
being submitted.
'We have no evidence that local authorities are making unduly high provision
for bad debts,' it added.
Last year 95 per cent of the assessed business rate was collected
nationwide.
Mr Ewan Rayner, president of the Association of District Council Treasurers,
said the proposed rule was 'extremely unfair' because it could place
additional burdens on council tax payers 'who can have no responsibility
whatsoever for business rates non-payment'.
The head of Britain's leading association for local tax experts yesterday
warned that many people in local government had a 'death wish' over the
introduction of the council tax.
Mr Colin Farrington, director of the Institute of Revenues, Rating and
Valuation said: 'Whatever short-term difficulties there may be, it is time
for us to reiterate that the new property tax for local government is
basically sound.'

FT  06 NOV 92 / Thatcher's union regime lives on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAKERS OF artificial flowers will soon find, after more than 80 years of
statutory wage protection, that their wages are set according to the harsh
dictates of the international market place.
The government's decision to abolish the 26 remaining wages councils,
announced yesterday, in effect ends Britain's system of statutory industry
minimum wages.
The councils set wages floors for 2.5m low-paid private-sector workers,
about 10 per cent of the workforce, and covered industries as diverse as
catering, hairdressing, laundries, and ostrich-feather workers.
The decision is intended to be a significant political signal from the
government that it is continuing the deregulatory agenda of the then Mrs
Margaret Thatcher when she was prime minister. Yet whether abolition will
increase efficiency and employment in the labour market is highly
contentious. A number of recent studies have suggested that these minimum
wages may even increase employment.
The government has consistently argued that wages councils, by distorting
the labour market, have reduced industrial efficiency and cut jobs. It
repeatedly made clear that it saw no medium term role for the councils and
their influence has declined significantly in recent decades.
The average hourly minimum set by the councils has declined steadily since
1979 as a percentage of the economy-wide average wage. More importantly, the
degree of wage variation within industries covered by councils has also
risen, suggesting that an increasing number of companies are paying wages
above the minimum.
British business has, not surprisingly, been calling for the councils to be
abolished for years in the face of union opposition. The Institute of
Directors argues that the councils constitute a bureaucratic and arbitrary
intervention in the labour market, which is especially onerous on businesses
employing less than 50 people.
A recent report from Income Data Services, the employment research body,
lists complaints from catering and retail companies such as Grand
Metropolitan and from the National Federation of Meat Traders.
The system, they say, is inflexible and arbitrary. The fixed national
minimums make it difficult to introduce pay structures which regard
performance or reflect regional variations in living costs or labour supply.
However, many smaller companies support the retention of wages councils,
according to the IDS survey, because they provide an uncomplicated guide for
wage-setting while preventing larger companies from competing by wage
cutting.
The government acknowledges businesses' complaints, but stresses two other
reasons for abolition: that they reduce employment by keeping wages
artificially high, and that they do so while playing a neg-ligible role in
preventing poverty.
The government claims that 80 per cent of those affected, primarily
part-time women workers, live in households with at least one other income.
So a fall in low wages would not increase poverty significantly.
Although no detailed study exists on the income characteristics of workers
in wage council industries, a study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies on
the income effects of the Labour party's plan to introduce a statutory
minimum wage appears to support the government's conclusions.
The IFS report found that wage floors were a surprisingly blunt way to
attack poverty because most low-wage workers come from high-income
households. The gains from Labour's minimum wage would be concentrated among
middle-income households with the richest 30 per cent having a larger net
gain than the poorest 30 per cent.
Yet minimum wages may still be well targeted on low-income working families,
according to Mr Paul Gregg of the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research.
He finds that a national minimum wage would raise the incomes of more than
half of the poorest 10 per cent of families in which one person works. Most
poor people do not work. But abolishing existing minimum wages may well
increase poverty among the working poor.
Nor is the government's case on the employment effects of abolishing wage
councils very sound. In some highly competitive manufacturing sectors the
evidence suggests that raising wages reduces employment. That was a
conclusion of a Department of Employment study of the UK textile industry in
1985.
In the service sector the evidence - both in the US and the UK - is less
clear cut. A recent study of the employment effects of UK wages councils,
conducted by Mr Stephen Machin and Mr Alan Manning at the London School of
Economics, finds no evidence that the decline in the effectiveness of wages
councils in the 1980s has increased employment.
In the catering industry the results seem to suggest the opposite.
Employers, they argue, have found it profitable to reduce the wages they
pay. But this makes it harder to recruit people and thus reduces employment,
a pattern that can also be seen in the US hamburger industry - not at all
the effect that the government intends.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Basic pay set for 10 per cent of workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN wages councils were set up in 1909 their brief was to encourage the
development of voluntary collective bargaining in industries where unions
had been weak, Catherine Milton writes.
In the industries covered by today's wages councils four fifths of employees
are women working part-time.
The Department of Employment has recently indicated that two thirds of the
workers whose wages are set by the councils are above the minimum rates
which vary between Pounds 2.60 and Pounds 3 an hour.
The councils were set up by the Trade Boards Act which established minimum
pay rates for workers in the 'sweated trades'.
Winston Churchill, then president of the Board of Trade, told the Commons:
'It is a serious national evil that any class of His Majesty's subjects
should receive less than a living wage in return for their utmost
exertions.'
By 1953 there were 66 councils covering 3.5m workers. Since then some
councils have become redundant, others abolished or amalgamated.
The 1986 Wages Act reduced the scope of the councils' influence, removing
workers aged under 21 and requiring councils only to set a single adult
hourly rate and overtime rate.
The councils are made up of workers' and employers' representatives, chaired
by one of three independent conciliators who cast their votes if the two
sides cannot agree.

BRITISH COAL is to increase its supplies of coal to ScottishPower, the

It is to supply an extra 250,000 tonnes to ScottishPower in addition to the
2.5m tonnes it supplies annually under contracts running to 1995. Adding in
other coal which it sells to ScottishPower, British Coal will provide almost
3m of the utility's total consumption this year of 4.8m tonnes.
ScottishPower is also buying 100,000 tonnes from Scottish private mines,
360,000 tonnes from Australia, 250,000 tonnes from Poland, 170,000 tonnes
from the former Soviet Union and 60,000 tonnes from the US.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Fleet buying boosts car sales by 8.2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW-CAR sales for October rose 8.2 per cent over the same month last year,
helped by a big jump in fleet sales.
Registrations of new commercial vehicles also rose year-on-year by 5.3 per
cent to 15,465, according to figures released by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders.
Sales to retail car buyers remained weak, however, with an increase
year-on-year of only 0.5 per cent. Ford, the UK market leader, said it had
'no optimism that the October sales figures are indicating a new trend'.
Yesterday Vauxhall said it would raise prices of its 1993 models by an
average of 3.25 per cent from midnight on November 29. The company said this
would 'not reflect the full extent of the additional cost burden'.
In spite of the continuing weakness of the market and widespread
discounting, Vauxhall's actions could spark a round of car-price increases
as manufacturers seek at least partial compensation for the devaluation of
the pound.
Ford last month raised the prices of its Sierra and Granada ranges, which
are imported from Belgium and Germany, by 2 per cent.
It also cut the prices of some of its UK-built Escort and Fiesta models.
Ford said last month's increase in new-car demand came from the fleet sector
(companies operating 25 or more cars), where registrations jumped 18.8 per
cent to 49,200.
The increase last month should be treated cautiously, as sales in October
last year were weak with a year-on-year decline of 22.5 per cent.
The increase in October car registrations was the second-biggest monthly
rise this year after April's 9.1 per cent increase, bolstered when the
Budget halved the special car tax.
New-car sales tipped 1.4m in the first 10 months of the year, 1.9 per cent
lower than a year ago.
Sales of new commercial vehicles, at 173,111, were still 5.9 per cent lower
than in the corresponding period last year.
Vauxhall, Volkswagen and Nissan made the biggest gains among the leading
carmakers in the UK market last month, while Ford suffered a further erosion
of market share.
Most leading car importers have been studying how best to raise prices after
the pound's devaluation. They have delayed only because of the depressed
state of the market.
Several German and French producers have already raised prices in Italy
following devaluation of the lira.
BMW and Mercedes-Benz are expected to impose increases of up to 6 per cent,
and Volkswagen has been considering an increase of around 5 per cent.
Mr Tom Purves, managing director of BMW (GB), said the company expected its
dealers to 'share the pain' in minimising the increase through reduced
profit margins.
BMW has produced statistics claiming that UK prices 'of almost every BMW'
are lower than in any other European country except Denmark.
Only Rover said there would be no price rises this year.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs hold Major's post-dated cheque
 -Ivo Dawnay counts the cost of the prime minister's narrow victory against
the Maastricht renegades in the Commons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER the party, the bill. Mr John Major's revelation that the Commons will
not complete ratification of the Maastricht treaty until after the Danes
hold a second referendum, roughly pencilled in for May, looks set to provoke
groans on the Continent.
There is every possibility that this was the post-dated cheque that bought
the three crucial votes which won the embattled prime minister the day.
Yesterday, as the Tory Euro-sceptics regrouped, their defectors defended
their wounded pride by blaming the brutal tactics of the whips.
If a lengthy ratification process was the price Mr Major paid, the quality
of his victory is seriously impaired and his ego is not left unbruised.
Arguably well short of a U-turn, the concession still bears all the signs of
an 11th-hour deal offered even after he had made his speech and found that
the voting figures still failed to add up. If that is the case, Mr Major's
authority cannot be assumed to be fully rehabilitated.
How did the prime minister manage to get himself into such a damaging
confrontation - a struggle that at one point left both his own future and
that of the treaty itself seriously under threat?
With hindsight, the showdown became inevitable when, last June, Mr Major
promised Mr Neil Kinnock, then the Labour leader, a routine debate on the
bill before it went to committee stage.
That was before the Danish referendum and Britain's humiliating ejection
from the exchange rate mechanism. After Black Wednesday, Mr Major appeared
to have opted for the safer path of holding the debate but putting intensive
Commons discussion of the treaty text on the back-burner until after next
month's Edinburgh summit.
His statement on September 24 that the committee stage of the bill would be
postponed to await Danish developments and new language on subsidiarity
appeared to satisfy the doubters.
However, the warm reception for the prime minister's speech at the annual
party conference in Brighton early last month has boosted efforts by the
cabinet's pro-European wing to capitalise on the goodwill and take on his
enemies within.
The still unexplained about-turn that led to this week's debate was provoked
at least in part by the attacks on Mr Major's leadership qualities after the
row and consequent U-turn over the coal-mine closures.
It was further hardened when the Euro-sceptic right objected strenuously to
the announcement by Mr Tony Newton, leader of the House, that the government
would table a substantive - as opposed to purely technical motion - for
debate.
That move provoked Lord Tebbit, the fiercely anti-Maastricht former party
chairman, to launch a direct and undisguised dismissal of the prime
minister's personal commitment to ratification. He suggested, woundingly:
'Maastricht is more important that any individual and therefore whether the
prime minister would resign or not is not material in the terms of the
debate.'
Journalists travelling with Mr Major to El Alamein the following weekend
were convinced that it was this remark which provoked the undenied reports
that the PM would call an election if his will was thwarted.
In the next 10 days, the run-up to the debate became a head-on battle of
wills between the two sides. At first the Euro-sceptics appeared to make the
running. A meeting of the rightwing 92 Group showed speakers lined up 21 to
nine against Mr Major's approach. His apparent election threat was dismissed
as 'silly and petulant' by one MP.
The following day, Downing Street gave ground, conceding that the prospect
of an election was 'not relevant'. But there was no quarter given on the
government's determination to table a substantive motion as Mr Major
launched a charm offensive from his Commons office.
Within a day, Labour's shadow cabinet set the scene for a showdown by
committing the party to outright opposition on the grounds that any debate
would, in effect, be a vote of confidence in the government and Mr Major.
That stance appeared, at least in part, to be vindicated by an ambiguous
reply from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. At Foreign Office
questions, he said the Commons would have to decide whether it wanted the
prime minister to preside over the Edinburgh summit - preserving and
extending the influence of Britain in Europe - or whether it did not.
Deftly Mr Jack Cunningham, his shadow, ignored the sub-clause and asked:
'How do you expect us to support that?'
As tension mounted, Mr Major launched an impassioned and well-received
appeal to the backbench 1922 Committee before a weekend of frantic telephone
lobbying by the whips.
Still the discipline and determination of the anti-treaty lobby remained
intact, provoking ever more dire warnings from the cabinet.
Raising the stakes, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
warned that a defeat for the government would leave a 'policy vacuum of
incalculable destructiveness'.
Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, appeared to vindicate Labour's claims
further by arguing in a BBC interview on Sunday: 'We have to show confidence
not only in the government but in the prime minister.'
As the numbers still failed to add up, speculation mounted at Westminster of
a behind-the-scenes deal - most probably with the Ulster unionists. Even Mr
Major's apparently desperate claim to those trooping into his Commons office
that he was 'the biggest Euro-sceptic in the cabinet' failed to deliver the
breakthrough.
By the day of the debate, the members' lobby resembled a goldfish bowl
invaded by sharks as the circling whips pressed their case. Allegations of
calls to tearful wives, missions to constituency chairmen and all the other
ungentlemanly conduct with which the whips are sometimes associated have all
been made.
The bottom line was the three votes that won the day - three votes that may
prove the most important in Mr Major's career.
By the time it comes to a final decision - possibly as late as October next
year - the government hopes that an official Labour abstention on the third
reading will ensure they are never as vulnerable again.
Nonetheless, one tranche of Danegeld has already been paid.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST nationals of the former Yugoslavia will need to get a visa before
travelling to the UK from midnight tomorrow, Mr Kenneth Clarke, home
secretary, announced yesterday.
The requirement will be imposed on all former Yugoslavs except those holding
passports issued by the governments of Croatia and Slovenia.
The UK has already admitted about 40,000 Yugoslavs, with 4,424 applying for
asylum. Mr Clarke said he would tell the United Nations and the Red Cross
that Britain could take 150 former detainees from this weekend. It would
also accept their dependants, making about 600 people in all.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said: 'You may have given hope to that
small group of people with one hand, but by your announcement on visa
requirements today you are taking hope away from many more with the other
hand.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A BILL to deal with compensation claims against Iraq following its 1990
invasion of Kuwait was backed in the House of Lords last night.
The Foreign Compensation (Amendment) Bill will enable the Foreign
Compensation Commission to act in cases where the government receives
compensation through international organisations or tribunals. The technical
measure was given an unopposed second reading.
Baroness Chalker, overseas development minister, said the government had
3,000 compensation claims over the Iraqi occupation, of which 2,000 were
from individuals and the rest from companies.
Lord Judd, for Labour, welcomed the bill and praised the speed with which
the United Nations had moved to deal with Gulf war compensation.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Cash cuts will hit some embassies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEEPING reductions in UK diplomatic centres abroad, including embassies,
are being forced on the Foreign Office by the public expenditure
restrictions and cuts due to be announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, in his Autumn Statement next week, Robert Mauthner writes.
Some 27 diplomatic centres - including embassies, consulates-general and
consulates, many of them in Africa and Latin America - may close as a result
of the cuts. Between Pounds 13m and Pounds 14m could be saved in this way.
The precise budget to be allocated to the diplomatic service and other
Foreign Office departments and services, such as the British Council and the
BBC's external broadcasting services, is still the subject of negotiations.
However, according to some informed estimates, the cuts to be made in
spending on the Foreign Office's services, except for the Overseas
Development Administration, over the next three financial years could amount
to nearly Pounds 100m. The bulk of the savings - an estimated Pounds 40m to
Pounds 50m - would be achieved during the last year of the period, 1994-95.
Among the services likely to be hit are embassies in the smaller countries
of the Third World, consulates in western Europe and commercial services in
the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development.
The Foreign Office's budget amounts to only 0.5 per cent of total government
expenditure, but officials argue that the UK's overseas representation has a
symbolic value far outweighing the money spent on the diplomatic service.
With German and French governments each deciding recently on an increase of
6 per cent in their spending on the diplomatic service, the Foreign Office
is particularly worried about its capacity to promote UK interests abroad.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers seek boost for housing
projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW MEASURES to square the circle of helping the construction industry
without adding too much to public spending will include changes to the
arrangements for combined public-sector and private-sector funding for
Housing Corporation projects.
Ministers from the Treasury and the Department of the Environment are still
agreeing the details of plans to 'stretch' the amount of public spending in
grants to housing associations, whose public funding is administered by the
Housing Corporation.
At present, the balance is 75 per cent public funding to 25 per cent from
the private sector, but that is set to tilt towards the private sector.
Officials are conscious of the need to ensure that the arrangements are not
so altered that private finance cannot be attracted.
The Treasury is said to have been talked down from its original 'optimistic'
estimates of the terms that would appeal to the private sector.
One of the main aspects to ministers' consideration of how to allocate
public spending on housing is its impact on the building industry. Officials
have been told to carry out extensive studies on the effect on the
construction industry of money spent on renovation and on new building.
It is also likely that the fall in land prices will enable ministers to
claim that the Tories' election manifesto commitment to the Housing
Corporation, of Pounds 6bn over three years to build 153,000 homes, is being
met in terms of the number of units rather than the cash figure.
Whitehall departments have been hard-pressed to devise proposals to meet Mr
John Major's commitment to a package of measures to help the economy in time
for the Autumn Statement next week, and some officials say that some of the
more radical suggestions will have to be wait until next year.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Warning of end to Civil Service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BILL that would enable public-service departments to develop their own
strategies on pay, grading and general conditions could mean 'the end of a
national Civil Service', a Labour backbencher warned MPs in the Commons
yesterday.
Implementation of the proposed measure - the Civil Service (Management
Functions) Bill - would lead to the replacement of a national service by 'a
conglomeration of agencies' subject to different conditions, Mr John
Garrett, MP for Norwich South, maintained. He was responding to remarks made
by Mr William Waldegrave, the minister for public service.
Introducing the bill for its second Commons reading, Mr Waldegrave said it
was 'modest in scope' but would dismantle a number of barriers that
prevented civil servants from doing their jobs to the best of their ability.
The Civil Service needed new management structures geared to customers'
requirements rather than being driven by a Whitehall-based hierarchy.
It was 'more sensible to try to organise the delivery of services in ways
that have more devolved accountability and more clearly specified units of
management', he said.
For the Labour front bench, Ms Marjorie Mowlam said that the bill would
encourage managers to 'do something internally' in order to meet their
financial targets, implying that they would seek to cut their pay bill - the
'main financial part of their budget'.
The measure, which has already been passed by the Lords, would allow
delegation only to servants of the Crown and cannot be used to transfer
management functions to the private sector.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory rebels vow to carry on
campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S defeat was a bitter pill for the Tory rebels to swallow. But
there is plenty of fight left in their camp.
Their intention is clearly to battle through the remaining stages of the
Maastricht Bill with all the strength and guile they can muster. 'There
certainly will be the use of every tactic that is appropriate,' one of the
rebel leaders said yesterday.
The rebels will find it difficult to derail the treaty's progress towards
ratification - their ideal objective. But they may well delay it
significantly, which for them is the next best thing.
To force the one change in the treaty's text that could prove fatal,
arithmetic suggests they would need to find common ground with Labour in
voting for an amendment to the implementing bill.
This will not be easy. Mr Michael Spicer, one of the rebel leaders, said
yesterday: 'We have got nothing in common with Labour generally. There is no
way we would co-operate on the sorts of things they want.'
To delay the bill's passage, however, they would merely have to help ensure
that the government did not obtain a guillotine or a series of closure
motions restricting the time for debate.
Although the bill itself stretches to just three clauses and less than one
side of an A4 sheet of paper, Tory rebels and other MPs have already tabled
sufficient amendments and suggested new clauses to fill a densely packed
65-page document. To debate all these proposals in full could take years.
The indication yesterday that the government was prepared to delay the
bill's third reading until after a second Danish referendum suggests,
however, that the government would like to see the committee stage finished
by May.
Such a deadline might trigger an old-fashioned war of attrition, involving a
long sequence of late-night sittings with MPs on call at virtually any hour
in case a division was called.
In this situation, the rebels would probably dig in their heels and seek to
delay the government for as long as possible.
As they did so, they would be encouraged by the hope that the Danes might
achieve their most cherished objective for them by rejecting the treaty for
a second time.
This would, of course, enable them to claim victory and to argue that the
government was wrong to waste valuable Commons time debating a document that
was destined not to be ratified.
In terms of finding common ground with Labour in a bid to force changes to
the bill at the committee stage, rebels suggest that the best bet could be
an amendment urging the government to hold a British referendum.
This could attract support from a significantly larger number of Tories than
those who opposed the government on Wednesday night. It would also be backed
by a sizeable contingent of Labour anti-Maastrichteers. However, it is
unlikely to be backed by the Labour leadership.
Even winning the battle to have an amendment carried would not amount to a
decisive victory in the campaign. The government could succeed in reversing
the change at the bill's report stage.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Clinton team gets to grips with tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONGRESSIONAL staff are already getting down to work on new tax measures to
head the agenda facing the new Congress, which will convene next year.
Economic advisers to Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic president-elect,
have indicated they hope to have a job creation package ready to present to
Congress soon after his inauguration on January 20.
But on Wednesday President George Bush, in his final tussle with the
outgoing Congress, vetoed a Dollars 27bn (Pounds 17.4bn) tax bill passed in
October. Aides said yesterday the veto would probably speed the process of
introducing tax legislation in the new Congress.
The vetoed tax bill grew out of an urban aid package proposed in the wake of
riots that broke out in Los Angeles at the end of April and included many
measures sought by Mr Bush - among them the creation of a number of
enterprise zones and the repeal of a controversial luxury tax on boats.
But the Democratic majority in Congress added other measures that the
president disagreed with, and which would have broken his renewed pledge not
to raise taxes. They delayed sending the bill to the president to give him
the opportunity to sign it after the pressure of the election was over. He
passed up this opportunity, signing a veto message on the flight back to
Washington the day after the election.
Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, who as chairman of the House ways and means
committee holds the keys to all US tax legislation, says the initiative now
lies with Mr Clinton. 'He's going to have to call the tune. I'll tell him to
be bold,' the veteran Illinois congressman said.
High on Mr Clinton's list of priorities is a targeted investment tax credit.
Influential members of Congress are likely to want to revive several of the
measures
included in the vetoed tax bill. The repeal of the luxury boat tax, for
example, is close to the heart of Senate majority leader George Mitchell,
whose home state of Maine harbours a significant boat-building industry.
Another measure, to expand the tax-sheltered Individual Retirement Accounts,
has been championed by Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, who chairs the Senate
finance committee.
Once a tax bill is on the road, congressional tax experts say, members will
use it as a vehicle to which they can attach any number of additional
measures, including legislation targeting taxes paid by foreign companies in
the US.
The issue is a contentious one, and the Internal Revenue Service is still
waiting to see what the yield will be of new legislation passed in 1989 and
1990, which imposed stiffer record-keeping and reporting requirements on
foreign companies.
Multinational groups can shift the balance of their profits between
countries by charging higher or lower transfer prices for goods and services
exchanged within the group. International rules dictate that transfer prices
should be established on the 'arm's length' principle, as if the goods or
services were sold to an unrelated company. For intangibles, however, an
arm's length price can be difficult to establish.
A number of congressmen, led by Democrat Jake Pickle of Texas and Republican
Duncan Hunter of California, claim widespread abuse of transfer pricing
rules has allowed foreign companies to shift billions of dollars of profits
abroad, so escaping US taxation.
Much of the criticism is based on 1986, when foreign companies in aggregate
reported a net loss of Dollars 1.5bn, although those companies that did
report profits paid aggregate taxes of Dollars 3bn.
In 1988, the latest year for which full statistics are available, foreign
company profits amounted to only 1.4 per cent of sales, compared with an
average 3.7 per cent of sales for US companies. But the General Accounting
Office, an investigative arm of Congress, concluded this discrepancy 'did
not prove the existence of a widespread problem'.
Already, the US's efforts to squeeze more taxes out of for-
eign companies have run into international criticism. Earlier this year the
Treasury had to withdraw a set of proposed regulations relating to Section
482 of the Internal Revenue Code, which governs transfer pricing.
The fiscal affairs committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD), the Paris-based grouping of 24 industrial nations,
said in a letter to Mr Nicholas Brady, Treasury secretary, that the proposed
regulations 'would seriously disrupt existing international taxation
arrangements, with adverse effects on the economic relations between member
countries'.
However, Mr Clinton's economic programme assumes that it will be possible,
just from tougher enforcement of existing rules, to raise an additional
Dollars 9bn from foreign corporations in 1993, rising to Dollars 13.5bn in
1996 - a total of Dollars 45bn over four years.
Realistic estimates of the available extra revenue range from Dollars 166m
to Dollars 1bn a year. The more extreme estimates are, for the most part,
more illustrative calculations based on the arbitrary assumption that
foreign corporations' profits ought to match the return on Treasury bonds.
A rigorous clampdown on transfer pricing is likely to raise more money from
US-based multinationals' arrangements with their overseas subsidiaries than
from foreign companies operating in the US. Only about 13 per cent of the
money involved in pending Section 482 cases involves foreign companies.
Political realities suggest some foreign taxation measure will be added to
any new tax bill.
Tax lawyers working with foreign companies in Washington appear confident
that the more extreme proposals will not come to pass. These include an idea
floated in a discussion bill issued by Mr Rostenkowski this summer, which
would tax foreign companies on the assumption that their earnings equalled
at least three quarters of the average profitability of US businesses in the
same sector.
'I do believe in the end the ways and means committee will recognise that
there is simply not Dollars 45bn out there,' one Washington lawyer
concluded.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Top Treasury official quits for First Boston
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR David Mulford, US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs, is
to join the CS First Boston group next week, the US Treasury announced
yesterday.
Mr Mulford, the longest-serving senior US Treasury official responsible for
international economic policy since the second world war, is one of the
first members of the Republican administration to announce his departure
following Democratic Governor Bill Clinton's victory in the presidential
election.
His move, to become vice-chairman of First Boston in New York and deputy
chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston in London, represents a return to the
world of investment banking for Mr Mulford, 55, after 8 1/2 years at the US
Treasury.
He will be a member of First Boston's operating committee in New York with
special responsibility for Latin America. Mr Mulford was closely involved
with the region during his time at the US Treasury, helping to develop and
implement the Baker and Brady plans for easing the Latin American debt
crisis and playing a large role in producing President George Bush's
Enterprise for the Americas initiative.
He served at the Treasury first as assistant secretary for international
affairs and from May 1989 as under-secretary. His departure comes as no
surprise - he is known to have been considering various job offers for
several months.
Since entering the Treasury in March 1984 he has been the Group of Seven
deputy responsible for co-ordinating economic policies with other members of
the bloc of leading industrial nations. He helped develop the 1985 Plaza
Accord to curb the dollar's strength and since 1986 has been the one of the
US team preparing the annual world economic summit as 'financial sherpa'.
He chaired negotiations with Japan to open and liberalise Japanese capital
markets and has played a prominent role for the US in international
discussions on assistance for Russia.
As a tough and sometimes brutal negotiator, Mr Mulford has earned respect
rather than affection in his dealings with officials from other countries.
The policies he has espoused have sometimes been controversial. Some
economists criticised the Brady initiative for having deterred banks from
lending new money to the debtor nations. Mr Mulford believes the Brady
initiative was one of the great successes of US economic diplomacy in the
late 1980s and played an essential part in bringing Latin American nations
back into the mainstream of the world economy.
Mr Mulford and Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury secretary after whom the
plan was named, were quicker than European policy makers to warn that the
world economy was slowing down at the end of the 1980s.
Mr Mulford has always pursued an international career. He spent 20 years in
international investment banking before moving to the Treasury.
After leaving the Treasury he will keep in touch with public affairs through
the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, where he
will be a special adviser.

US aviation authorities will make a decision before Christmas on whether to
let British Airways acquire a Dollars 750m (Pounds 483.8m) stake in USAir,
the sixth-largest US carrier.
Mr Andrew Card, US transportation secretary, said yesterday the
decision-making process would be an open one. He has instigated a formal
'comment' period, which allows interested parties to submit their views by
November 27. Comments in response would then be due by December 11 and Mr
Card's ruling would be made by December 24.
The department has already received considerable correspondence on the issue
 -not least from the 'Big Three' US airlines, which oppose the deal. The
correspondence will be placed on public file, and the department has ordered
both British Airways and USAir to do the same with information they have
already provided to it.
The department said the deal 'would result in changes in USAir's operations,
financial structure and management', and raised the question of whether the
airline would 'continue to operate under the control of US citizens'.

FT  06 NOV 92 / New US tax legislation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Attempts by the US to introduce new tax legislation affecting foreign
corporations could lead to tit-for-tat retaliation from other countries.
An obvious candidate in the UK would be for the Inland Revenue to withhold
the refund to US-owned companies on advance corporation tax (ACT) levied on
the dividends paid to shareholders.
A precedent for retaliation does exist. Legislation was introduced in 1985
in the UK in response to unitary tax laws in California and can be triggered
at any time if a current appeal on its applicability to UK companies is
lost.
However, the Revenue sees no way that this could be used in response to Mr
Clinton's proposals.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Foreigners keep their cool on US tax threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US President-elect Bill Clinton's promise to crack down on the tax practices
of foreign companies has so far failed to cause much consternation in
corporate boardrooms overseas.
Most are waiting to see how far campaign threats will translate into
realities once the new president settles into negotiations and sees the
difficulties of implementation.
Mr Michael Garner, finance director of TI, the UK-headquartered engineering
group, said: 'Without sounding too cavalier, we have seen these things come
and go before. If the proposals get too Draconian, sanity usually prevails.'
The threat to TI from new transfer-pricing rules would not be significant,
because the company manufactured in the US rather than importing goods for
the US market.
However, Mr Nick Cunningham, an analyst with Societe Generale Strauss
Turnbull, the securities house, said: 'At the very best, the US Internal
Revenue Service is going to get tougher.
At worst, they will introduce arbitary unitary taxation under which foreign
companies would be hammered.'
Mr Cunningham has made tentative calculations for seven UK companies with
substantial US operations which show that all but one are paying below full
US corporate tax, and would have reported earnings per share more than 20
per cent lower if they were subject to unitary tax.
One of the principal mechanisms companies were likely to lose was the
ability to use 'debt arbitrage,' he said. This involves taking out
borrowings in the US which are deductible against US tax, and investing them
at higher interest rates in the UK, where the taxable interest can be offset
against advance corporation tax payable on dividends.
Tax experts yesterday were busy providing advice on strategies which
companies should adopt in response to the election of Mr Clinton.
Mr Bruce Lassman, head of the US tax desk at Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy
firm, stressed a number of actions which would save tax.
Transfer pricing: Companies should examine transfer pricing methods and
gather documentary support to help justify the system in future negotiations
with the IRS.
Foreign investors' capital gains tax: sales of US subsidiaries now would
protect them from possible future capital gains taxes.
'Earnings strippings': pre-paying rents, royalties, management charges and
other payments should protect companies from future legislation which limits
'excessive' tax relief on payments paid to foreign companies.
Lobbying expenses: lobbying may be disallowed for tax deductions, so
companies should lobby against the legislation and enter binding lobbying
contracts before any change.
Worker training: pre-paying salaries and bonuses before any changes, such as
Mr Clinton's proposal requiring all employers to contribute 1.5 per cent of
payroll to worker retraining, is recommended.
Investment tax credit: delaying capital expenditure to take advantage of a
Clinton-proposed 10 per cent credit on new capital investment.

US aviation authorities will make a decision before Christmas on whether to
let British Airways acquire a large minority stake in USAir, the
sixth-largest US carrier.
Mr Andrew Card, US transportation secretary, said yesterday the
decision-making process would be an open one. He has instigated a formal
'comment' period, which allows interested parties to submit their views by
November 27. Comments in response would then be due by December 11 and Mr
Card's ruling would be made by December 24.
The department has already received considerable correspondence on the issue
 -not least from the 'Big Three' US airlines, which oppose the deal. The
correspondence will be placed on public file, and the department has ordered
both British Airways and USAir to do the same with information they have
already provided to it.
The department said the deal 'would result in changes in USAir's operations,
financial structure and management', and raised the question of whether the
airline would 'continue to operate under the control of US citizens'.
The final decision will be made by Mr Card, despite the impending change in
presidential administrations. During the election campaign President George
Bush and Governor Bill Clinton voiced differing views on the deal, which
involves a Dollars 750m (Pounds 483.8m) British Airways investment in USAir.
The president was carefully non-committal about the transaction's overall
merits, although he had previously favoured more foreign investment in US
airlines. But Mr Clinton said during a TV chat show that he had 'real
problems with it'.
'We get no access to the British market if we do it,' he said but, in
response to a further question, replied that he would not 'sign off' on the
deal.

<TEXT>
CHINA yesterday congratulated Governor Bill Clinton on winning the US
presidency, while Vietnam expressed the hope that he would continue the
normalisation of relations between Washington and Hanoi.
The world's two largest remaining communist nations have reason to be
concerned about Mr Clinton's election, chiefly because of his promise to
take a tougher line on human rights abuses.
His election platform linked maintenance of China's most-favoured nation
(MFN) status for trade to improvements in human rights. Vietnam may fear
that, after progress made with President George Bush towards ending a US
embargo on business with Hanoi, the sensitive issue may be given a lower
priority in Washington.
China's President Yang Shangkun, Vice-President Wang Zhen and Premier Li
Peng each sent messages of congratulations to Mr Clinton yesterday.
Wu Jianmin, Foreign Ministry spokesman, said: 'The Chinese government always
attaches importance to Sino-US relations and is ready to work with the new
US administration for improvement and development of bilateral relations.'
Though he acknowledged that China and the US did not agree on human rights,
he said: 'We can exchange views, enhance mutual understanding and seek
common ground while setting aside differences.'
However, Wu added that attaching conditions to MFN status was 'unacceptable
to China'. Mr Bush, following a policy of constructive engagement, has
maintained China's MFN status, though relations deteriorated when he
sanctioned the sale of US fighter aircraft to Taiwan.
In Hanoi, Mr Phan Van Khai, deputy prime minister, said he believed Mr
Clinton would continue US co-operation with Vietnam on the accounting for
missing servicemen.
Mr Khai said: 'We believe he will also proceed with the normalisation
process with Vietnam, proceeding from the common interest of the two peoples
in this regard and for the sake of peace, stability and co-operation in the
region as well as the whole world.'

FT  06 NOV 92 / Policy talks continue in Little Rock: Yeltsin urges early
summit and more N-weapon cuts
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT-elect Bill Clinton continued yesterday to prepare himself for his
new administration in a series of meetings in Little Rock with senior
advisers, writes Jurek Martin, US Editor, in Washington. Talks focused on
Cabinet and other appointments and on the economic proposals he is expected
to unveil early in his first term,
Mr Clinton spoke by telephone to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who
suggested an early summit, British Prime Minister John Major, and Mr Nelson
Mandela of South Africa. In a separate message the Russian leader proposed
further nuclear weapon cuts.
There was no word when Mr Clinton's appointments would be announced. If
history is any guide they may emerge piecemeal and only after he has
interviewed leading candidates. The first announcement is likely to be over
the composition of the transition team, providing clues as to who might get
top Washington jobs.
A small team has been set up but it will be succeeded by a larger group
that, in effect, operates for 10 weeks as a government-in-waiting.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the campaign chairman, is considered a front-runner for
the job as transition director. Other candidates are Mr Eli Segal, campaign
director of administration, Mr Warren Christopher, former deputy secretary
of state under President Carter, Mr Vernon Jordan, the civil rights
activists and former head of the Urban League, and Ms Madeline Kunin, once
governor of Vermont.
The last three formed the 'search committee' which eventually recommended
that Mr Clinton chose Senator Al Gore as his running mate.
Of all the appointments he may make, none will be more significant in the
long term than those to the Supreme Court. Federal judges serve for life,
and it is probable that vacancies on the highest court will occur during his
term. Only one justice on the current court was a Democratic nominee - Mr
Byron F. White, named by President John Kennedy in 1962.
Justice White, now 75 and progressively more conservative in his rulings,
may want to step aside. So may Justice Harry Blackmun, who is 83 and is
probably the most liberal member of the court. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,
a Reagan appointment but an important swing vote between liberals and
conservatives, has not been in the best of health.
Justice Blackmun, who wrote in 1973 the Roe vs Wade ruling guaranteeing the
right to abortion, is believed to have resisted retirement for some time
because of his fear that he would be replaced by a Republican-appointed
justice committed to overturning the landmark ruling.
Mr Clinton's only pronouncements on his criteria for the Supreme Court were
that he would prefer justices who believed in a woman's right to
reproductive choice and that he thought Governor Mario Cuomo of New York had
the sort of intellect that belonged on the court. But those who follow Mr
Cuomo closely are convinced he would hate the thought of leaving New York.
Mr Clinton may want to appoint a justice from one of the minorities. The
'black' seat on the court has moved sharply to the right with Justice
Thurgood Marshall's retirement and the accession of Justice Clarence Thomas.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Spur for Mideast peace negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARAB and Israeli negotiators will resume delicately poised peace talks on
Monday with an eye on president-elect Bill Clinton.
The talks were painstakingly brokered a year ago by the Bush administration,
which has nurtured them since. Both sides were pleased when Mr Clinton
voiced his support on Wednesday for efforts by President George Bush to push
the peace process forward during the transition between administrations.
The latest round of bilateral talks will be the eighth between Israel and
Syria, the Palestinians, Jordan and Lebanon. There is some expectation that
Mr Bush and Mr James Baker, his chief of staff and architect of the talks,
will push hard to cap their administration with a breakthrough in one of the
world's most persistent conflicts.
They may find the Arab side willing to help; Arab leaders have been worried
by pro-Israeli sentiments expressed both by Mr Clinton and Senator Al Gore,
vice-president-elect.
In a speech to American Jewish leaders in September, prominently reprinted
in the Jerusalem Post yesterday, Mr Clinton said: 'I do not believe we ought
to pressure Israel into making unilateral concessions in the peace process,
as this administration has tried to do.' He said it was time for Arab
concessions instead.
Mr Clinton also criticised President Hafez al-Assad of Syria in an interview
published this week, calling his regime a tyranny. Mr Farouk al-Shara, the
Syrian foreign minister, retorted: 'Clinton cannot be an honest mediator and
be biased towards Israel.'
Israel and Jordan are already on the verge of agreeing a joint statement
which would serve as a blueprint for a final peace between them. The
Palestinians and Israel appear to be edging towards an interim agreement on
Palestinian self-government in the occupied territories.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, who never shared the animosity
for Mr Bush felt by Mr Yitzhak Shamir, his predecessor, would be happy to
achieve early progress, especially with the Palestinians. When he was
elected in June he promised an interim deal on the West Bank and Gaza within
nine months.
Talks between Syria and Israel present a more difficult problem. President
Assad may judge it prudent before Mr Clinton is sworn in to office to agree
with Israel a joint 'statement of principles', over which it has been in
negotiations since September.
But both Israel and Syria are deeply suspicious of each others' motives.
This could delay progress, whoever is in the White House.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE best-known damage suit against the US cigarette industry, and the only
one to meet any success in the courts, has ended.
Lawyers at Philip Morris, the cigarette and food manufacturer, revealed
yesterday that Mr Marc Edell, lead lawyer for the plaintiffs in the suit
brought by long-time smoker Rose Cipollone and her family, had voluntarily
withdrawn from the case. The request to end the nine-year-old litigation was
made yesterday morning and an order was signed by the presiding judge.
Philip Morris was one of three cigarette manufacturers sued by Rose
Cipollone and then her family after she developed and subsequently died of
lung cancer.
Philip Morris declined to speculate on the reasons for the dismissal. Mr
Edell was not at his New Jersey office yesterday morning, and was
unavailable for comment.
In 1988, four years after Mrs Cipollone died, a Newark-based jury awarded
her husband Dollars 400,000 (Pounds 258,000) on the grounds that the Liggett
tobacco company, another defendant in the lawsuit, had misrepresented the
risks of smoking. This was the first and only verdict requiring a tobacco
company to compensate the family of a smoker who had died of cancer. Two
years later, however, it was overturned by a federal appeals court.
The case then progressed to the US Supreme Court, which earlier this year
deliberated over whether federally-mandated health warnings on cigarette
packets protected tobacco manufacturers from being sued under state
liability laws.
In a complex and splintered decision, released in June, the Supreme Court
ruled that some suits could be brought, where, for example, plaintiffs
alleged that cigarette manufacturers hid or distorted the health dangers of
tobacco. A new trial of the Cipollone v Liggett et al case was ordered.
Yesterday, Philip Morris shares rose strongly on the news, gaining Dollars 3
1/4 to Dollars 78 5/8 . Loews Corporation, which owns Lorillard, another
manufacturer involved in the Cipollone case, gained Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars
115 1/2.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Rawlings heads for surprise poll victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE, Africa Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLIGHT Lieutenant Jerry John Rawlings, Ghana's military leader, was last
night headed for a surprise victory in the country's first democratic
presidential elections in 13 years.
The outcome was challenged by opposition leaders, but government supporters
hailed it as a triumph for the 45-year-old former air force pilot over four
other candidates.
Semi-official figures announced on state-run radio from 198 of the 200
constituencies gave Flt Lt Rawlings 58.6 per cent of the vote.
If his lead is maintained in the last remaining constituencies, the
charismatic Flt Lt Rawlings will be elected president in a single round of
polling.
Opposition candidates said the voting should be annulled because of
widespread vote rigging. In the central Ghanaian city of Kumasi, an
opposition stronghold, a dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed after riots broke
out when results were released showing Flt Lt Rawlings in the lead.
An interim report by a 15-member Commonwealth observer group said the
elections were free and fair. But the process had 'not been without
incident', the report continued, citing 'admitted imperfections in the
voters' roll and the organisation and conduct of some polling stations'.
'Most of what we are hearing so far are problems of organisation and
training rather than deliberate mischief,' said Mr Richard Joseph, head of
an observer team sent by the Carter Centre of former US President Jimmy
Carter. 'The real instances of malfeasance are really just a handful.'
Flt Lt Rawlings' closest rival, Prof Albert Adu Boahen, had 30.2 per cent of
the poll and the three other candidates were trailing further behind.
Flt Lt Rawlings will have achieved a remarkable victory if he has succeeded
in converting an unpopular austerity reform programme, implemented under his
heavy- handed 11-year rule, into a winning electoral programme.
His supporters said that he had received widespread support from rural
peasants, who make up more than 75 per cent of the population and who have
benefited from the reforms through much increased producer prices for
agriculture and cocoa and mass programmes of rural electrification.
Parliamentary elections are due to take place on December 8.

<TEXT>
A RUSSIAN trade delegation to Syria made little progress this week in
resolving the issue of Syria's Dollars 15bn (Pounds 9.6bn) military debt to
the former Soviet Union.
According to Russian diplomats, Syrian officials said other former Soviet
republics were also claiming repayment. The Russians said this was unlikely
in view of a CIS-wide agreement that former Soviet debt devolved to Russia.
A request for a meeting with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad was reportedly
denied. In these circumstances, it was being suggested that Russia is
unlikely to sell military equipment to Syria in the foreseeable future.
In a recent interview, Mr Mohamed al-Imadi, the Syrian minister of economy
and foreign trade, acknowledged that the debt to the former Soviet Union was
'a very delicate issue', and added: 'We are doing our best to build on the
friendship of the past to construct new economic relations with Russia. All
of these issues will be dealt with in time.'
The Russian delegation also went to Lebanon this week, where commercial
relations are flourishing. A joint Russian-Lebanese Middle East studies
centre is being set up in Beirut. And Lebanese businessmen who are well
established in Africa are purchasing former Soviet debt - in, for example,
Congo Brazzaville - at discounted rates.
A Russian diplomat said: 'We have no way of collecting debts in Africa. But
the Lebanese are on the spot and they can, for example, take African
mahogany in lieu of payment and sell it abroad.' Official Syrian figures
quoted in the Financial Times of November 5 said the country's gross
national product showed average recent annual growth of 24 per cent.
Authoritative western estimates put inflation-adjusted growth rather slower,
with real gross domestic product up between 5 and 8 per cent last year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BRITISH military exercise in Hong Kong, which would have included a mock
invasion by Chinese troops, has been postponed. The manoeuvre would have
been certain to cause a further rift in already sensitive Sino-British
relations.
The instructions to cancel the exercise came from the British Defence
Ministry but are believed to have originated from Governor Chris Patten.
Mr Patten is already enmeshed in a tense struggle over his political
blueprint for the colony in its last five years of British rule.
The military operation was a command post exercise, code named Operation
Winged Dragon.
Troops from Britain's rapid deployment force were to be flown in for the
exercise which had been in the planning stage for several months.
A military spokesman said 'it was felt that it wasn't the best time to hold
an exercise of this nature.' However, there are concerns within Hong Kong
that such an operation could ever have been considered appropriate.
Mr Ronald Arculli, a legislative councillor, warned that if the operation
were to proceed, the People's Liberation Army might set up its own exercise
on the other side of the border, which would be disastrous for local
confidence.
The military exercise has been postponed to an unspecified date, rather than
cancelled altogether, but it is likely to meet significant opposition from
members of the Legislative Council if the plans resurface.
Britain and China are already at loggerheads over the financing of the
proposed HKDollars 163bn (Pounds 13.7bn) Chek Lap Kok airport, and over Mr
Patten's push for further democratisation in Hong Kong before 1997.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Japan set to agree package of aid to Vietnam: A window of
opportunity for an expansion of trade and investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government is today expected to approve the resumption of
official aid to Vietnam, signalling to eager Japanese companies that the way
is clear for a rapid expansion of trade and investment.
In deference to US sensitivities, Japan has maintained a ban on official
economic links to Hanoi since 1979, and urged trading houses and industrial
companies to adopt a low profile in their bilateral dealings
Sensing that the US may soon lift its economic embargo and having secured
informal approval from the US State Department, the Japanese cabinet is
today scheduled to consider a loan package of Y45.5bn (Pounds 230m). The
loans may be announced later by Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister,
who is planning a trip to Vietnam in coming weeks.
About six Japanese banks including Bank of Tokyo, the country's main foreign
exchange bank, provided bridging finance of about Y23.5bn to the Vietnamese
government on Wednesday in what was apparently the first commercial bank
transaction between the two countries since 1975.
These funds will be used to cover Vietnam's arrears on Japanese loans from
the 1970s, paving the way for the government to announce the aid package.
Meanwhile, most leading banks are negotiating with Japan's Ministry of
Finance over the opening of representative offices in Vietnam. Sakura Bank,
the country's second largest bank by fund volume, sent a delegation of 21
officials to the country late last month.
Trade between the two countries has surged over the past year. Japan's
exports to Vietnam in the first nine months rose by 133 per cent over the
same period last year, while imports from Vietnam are 27.8 per cent higher.
The true level of exports is unclear, as Japanese goods have been
transferred through subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Bangkok to avoid
antagonising the US.
But the flurry of commercial activity has prompted words of caution from
some Foreign Ministry officials who fear the rush to Hanoi could become a
point of contention with Washington. These officials suggest that Vietnam
still has a poor human rights record, with dissidents and religious groups
routinely harassed.
There is concern that the Clinton presidency could both lift the embargo
against Vietnam and stress the importance of human rights, in a two-pronged
policy similar to that in place for China. Officials in Tokyo generally
agree that the incoming administration is likely to increase pressure on
China, which could increase friction between Tokyo and Washington.
After a successful China visit by Emperor Akihito last month, the Japanese
government hopes the wartime scars have healed and the two countries can
develop a more forward-looking relationship, a prospect relished in Beijing,
which senses, in the longer term, that Tokyo could be played off against
Washington.
But these geo-political concerns are not restraining Japanese companies,
which feel, for the first time in a decade, confident enough to express
publicly their enthusiasm for the economic potential offered by a reforming
Vietnam.
The Keidanren, the country's main business federation, said the 'countdown
has already begun' until the lifting of the US embargo, and 'everyone in
Japan' is pleased that Tokyo's official development assistance (ODA)
programme is on the verge of resumption.
'There is so much potential in Vietnam. The labour costs are low, and they
have very skilled workers with a good work ethic. There is oil and high
quality coal, and the country has excellent sea access,' a Keidanren
spokesman said.
Mr Toshihiko Sekimoto, general manager of Asian business planning at Itochu,
the leading trading house, said his company has had offices in Hanoi and Ho
Chi Minh City since last November researching potential investments.
'There needs to be improvement of the infrastructure, but we are very
interested in projects involving agriculture, marine products, and textiles.
The skill level of the workers is very high.'

<TEXT>
THE REPUTATION of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) was further
tarnished yesterday when Tokyo prosecutors alleged that senior party
officials offered a total of Y5bn (Pounds 25.3m) to an extreme right-wing
group to stop a public campaign against the party.
Prosecutors were presenting evidence to a Tokyo District Court trial of
executives at Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, the trucking company at the centre of an
illegal donation scandal, when they yesterday outlined alleged dealings
between seven LDP leaders and the far right group, Kominto.
Mr Shin Kanemaru, the godfather of Japanese politics, resigned last month
after admitting that he accepted a Y500m donation from Tokyo Sagawa. He was
also under suspicion, as are several other LDP politicians, of having
regular contact with a prominent gangster organisation.
However, the ruling party was shaken by the unexpected prosecutors'
statements yesterday, as they lengthened the list of senior officials who
attempted use gang links, money or personal contacts to silence Kominto,
which launched a noisy campaign against a former prime minister, Mr Noboru
Takeshita, in 1987.
There was further embarrassment when the prosecutors said Mr Kanemaru had
contacted executives at a leading Japanese commercial bank last year to ask
that it provide assistance to the financially troubled Tokyo Sagawa.
The prosecutors ensured that the LDP's largest faction, formerly run by Mr
Kanemaru, would remain in turmoil, as they alleged that Mr Keizo Obuchi, the
new faction head, had used 'agents' to persuade Kominto to end its campaign
against Mr Takeshita.
Mr Obuchi said he had no direct contact with Kominto, but four of the six
other politicians mentioned by the prosecutors conceded that they or their
representatives had arranged meetings with the group, well known for both
its use of violence and its underworld links.
The new allegations threaten to dominate the present sitting of the Japanese
parliament, which is supposed to give its approval to an emergency economic
package announced by the government in August.
Opposition parties have wanted Mr Takeshita to testify under oath about his
links to Tokyo Sagawa, but there may now be a move to force all seven
politicians listed yesterday to answer questions in parliament.
Naming the politicians was an apparent reaction by the prosecutors to strong
public criticism of their handling of the illegal donation case against Mr
Kanemaru, who was not questioned directly and did not face a court action,
in spite of admitting that he broke the Political Funds Control Law.

MR PIK BOTHA, South African foreign minister, said yesterday Mr Jonas
Savimbi, Angola's rebel Unita leader, was willing to seek peace in the
country, Reuter reports from Pretoria.
He told a news conference he had spoken to Mr Savimbi on Wednesday following
fighting between Unita forces and Angolan government troops that killed some
1,200. 'He indicated firmly and clearly his willingness, despite tremendous
emotional stress, to continue with the democratic process. . .and play a
constructive role,' Mr Botha said.
There was no immediate response from the government in Luanda, which South
Africa informed about the conversation. But Angolan diplomats in Lisbon said
government and Unita officials had held talks to end fighting in the towns
of Lobito and Benguela. The last pockets of fighting in the capital Luanda
appeared to have died down.
The European Community, meanwhile, said it would hold any party that blocked
the peace process responsible for its actions. A statement issued in London
called on all parties to abide by a ceasefire negotiated by the United
Nations on Monday.
The ex-Marxist MPLA won United Nations-supervised elections which Mr Savimbi
later denounced as a fraud.

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR Indian policy-maker said yesterday that economic reform was going
ahead 'at a gradual pace', rejecting any suggestion that the government's
programme was running out of steam.
Mr Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the economic affairs secretary and top economic
adviser to Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, said in an interview
that there was no other way of carrying out change in a large democracy such
as India.
He added that the government's economic policies had been given a stamp of
approval from an International Monetary Fund delegation, which last week
completed a far-reaching review of India's economy and reforms. The IMF
routinely carries out such reviews in countries that receive its support.
The IMF is lending India money under a standby programme designed to help
the country implement reforms to liberalise the economy after decades of
heavy state intervention and regulation.
India is also asking the IMF for an extended fund facility and an enhanced
structural adjustment facility. These are longer-term loan programmes, which
could start at the beginning of the 1993-1994 financial year next April and
run for three years or more.
The terms of these loans have yet to be settled. However, finance ministry
officials believe that the Indian government and the IMF have broadly
similar views of the likely economic targets.
Mr Ahluwalia said that the next substantial announcements about the future
economic reform programme would be contained in the budget for next year,
which will be published in mid-February.
The Indian economy has endured a sharp slowdown in growth since the reforms
were introduced as the government has sought to bring inflation and
difficulties with the balance of payments under control. Mr Ahluwalia
predicted that signs of a strong recovery would emerge in the next few
months, followed by more robust growth in the 1993-1994 financial year.
By the mid-1990s the economy could be expanding at a rate of 6.5 per cent a
year, compared with a likely 3.5 to 4 per cent in the current year.

following Austria's lead, the Asean countries (Indonesia, Malaysia,
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand) raised the issue at this week's meeting
of the governing council of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt). Canada and a number of developing country timber exporters spoke in
Asean's support.
Asean claims that the Austrian action is contrary to Gatt rules, because it
discriminates against tropical timber and will have the effect of inhibiting
trade.
Austria is the first country to introduce a mandatory tropical timber
labelling scheme, which came into force in September. The labels indicate
whether a product contains tropical timber. The law also envisages a quality
mark for timber and timber products from sustainably managed forests.
The case is the latest in a growing number of disputes over the legitimacy
of trade measures to promote environmental objectives. Gatt rules in this
area are ambiguous, though a Gatt dispute panel judgment last year (against
a US ban on tuna imports from countries whose fishing fleets killed too many
dolphins) said countries could not unilaterally impose environmental
standards on others.
Noting that Austria is itself an important timber producer and exporter,
Asean argues the labelling scheme helps domestic producers by encouraging
consumers to switch from products made of tropical woods to those using
temperate timber.
Austria's Gatt representative yesterday denied that the new regulations were
protectionist, and said they arose solely out of concern to promote the
sustainable management of tropical forests. Asean claims that, by depressing
demand for tropical timber and thus its value, labelling will tend to
increase rather than reduce the pace of forest destruction.
Other countries, including the Netherlands, are considering mandatory
labelling schemes for tropical timber.

sanctions

ALL THE formulas concocted, plans rejected, trips taken and words spoken
since the EC and US began battling over oilseeds subsidies in the 1980s have
been to no avail.
In pushing hard and insistently for an EC reduction of its massive
subsidies, the US has now backed itself into a corner with no other route to
take than its unilateral 'withdrawal of concessions' - otherwise known as
sanctions - on Dollars 300m (Pounds 194m) worth of EC white wines, rapeseed
oil and wheat gluten.
Many officials believe that with no other course to follow provoking a real
crisis may be the only way of forcing deeply divided EC countries to work
together to offer a satisfactory compromise.
'We regret that we were forced to take this action,' said Mrs Carla Hills,
the US trade representative. 'For five years the EC has refused to provide
the US what it is clearly owed under international trading rules. The
credibility and effectiveness of the Gatt are at stake here.'
The course the US is following is difficult for the legalistic Mrs Hills.
Since the Uruguay Round got under way, US trade officials have committed
themselves to act under multilateral rules, wherever they apply in trade
disputes, and to work to improve the Gatt dispute settlement process.
The US has acted unilaterally against China - which is not a member of the
Gatt - and on intellectual property rights, which is not covered by trade
rules. But wherever possible, it has sought to negotiate; in fact Mrs Hills
has yet to go beyond the threat of imposing trade sanctions.
In Mrs Hills view, the US has played by the rules, won two panel decisions,
delayed for compensation talks, twice tried to fix a level of damages
through arbitration and been blocked by the EC. And it has embarked on an
exhaustive set of negotiations to find a solution within the proposed
Uruguay Round reform of agriculture trade.
On Wednesday the US asked the Gatt council for authorisation to withdraw
tariff concessions given earlier, in essence asking for permission to impose
sanctions. The EC blocked the request. This left the US without clear rules
to follow. To delay action further, would expose the Gatt as a toothless
tiger and a useless court of final appeals.
All hope of agreement ended, in fact, because of a lack of trust. The US
could not believe in proposed EC formulas for limiting oilseeds production.
With so many economic problems of its own the US felt it could not accept a
fudged accord which did not produce the expected results.
The action came two days after the election, leaving Mrs Hills less than
three months in office. She did not approach President-elect Bill Clinton or
anyone on his staff because, as she explained yesterday, no one had yet been
appointed whom she could consult.

FT  06 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Hit-list smaller than wine industry feared

<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S US trade measures against European exports, targeting white
wine, corn gluten and rapeseed oil, will enrage the French government, but
were less widespread than the French wine and spirits industry had feared.
The threat of 200 per cent tariffs is more punishing than expected, but
after targeting Dollars 300m (Pounds 194m) of EC farm exports from an
initial hit-list of Dollars 2bn, many of those preparing against sanctions
will live to export to the US another day. French cheese-makers are unhurt,
as are producers of Cognac and other liqueurs. French mineral water exports,
epitomised by Perrier, are untouched, as are Germany's small sugar
confectioners and apple juice makers.
France exported a mere FFr470m (Pounds 56m) of still white wine to the US
last year. Within that, the main wines were white Burgundies, worth FFr291m,
followed by white Bordeaux, worth FFr120m, then cheap white vin de pays
worth FFr33m.
The damage will be spread around hundreds of small to medium producers and
wine merchants when export sales are suffering in their main markets. French
wine exports of all types fell by 7.5 per cent in volume in the first half
of this year, but rose 4.7 per cent to FFr13.1bn in value, because of
currency gains and higher prices.
The impact will be limited considering the US is only France's fourth export
market for wine, after Britain, Germany and Belgium plus Luxembourg. Last
year, the US bought only FFr2.5bn worth of French wine and champagne, a
little more than Switzerland, with FFr1.8bn. Producers feared spirits would
be hit, and cognac producers, including the giant LVMH, proprietor of
Hennessy, stepped up exports to the US over the summer. 'We have already
shipped our entire Christmas stocks of cognac for the US,' an LVMH official
said.
Nor do the duties hit the champagne industry, which had FFr958m of US sales
last year, so Mr Bill Clinton can toast his victory at a reasonable price.
'We are not completely heartless,' a US embassy official said.
As for Germany, the US administration has chosen in white wine the one
agricultural product closest to the Chancellor's heart, and to that of his
political constituency in the Rhineland Palatinate.
German farm exports are insignificant; the political pressure comes from
small farmers who are not serious exporters. Rapeseed is grown mainly in
northern Germany, where big farmers have never had great political
influence. A key German concern has been that if French exports were blocked
access to markets outside the EC, they would be redirected to the German
home market, undercutting small German farmers.

AS FAR as Gatt's formal disputes machinery is concerned, the US-EC oilseeds
dispute has gone as far as it can. Gatt officials acknowledged yesterday
that nothing more could be done within the Gatt framework if the two
partners were not able or prepared to reach a negotiated agreement.
Strictly, in imposing trade sanctions without Gatt authorisation, the US is
violating Gatt procedures which require such decisions to be made by
consensus. The EC, which in effect vetoed that consensus, would be equally
in breach of the rules by retaliating.
However, the US undoubtedly has the better moral argument, since the cause
of its action remains the failure of the Community to comply with earlier
Gatt decisions.
Washington can reasonably claim to have 'gone the extra mile' to resolve the
five-year-old dispute within the multi-lateral system.
In 1989, a Gatt panel ruled that the EC's oilseed subsidy regime impaired
the benefits of duty-free access for oilseeds into the EC granted in a 1962
US-EC deal.
Earlier this year, the same panel ruled that the EC's new subsidy scheme,
changed in response to the first judgment, was no better. The EC refused to
amend the scheme again. Instead, it took the second option proposed by the
panel, offering compensation by way of trade concessions on other items.
These offers proved unacceptable to the US and other oilseeds producers.
In September, the US proposed binding arbitration on the amount of trade
damages involved, put by Washington at Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.03bn) and by
the EC at no more than Dollars 400m. This procedure, unprecedented in Gatt,
was refused by the EC. Subsequent bilateral negotiations on the issue
finally broke down in Chicago earlier this week.
Gatt officials admit the organisation's disputes procedures have been
stretched to the limit in this case, but point out that sanctions do not
solve the problem either.

FT  06 NOV 92 / World Trade News: US and French farm lobbies deprive world
of Gatt deal - A chance slipped away because governments 'haven't got the
guts to face them down,' one negotiator says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GATT deal has slipped through the world's fingers because of the power of
the US and French farm lobbies, and because, as one senior EC negotiator put
it, governments 'haven't got the guts - that's the word, guts - to face them
down.'
On the evenings of October 12 and November 3, EC negotiators say the US was
ready to settle both on the farm chapter of the Uruguay Round and on the
linked dispute over EC oilseeds production.
On the first occasion, they say, Mr Ed Madigan, the US agriculture
sec-retary, took a phone call from Mr Dean Kleckner, head of the US Farm
Bureau, the main lobby group, after which he said a deal was not possible
then.
On November 3, Mr Madigan broke off the Chicago talks to vote in the US
presidential election. The throngs of lobbyists in the hotel where the talks
were held had been complaining they had been unable to reach Mr Madigan
during the previous two days.
EC negotiators assume they did during the agriculture secretary's unusually
long voting break, after which the US went several steps backwards on the
draft oilseeds compromise - a factor in the collapse of the talks.
France, too, as Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, French agriculture secretary,
confirmed yesterday in parliament, had been trying to put pressure on Mr Ray
MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, in Chicago. Once it became clear in
Paris how close to a deal the two sides had been on October 12, Mr Soisson
was mandated to block agreement, Commission officials close to the French
government say.
France ignored the Commission's argument that Paris had signed up to greater
cuts under CAP reform than the EC would suffer under a Gatt deal.
Nonetheless, one highly-placed Commission official says that when Mr Soisson
was shown the CAP figures in Brussels, he said if he had known that was the
position, he would have refused the job.
'It is clear that France never really intended to comply with CAP reform,'
the official said.
After a long silence on Gatt, Mr Jacques Delors, Commission President, then
pitched in to the controversy, saying 'the adolescent Community should be
able to say 'no' to its big brother (the US), provided it has a sound
argument to do so.'
Mr Delors dismissed as 'pure slander', suggestions that he was motivated by
French presidential ambitions; his aides say he feared serious unrest in
France and felt the EC was being railroaded as part of the re-elect Bush
effort.
Mr MacSharry, nevertheless, let it be known that he regarded Mr Delors'
periodic interventions as little short of sabotage. He also built an
alliance in the 16-strong Commission to defeat Mr Delors.
Senior EC officials confirm Mr Soisson's claim that Mr Delors phoned Mr
MacSharry in Chicago to express his opposition to the deal then taking
shape.
The Commission president is also understood to have said that two member
states would veto such a package - invoking overwhelming national interest -
and that he would oppose Mr MacSharry inside the Commission. The farm
commissioner pressed on anyway, but, as one senior official said angrily,
the intervention from Brussels 'didn't help our credibility.'
In the event, Mr MacSharry was left at the altar by Mr Madigan, and the
Commission had no Gatt package to vote on. But on his return, Mr MacSharry
appears to be trying to put Mr Delors on the spot.
He is understood to have written to the Commission president handing over to
him his Gatt negotiating responsibilities, although Mr Delors' spokesman
said yesterday: 'This does not correspond to reality.'
The irony in the French position is that without a Uruguay Round agreement
which would protect the reformed CAP, France's and the EC's cereals and beef
exports will be at the mercy of a series of subsidy complaints being
prepared for Gatt by Australia, New Zealand and Argentina, quite aside from
the effect of US sanctions. That, of course, is if the world's main traders
continue to play by Gatt rules - an assumption which may prove optimistic.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Schlesinger doubt on Eurobankers

<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank president yesterday expressed doubt whether European
countries will be able to provide genuinely independent people to sit on the
council of the planned European Central Bank.
In a speech in Amsterdam highlighting the German central bank's scepticism
about the path to monetary union in Europe, Mr Helmut Schlesinger warned
that central bankers sometimes had to operate without government or public
support if they were to hold to their central goal of curbing inflation.
Worries about the domestic impact of the new bank's policies might stop
suitably qualified central bankers from joining the institution, he said.
He explicitly rejected President Mr Francois Mitterrand's recent comments
that the future European central bankers would be monetary technicians,
answering to EC governments. The Maastricht treaty, which guarantees the
independence of the new institution, had to be implemented 'to the letter',
he said.
New orders for west Germany's manufacturing industry fell by 0.5 per cent in
September from August, the seventh successive monthly decline, Quentin Peel
writes from Bonn.
The drop was entirely accounted for by a 2 per cent fall in export orders,
according to the Economics Ministry. Orders from the home market increased
by 0.5 per cent.
A comparison of the combined total of August and September with the same two
months of 1991 shows an overall drop of 4.7 per cent. Within that total,
export orders were down 6.7 per cent, and domestic orders by just 3.8 per
cent.
Over the year, capital goods orders were down 6.9 per cent.
Germany enjoyed a trade surplus in September of DM5.6bn, with exports of
DM55.6bn against imports of DM50bn. The overall balance of payments was in
deficit to the tune of DM4.2bn.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Markets sense early realignment in ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was growing speculation in financial markets yesterday that another
realignment of the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) will take place
before the end of the year, following a number of statements from European
governments.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, Spain's finance minister, told the New York Times that a
further realignment in the ERM would probably be needed before the end of
the year to restore stability to the system. 'We are absolutely open to all
changes of parities,' he said.
A spokeswoman at the Spanish Finance Ministry said yesterday that Mr
Solchaga's comments dated back to an interview given last month and that the
arguments for a realignment were now much less clear.
However, speculation was boosted later in the day by Ireland's announcement
that it will be lifting all its remaining exchange controls by the end of
this year.
Mr Bertie Ahern, Ireland's finance minister, said: 'We are committed, under
existing European Community agreements, to remove all our remaining exchange
controls by the end of this year. We will of course fully comply with this
obligation.'
Analysts said that the abandonment of exchange controls could accompany a
devaluation of the Irish punt. The currency is one of the weaker ERM
members, but its position in the system would be stabilised by a
devaluation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY yesterday added a further glimmer to hopes of saving the four-nation
European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) project following signs of a slight shift in
German attitudes earlier this week.
Speaking at the 70th anniversary of the country's air academy, Mr Salvo
Ando, defence minister, said he hoped the EFA partners - Britain, Germany,
Italy and Spain - could reach a 'useful conclusion' by mid-December. Plans
for the EFA were dealt a heavy blow in July when Germany, struggling to
contain government spending, announced it was pulling out of the fighter's
production phase. It wanted a cheaper aircraft reflecting changed defence
needs following the end of the cold war.
Mr Ando's comments are an attempt to help bridge the gap between British
wishes to push ahead with the EFA and Bonn's inclination to pull out.
'Given the fact that the willingness exists among the four partners to meet
each other half way on their problems, a positive conclusion must be within
reach,' he said.
Choosing his words carefully, the minister stressed that any project would
have to reflect the need for lower costs. It would also have to take into
account the changed circumstances of European air defence.
The implication is that Italy, which badly needs to replace its ageing
US-designed F104 fighters, favours the cheaper, lighter aircraft wanted by
the Germans. The Italians are also keen not to see the collaborative project
collapse owing to differences between the four partners.
Mr Ando emphasised that it would be a grave pity not to go ahead given the
large amount of money and time already put into the EFA project.
Italy has so far paid out L1,600bn (Pounds 780m) for the research and
development phases of the project. 'Our aim is not to waste the money
already invested. . . . at the same time, it is extremely important for our
country to get a modern and reliable fighter,' he said.
'Italy is making an effort to bring the EFA project into harbour, taking
into account with our partners the changed security outlook which must
inevitably be reflected in the characteristics of the fighter,' he said.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday denied he would reshuffle his cabinet as
demanded by Civic Union, a powerful conservative opposition group, although
he hinted that he was prepared to make a few changes to his economic reform
programme.
He said there were 'practically no big disagreements or changes' in policy
demands presented to him by Mr Arkady Volsky, the chief of Russia's
industrialists and a leading influence in the Civic Union opposition
movement. 'Maybe two or three or four clarifications, corrections are
possible. They will be taken into account in the government's programme.'
But Mr Yeltsin said he would not give in to Civic Union's demands for a
drastic overhaul of the cabinet. 'I told them they have an excessive
appetite. We will not make the changes they want.'
As a condition for supporting the president at a December session of the
Congress of People's Deputies, which wants to remove Mr Yeltsin's reformist
government, Mr Volsky wants changes to economic policy and a restructured
cabinet, in which Mr Yegor Gaidar would still figure, but no longer as prime
minister.
'They said they are in favour of keeping Gaidar but the number of deputy
prime ministers and ministers named by them (as people who should be removed
from office). . . practically destroys the Yeltsin-Gaidar team,' Mr Yeltsin
said.
Mr Yeltsin, however, did not deny that a few ministerial heads might roll.
He declined to say which names or aspects of economic policy been discussed
with Civic Union leaders on Tuesday. But a senior member of the Gaidar team,
Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister responsible for foreign economic
relations, said he could not serve in a cabinet which carried out the Civic
Union programme.
'There are some similarities in general terms between our programme and that
of the Civic Union - but in the detail, as for example when they talk of
freezing prices and reintroducing state orders (the elaborate old state
procurement system), they're absolutely different,' he told the Financial
Times.
He said leaders of the Civic Union had made clear to Mr Yeltsin they wanted
a number of senior jobs for themselves.
Ukrainian leaders yesterday played another card in their risky bid to win
financial compensation in exchange for giving up their nuclear weapons,
write Oleksandr Tkachenko and Chrystia Freeland.
'Ukraine cannot allow the nuclear weapons which are located on its territory
to be removed for free,' said Mr Ihor Yukhnovsky, the first deputy prime
minister.
While reiterating Ukraine's eventual commitment to becoming non-nuclear, he
insisted: 'Ukraine must be paid for its nuclear weapons.'
His comments are the latest move in Ukraine's campaign to receive a
political and economic pay-back in return for its historic pledge to
renounce nuclear weapons.

THE Swedish government yesterday promised unlimited financial assistance to
its crisis-stricken banking sector as a long-expected package of support
measures was finally unveiled.
'All obligations will be met, regardless of the final amount,' said Mr Bo
Lundgren, tax minister, although he indicated that tough conditions would be
attached to any assistance to minimise the cost to the state.
The support, generally in the form of loans and guarantees, will be
administered through a special authority. The government has made it clear
that the last thing it wants is for the state to end up owning the banks or
state-affiliated credit institutions which are covered by the scope of its
proposals.
The government will force the 'viable institutions' which request help to
repay any aid once when they recover their financial strength. However, in
cases involving reconstruction or winding-up, it accepts it may lose money.
Credit losses in the Swedish financial sector amounted to SKr100bn (Pounds
11bn) in 1990-92, and many experts expect at least as much again to be lost

FT  06 NOV 92 / Norway struggles to rekindle Community spirit: Opposition to
EC membership is as strong as it was in 1972 when it was rejected in a
referendum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NORWAY'S ruling Labour party is gearing up to lodge a fresh application for
membership of the European Community by the end of this month. But it will
be hard-pressed to win acceptance from an electorate that is not only deeply
sceptical about joining the EC but also increasingly opposed to the minority
government itself.
Opposition to EC membership is as strong as it was in 1972, when it was
narrowly rejected in a bitterly divisive referendum. Recent polls put the No
vote at 51 per cent, with 30 per cent in favour and the rest undecided.
Before neighbouring Denmark narrowly rejected the Maastricht treaty in June,
Norwegian support for EC membership had grown to an unprecedented majority.
But the Danish vote came as a blow and resistance to Europe has been further
strengthened by growing opposition in Sweden, where 53 per cent of the
electorate now say they would vote against membership if a referendum were
held today.
Meanwhile, support for Norway's Labour government was put at 24.6 per cent
in an opinion poll published yesterday, its lowest level ever. Norwegians
are particularly angry about unemployment, running at a post-war high of 7.6
per cent, including those on government training schemes.
Yet Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the indomitable prime minister, is seeking a
mandate from the party's annual conference on Sunday to file a fresh EC
application.
Mrs Brundtland argues that EC membership will give Norway the chance to help
shape future EC law which could affect the country.
After an uphill struggle, the government in September succeeded in pushing
through parliament the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, a 19-nation
trade pact encompassing the EC and Efta, of which Norway is a member.
The EEA, considered by many a stepping stone towards EC membership, will
take effect from next year, but it is vague about the powers Efta countries
will have over future EC legislation.
Mr Finn Kristensen, Norway's energy and industry minister, said recently
that Norway would use a 'veto' if the EC refused to consider the country's
wishes in a draft proposal for an energy directive.
Norway is western Europe's biggest oil producer alongside Britain, with
daily average production of about 2.2m barrels. It argues that the state
owns all petroleum reserves under the seabed off the country's coast and
should be able to decide who exploits these reserves. Many Norwegians,
sceptical about the EEA as well, fear Norway will lose sovereignty over vast
natural resources and will no longer have a say in agricultural and
fisheries policy.
At least two-thirds of Labour's 300 conference delegates are expected to
support a new application, with opposition coming mainly from northern
regions where fishing and agriculture are the main source of income and
unemployment is the highest in the country.
To pacify opponents, Mrs Brundtland said that an application did not
necessarily mean Norway would join the EC. 'What we experienced 20 years ago
is repeating itself,' she admitted this week. 'People in this country have a
strong fear of being taken over by outside forces.'
But she argues that Norway should seek to join with Sweden and Finland,
which have both applied, and that being the only Nordic country outside the
EC, with no one to plead its case, would have more serious consequences for
the country than joining.
By mid-November, the Labour government is expected to inform parliament of
its decision to reapply for membership. This will be followed by a formal
parliamentary debate in which at least 100 of a total 165 MPs are expected
to support a new membership application.
It is important that Norway stick to this schedule if it is to enter
negotiations with Brussels next year alongside Sweden and Finland. This
means an application will have to be delivered before the Edinburgh EC
summit in December.
It would then be submitted to a crucial referendum in 1995.

FT  06 NOV 92 / German health bill raises temperature: Dentists and doctors
are preparing to defy rare party consensus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S opposition Social Democrats call it 'an historic opportunity'.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has praised it as one of the great success stories of
his otherwise lacklustre administration.
Mr Horst Seehofer, his health minister, describes it as 'the most
far-reaching reform in the history of the statutory health insurance
scheme'.
The object of their rare mutual admiration is the remarkable political
compromise between all four big parties - the three in the ruling coalition
and the Social Democrats (SPD) - on a health reform plan to curb the soaring
costs of medical and dental care in Germany.
The bill was given a first reading in parliament yesterday. Thanks to the
agreement between the parties, it seems certain to become law in record
time, and is supposed to start saving DM11bn (Pounds 4.4bn) a year from
January.
It proposes a combination of a drugs price cut followed by a two-year price
freeze, a fixed list of drugs that may be publicly prescribed, and penalties
for doctors who over-prescribe.
There is also to be a reduction in fees for dentists, a limit on the number
of doctors who may be registered in the state-backed health scheme, a
compulsory retirement age (68) for doctors and dentists, and increased
contributions from patients for hospital care and drug prescriptions.
Overall, it provides for a complex series of controls on medical care - down
to the number of false teeth installed on a bridge or the number of pills in
a medicine packet - in order to cut costs.
Despite the political consensus on the issue, virtually the entire health
industry has denounced the reform as irrelevant and illogical: a political
compromise which simply bears no relation to reality.
The only ones in favour are the state-backed health insurance institutions,
which are desperate to reduce a deficit which stands at DM5.5bn this year.
Without the planned savings, in 1993 the deficit will nearly double.
Perhaps it is inevitable that the 'industry' is protesting: the doctors,
dentists, drug companies and hospitals will in effect be financing DM8.2bn
of the cuts, and the patients only about DM2.8bn.
The 43,000 dentists are threatening to walk out of the statutory health
service en masse, and in future provide treatment privately. They claim the
reform amounts to creeping state control of an independent health system.
The pharmacists claim that up to 30 per cent of medicines will no longer be
available to public health service patients. And they say they will
challenge the deal all the way to the constitutional court.
The 75,000 public health service doctors have described the scheme as
'disguised euthanasia'. The drugs companies have been more reserved, saying
it is a 'missed opportunity for a more comprehensive reform of the health
service'.
Mr Seehofer says that the whole system has become extravagant: that Germany
has too many doctors, too many hospital beds and consumes far too many
medicines. The price, he maintains, has increased disproportionately:
insurance contributions have been rising inexorably as a proportion of
individual wages, reaching 12.2 per cent in 1990, 12.6 per cent today, and
by next year probably 13 per cent.
The doctors say that he is missing the point, and that behind the financial
crisis lies a classic demographic dilemma: Germany's population is rapidly
ageing, and the birth rate is dropping.
In 1950, the over-60s accounted for just 14.5 per cent of the population. By
1975 that had reached 20.4 per cent and by by 2020 it will reach 26.7 per
cent, or more than one in four of the population,
'The pensioners pay a very small insurance contribution, but they are
getting older all the time, and their incidence of illness is growing very
sharply,' says Mr Klaus Noldner, chief executive of the Hartmannbund, the
doctors' lobby group.
While the volume and value of medical treatment is increasing, the number of
wage-earners paying for it is stagnating. The proportion of GNP devoted to
health care has remained at around 5.5 per cent since 1975, Mr Noldner
insists. But wages as a proportion of national income have declined,
providing a second reason why the proportion of wages going on health care
has increased so steadily. What the latest health reforms fail entirely to
do is tackle that underlying problem, he says. 'We need a completely new
financing system. If the law says that wage contributions must be fixed,
financing must be found outside the system.'
The doctors believe one answer is to impose a proportion of all health care
costs on the patient - a direction in which the Seehofer reform package
moves very cautiously. Patients will in future have to pay DM3 or DM5 or DM7
towards medicines, depending on their expense and the quantity prescribed.
Another possibility is a two-tier system of basic treatment - financed by
the health insurance scheme - and voluntary treatment, privately financed.
The dentists believe the two-tier system is also inevitable. They are
particularly furious because they say the reform, which would see them take
a 10 per cent cut in fees for false teeth and bridge treatment, follows a
slight decline in their own income and turnover since 1980. The dentists'
association is collecting sworn statements from those ready to quit the
public system. It will call out members if 75 per cent agree to go.
With the entire political establishment versus the health lobby, the
temperature is still set to rise.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Major puts back Maastricht ratification date: Prime
minister's surprise move throws fresh doubt over process of European union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign and Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN last night threw into fresh doubt the process of European union
after Mr John Major announced that final ratification of the Maastricht
treaty would be delayed until after a second Danish referendum next May.
The prime minister's move caused embarrassment among his own senior
colleagues and bewilderment in Brussels and Denmark.
Surprised Danish officials said a date for a second referendum had yet to be
set. At the European Commission, senior officials said the delay amounted to
'a U-turn' on Mr Major's earlier commitment to remove uncertainty about
Britain's position by ensuring speedy passage of the treaty through the
Commons.
If the final Commons vote does not take place until mid-May, UK ratification
of the treaty could be delayed until October, since the legislation
approving the agreement has also to be considered in detail in the Lords.
In Brussels, officials argued that a delay until after the Danish referendum
would give extra leverage to Denmark's attempt to add legally-binding
amendments to the treaty.
An aide to Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, said the
announcement had 'come as a great surprise'. A Commission official said: 'Mr
Major won the vote, so we don't understand why he's treating this as a
defeat.'
In London, one minister said the announcement was a 'terrible embarrassment'
and meant the government had decided in effect to 'hide behind the Danish
referendum'.
Mr Delors arrives in London today for scheduled talks with Mr Tristan
Garel-Jones, foreign minister, at which the delay will be discussed.
A formal meeting between Mr Major and Mr Delors is not planned but the
Commission president was due to accompany the prime minister to a football
match tomorrow.
Mr Major's move - a significant concession to his party's Euro-sceptics -
followed the government's perilously small majority in Wednesday's Commons
votes to restart the the treaty ratification process this month.
Senior ministers confirmed that Mr Major had offered to link a vote on the
final stage of the British legislation with Danish ratification in a
last-minute attempt to win the support of potential Tory rebels ahead of
Wednesday's vote.
In Denmark, the timing of the second referendum is controversial, with
parties sceptical about Maastricht keen to delay a vote, possibly until
autumn next year.
Mr Poul Schluter, the prime minister, said no date had yet been fixed for
the referendum. But he told Danish television it was not excluded that the
referendum could be held in May or June.
He stressed that the EC and Denmark must first reach agreement on a special
deal for the Danes and this must be approved by the Danish parliament before
it could be put to a referendum.
Mr Major's confirmation of the concession in the Commons yesterday also
dismayed pro-European ministers and left Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, facing the awkward task of explaining the delay to Britain's
European partners.
The concession emerged from comments by Euro-sceptic Tory MPs who had
belatedly been persuaded to vote with the government.
Mr Michael Cartiss, a Tory MP who had planned to rebel, said: 'I voted for
the government because the prime minister and Michael Heseltine (the trade
and industry secretary) promised me there would be no third reading until
after the referendum'.
In Bonn, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, insisted that Germany would
abide by the timetable of its own ratification process, which should be
completed by the end of November.
But Mr Gunther Verheugen, opposition Social Democrats' chairman of the
committee responsible for ratification, suggested a re-think might be
necessary. He said if Danish concerns about Maastricht meant full-scale
treaty amendments, it was not necessarily sensible for Germany to press
ahead.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Trade row erupts in Brussels as US sets out sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES DELORS, the European Commission president, was at the centre of a
deepening row over farm trade last night, as the US announced plans for
Dollars 300m (Pounds 194m) in punitive tariffs on European farm exports.
Mr Delors was at odds with Mr Ray MacSharry, the European Community's
agriculture commissioner, who confirmed he was handing over to Mr Delors all
responsibility for negotiations in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks.
Mr MacSharry relinquished his responsibility after the collapse of talks in
Chicago with Mr Ed Madigan, the US agriculture secretary, which were aimed
at averting a trade war.
Mr MacSharry, who remains in charge of EC agriculture, is understood to
believe that his efforts to secure a breakthrough in protracted Gatt talks
with the US were being undermined by Mr Delors. He has let it be known he
believes that interventions by Mr Delors in the Gatt imbroglio constitute
little short of sabotage.
Mr Delors and the French government have accused the commissioner of going
beyond his negotiating mandate. Other EC officials blame Mr Madigan for the
failure to resolve the impasse in the US-EC talks. The US sanctions are in
retaliation for damage that the US says is being caused to its farmers by EC
subsidies for oilseed cultivation.
The oilseeds dispute is one of the main obstacles blocking agreement in the
Uruguay Round, which aims to expand world trade through liberalisation
measures.
Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, announced that the first
package of sanctions would involve 200 per cent tariffs on white wine,
rapeseed oil and wheat gluten. The US also threatened to impose additional
tariffs on Community farm and industrial products worth Dollars 700m.
Mrs Hills sought to pre-empt a counter-explosion of EC tariffs on US
products leading to a mutually destructive transatlantic trade war, by
saying the sanctions would only take effect after 30 days.
The US had been expected to try to limit the pain of the high tariffs to
France, and perhaps Germany. But the tariffs on rapeseed oil, which hurt
France, also hit Britain. Wheat gluten tariffs will penalise German
producers. The tariffs on white wines will damage Italian exports as well as
French and German.
The US is pressing for negotiations on the oilseeds dispute to resume, in
the hope of finding a settlement before the 30-day waiting period is up.
The oilseeds dispute is at the heart of a two-year row between the US and
the EC over Europe's farm subsidy regime. The row has blocked progress in
the Uruguay Round of talks on trade liberalisation, which according to OECD
estimates could stimulate world trade worth an extra Dollars 200bn a year.
Many fear US sanctions will trigger a trade war enveloping a wide range of
farm and industrial products.
Senior EC officials confirmed that the EC in July had decided to retaliate
if the US imposed sanctions. That decision would almost certainly have to be
confirmed by the council of ministers.
Mr MacSharry said: 'We would have no difficulty finding products to hit them
back with.' He pinpointed Dollars 3bn of imports of US soya, soya meal and
corn gluten alone. He repeated earlier remarks: 'It's very easy to start a
war, but very difficult to stop it.'
One senior Commission official argued last night that 'it won't come to
that.' The official said the US had reopened contacts with the Commission to
try to get a settlement before the sanctions come into effect on December 5.
In Geneva, Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), expressed 'grave concern' about a US decision. But
he said he was pleased the US and EC had expressed determination to continue
negotiations before the sanctions came into effect.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, spoke of Britain's
determination to restrain the EC from hasty retaliatory action against the
US.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Cabinet agrees spending cuts amid hints of tax concessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CABINET yesterday settled the sweeping cuts in government programmes
needed to meet its spending targets amid Whitehall hints that next week's
Autumn Statement could include a modest package of tax concessions.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will withhold from the cabinet the details
of his promised economic 'recovery' programme until a few hours before his
speech to the House of Commons next Thursday.
The imposition of Budget-style secrecy strengthened the suspicion of
ministers that the Treasury is considering tax concessions to boost
industrial confidence and prevent a further slump in the housing market.
Mr Lamont's colleagues are convinced that the statement will be followed by
a further cut in interest rates from the present 8 per cent, taking the
level of borrowing costs down to their lowest since the 1970s.
The programme will contain separate incentives for private sector
involvement in large-scale infrastructure projects and may temporarily lift
some of the restrictions which prevent local authorities from spending their
capital receipts. Such creative accounting would push up the level of
borrowing but would keep increased spending outside the Treasury's spending
total.
However, warnings from some members of the cabinet that the Treasury would
reveal what one described as a 'horrendous' increase in public borrowing
tempered expectations of a 'mini-Budget' with wide-ranging tax changes.
They believe that an explosion in borrowing - now expected to total over
Pounds 40bn next year - may force the chancellor to consider an overall tax
increase in next year's Budget, most probably through an extension of VAT.
The government's concern about the potential for renewed unrest on the Tory
backbenches was underlined by a decision by Mr Lamont, and Mr Michael
Portillo, to hold an intensive series of meetings with ministers and MPs.
Every Tory MP outside the cabinet will be invited to the Treasury next week
to receive a briefing on the harsh economic background to the statement.
The cabinet accord yesterday on the cuts in Whitehall programmes needed to
meet the target for next year, will involve an intense squeeze on public
sector pay, with budgets allowing for increases of less than 2 per cent. But
ministers have rejected a pay freeze because of the anticipated political
outcry.
Ministers are nonetheless braced for a series of possible backbench
rebellions over proposed cuts in some social security programmes, a sharp
reduction in the defence budget and an agreement to limit the resources to
smooth next year's introduction of the council tax.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, has warned colleagues that
limiting the amount of money available for 'transitional relief' will mean
sharp increases in bills for households in the south.
Among the other casualties of the spending round, Mrs Virginia Bottomley,
health secretary, has lost several hundred million pounds from her budget
and Mrs Gillian Shephard has faced a tight squeeze on the Employment
Department's training budget.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Further aluminium production
cuts urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CUT of another 1m tonnes in western world aluminium production next year
from present levels would push the metal's price up by about 12 cents a lb
to 65 cents, according to Mr Stewart Spector, the New York-based industry
observer and author of the Spector Report.
'This won't make the industry solvent but at least 80 per cent of its
smelters would then be operating at or above their cash costs,' he says.
Mr Spector calculates that, at the present aluminium price of about 53 cents
a lb, more than two-thirds of the smelters outside the former eastern bloc
are operating at a cash loss. Many more are suffering losses on a full-cost
basis.
He suggests the industry can choose its level of prices and profits next
year. But he warns that a production cut of 500,000 tonnes in aluminium
ingot production would take prices only to 56 cents a lb and 'that certainly
won't result in higher (aluminium company) profits in 1993'.
In the second half of 1991 western aluminium producers implemented permanent
closures and temporary cuts totalling 850,000 tonnes in a full year. But
demand remained flat, imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States
continued to flood in and aluminium stocks in London Metal Exchange
warehouses are now 1m tonnes higher than in June 1991 when the first
capacity cuts were implemented.
So why is the industry continuing to increase production rather than make
cuts?
Mr Geoff Campbell, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking
group, points to the aluminium industry's version of Catch 22. Shutting down
part of a smelter usually pushes unit costs up. Closing a complete smelter
can frequently cause problems because many of the industry's big producers
are integrated groups. They have downstream facilities to supply or upstream
refineries supplying them with alumina (aluminium oxide). So the closure of
a high-cost smelter may cause more problems than it solves. He concludes:
'The only realistic justification for reducing output is to get the
aluminium price up and there is not much point closing down an operation
because you won't be around to take advantage of the subsequent price rise'.
And anti-trust legislation prevents producers getting together to organise
between themselves an orderly shutdown of capacity.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, the Royal
Dutch/Shell offshoot, suggests: 'The onus is largely, although not
exclusively, on the European producers to reduce output and return the
market to balance'.
He points out aluminium companies have been reluctant to act so far because
of forecasts - up to the summer at least - that an economic recovery was not
far away. 'The temptation to hold on in the hope that better times are just
around the corner is overwhelming when the costs incurred in permanently
closing or mothballing capacity are taken into account.'
Mr MacMillan says that producers also had the chance to sell metal forward
at higher prices earlier this year and protect themselves from the present
environment to some extent.
He says the market is full of rumours about more capacity cuts but 'even if
they materialise, there is a real danger that we will experience a repeat of
the second half of last year, when successive announcements about cuts were
regarded as too little too late and prices continued to slide.'

<TEXT>
THE SHIUGANG Corporation from the People's Republic of China became the new
owner of Peru's state iron producer yesterday in Lima. The investment,
totalling USDollars 311.8m, is the first made by communist China in Latin
America, according to Shougang directors.
Shougang amply exceeded the minimum bidding requirement set by Copri, Peru's
state privatisation commission. The Chinese offer for 100 per cent of Hierro
Peru's shares was Dollars 120m compared with a minimum of Dollars 22m; and
it has pledged to invest a further Dollars 150m over the next three years in
much-needed modernisation of equipment (The minimum investment commitment
was set at Dollars 60m). In addition, Shougang must assume Hierro Peru's
debts, projected at Dollars 41.8m.
Front runner for months in the Hierro Peru stakes had been a multinational
consortium of Swiss, Chilean, Mexican and Japanese capital, headed by
Santiago-based Compania Minera del Pacifico and led by former Peruvian mines
minister Mr Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski. Disappointed representatives at
yesterday's auction admitted, however, that the Chinese offer was
unbeatable.
Shougang is one of communist China's 30 top corporations and is in the
mainstream of the country's economic reform. It is described as an
'autonomous state company' with extensive steel, mining and shipping
interests in China and Asia, and turned in profits of Dollars 500m last
year. It plans to double its current steel output over the next seven years.
To maximise the lucrative freight side of the business, Shougang would ship
coal from China to substitute the oil at present used to fire Hierro Peru's
furnaces.
Mr Julio Orihuela, Shougang's Lima representative, said the offer for Hierro
Peru also included construction of a steel mill locally.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sri Lanka sees bright future in
the tea leaves - Managers of the privatised plantations are brimming with
confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been less than six months since Sri Lanka pushed through a radical
reform of its tea industry, but plantation managers are already confident
that they can rapidly turn the loss-making sector round.
In June, the tea estates - which have for nearly two decades been run at a
loss by the state - were regrouped and placed under private management.
One of the new management companies, Hayleys Plantation Services, expects
its Talawakelle plantations to become profitable within the next two years.
Mr WL Wijewardena, the general manager, says that the situation can be
improved dramatically simply by employing standard techniques, such as
proper use of fertiliser, to increase yields.
Sri Lankan yields, which average 1,100 kg a hectare, are far below those of
its main competitors, such as India and Kenya. State managers, through
neglect and incompetence, did little to improve the situation. Scant
attention was paid to replanting higher-yielding tea varieties and the
application of fertiliser was sporadic.
Managers at Talawakelle also intend to become more sensitive to market
needs, says Mr Wijewardena. Sri Lanka has been notoriously slow to react to
international trends, for example producing only 3 per cent of CTC (cut,
tear and curl) tea, which accounts for the greater part of world trade.
There is also scope to enter specialist markets such as scented teas and tea
bags.
Those involved in the Sri Lankan industry are hoping that Mr Wijewardena's
confidence is well founded. The sector, in spite of being the country's
largest net earner of foreign exchange, has been an economic liability ever
since estates were nationalised in the mid-1970s.
The two state corporations put in charge of plantations were heavily
subsidised by the government, to the tune of SLRs400m (Pounds 5.8m) a month,
according to brokers Forbes and Walker.
Mr Maxwell Fernando, a consultant at Forbes and Walker, estimates that the
total loss to the economy during 17 years of state management was a
'colossal' SLRs50bn.
Whatever the scale of losses, the government has seen fit to shuffle off
responsibility for running the estates. Fear of wholesale redundancies among
the largely Indian Tamil workforce, however, persuaded the administration to
stop short of outright privatisation.
Instead it chose to privatise estate management, drawing up contracts that
ensure it a share in profits but protect it from losses. These are to be
absorbed by the new management companies, while plantation workers are to
benefit from a 10 per cent share in any profits.
Government officials admit privately that the recent reforms are a precursor
to full-scale privatisation. Some managers expect to be offered at least a
portion of estate equity within five years. The public would also be offered
a stake, as has happened in other sell-offs in the government's
'peoplisation' programme.
If privatisation is to be successful, management teams will have to move
into profit before then. Their task has been made far more difficult by four
months of drought earlier this year, which has cut production sharply.
In the first six months of 1992, output was 41.4m kg down on last year.
Forbes and Walker is forecasting a total 1992 crop of 180m kg, 23 per cent
lower than last year's record.
In spite of such difficulties, Mr Wijewardena expects at least 70 per cent
of the new management companies to be successful.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Technology threatens sows with
baby boom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of piglets reared by a single sow every year will rise from an
average of 21 to 30 by the year 2012, using only existing technology, an
international conference on pig breeding was told this week.
Much higher figures could be achieved through improvements in genetic
engineering and reproductive technology, according to Mr Hein van der Steen,
technical manager at the Oxfordshire based Pig Improvement Company. He
suggested a figure of 44.6 piglets per sow.
While such high numbers are still science fiction, 'few of us doubt that
they could be achieved', said Mr van der Steen. He pointed out that the most
efficient breeders were already getting 28 piglets per sow.
The biggest strides were being made in the field of reproductive technology.
Future developments could include the sexing of semen, enabling litters of
only one sex to be produced; in vitro fertilisation; collection and
maturation of eggs; and non-surgical embryo transfers, Mr van der Steen
suggested.
He was doubtful, however, that the public would accept some methods of
increasing efficiency, pointing out that public pressure had already stopped
the use of bovine growth hormone to boost milk production in the European
Community.
'You have to ask: is 45 pigs a year on a sow acceptable from an animal
welfare point of view?' he said. 'We have to find the right balance.'
PIC, which is owned by Dalgety, staged the conference to celebrate the 30th
anniversary of its foundation by a small group of Oxford farmers. It now
boasts sales of Pounds 100m a year, with more than 25 per cent of the UK
market for breeding gilts and a network of worldwide outlets. Last year more
than 750,000 breeding animals were sold in 29 countries.
Mr Richard Clothier, chief executive, said the world market still had plenty
of potential. The US had been slow to develop improved pig breeding, but
demand now far exceeded the ability of breeders to supply. China, another
huge potential market, has not yet started to improve its pig farming.
'Over the next 10 years the demand for breeding stock will at the very least
double - and probably treble,' he said.

PLATINUM and SILVER rose sharply in afternoon trade following early rallies
in the New York markets on bullish chart factors. Platinum was fixed in the
afternoon at Dollars 363 a troy ounce, up Dollars 6, before peaking above
Dollars 364 an ounce, and silver closed 14 cents higher at 398.5 cents an
ounce. Dealers said there was active option writing in silver with strike
prices at 400 cents. COCOA prices climbed to nine-month highs during the
afternoon session, with key support levels breached. The March quotation's
Pounds 24 rise to Pounds 741 a tonne elicited little sign of producer
selling, dealers said. Breach of resistance at Dollars 1,000, for the New
York March position, helped to give the market an initial spur, they added.
In contrast, London robusta COFFEE futures ran into a wave of profit taking,
following the recent rise to nine-month highs. The January position closed
Dollars 22 down at Dollars 922 a tonne. At the LME COPPER led a decline in
base metal prices before finding support below Dollars 2,220 a tonne. But
dealers thought the three months price was set to test Dollars 2,200.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Asarco expects 2.9% copper
demand rise next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PHOENIX, ARIZONA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHAIRMAN of North America's third-largest integrated copper producer
told analysts this week that he expects world copper consumption to increase
to 10.3m tonnes in 1993, a 2.9 per cent advance over this year.
That rise in consumption, and a slower advance in 1993 worldwide production,
should put copper demand about 100,000 tons above output, reversing the
stock build-up that occured in 1992.
Mr Richard Osborne, Chairman of Asarco, based the rosy projections on
assumptions that the economies of Japan and Europe would rebound sharply in
the second half of 1993. He put the rate of consumption growth in the US at
about 1.5 per cent, in Europe at 1 per cent, in Japan at 4.5 per cent and in
the rest of Asia at 7.5 per cent. He forecast China's 1993 imports at
190,000 tonnes, compared with estimates of 165,000 for this year.
Mine expansion in the US, Chile, and Indonesia will boost copper supplies by
2.2 per cent to 9.7m tonnes in 1992, he said, and by 2.6 per cent to 9.9m
tonnes in 1993.
Reporting the company's third quarter results at a meeting in Phoenix,
Arizona, Mr Osborne said Asarco would be delivering an average of 175m lb of
copper to the market in each quarter of 1993. That reflected full production
at the company's Mission and Ray copper mines.
Asarco spent Dollars 350m on expansions and improvements at those
facilities, which were completed between September 1991 and March 1992.
These transformed the company from a metals processor to a fully-integrated
copper producer.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Douglas Yearley, Phelps Dodge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DOUGLAS Yearley, chairman of Phelps Dodge, was misreported in the article
'Copper mining projects attract big spenders' on October 28. His comments
were made at a private meeting for analysts to which the press was not
invited.
He did not say at that meeting that the price paid for the Zaldivar copper
project in Chile could be justified only if the copper price stayed at
Dollars 1.15 a lb for the long term. He did not say that the Collahausi
project, also in Chile, was 'on the wrong side of the Andes mountains' and
accordingly could not use a slurry pipeline to transport ore.
Mr Yearley points out that the Lisheen deposit in Ireland is a zinc, not a
copper deposit. He also says that, while he used the word 'amateurs' when
questioned about some international gold mining companies which were moving
into base metals, the word was used in a joking manner. Furthermore, he
described his own company as an 'amateur' in the gold business when compared
with other, more substantial, gold producers.
Mr Yearly says: 'I certainly would not deprecate any of the mineral
properties mentioned in the article. They are all excellent deposits and our
company would be delighted to own an interest in any of them. I was simply
making the point that Phelps Dodge believes it will get a better return for
its money if it invests in exploration rather than purchasing interests in
known deposits, given the prices or recent, publicly announced,
transactions'.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Price slide alarms Opec
ministers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH SEA oil prices dipped below Dollars 19 a barrel yesterday to their
lowest level since April, but recovered after reports that the Organisation
of Petroleum Exporting Countries was considering taking steps to stop the
price slide.
Brent crude for December delivery ended yesterday at Dollars 19.30, up 20
cents on the day. Earlier, it had fallen to Dollars 18.90.
Oil prices had fallen from about Dollars 20.80 two weeks ago to between
Dollars 19.30 and Dollars 19.50 early in the week, as rumours of production
increases by Iran, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait led to fears that oil supply and
demand might not be as closely balanced this winter as analysts had
forecast.
The fears were compounded by surveys which estimated Opec production in
October at between 25.1m and 25.3m b/d in October - well above the 'market
share' of 24.2m b/d, plus some extra for Kuwait, Opec agreed in September.
Prices were depressed further on Wednesday by the latest figures for US oil
stocks from the American Petroleum Institute which showed a rise of 3.64m
barrels, compared with an expected rise of only 1m to 2m barrels.
They slipped below key support at Dollars 19 a barrel yesterday, before
reports that Opec ministers were consulting by telephone and telex pushed
prices back up. The Reuter news agency quoted Opec sources as saying that
ministers were discussing taking action to curb excess supply, or convening
a special meeting before the next scheduled Opec conference on November 25.
Mr Joe Stanislaw, managing director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates,
said the increase in stocks was caused by higher-than-expected Opec
production in September and October that had occurred ahead of demand. 'If
we had a two-week cold snap, you could see prices go back to what they were
before,' he added.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Survey of Ireland (7): Across the water / Review of the
energy sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DONAL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN CONTRAST to the Irish manufacturers which are trying desperately to
distance themselves from the effects of the downturn in the UK currency, the
Irish energy sector is looking increasingly to the UK for future
development. The Irish gas board, BGE, is well advanced in its plans for the
construction of a IPounds 280m gas interconnector to Scotland in order to
tap into North Sea gas. A study on the feasibility of a UK electricity
interconnector is also under way.
Flogas, the only publicly quoted LPG distributor, is developing its UK
market presence by diversifying into the sale of British natural gas in
England, and the hopes of some of Ireland's leading oil exploration
companies are increasingly dependent on North Sea prospects. The currency
advantage of the stronger Irish pound makes buying UK energy for the Irish
market more attractive.
Conversely, competition from cheaper priced sterling products has further
intensified the pressure on the Irish government from industrialists
requiring reduced energy costs to improve competitiveness.
Even before the rise of the Irish pound against sterling, the Culliton
Review Group, a government-appointed commission on employment creation and
industrial competitiveness, pointed out that the Irish government-owned
electricity supply board, EBB, could reduce the cost of electricity by using
imported fuels instead of peat.
However, such a decision would spell disaster for Bord na Mona, the
state-owned peat harvesting company which generates 55 per cent of its
revenue from its sales to the EBB. Peat also provides an important source of
employment in the Irish midlands, where the Taoiseach's constituency, Mr
Albert Reynolds's, is based.
Culliton says: 'The financial and social consequences of a reduced price for
milled peat should be faced by the government directly and not hidden in a
cross subsidy between the two state sponsored bodies.'
But since implementation of the Culliton proposal would cause social and
political consequences equivalent to a pit closure for a British Labour
government, the Irish coalition government is unlikely to risk such a move.
Similarly, the government seems reluctant to implement another Culliton
proposal: that BGE charge a more commercial price for the natural gas it
sells to Irish Fertiliser Industries as a feedstock for manufacturing
nitrogen fertiliser. IFI (and its predecessor, NET) has been receiving this
gas at a discount, paying as little as one fifth of the price paid by
commercial customers.
A more likely victim of the drive for competitiveness could be the
state-owned Irish Refining Company. whose sales rely mainly on the
government requirement that Irish oil distributors source one third of their
supplies from the refinery. The result is an extra imposition on petrol
prices for consumers.
Here the government has at least taken the step of trying to find a
purchaser or partner to take over the operation and invest in upgrading. So
far its efforts have proved fruitless.
The government appears to be holding out in the hope that an important oil
discovery in the Celtic Sea - on the shore of which the refinery is located
 -could help to justify the investment. The most recent well to be drilled
last month discovered oil, which flowed at 100 barrels a day, approximately
30 miles south of the refinery.
This news offers little encouragement for the refinery company, but adds to
the tantalising results of exploration, which indicate that there is oil at
a number of locations off the southern coast. (The structure is so complex
that it requires innovative investment and production techniques to bring it
ashore.)
The government has recently begun to recognise that it too must take a more
innovative approach to offshore exploration. As a result it has reduced
corporation profits tax on oil discoveries to as low as 25 per cent - which
compares favourably with tax rates for North Sea producers.
It has also designed its terms to revive interest - which had been flagging,
after the disappointing results of the 1970s.
Mobil, the second largest US oil company, has committed itself to drilling
programmes with a number of Irish companies, including Aran Energy and Bula.
Pict, the UK exploration company, also joined in the search this summer.
To encourage exploration in the frontier area off the north west Atlantic
coast, Mr Bobby Molloy, the Irish minister for energy, is scheduled to
announce special licensing terms which 'will reflect the particularly
challenging nature of the acreage.'
The challenge to which the minister refers includes the weather conditions;
the minister describes the area as having one of the best wind regimes in
Europe. But while the wind may cause difficulties for exploration, it can
facilitate the generation of alternative energy. Last month saw the
completion of Ireland's first wind farm on the north west coast with a
capacity of 6.45 megawatts for the ESB controlled national grid.
But even the recent 30 per cent increase in the price, to 3.6p per unit for
independent supplies, is unlikely to lead to this sector catering for the
increased electricity demand expected before the end of the century.
Instead, the ESB has developed proposals for another gas powered station in
Dublin. Since nuclear fuel has also proved unpopular, it seems that the only
other alternative would be the interconnector which it is exploring with the
UK National Grid Company.
Both partners hope that the EC could be persuaded to help finance the
project (the gas interconnector is receiving IPounds 80m.). Routed through
Northern Ireland and Wales, it would link both parts of the island to the
European free trade electricity network.
Such a link would also lay the groundwork for outside involvement in
generating electricity for the Irish market.
With serious concern that gas sales are unlikely to provide a return from
the interconnector soon enough, BGE may encourage British Gas to avail
itself of the interconnector in order to introduce natural gas to the
Belfast markets, and to power an electricity station in Northern Ireland.
The next step could see British participation in the distribution of natural
gas in the Republic, just as Flogas is already doing in the UK.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Survey of Ireland (9): Irish mice still smile - Electronics
remain healthy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGELA LONG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
1992 HAS not been a good year for the electronics industry in Ireland -
until recently the great white hope of the country's industrial development
authority.
Ireland's computer industry flashed into life in the 1960s. It meant very
little in terms of jobs and exports until the 1980s; even in 1970 it
generated only 6 per cent of Irish industrial exports. And then, from 7 per
cent at the beginning of the 1980s, computer goods made up 25 per cent of
exports by 1991, and software accounted for 7 per cent - out of nowhere a
mere decade earlier. The proud (if esoteric) boast was that Ireland was
responsible for 90 per cent of the mice in Europe.
Electronics generally had been following the same trend. By last year there
were 300 companies set up in Ireland, employing over 28,000 people,
exporting goods worth IPounds 4bn.
So far hundreds of jobs have been lost at the plants of foreign
multinationals, which had been identified as great providers of jobs,
service jobs and export dollars. The first bad news came in May, when Apple
Computer indicated that 400 jobs would go at its European headquarters in
Cork. Fortunately for the workforce, Apple later modified its decision, and
no jobs have gone yet. But the company had been looking in the direction of
the far east (anathema to the Irish government and trade unions) where it
plans to centralise its printed circuit board (PCB) manufacture.
Also in May, BG Turnkey, a supplier to computer manufacturers, laid off 30
staff. In July Digital announced that it wanted 100 voluntary redundancies
from its Galway plant (a Digital operation at Clonmel closed in May 1991),
and if these were not forthcoming it would have to impose redundancy.
Then came August, a wicked month indeed. Pulse, an American electronics
firm, sacked 125; then Wang announced that 100 jobs would have to go at its
Dollars 75m plant in Limerick. The other big job losses announced in August
were also at American companies; the US has the highest foreign
representation in Ireland, with about 350 plants or offices out of 1,000.
The Wang announcement had the biggest impact, partly because it came in the
same week as publication of another 500 redundancies effective at foreign
multinationals operations concentrated in the west of Ireland. The bad news
gave ammunition to those who had criticised the government and the
Industrial Development Authority (IDA) for heavy reliance on foreign
companies to create jobs and capital by setting up operations in Ireland.
Mr Pat Rabbitte, spokesman on commerce and industry for the vocal minority
party, the Democratic Left, says: 'The experience with Wang illustrates all
the problems associated with relying so heavily on multinationals for job
creation. The excellent record of Wang's Irish operation was not enough to
save them.' This is the rub: having one's destiny controlled from afar. In
the Irish context this is especially irritating; it is at once a fact of
history and of the economic present.
But it is not time to lower the curtain on this contemporary success story
for Irish industry.
The IDA says it has no plans for a U-turn away from its strategy of chasing
electronics companies with generous financial inducements and the lure of a
skilled English-speaking workforce. And there have also been a number of
positive events in 1992.
Wang is a typical case from the computer sector. It came in 1980 when times
were good, speaking of a possible 1,500 jobs in the Limerick plant. But the
actual figure never exceeded 700, although the people of Limerick were
delighted with the contribution the company made to the area. In recent
years turnover hovered around the IPounds 300m.
But the Wang dream turned sour. US head office said that the total
workforce, 12,000 internationally, would have to shrink to 5,000. The world
recession was taking its toll, and the advantages of cheaper manufacture in
the Far East could not be ignored by hard-pressed computer companies.
Additions to the sector, such as a new plant in Coolock, Co Dublin, to be
built by US firm Seagate Technologies, and a takeover of the Nixdorf plant
in Wicklow by Maxtor, are in doubt; both companies have suspended decisions.
(Together, these ventures would have created over 2,500 jobs  - jobs sorely
needed in the context of 21 per cent unemployment nationally.) But companies
like Motorola and Intel are still filing good results. Dell, another
American computer company based in Limerick, reported a 129 per cent
increase in sales during the quarter ended August 1992 - and net income up
77 per cent.
The list of electronics companies attracted by lreland's generous provisions
for foreign investors is long and star-studded: NEC, Amdahl, Microsoft,
Siemens, Phillips Ericcson, Claris. Not all of them are in bad straits,
although in the middle of a severe international recession there is not much
reckless spending.
Lay-offs must be seen in the context of the world recession, says Martin
Cronin, manager of the electronics division at the IDA. 'Workers have been
laid off in the UK and the US. Compared with the worldwide situation,
Ireland is still in a strong position. And the response of the electronic
industry worldwide would be similar to Ireland's. It's a technology that is
evolving very rapidly, and new products will come in bursts.'
The National Microelectronics Centre at the Plassey Technology park is
engaged in doing 'cutting-edge' research, and the nearby making the
graduates with skills the electronics companies need.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Taoiseach, acknowledged the changing scene last
month: 'While previously we had been able to rely on an attractive package
of fiscal incentives . . this is increasingly being matched by our
competitors in other countries. It is therefore essential that Ireland
should develop additional sources of advantage.'

FT  06 NOV 92 / Survey of Ireland (8): A state of chassis - Angela Long
seeks a road out of the dark ages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGELA LONG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BOREEN, in Irish, is a little back road, likely to feature overgrown
hedgerows and an assortment of potholes. Charming as they are, they are not
exactly suitable for large transport vehicles.
Ireland is full of boreens. One of the attractions of endorsing the
Maastricht treaty in last June's referendum, according to the government
headed by Mr Albert Reynolds, was the IPounds 6bn in EC funds which would
build bigger, better roads and other infrastructural necessities.
A standard map of Europe map shows the difference between road networks on
mainland Europe and those in Ireland. While German, Dutch and French
motorways appear as black spiders' webs on the page, Ireland boasts a few
lines: the N1 down the east coast, the N6 across from Dublin to the west and
the N7 down to Limerick and Cork.
Irish people in their early thirties can remember national rejoicing when
the double carriageway on the Naas road was opened. These few miles of
modern road linking the capital with a town to its south-west represented a
symbolic breakthrough to the world of the autobahn, which Ireland must join
 -or be forever peripheral in every sense.
As recently as two years ago Mr Oliver Haslette, the then president of the
Construction Industry Federation, was complaining that Ireland was 'in the
Dark Ages' as far as transport went, with 'the most diabolical roads you
could imagine.' - But more than 40 important road projects presently eat up
about IPounds 600m of government funds - plus the essential EC funds -
across Ireland.
The National Roads Authority (set up in 1988) and local authorities are
charged with carrying out the planning. The National Development Plan
adopted by the government in 1989 gives priority to improving Ireland's
supply infrastructure, emphasising the vital sea routes and small but
growing air freight; sea, road and rail account for nearly 99 per cent of
freight carried to and from Ireland. The Industrial Development Authority
likes to mention the telecommunications network, recipient of big investment
in the 1980s, as another important component of Ireland's infrastructure.
But roads - to carry goods and agricultural produce to the ferry ports of
the east coast - are the first plank in the policy. Of these, the Dublin
Port Access road project is the biggest in cash terms; its budget is IPounds
96m.
Athlone, smack in the middle of Ireland, is a town which benefited typically
from a new road which was Ireland's largest single civil engineering
venture. Before the 1990s, Athlone's had main street was choked with
trans-national traffic heading for Galway and points west. The Athlone
bypass has changed that. Other towns, such as Arklow in County Wexford, are
scheduled to get the same relief.
Improving local quality of life is one thing; improving the livelihoods of
the local people is another - a prospect arising from the hoped-for increase
in export/import trade after the Channel tunnel speeds journey times to
continental Europe. 30 per cent of Irish exports go to Britain, but there is
a big balance for the continent and beyond. More than half of the
inward-bound bulk shipments on ferries (oil and coal, for example) come from
countries outside the EC.
The Republic has four main ports, Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Rosslare.
Roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro) services go only to the UK and France, but the lift
on/lift off services (lo/lo) also go to the Netherlands (Rotterdam), Belgium
(Antwerp) and Germany (Hamburg).
Much of the present sense of crisis is because of the imminent opening of
the Channel Tunnel. The thought of being the only country in the EC without
direct road/rail access in the market of 350m consumers is a psychological
handicap for Irish exporters.
Commentators point out that a joint, concerted, Northern Ireland/Republic of
Ireland transport strategy is the best solution for both. Dr Con Power,
chairman of the interim National Roads Authority is among those who have
taken to task both Dublin and Westminster for the lack of any integrated
transport policy. It would apply not only to roads: the rail link between
the two capitals also needs to be upgraded and provided with fresh rolling
stock.
The Chartered Institute of Transport recently declared that Ireland would
have to spend IPounds 2bn on urgent infrastructure projects if her
competitiveness were not to be seriously affected. Apart from the familiar
arguments about roads and upgrading ports, the CIT estimates that 60 new
rail locomotives are needed, and 14 new ships should ply the sea routes to
Britain and mainland Europe (a point emphasised by the tragic deaths of two
teenagers last August, when an old ventilation system on board a ferry
malfunctioned, producing toxic gas.
While the rest of Ireland grumbles that it misses out on Dublin's advantages
of being close to the ports, and campaigns for new roads, Dublin labours
under the burden of its traffic problem. The port is right on top of the
city centre; heavy transport vehicles clog famous thoroughfares.
The government has commissioned a report, combining civil servants,
consultants and interest group submissions, on ways to handle Dublin's
existing traffic and divert vehicles which have to use the central routes
because there are no obvious alternatives. It is having a long and
quarrelsome gestation.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Survey of Ireland (10): Talent prefers a crisis - Alannah
Hopkin goes to the theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALANNAH HOPKIN

<TEXT>
IRISH theatre has not been so strong since the days of George Bernard Shaw
and Sean O'Casey. Neither television, video nor the recession seem to have
an adverse effect on it.
If export is an indication of success, there are at present three Irish
plays in London's West End: Dancing at Lughnasa and Philadelphia, Here I
Come, both by Brian Friel, and Someone to Watch Over Me by Frank McGuinness.
By the end of the year the latter will have joined the former on Broadway.
Three Irish plays were awarded Fringe First awards at the Edinburgh Festival
this year.
Ever since the founding of the Abbey Theatre, in 1904, theatre has had a
central place in Irish life. Indigenous Irish theatre belongs to the 20th
century (all previous dramatists are relegated to the 'Anglo-Irish'
category). So vital was the Abbey to national life that JM Synge's reference
to underwear - the text of Playboy of the Western World mentioned a shift -
caused a riot in 1907. Another riot, in 1926, took place at the opening of
O'Casey's The Plough and the Stars. In both cases the audience felt that the
play had insulted national self esteem by questioning Irish patriotism,
chastity and the Irish character in general.
Contemporary playwrights continue to be preoccupied with national identity.
Whether revival of a classic or a brand new play, the best Irish theatre is
always in some sense an exploration of this The stronger the crisis in
identity, it would seem, the better the theatre.
The most striking aspect today is the astonishing number of playwrights at
work, from established names such as Brian Friel, Tom Murphy, John B Keane,
Hugh Leonard, Thomas Kilroy, Tom MacIntyre and Frank McGuinness, to the
younger generation: Dermot Bolger (five plays staged in three years),
Sebastian Barry, Ger FitzGibbon, Antoine O'Flatharta, Jim NMolan, Billy
Roche, Mannix Flynn and the 23 year old Michael West, whose version of
Tartuffe is running now at the Gate. Irish theatre is writer-led, in
contrast to the actor-led English theatre, where technical training is
paramount.
Indeed, given scant resources for training, it is extraordinary how
professional Irish work is, even in small provincial companies. Dublin used
to dominate Irish theatre - 'Dublin' being the Abbey (the National Theatre
of Ireland) and The Gate. The scene began to change about 15 years ago, when
Garry Hynes, now artistic director of the Abbey, founded the Druid Theatre
in Galway: a shoestring venture, the prototype of numerous other small
companies which have come (and sometimes gone) in recent years.
Phelim Donlon, drama officer of the Arts Council, has the unenviable task of
allocating drama's tiny budget of IPounds 3,338,7000 (out of a total budget
of IPounds 10,028,000, in 1992, for all the arts). He identifies the success
of these small companies as the biggest change on the drama scene. Their
names give the flavour of their often unconventional approach to drama:
Rough Magic, Co-Motion, Pigsback, Focus, Wet Paint (all Dublin-based);
Punchbag (Galway), Red Kettle (Waterford), Graffiti (Cork). Not all receive
a direct Arts Council grant - Punchbag won its Fringe First at Edinburgh
without one - but they benefit indirectly from the Arts Council's policy of
subsidising small performance spaces and providing touring grants.
There is resentment, among the newcomers, that the Abbey and The Gate
between them absorb two thirds of the drama budget. Vincent O'Shea, artistic
director of Cork's Everyman Palace, maintains that 'we cannot afford to
support the huge standing army represented by the Abbey at the expense of
the guerrillas who are saving Irish theatre from dullness and boredom.'
Phelim Donlon explains that this is because, when responsibility for the
Abbey and The Gate was transferred to the Arts Council in 1976, they brought
their own budgets with them. (In those days they absorbed some 90 per cent
of the drama budget; their directors in turn now complain of being
under-funded.)
The only significant instance of regular corporate sponsorship for theatre
is Irish Life's commitment to the Dublin Theatre Festival which takes over
the city for two weeks in early October. The festival has a dual function:
it is an opportunity to showcase the best local productions, and it also
gives Irish audiences a chance to see the work of overseas companies.
There is a tendency, in the younger generation, to react against the word -
the literary quality which has hitherto distinguished Irish theatre - and to
emphasise physical imagery rather than verbal. The Kabuki Hamlet, the
Schiller Theatre's Macbeth and the circus-inspired Archaos were big hits of
the last two festivals, and their influence can already be seen in local
productions.
The Abbey is still an important promoter of new talent. David Byrne, its New
Writing editor, receives between 600-700 unsolicited scripts a year. Many
come from overseas, and stand little chance against the competition from
Irish writers, particularly young ones. Mr Byrne can name over a dozen of
these, in their early 20s, some of whom can expect to see their play at The
Peacock, the Abbey's small stage, in the near future.
And yet he is pessimistic about the long term prospects of people involved
in theatre in Ireland making a comfortable living out of it. As in so many
other walks of life, the existence of the UK market is important.

maintains world-class aspirations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SIX MONTHS ago, Ireland's National Aerospace task force set itself the goal
of creating in Ireland a new European hub for jet aircraft maintenance by
the end of the decade.
It envisages a world-class centre for aerospace maintenance, overhaul and
repair, together with associated manufacturing and service industries which
by the year 2000 is intended to provide employment for 11,500 people.
Established two years before, the task force was set up under the aegis of
the Industrial Development Authority (IDA) to bring senior management teams
from Ireland's nascent aerospace sector together with industry and trade
specialists from the government, to draw up a coherent strategy.
They concluded that a number of key trends in the world aerospace industry
have created an opportunity for Ireland to become an important European
player in niche sectors of the market.
These trends include a shift by big manufacturers towards sub-contracting;
the growing use of composite materials in aircraft construction; high labour
costs and turnover in certain industrialised countries, and Europe's growing
strength in world aerospace activity. As a result the IDA now views
aerospace as one of one of its top priorities in industrial promotion,
alongside pharmaceuticals, electronics and tele-marketing.
Up to now it has invested in excess of IPounds 25m in what are considered to
be three anchor projects for the sector. The first, Team Aer Lingus, is the
aircraft maintenance subsidiary of the Aer Lingus airline, Ireland's
national carrier. Growing out of the airline's own maintenance facilities,
the company has invested an additional IPounds 35m to increase its hangar
capacity by 50 per cent to 19 bays, to be able to offer to outside operators
full airframe maintenance on Boeing's entire range of passenger aircraft as
well as McDonnell Douglas DC9s. A Team subsidiary, Airmotive Ireland,
provides jet engine overhaul for Pratt and Whitney and Snecma engines.
Shannon Aerospace rolled back its hangar doors for business last September.
This IPounds 80m joint venture between Swissair, Lufthansa and the
Shannon-based GPA aircraft leasing group provides heavy maintenance ('D'
checks) and important line checks ('C' checks) for airframes, and other
services, such as repairs and painting, for narrow bodied aircraft such as
the Boeing 737 and MD80s.
Shannon Turbine Technologies (STT) is a IPounds 24m joint venture of GPA and
Sulzer Brothers of Switzerland. It is building a high technology facility
for the repair and remanufacture of high pressure turbine parts for Snecma
and General Electric jet engines, which are widely used in Europe. The plant
is scheduled to open in autumn 1993.
Such projects are intended to provide the nuclei of two aerospace-orientated
industrial 'clusters', one at Dublin, centred round Team Aer Lingus, the
other at Shannon in the west of Ireland, centred round Shannon Aerospace and
STT.
In five years, when Shannon Aerospace plans to be working at full capacity
with a workforce of over 1,000, it expects to be the largest independent
supplier of heavy maintenance for Boeing 737 and MD80 aircraft in Europe.
The company estimates that there are now 300 operated by airlines in the
European region that rely on outside maintenance facilities and plans to win
a substantial share of that business. At full capacity, the facility can
carry out 50 full 'D' checks, or more than 300 'C' checks, each year.
There are clearly expectations that the general economic recession, which
has dampened demand for aircraft travel over the past two years, will
eventually bottom out. In the meantime, their executives are hoping that
even with an acknowledged overcapacity in maintenance facilities in Europe
at present, they can compete effectively on price, quality and turnaround
time.
In opening the Shannon Aerospace facility in September, Mr Otto Loeffe, the
president of Swissair, said: 'The ultimate survivors (in the airline
industry) will be those who are able to operate with low costs and still
provide a quality service. Maintenance is a vital component in that
equation.'
Through the IDA and the Shannon Development Corporation, the government
offers substantial capital, training and R&amp;D grants. A flat-rate corporation
tax of only 10 per cent until the year 2010 is a strong incentive, while a
pool of well-trained labour with firm roots in the country is a big
attraction to foreign companies suffering from high wage costs and high
staff turnover. A new aircraft engineering faculty at Limerick university
will produce its first graduates next year, adding to the flow of skilled
technicians and scientists into the industry.
Mr Loeffe said: 'One of the reasons for our location here has been the high
level of Irish government support for the project'.
It is that government commitment to the aerospace sector which has largely
dispelled worries about the present recession killing off the infant
industry in its cradle. The Irish government has already invested tens of
millions of punts in development and training grants and is set to spend
tens of millions more. Although neither the government nor Shannon Aerospace
is willing to reveal the extent of public finance that has gone into the
latter's facility, it is thought to be in the region of IPounds 20-30m, a
substantial proportion of that having been spent on workforce training, the
total bill for which will reach IPounds 25m at full capacity.
At the bottom line, the government views the aerospace sector as an
important potential provider of sustainable high-tech jobs.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Survey of Ireland (3): Undeterred by recession - 'A
successful unemployed economy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE Irish economy can be considered both a success and a failure
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
depending on your viewpoint. Low inflation, sustained growth and a healthy
trade surplus add up to a classic textbook case of good economic management.
The appendix would have to point out, though, that almost a quarter of the
3.5m population is marginalised from the mainstream economy, and a
substantial proportion more has little to show for that good economic
management.
In Dublin, the carefully-tended gardens of the middle- and upper-class
neighbourhoods of the 'southside' - south of the river Liffey, which bisects
the city - give an aura of genteel prosperity. The only hint of anxiety is
the ubiquitous burglar alarm, now to be seen on almost any house with a
reasonable coat of paint. (It could probably rate alongside the personal
computer as a yardstick of the occupant's standard-of-living.) City centre
restaurants, with their uniformly expensive menus, seem invariably to be
full, and doing a thriving business.
On the other side of the Liffey on the 'northside' where lower-middle class
and working class neighbourhoods predominate, the pubs, supermarkets and
fast-food shops continue to ring up profits, but their trade is increasingly
being financed by transfers from the exchequer in the form of welfare and
unemployment benefits.
Despite the recession, Ireland continues to have one of the fastest-growing
economies in the European Community, averaging 5 per cent growth per annum
over the past five years. But it also has the longest dole queues; grown
longer by 30 per cent over the past two years. By the end of 1992
unemployment is projected to pass 300,000, over 21 per cent of the labour
force; easily the highest in the EC.
This has prompted one sarcastic commentator to remark that Ireland has 'one
of the most successful unemployed economies in the world.' Two things
explain this ambiguity: Ireland's demographic trends, and its membership of
the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) within the EC.
Although the birth rate has fallen to about 50,000 live births per annum,
from 70,000 10 years ago, there will be no significant reduction in the
number of people entering the labour market until the end of the decade.
Emigration, the traditional escape valve for those unable to find work in
Ireland, has declined from an average 30,000 per year in the late 1980s to
only 1,000 last year - because of recession in the UK and the US.
Meanwhile the government's policy to maintain a strong punt within the ERM
has severely restricted exchequer freedom to borrow and spend. This has had
a deflationary effect on employment and domestic demand, but has created a
stable macro-economic environment, attractive to export-orientated inward
investment. It is that sector which has shown the most dramatic growth in
recent years.
Merchandise exports are expected to be up by 10 per cent this year, while
manufacturing output is predicted to grow by 7 per cent. This impressive
performance is now under threat.
In September sterling abandoned the ERM and floated downwards. Some 32 per
cent of Irish exports are destined for the UK; about 42 percent of imports
are sourced there. The financial markets, having overwhelmed sterling,
turned on the punt, anticipating that the government would be forced into a
devaluation.
The government, however, has held firm. Using its remnant exchange controls
(which are scheduled to be abolished by the end of the year), raising
interest rates by 3 percentage points, and borrowing abroad to rebuild
reserves lost in defending the punt in the first speculative rush in
September, it has managed to throw together a credible defence of the punt.
Upon this the entire edifice of Ireland's economic policy is structured.
Maintaining the punt's link to the DM is Ireland's passport to the
'inner-core' of hard-currency EC states, which may press ahead with plans
for monetary union and a single currency if a two-speed EC eventually
emerges out of the ERM crisis. There is almost unanimous agreement across
Irish political party lines, and between employers' organisations and trade
unions, that to link the fate of the Irish economy to that of sterling and
the UK's ailing economy would be a fatal error.
The question is whether the very high real interest rates now being suffered
by the economy, currently in excess of 11 per cent, will prove more damaging
than sterling's devaluation. Mr Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister
says: 'The real level of interest rate is far too high, and for the
performance of the economy is almost ridiculous . . .if the Germans move (to
lower rates) this side of Christmas, it will allow us to do so as well, but
we will have to live with high interest rates certainly for this quarter.
(Then) in 1993 we would be trying to roll back that 3 per cent increase.'
Mr John Bruton, leader of Fine Gael, the opposition party, accuses the
government of having 'a foreign exchange policy but not an economic policy'.
He is arguing for thorough structural reforms in the economy - a sweeping
reform of the tax legislation which currently encourages capital-intensive
investment but discourages labour-intensive investment. High national
insurance contributions should be reduced and income tax bands widened to
encourage investment and job creation, he says.
Mr Ahern has a worried eye on next year's budget. This year the target of an
exchequer borrowing requirement of IPounds 590m, or 2.4 per cent, looks
likely to be met. Next year a 9 per cent rise in the public sector wage bill
is already locked in through outstanding agreements with the unions. This
leaves stark choices: either to abandon the convergence criteria for EC
monetary union, or implement significant spending cuts in public services.
With a general election looming, neither one of these is a politically soft
option.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Survey of Ireland (2): Cork is fighting back / A look at the
second city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DES O'SULLIVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the Culliton review group on industrial policy looked at Irish ports it
found serious problems, expressed concern about competitiveness and
recommended action. But the group bypassed Cork altogether - although the
republic's second city has Ireland's most successful port.
Complaints about being ignored are often dismissed as typical of the 'second
city' syndrome. Yet the proposed designation of Cork as a Europort is a
political football which has been kicked around fruitlessly for years. Just
as there is an urgent need to improve the Cork-Dublin road, so there is a
priority need, too, to improve the route from Dublin to Rosslare, Cork's
competitor port.
The view that Cork loses out to centralised decision-making in Dublin
(particularly during the years when Charles Haughey led the Irish
government) is widespread. Father Donal Linehan, parish priest of Mayfield,
on Cork's poorer north side, is alarmed about large concentrations of people
outside the labour force, and believes that for over 20 years the north side
in particular has not benefited from national growth.
Cork has lost its traditional industry base over the past 10 years. It is
fighting back by capitalising on natural advantages such as Cork harbour,
and the availability of a technically advanced and skilled young labour
force. The Cork economy is heavily influenced by agriculture, but the 10 per
cent increase in farm incomes this year is not matched by hopes of important
expansion in 1993. This year the harvest was poor.
High interest rates have brought widespread uncertainty, and consumers are
not spending. 'A lot of people are just being very cautious,' observes
George Mansfield, Allied Irish Bank's regional manager. 'But there have been
quite a number of property deals, indicating confidence in the future.'
Unemployment - intractable even in the good years - remains the big problem.
The urgent need to deliver jobs fuelled local suspicions that chemical
industries looking for new locations were pushing against an open door.
Environmentalists lined up against industrialists during long public
planning inquiries into a Merrell Dow proposal to build a factory on a
greenfield site in east Cork, and the Sandoz plan to invest in Ireland's
most expensive chemical plant at Ringaskiddy.
Merrell Dow retains its planning permission but decided not to proceed. The
Sandoz fire at Basle in 1986, which created an environmental disaster on the
Rhine, contributed to an enormous negative public response when the Cork
plant was first mooted. Sandoz mentioned Puerto Rico as an alternative
location. Eventually planning permission was granted under conditions as
rigorous as in Germany or Switzerland.
Sandoz received 5,000 job applications on the basis of a plan which, if
implemented, will ultimately employ 400 people. One advertisement for 40
operatives drew 1,800 applications. Sandoz is a company which the Cork
Environmental Alliance (CEA) - which operates entirely on public support,
with just one full-time staffer - continues to view with deep suspicion.
Yet even here there is a sensitivity about the lack of jobs. 'We would like
to see Ireland move in the direction of more jobs because of our
environment, not in spite of it,' says Geraldine O'Brien of the CEA. 'We are
not satisfied with the standards. Factories are not meant to produce smells.
When they do the rate of prosecution is laughable - and the fines imposed
are peanuts.'
There is a shortage of research and information on the challenges to human
health and the environment posed by the chemical industry in the Cork
harbour area. 'We have laws and they are not enforced,' Ms O'Brien
complains.
Seven of the world's top 15 pharmaceutical companies now have operations
centred in Cork or Munster. Most of these plants produce bulk chemicals for
export (valued in 1991 at IrPounds 750-IrPounds 800m).
Mr Neil Buckley, director-general of the Federation of Irish Chemical
Industries, points out that while the industry was establishing itself not
one company closed down. 'The overall net picture is one of consistent
growth in output and employment.'
Other important newcomers are the computer and electronics industries. Apple
Computers has its European manufacturing base in Cork. With over 1,000
people on the payroll, it is now the city's largest employer.
There were shockwaves this year when Apple suggested that it might move
printed circuit board manufacture to the far east. Cork's advantages in
terms of just-in-time delivery and flexibility in manufacturing in a variety
of languages averted the risk.
The long-awaited decentralisation of the Central Statistics Office from
Dublin to Cork, scheduled for next year, will be a significant move locally.
The Industrial Development Authority (IDA) is anticipating the arrival of a
Taiwanese electronics park at Ringaskiddy. Taiwan does not yet have a
foothold in Europe, so this is a pioneering proposal. There was a hold-up in
the granting of planning permission because of one objector, but this has
now been resolved.
The Gulf war reduced the number of visits from industrialists last year and,
according to Barry Condron, the IDA regional director, its effects are still
being felt. Visits undertaken by companies seeking a base in Europe show an
increase this year, but decisions are likely to be delayed until there is an
improvement in the market.
Cork port benefited from strike problems at Dublin, but it has proved that
it can attract shippers on its own merits. Free of industrial strife for the
past 10 years, important rationalisation and investment programmes have made
the port competitive and efficient. In the first nine months of this year,
shipments topped 4.88m tonnes. Port authorities confidently expect a
record-breaking 6.5m tonnes by the end of 1992.
Brittany Ferries and Irish Ferries will each increase sailings next year,
with services to Roskoff, St Malo, Cherbourg and Le Havre. This reflects the
fact that more and more Europeans view Cork as the gateway to the west of
Ireland - and road networks to the west are improving fast. Services will
continue to improve, and in the next five years Cork port is planning
investments in 12 projects worth over IrPounds 50m.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts surge on relief at Maastricht vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK government bonds surged yesterday, gaining more than a point at the long
end on relief at the government's narrow victory in Wednesday night's
Maastricht debate and hopes of a cut in interest rates.
In spite of the government's narrow majority, the gilt market rallied
strongly, reversing the losses seen in the days ahead of the Maastricht
debate.
Dealers noted strong demand from overseas buyers.
The Liffe gilt future rallied from 100.10 to 101.16, although volume in the
contract was relatively low at just over 25,000 contracts.
In the cash market, the 9 per cent gilt due 2008 rallied from its opening of
102 5/32 to 103 7/16 by late afternoon.
At the short end, the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 rose from 105 9/32 to 105
7/16 .
THE German yield curve steepened further yesterday as dealers reported
strong demand for medium-dated issues.
On the DTB, the December Bobl future rose to 95.97 from 95.81, reflecting
the demand for medium-dated notes.
Dealers said that some European central banks - which have succeeded in
replenishing their reserves following the September currency crisis - have
started to buy medium-dated notes again.
However, long-dated bunds were little changed on the day, with the Liffe
December Bund futures contract trading at 91.33, down 0.02 points from
Wednesday's close.
Elsewhere in Europe, short-dated French government bonds rose on hopes of
further interest rate cuts.
The long end of the market closed little changed after yesterday's auction
of OATs.
The French Treasury sold FFr10bn of 8 1/2 per cent bonds due 2003, and
FFr4.5 bn of 8 1/2 per cent bonds, due 2008.
Demand for the issues was 'reasonably healthy', according to one dealer.
The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2003 ended at 8.10 per cent against
an opening of 8.09 per cent.
JAPANESE government bonds ended slightly weaker on profit-taking, with the
December futures contract slipping from 107.52 to close at 107.46.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 JGB moved in a range of 4.685-4.71 per
cent, and ended Tokyo trading at 4.7 per cent. The Finance Ministry offered
Y300bn of 20-year bonds at auction with a coupon of 5.7 per cent, up from
5.6 per cent for the previous issue. The average yield at the auction was
5.7 per cent.
AFTER an unexpected fall in jobless claims, US Treasury prices see-sawed in
light trading yesterday as dealers and investors awaited this morning's
important employment data.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  5/32 at 94
27/32 , yielding 7.686 per cent. The two-year note was slightly firmer, up
1/32 at 99 23/32 , yielding 4.383 per cent.
Prices, especially at the long end, fell in early trading after the Labor
Department announced that initial claims for state unemployment insurance
fell 16,000 in the week ending October 24. The drop was bigger than
expected, and left the market even more uncertain about today's employment
report for October.
After recovering around midday, Treasuries fell back later in the afternoon
as players positioned themselves for this morning's employment news.

FT  06 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: UK government auctions
privatised companies' debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE auction of debt owed by companies privatised by the British government
is set for November 19, with the results due to be announced on November 20.
The total amount of debt available at the auction totals Pounds 3.7bn
(Dollars 5.73bn), consisting of Pounds 1.69bn of BT debt and Pounds 2.05bn
of electricity companies' debt.
The Treasury has increased the cash value of bids it plans to accept from
Pounds 1bn to Pounds 1.25bn, as a result of strong interest from both the
privatised companies and third parties.
Proceeds will be received by the Treasury on December 15.
Bids will be made on a yield basis, expressed as margins over specified gilt
issues.
The disposal, which is part of the Treasury's plans to raise Pounds 8bn from
privatisations this year, had been scheduled to proceed at the beginning of
October, when potential buyers were to register their interest.
BT has undertaken that it will bid for a minimum of Pounds 750m of its debt.
A BT Treasury official said that the company would be able to repay that
amount of debt out of its cash holdings without needing to seek fresh
financing.
However, a total of Pounds 700m of debt falls due in the first quarter of
next year, ahead of BT's financial year-end in March.
If BT bids successfully for Pounds 750m, then it is likely that the company
will need to seek refinancing for some of that debt, the official said.
In that case, the company would seek to secure long-term funding, in order
to prevent any potential bunching of debt.
However, the official added that plans to sell the company's 22 per cent
stake in McCaw Cellular Communications to American Telegraph &amp; Telephone
might provide BT with further cash, thus reducing financing needs.

FT  06 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Demand for franc tempts French
borrowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH borrowers are queueing up to take advantage of the international
demand for their own currency.
Three issuers tapped the market yesterday for a total of FFr3.1bn to be
distributed abroad.
Societe Generale led the biggest franc issue of the day for itself, a
FFr1.5bn 10-year 8.5 per cent straight bond.
Rival banks said the spread of 55 basis points over OATs was not
over-generous, when compared with the 50 basis points spread paid by Banque
Nationale de Paris on its FFr1.5bn five-year issue two weeks ago.
Credit Commercial de France added to the small pool of French reverse
floating-rate notes with a self-led FFr600m five-year issue. CCF said sales
of the note would benefit from expected cuts in French franc interest rates.
The coupon is 9 per cent for the first year, then 22.85 per cent minus twice
six-month Paris interbank offer rate.
Corporate borrowers are also eager to borrow at the best rates available for
several years.
Rhone-Poulenc is paying 71 basis points over OATs for FFr1bn on a seven-year
straight bond, also arranged by CCF.
In US dollars, two more issues were launched using the collared floater
structure, which is seen as by far the most aggressive way of securing
sub-Libor funding.
The Kingdom of Norway, which has apparently been trying to get into the
international capital markets since missing the Ecu boat in the summer, is
raising Dollars 200m towards its public sector borrowing requirement.
Its 10-year bond pays a coupon of 25 basis points below six-month Libor,
subject to a minimum of 5 per cent and a maximum 8 1/2 per cent. Kidder
Peabody is lead manager.
Unlike Sweden and Finland, which have been active in the international
markets, Norway escaped the recent currency traumas.
The Dollars 50m eight-year issue for Bank Austria, led by Lehman Brothers
and offering a minimum coupon of 5 per cent, maximum of 10 per cent, was
thought to be expensive for a re-opening of an existing issue.
In guilders, SBC Nederland said the two deals it launched were aimed at
quite different markets. LKB Finance's tightly-priced Fl 200m five-year bond
is aimed at the international market while SudwestLB's Fl 250m 10-year issue
met far more domestic Dutch demand.
Shell Oil has had its triple-A credit rating slashed by Moody's Investors
Service, the US agency, affecting some Dollars 3bn of long-term debt.
The agency's action leaves Shell two notches lower on the ratings ladder, at
Aa2, though the company retains its triple-A classification from Standard &amp;
Poor's.

FT  06 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Mexico to tighten rules on
banks' borrowings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican authorities will act to prevent the country's newly-privatised
banks from side-stepping central bank regulations aimed at limiting the
build-up of their foreign currency debts.
Measures introduced last year limit Mexican banks' foreign currency
borrowings to 10 per cent of total liabilities.
However, banks have issued peso-denominated debt instruments carrying
clauses which promise to cover the holder against the risk of a devaluation
against the dollar.
Authorities estimate the banks have issued about Dollars 5bn of such debt
instruments abroad, usually in maturities of three to six months.
'This is something we do not like at all,' said a government official.
'We would like to put a cap on this amount and see a gradual liquidation,'
he added.
Last year's measures were aimed at curbing the highly-profitable practice by
Mexican banks of borrowing in dollars at relatively low interest rates and
lending on the funds in pesos at much higher interest rates. This exposes
the banks to potential currency losses.
Banks face Bank of Mexico limits on their dollar exposure of around Dollars
20bn.
The new instruments evade the regulations by being nominally denominated in
pesos, even though they present the same risk as dollar instruments in case
of unexpected devaluation.
Mexican banks are also under acute pressure to meet international capital
requirements that come into force at the start of next year.
These require banks to have capital equivalent to 8 per cent of their
liabilities, adjusted for risk.
A government official said that some banks would not be able to meet that
limit by January. However, he added that 'some tolerance will be shown' if
banks are moving towards meeting the requirements.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Survey of Ireland (4): Yes, we have bananas - Joe Gill notes
some important changes in the food industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE GILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVERSEAS fund managers might be surprised by what markets and investments in
the Irish food sector could expose them to.
One Irish company operates at the leading edge of food ingredients'
technology in the US. Another handles one in every three bananas in Britain,
and will shortly handle most the supplies for Sweden's largest banana
importer. Yet another manufactures processed cheese used for over half of
all cheeseburgers in leading UK fast food chains.
Common market agricultural reforms since 1984, privatisation, and a hectic
programme of mergers and acquisitions have transformed the scale and
structure of the food sector.
Many companies have moved to the stock market as a source of funding for
their expansion. Chief among these are the farmer-controlled co-operatives
which have dominated Irish agribusiness in the past. Prior to 1986, none of
them considered the stock market as a viable funding option.
Thanks to the development of a co-op/plc hybrid structure - which was a
first in the world co-operative movement - no fewer than five co-ops have
now adopted plc status. These companies - Avonmore, Golden Vale, IAWS,
Kerry, and Waterford Foods - form the core of the quoted food sector, which
has a combined market capitalisation of IPounds 1.4bn.
Overall, the sector represents 33 per cent of the Irish industrial index. By
comparison, as recently as 1986 just three food companies were quoted on the
stock market - with a capitalisation of only IPounds 77m.
The imposition of milk quotas in 1984, under EC common agricultural policy
(CAP) adjustments, acted as a trigger for fundamental change. Faced with a
ceiling on organic growth in their core dairy divisions, food manufacturers
were forced to pursue diversification strategies both at home and abroad.
This led them to the UK and the US, traditionally the stamping ground of
expansion-minded Irish corporates. Acquisitions in these markets, combined
with domestic restructuring, has produced a new breed of Irish food company.
Aside from dairy processing, these corporates have acquired interests in
beef, pigmeat, poultry and animal feed. Their international acquisitions
have been in associated industries. Kerry Group has followed its casein (a
powder formed from skim milk) export trade to the US and acquired
dairy-based food ingredient businesses. Avonmore has bought cheese companies
in both the UK and the US. Waterford has number two position in the northern
England liquid milk market.
The recently agreed overhaul of the CAP is likely to accelerate the trends
of domestic rationalisation and overseas expansion. It will reduce the value
of food products and limit volume growth, a sure recipe for consolidation.
Although Irish farmers will be largely compensated for a fall in farm prices
by direct subsidies, food manufacturers will have to reduce costs and
acquire, if profit growth is to be sustained.
Ireland is highly dependent on agriculture and food processing. It accounts
for 12 per cent of GDP; 24 per cent of exports. Domestic farming is
dominated by the meat and dairy sectors. Together, these represent over 80
per cent of agricultural output.
The quoted food companies have now assumed a leading role in these
industries. Almost 60 per cent of the dairy industry, over half of the
pigmeat sector, and about 30 per cent of beef processing is controlled by
quoted companies. This proportion is likely to grow over the next few years,
as companies continue to expand abroad, and further increase the scale of
their domestic businesses.
Outside the quoted sector, certain co-operatives retain a key role in the
industry. Dairygold, with 20 per cent of the milk pool, also has interests
in beef and pigmeat processing. Bord Bainne, the dairy marketing co-op, owns
the Kerrygold brand and has itself made acquisitions in continental Europe
and the US. In the beef sector the Goodman organisation remains important,
despite its financial difficulties.
Alongside the changes in the co-operative sector, Fyffes, the fruit company,
and Greencore the former state sugar company, have also used the stock
market for funding purposes. Fyffes (formerly Fruit Importers Of Ireland)
now has over 80 per cent of its sales coming from Britain, following the
successful purchase of Fyffes itself.
The future of the food industry is inextricably linked with its performance
outside Ireland. Over 70 per cent of dairy and beef output is dependent on
export markets.
In Britain, effort is largely being directed at building a share of the
own-label food market, with particular emphasis on developing relationships
with the primary multiple retailers. If they can survive the crucible of
food retailing in the UK, probably the most competitive and sophisticated
retail market in the world, Irish companies can expand and succeed
elsewhere.
Historically, Irish agriculture and Irish food companies form both sides of
the same coin. Agribusiness was largely an extension of domestic on-farm
activity. That relationship has now fundamentally changed. While domestic
agriculture remains a key variable in the structure of Irish food companies,
their future is largely dependent on establishing profitable positions in
the international food market.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Survey of Ireland (1): Past and future state - This week's
falling apart of the coalition Government in Dublin is evidence of deeper
rifts within Irish society as a result of the pressures to create a modern
and outward-looking European state. With an election now looming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLITICAL crisis of the past week that has brought about the collapse of
Ireland's coalition government, and precipitated a general election, was not
entirely unforeseen. Superficial strains have been evident in the coalition
for months, but were warning signs that much deeper rifts exist throughout
the country's body-politic.
As 1993 and the Single European Market approaches, Ireland is living the
trauma of a country torn between its past and its future. The traditional
redoubts of power and paternalism - church, state and family business
patriarchs - have in the past year found themselves under assault as never
before, from the media, the courts, outspoken pop stars and disgruntled
shareholders.
The allure of European unity and its perceived promise of a fast road to
affluence has made Europhiles of most of the population: 70 per cent voted
in favour of the Maastricht treaty in the June referendum. Although by no
means all that emanates from Brussels is viewed as desirable, the widespread
wish to create a modern, outward-looking Ireland has meant that, in the
process, a few sacred cows are being goaded in the direction of the
butchers.
At the front of the line is the church's moral authority. 'My father, the
Bishop', said a banner headline in a Dublin tabloid last May, above a
picture of a pudgy teenager who became an overnight celebrity on both sides
of the Atlantic.
The prelate in question was Bishop Eamonn Casey, the Bishop of Galway, who
admit ted to having fathered a son 17 years ago, after his former lover, an
American, decided to go public with her story.
It was a salacious shock for Ireland's staunch Catholic society, accustomed
to the moral strictures of its clergy on the multiple evils of abortion,
divorce, contraception and homosexuality.
Recommending that the clergy cast the beams out of their own eyes, Ms Sinead
O'Connor, the outspoken, shaven-headed Irish singer, one of the avant garde
of rebellious Irish women, last month tore up a photograph of the Pope
during a live television performance in the United States, saying: 'Fight
the real enemy.' There was public and political outrage over a High Court
decision preventing a 14-year-old rape victim from travelling to Britain for
an abortion. The ruling, and its overturning by the Supreme Court, forced
the government into a public commitment to hold a new referendum on the
abortion issue.
If liberal European social and moral standards are weakening the Catholic
church's traditional sway over Irish souls, so are traditional Irish
political and business ethics being called into question.
In the past four months serving and former prime ministers, and members of
their cabinets, have been called to give evidence in the Beef Tribunal, a
parliamentary inquiry into allegations of fraud, malpractice and political
favouritism in the beef industry.
The tribunal has given some insights into the inner workings of Irish
government and its civil service. The public has heard of cabinet meetings
at which no minutes were kept; no civil servants were present; ministers
ignoring expert advice from their own departments; official documents
altered or suppressed to avoid the cancellation of lucrative beef export
contracts. In the event, the tribunal has been the stage upon which the
death throes of the present administration have been acted out.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the present prime minister, when called to the witness
box ten days ago, accused his industry minister - and leader of the junior
coalition party, the Progressive Democrats - Mr Des O'Malley of having been
'dishonest' in his criticisms of Mr Reynolds, when he gave evidence to the
inquiry last June. That precipitated the present political crisis. Mr.
Reynolds was the minister for industry and commerce during the period which
relates to many of the allegations and Mr O'Malley had accused him of 'gross
errors of judgment' in supporting beef exports to Iraq in 1987 and 1988. The
die was thus cast for a collapse of the coalition.
The results of public inquiries into two other scandals - alleged insider
dealing by top executives in two state-run companies - are also expected in
the coming months.
Mr John Bruton, the leader of Fine Gael, the main opposition party, says: 'I
think the tribunal will have a cathartic effect and will clean up Irish
politics definitively. Corruption or the suspicion of corruption is most
corrosive to any economy. Regardless of any findings, it will have had a
very good effect in improving the probity of public life. It will have
chastened politicians and civil servants such that they will in future be
very wary of doing anything untoward.'
The various inquiries have also added impetus to the pressure for changes in
corporate management. The accountancy profession is about to introduce new
guidelines and standards to close loopholes which have been exploited in the
past by unscrupulous businessmen. Institutional fund managers and stock
exchange officials have raised their voices in recent weeks to call for a
greater onus of responsibility to be placed on non-executive directors.
The image of Irish business practice has not been helped by the succession
of scandals; nor has the image of Ireland itself been aided by the
continuing trouble in Northern Ireland. Peace talks, in meetings involving
the British and Irish governments and the four main constitutional parties
in Northern Ireland, have been going on since last April in an effort to
find a solution to the 70-year-old conflict.
The talks are on the verge of collapse because of the rival and incompatible
constitutional claims to the province. The Unionists from Northern Ireland
want the Republic to hold a referendum which would abolish or amend Articles
II and III of the Irish constitution, the basis of the Republic's
territorial claim on the North.
The Unionists have threatened to walk out of the talks if there is no
commitment by the Irish government to a referendum by the date set for the
next Anglo-Irish Conference meeting - just ten days away, on November 16.
Opposition parties in the Republic have called on the government to show
flexibility in order not to lose what is, they say, an historic opportunity
for peace. The talks are expected to wind up today with perhaps nothing more
than a vague promise to return to the negotiating table some time in the New
Year.
Two referendums the government has committed itself to are those on abortion
and divorce. Later this month voters will be asked whether they want
constitutional changes to permit limited abortion in Ireland in cases of a
life-threatening, as opposed to a health-threatening, risk to the mother.
The convoluted wording of the referendum text, designed to appease both
anti-abortion and pro-choice lobbies and aimed at winning a cross-party
consensus, has failed to achieve any of these objectives.
Even the erstwhile junior partners in Ireland's coalition government, the
Progressive Democrats have expressed deep reservations. Womens' health
should not be discriminated against, opponents of the wording say. The
government argues that if a distinction is not made it will open to the door
to abortion on demand.
The planned divorce referendum has now been pre-empted by the general
election and is unlikely to be held before the second half of next year. But
the potent brew of abortion, Northern Ireland, the Beef Tribunal and
deepening concerns over the government's ability to maintain its foreign
exchange policy - and hence its economic policy - will provide plenty of
ammunition for what is likely to be one of the most bitter election
campaigns for some time.
Mr Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, recently reorganised his shadow cabinet in
preparation for such an eventuality. He said: 'We have had to work on the
assumption that we needed to be ready for an election at any time.'
Whether Fine Gael could do better remains to be seen, but for the sake of
change the electorate might be willing to give it a try. If traditional
values are coming under heavy fire there is no reason to assume that
traditional party loyalties should remain sacrosanct.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Somali gunmen hold aid agencies to ransom as thousands
starve to death - Protection rackets that are immobilising UN relief efforts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SADDYR OMAR sits behind his chicken-wire grill in war-blasted Mogadishu's
bustling gun-bazaar chewing qat, Somalia's war-drug. In one hand he holds
stems of the leafy narcotic stimulant and in the other he plays with a
Chinese-made grenade.
To a group of gunmen gathered around his stall, Saddyr is boasting that he
can get FN rifles used by the 500 United Nations Pakistani troops who have
been sitting idle in their camp in Mogadishu for the past six weeks.
'And for another 200,000 shillings I get you a Pakistani - dead or alive,'
he jokes to the crowd's stoned amusement.
Contempt by Somalia's brutal bandits and gunmen for the UN operation in
Somalia (Unosom) threatens Africa's largest relief effort, which is
increasingly paralysed and falling victim to an obscene protection racket.
Blackmail, threats and extortion made by Mafia-style warlords have defeated
intensive efforts to help Somalia's civilians dying from malnutrition. Eight
months after the UN started a serious relief effort the balance sheet of
achievement is poor. Death rates from starvation remain extremely high,
looting and banditry continue and little progress has been made by the UN
towards political reconciliation of the warring factions.
A handful of power-hungry, greedy warlords, led by Gen Mohamed Farrar
Aideed, continue to hold the international aid community to ransom in their
effort to save Somali lives. The UN estimates 250,000 more people could die
before the end of the year.
'The warlords don't give a damn about their people,' said one aid boss who
feared to be identified. 'They see us as weak and just keep vetoing our
efforts and grabbing loot. If it wasn't for them we could sort out the
humanitarian situation in Somalia in two months.'
The central problem facing the relief effort remains lack of security - the
inability of agencies to deliver food to those most in need in the face of
banditry, looting, violence and inter-clan rivalry for UN resources.
The 500 Pakistani troops in Mogadishu, whose mission was to help increase
security, particularly at the port and international airport, remain holed
up in the bombed-out buildings of the former naval headquarters in the sand
dunes north of the airport.
'The more they do nothing, the more the Somali gunmen think they will do
nothing and treat the UN with derision,' said one aid worker.
Conditions have deteriorated significantly since the forced resignation last
month of Mr Mohamed Sahnoun, the UN special envoy for Somalia, who was
widely credited for what little progress the UN had achieved. Mr Sahnoun was
obliged to resign following his outspoken criticism of the record in Somalia
of UN agencies such as the World Food Programme, United Nations Development
Programme and Food and Agriculture Organisation.
Mr Sahnoun's resignation has left Unosom rudderless at a critical time and
has raised fears among UN personnel in Mogadishu that they do not have the
full support or confidence of New York.
'Sahnoun's resignation is a disaster for Somalia and for the reputation of
the UN,' said Ms Rakiya Omar, executive director of Africa Watch.
Since Mr Sahnoun's departure, hostility by Somalia's gunmen towards the UN
has increased.
This week a gunman with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher hijacked a UN
aircraft.
Gen Aideed warned last week of 'fierce confrontation and bloodshed' if the
UN tried to deploy more troops.
He has also ordered the expulsion of two senior relief experts, threatened
the expulsion of four others, and encouraged gunmen imposed on relief
agencies and Somali workers to strike for better pay and conditions.
Twelve supplementary feeding centres run by Save the Children Fund in
Mogadishu have been paralysed by the strike action.
The general has also begun backtracking on an agreement he signed with Mr
Sahnoun on the deployment of the 500 Pakistani troops.
Originally, he agreed that the UN troops could be deployed at the port with
500 local Somali guards - to be given one uniform each and under the command
of the UN. Now he is insisting on 2,000 Somali guards, with three uniforms
each and under their own chain of command.
Similarly, the UN has been unable to deploy troops at the international
airport, which has been closed for five weeks, as rival clan gunmen dispute
who should control it and take the exorbitant landing fees imposed on the
relief operation.
The UN has been forced to divert air operations to a private dirt airstrip
50km south of Mogadishu established by the qat merchants for importing the
drug by air from Kenya.
Although progress has been made in lowering the death rate in Mogadishu and
other towns, such as Baidoa, the vulnerability of the relief operation to
continued insecurity has been most powerfully exposed in Bardere, a town
200km from the capital. Three weeks ago the town was retaken by Darod clan
forces loyal to former dictator Siad Barre. In the immediate vacuum
afterwards the death rate soared from 20 a day to over 200.
As the UN looks increasingly crippled and directionless extortion by Somali
thugs and bandits masquerading as legitimate political entities has
increased. Already, aid agencies are forced to employ security guards and
'technicals' - Mad Max-style customised Somali vehicles with mounted heavy
machine-guns. The average cost of each technical, with about six qat-chewing
gunmen per vehicle, is Dollars 200 a day. Aid agencies and the UN are
warned: if you don't employ us we can't guarantee your security.
Similarly, Gen Aideed warned aid workers returning to restart feeding
centres in Bardere after the fall of the town that if they went, they did so
at their own risk.
Even greater extortion is being exerted by gunmen on aid agencies through
the control of strategic assets such as the port and airport. Fees for
aircraft landing or port clearance are among the highest in the world.
A UN water project was held up for four months recently because the clan
family controlling the Afgoi well field demanded exorbitant compensation for
protecting the assets during war. Eventually the UN caved in and agreed to
employ all the members of the extended family in the rehabilitation project.
'They are holding us to ransom, screwing us all over the place, upping the
charges and fees and we have to keep paying them off if we want to carry on
working here,' said one head of an aid agency. 'The problem with this type
of blackmail is we can't call their bluff because it would be unacceptable
to pull out when people are dying.'

DOMTAR, the Canadian forest products, building materials and packaging
group, reduced losses in the third quarter with higher shipments, lower
operating costs and a lower Canadian dollar.
Most of Domtar's pulp and paper is exported to the US while it operates a
large US gypsum wallboard business. A lower dollar increases Domtar's
exchange gains.
The loss was CDollars 32m (USDollars 25.67m), or 26 cents a share, against a
loss of CDollars 39m, or 43 cents, a year earlier, on sales of Dollars 482m,
up 6 per cent.
Fine paper sales were stable and sales of market pulp and groundwood papers
were up 15 per cent. Packaging results were little changed.
Building materials sales rose 13 per cent but wallboard prices were weak.
Domtar's nine months' loss was CDollars 117m, or CDollars 1.02 a share,
against a loss of CDollars 104m, or CDollars 1.22, a year earlier. The first
quarter this year was the worst. Nine months' sales were up 3 per cent
overall to CDollars 1.4bn.

amalgamate
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE reliance of derivatives traders on a small number of large software
suppliers is likely to grow, following the latest amalgamation of software
houses announced yesterday.
Devon Systems International, one of the biggest software suppliers in the
derivatives industry, has extended its reach into continental European
capital markets through the purchase of the Swedish suppliers Front Capital
Systems and Prosoftia. Front has supplied trading and risk management
systems to around 50 banks on the continent.
Devon's parent, SunGard Data Systems, is paying Dollars 16m for all the
common stock of A. J. L. Holding, which owns the two companies.
Devon, which claims 650 clients around the world, said that the move would
not lead to less choice for derivatives traders. 'We believe it is a bad
decision to remove choice from banks,' Mr Patrick Brazel of Devon in London
said. Front's software for traders on DTB and Soffex, the German and Swiss
derivatives markets, has been in competition with a rival product from
Devon.
Mr Brazel added that Front's main product, Optas, would provide Devon with a
front-office trading and risk management system for equity derivatives,
extending its range of services into potentially 'the hottest area in
derivatives at the moment.'

<TEXT>
DU PONT, the leading US chemicals group, said yesterday it would stop making
payments to horticultural growers who claimed its Benlate DF fungicide had
damaged their crops.
The company, which last year took a Dollars 215m after-tax charge because of
such claims, said yesterday it had paid more than Dollars 470m in claims
from ornamental plant and fruit growers since Benlate was withdrawn from the
market in 1991.
Du Pont claimed yesterday that its own studies showed the Benlate fungicide
did not cause the crop damage. Based on these findings, the company said it
would no longer pay any claims.
The company said it had initially begun paying Benlate-related claims
because its scientists believed at the time there was a high probability
that the fungicide would eventually be shown to have contributed to plant
damage.

retirement from IBM
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of IBM's top four executives, Mr Terry R. Lautenbach, said last night
that he would retire early, AP-DJ reports. He is at present
a senior vice-president of the computer-maker, and one of four members of
IBM's management committee, its top policy-setting body.
Mr Lautenbach, aged 54, said he had made it known for some time that he
wanted to retire when he turns 55 next August.
He said he decided to bring forward he move up his departure to November 30,
in part because the company's cost-cutting programme, which he helped
oversee, was going better than expected.
His departure is not expected to have any impact on possible successors to
IBM's chairman Mr John F. Akers, who plans to retire when he turns 60 in two
years' time.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S government yesterday stepped up pressure on workers to ignore a
general strike called for Monday by the CGT trade union confederation. It
took out full-page newspaper advertisements saying: 'The country is
advancing. The November 9 general strike is a step back.'
Recognising the right to strike, the government demanded the unions also
recognise the 'rights of the rest of the population'.
The governing Peronist party, which has close links to the union movement,
said the strike had 'ulterior political ends'. President Carlos Menem
promised to ensure basic services such as health, transport, energy and
banking services.
Previous threats by the weak and divided unions to call a general strike
have failed in the face of a determined and aggressive government that has
systematically eroded their privileges. The most hated of the government's
measures is a decree linking wage rises to productivity increases, rather
than inflation. The inflation rate now stands at 20 per cent a year, while
wage increases trail far behind.
However, falling real wages and government attempts to reform rigid labour
laws and wrest some Dollars 5bn in welfare funds from the union leadership
have galvanised them into organising the first general strike against Mr
Menem's government, after staging 13 stoppages against the previous Radical
government of Raul Alfonsn.
Nonetheless, Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, is determined to force
labour legislation through Congress, to improve industry's international
competitiveness. Economists say Congress must approve the reforms by early
1993.

FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Fitch has no explanation for continued
share fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FITCH, the design consultant, said yesterday it was at a loss as to why its
share price was continuing to fall.
While the company was being financially restructured, the shares were
suspended at 41p until October 19. Relisted, they rose from 16p to 20p on
October 20. But as recently as Wednesday they stood at 15p, dropping to
close at 8 1/2 p. Yesterday they fell to 6p before rallying to 8p.
Mr Christopher Thomson, chief operating officer, said that the restructure
had been successful - 35 per cent of the equity was now controlled by Brand
Trust, a company led by Mr Jean-Francois Bentz and Mr Bernard Roux, two
former executives of the French RSCG advertising agency, and 25 per cent by
Sir Terence Conran, founder of the Habitat group and one-time chairman of
Storehouse. Fitch gained Pounds 2.5m through the subscription.
On October 15 RSCG failed to obtain a court injunction to prevent Sir
Terence investing in Fitch, though he undertook not to take an active role
until his consultancy period with RSCG expired on July 2 1993.
Mr Thomson said that he had no idea who was selling, but added that it was a
thin market. Earlier he had said he thought it was no-one connected with the
company.

FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Harmony rebels hit out at board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INCREASINGLY hostile battle for control of Harmony Leisure, the
loss-making pubs and restaurants group, reached a a new pitch yesterday when
rebel shareholders accused the board of financial incompetence and
defamatory tactics.
Launching their strategy to revive the company, the dissidents said they
would reverse the slide in Harmony's performance marked by accumulated
losses of Pounds 6.9m over the past three years.
Mr Andrew Martyr, leader of the rebel group, dismissed management
allegations that the dissidents had misled shareholders about their former
directorships and lack of experience.
Harmony was behaving like President Bush's failed campaign team and 'the
board has resorted to personal attacks and innuendo to stave off defeat,' he
said.
The rebel leaders, who hope to oust the board at an extraordinary meeting
later this month, claim 36 per cent support for their restructuring plans.
The board has rejected the rebel plans as 'opportunistic' and urged
shareholders to back the current management team.
Mr Martyr, however, warned that failure to unseat the board could result in
Harmony being absorbed by a larger group, leaving shareholders facing
considerable losses.
'The board has proved itself incapable of taking the action necessary to
rescue Harmony,' he said.

first-half reverse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER sales and an adverse tax adjustment contributed to a fall in
first-half attributable earnings of 15 per cent at Amcoal, South Africa's
largest coal group and the coal arm of the Anglo American Corporation.
But the dividend was maintained at 150 cents a share, despite the fall in
per-share earnings to 537 cents from 632 cents.
Sales of coal and coke fell by 2 per cent to 20.74m tonnes from 21.2m
tonnes. Export sales were 9 per cent higher at 5.16m tonnes compared with
4.74m tonnes, but sales in the domestic market were lower.
Export profitability was lower as weaker dollar prices offset the benefits
of increased volumes and a weaker rand/dollar exchange rate, while colliery
working costs were kept below the inflation rate.
Operating profits fell by 6.6 per cent to R202.7m (Dollars 69.8m) from
R217m, although turnover rose to R952.7m from R948.9m. Attributable earnings
emerged at R135.2m compared with R159m. This resulted from lower interest
and investment income - a function of higher capital expenditure and lower
interest rates - and a fall in the favourable adjustment to the previous
year's deferred tax benefits, arising from a lower rate of tax.
Mr David Rankin, chairman, said Amcoal's operations were likely to remain at
the same level in the second half despite the weak domestic economy.
He said the combination of increased volumes and the rand/dollar exchange
rate should ensure second-half earnings similar to those just reported.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Amnesty offered to Lloyd's Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London made a sharp turn in policy yesterday by offering a
six-month amnesty to Names who have refused to make good their debts to the
insurance market.
The move contradicts Lloyd's determination until now to pursue with legal
action any outstanding debts from Names, the individuals whose assets
underwrite the market.
It follows assessments showing that less than Pounds 10m will be foregone as
a result of the amnesty, and comes after an intensive series of meetings
with politicians and distressed Names over the difficulties of repayment.
It also appears to mark a change in approach following the appointment in
September of Mr Peter Middleton as chief executive of Lloyd's. Mr Middleton
said the decision had been taken because 'the sums involved are so small and
the action will be of such huge benefit'.
But Mr Tom Benyon, chairman of the Society of Names, called the action 'a
very cynical operation' which would sever funding to legal action being
taken by Names already served with writs. The outcome of their cases will
apply to all Names.
Lloyd's will also allow Names' action groups to have access to full lists of
members of syndicates for the first time so they can contact each other.
Mr Paul Marland, Conservative MP for West Gloucestershire and a Lloyd's
Name, said he was 'very, very pleased' by the announcement.
Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, said
action groups may call off legal action against Lloyd's: 'If these proposals
turn into concrete ones then we will obviously tone down and stop our
actions.'
At least two Names - one in Wales and one in Canada - have committed suicide
in the past few weeks after apparently being unable to cope with cash calls
 -requests by their agents to cover underwriting losses.
Yesterday's decision could potentially help hundreds of Names who have been
unable or have refused to meet cash calls for the 1990 and 1991 underwriting
years, but it will do nothing for the 194 Names who have already been issued
with writs.
When Names refuse to pay cash calls, Lloyd's issues a letter establishing
that they have a legal debt. After 28 days, it follows this with a writ.
Some 3,500 letters were sent out in October.
It will now issue no further writs until April.

FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Wm Low picks up in second half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WM LOW, the Dundee-based food retailer, yesterday reported a 12.5 per cent
fall in profits, but said problems which led to a poor first half had been
overcome.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 23.6m to Pounds 20.6m in the year to
September 5. Most of the decline came in the first half, when profits fell
23 per cent to Pounds 8.82m, because of falling margins and one-off costs.
Mr James Millar, chairman, said: 'This has been a game of two halves. The
first half was a one-off and we've got it out of the system'.
Operating margins, which fell to 3.98 per cent in the first half, partly
because of increased promotional sending, recovered to 5.93 per cent, only
slightly below the comparative period figure of 6.1 per cent.
Turnover increased 9.4 per cent to Pounds 420.1m, mainly due to new store
openings. Five new stores were opened while three neighbourhood branches
were closed, leading to a net gain of 90,000 sq ft. Like-for-like sales
increased 2.7 per cent, about half of which came from inflation.
Depreciation was Pounds 7.8m with capital expenditure - mainly on new stores
 -unchanged at Pounds 44.3m. The expansion programme pushed up net
borrowings to Pounds 37.9m (Pounds 11.3m) with gearing at 24.8 per cent.
A lower than expected tax charge of 17 per cent, due to the release of
unnecessary provisions, could not prevent a fall in fully diluted earnings
per share to 24.92p (27.9p).
The company proposes an unchanged final dividend of 5.7p, to give a
maintained total of 8.4p.
Mr Colin Mitchell, the former managing director who left abruptly in
February, received severance pay of Pounds 223,000. The company said Mr
Philip Spicer, presently national food manager with Co-operative Retail
Services, had been appointed chief executive.
COMMENT
Wm Low's shares gained 15p to 239p yesterday and have now recovered much of
the ground lost following the poor interims. Margins have been restored and
new stores appear to be performing well. But despite the assurance of Mr
Millar's footballing analogy, retailing is a funny old game and Wm Low's
sceptics are still not convinced. Some point to the company's erratic profit
record, and others question whether it can really survive a dual assault on
its Scottish heartland by majors like Sainsbury and discounters like
Shoprite. Forecast profits of Pounds 23m put the shares on just under 9
times, which looks cheap relative to the sector. The shares may go higher,
but long-established reasons for the company's low rating - its size and
store portfolio - are still valid.

FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: US halts production of Tate's sweetener
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES FOR Sucralose, a calorie-free sweetener developed by Tate &amp; Lyle, have
been further deflated by news that production has been halted in the US,
pending regulatory approval.
The US is estimated to account for 85 per cent of the Dollars 1bn (Pounds
600m) a year world market for high intensity sweeteners, led by NutraSweet
from Monsanto, the US chemicals group.
But although Tate and its US partner Johnson &amp; Johnson have spent Pounds
150m in more than 15 years of development, the product is so far only on
sale in Canada, where it gained approval a year ago.
As stocks have piled high enough to satisfy Canadian demand 'for the
foreseeable future' - which one analyst calculated to be four years - two US
plants have been mothballed by J&amp;J. The product is described as 'highly
stable' and so is not expected to go stale.
J&amp;J submitted an application to the US Food and Drugs Administration in
February 1987. The FDA would only say yesterday that the petition was still
under review.
J&amp;J said the length of time taken was 'not really unusual.' Aspartame, the
NutraSweet ingredient, took 10 years.
UK analysts were not expecting Sucralose to contribute yet to Tate's
profits. But some recently downgraded estimates for the year just ended by
about Pounds 8m, to less than Pounds 190m pre-tax, to allow for the
write-off of previously capitalised development spending.
Mr Mark Lynch, at SG Warburg, said the delay in gaining FDA approval did
cause concern in terms of Tate's medium-term earnings prospects.
One analyst said there had been a time when it seemed Sucralose and the fat
substitute Stellar, launched last year, might become star products, like the
blockbuster drugs that help the ratings of pharmaceutical companies.
However, they now seemed insignificant alongside the factors affecting the
main sugar businesses.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Bernie Cornfeld joins bid for MGM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BERNIE CORNFELD, the controversial American mutual funds promoter whose
empire collapsed more than 20 years ago, is hoping to make a comeback today
when he joins in a Dollars 500m (Pounds 324m) cash bid for Hollywood's MGM
film studio.
The 65-year-old Mr Cornfeld said he was joining forces for the bid with Mr
Giovanni Di Stefano, a former business associate of Mr Giancarlo Parretti,
the Italian former owner of MGM.
Mr Di Stefano is locked in several legal battles with Credit Lyonnais, the
French state bank that suffered embarrassment last year when it was revealed
to have loaned Mr Parretti Dollars 1bn for his successful 1990 MGM bid.
The French bank then forced Mr Parretti out of MGM in a US court and last
spring took possession of the once great studio, which is believed to be
making heavy losses.
Mr Di Stefano, who once spent three years in prison in the UK after being
convicted of fraudulent trading, said the Dollars 500m bid would be made
today to the Netherlands branch of Credit Lyonnais.
The proposed takeover vehicle will be a Luxembourg-registered company called
The Lion Group SA, which is more than 50 per cent controlled by Mr Di
Stefano and has, as a minority shareholder, a company controlled by Mr
Cornfeld. The bidders claim to have half the Dollars 500m in cash and the
rest in loans from Italian and German banks.
Mr Cornfeld spent 11 months in a Swiss jail in 1973 accused of fraud in
connection with his Investors Overseas Services (IOS) business. He was
acquitted of the charges in 1979.
Mr Di Stefano said he spoke last week to a senior executive of Credit
Lyonnais and was told 'to come back when the money is lined up'.
But Credit Lyonnais said: 'There has been absolutely no contact with Mr
Cornfeld and Mr Di Stefano. Their statements are unworthy of any comment by
us.'
Mr Cornfeld said he was excited at the prospect of attempting his first
high-profile transaction in 20 years and he and Mr Di Stefano planned to
name themselves as co-chairmen of MGM if the bid succeeds.
'I see this as an opportunity to turn around a major company in the film
business. I'll be active in management,' he said.

FT  06 NOV 92 / People: Scotland takes the high road to attract upmarket
tourists
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the tabloid press in a frenzy over the Prince and Princess of Wales'
failure to exchange glances during their trip to Korea, and the financial
pages wondering whether Hanson will enter a bidding war to take over Ranks
Hovis McDougall, who could blame Michael Shea (above) for opting for a
quieter life as the head of an up-market Scottish tourist initiative?
Now 55, Shea is about to step down as Hanson's head of political and
governmental affairs, although he will remain a political consultant to the
group. Before joining Hanson in 1987, he was the Queen's press secretary.
He has now been appointed chairman of Connoisseurs Scotland, a newly-formed
private company. Backed by Scottish tourism organisations, it aims to market
Scotland abroad as a high-quality destination.
Connoisseurs Scotland's members - which include the Turnberry Hotel, the St
Andrews Old Course Hotel, and the Gleneagles Hotel - have decided to put
their rivalries aside in an attempt to entice more high-spenders to
Scotland.
Shea is already chairman of Scotland in Europe, the public sector body that
helps Scottish companies find continental partners, and is a visiting
professor at the University of Strathclyde's graduate business school.
A former diplomat, and speaker of French, German and Romanian, Shea has
written 14 books, including Influence (or how to work the system) and
Leadership Rules, which explains the role of public relations in the making
of leaders.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Posts to go at chemicals company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRUNNER MOND, the Cheshire-based chemicals company, said yesterday that it
was shedding 400 jobs as part of a cost-cutting programme. The company,
owned by Imperial Chemical Industries until last year, said it hoped to
avoid compulsory redundancies.
The move comes after a 12-month review of the business and follows 200 job
cuts last year. Mr Bob Collicutt, Brunner Mond general manager, said the job
losses would be across all parts of the company. 'It's going to take 12 to
18 months for us to see this change through,' he said.
The latest move will take the workforce down to 650 at Brunner Mond's two
sites making soda ash - used in glass production and several chemical
processes. In 1979 the company employed 3,000 people.
'We are offering very attractive redundancy terms,' said Mr David Wertheim,
who was behind the Pounds 90m buy-out of Brunner Mond from ICI in September
last year.
He said the redundancy terms were 'better than ICI's' and would cost 'many
millions of pounds'.
Mr Collicutt said the company would reorganise its plant operations,
distribution, administration, sales and marketing over the next 18 months.
He said that the reorganisation would involve some extra investment by the
company.
Brunner Mond produces about 1m tonnes of soda ash a year and supplies 90 per
cent of the UK market.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Jailing of editor sought over Arrow jury article
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO High Court judges were asked yesterday to punish the Mail on Sunday for
a 'self-evident' contempt of court in publishing an article in July
disclosing details of the secret deliberations of the Blue Arrow fraud trial
jury.
Mr Philip Havers, appearing for Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, attorney-general, is
seeking a fine against Associated Newspapers, the publisher, and the
imprisonment of Mr Stewart Steven, who was then editor, and of Mr Clive
Wolman, City editor.
Mr Havers said the 1981 Contempt of Court Act stated it was a contempt 'to
obtain, disclose or solicit any particulars' of jury deliberations. Section
8(1) of the act imposed a strict liability in respect of obtaining such
information and there was no restriction upon those to whom the act applied.
Mr Havers said the newspaper's defence relied on article 10 of the European
Convention on Human Rights, which guaranteed the right to freedom of
expression on matters of public importance.
Mr Havers said that on February 14 the Blue Arrow jury convicted four of the
10 original defendants and acquitted one. The other five had already been
acquitted on the direction of the judge.
In July, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeals by the four convicted
defendants.
Mr David Pannick QC, for Associated Newspapers, said the case raised
important legal questions about the scope of freedom of expression in the
context - which was of considerable public importance - of whether serious
fraud trials should be conducted before a jury.
There was no evidence to show that the newspaper had obtained the published
information directly from any jury member. All the evidence was that the
information was provided by jury members to US researchers who then provided
that information to Mr Wolman.
The hearing was adjourned until today.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour relations with Lib Dems
'abysmal'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RELATIONS between Labour and the Liberal Democrats plunged to new depths
yesterday with the parties' public row in Wednesday's Maastricht debate
reducing any chance of an 'anti-Tory' alliance before the next general
election.
One senior Labour official described the relationship between the two
parties as 'abysmal'. He added: 'These people have jumped straight into bed
with the government. We can't work with them.'
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said the Liberal Democrats had
shown 'a high degree of naivety and a low degree of judgment'.
The two parties are taking very different views on the role of opposition
parties. Labour is determined to harry the government relentlessly. But Mr
Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said the opposition's role was 'to
behave as far as possible as it would in government and always put the
national interest first'.
He qualified that, however, by adding: 'Of course we would have liked to
kick this government out, but this is not what was on offer.'
Mr Ashdown said his party's decision to vote with the government had been
essential for the UK's economic future. 'Nobody can ever say that a small
force of Liberal Democrats cannot make any impact on the important things
that happen in this nation,' he said.
He expected a 'short-term downside' to Liberal Democrat electoral fortunes
after the vote, but said the credibility of Mr John Smith, Labour leader,
had suffered long-term damage.
Mr Ashdown did not rule out co-operation with Labour, and Mr Calum
MacDonald, Labour MP for the Western Isles, who still favours some kind of
deal between the parties, said that the events of Wednesday had increased
the need to 'open up lines of communication'.
One similarity between the parties is that both are deliberately being
reticent about the tactics that they will adopt when the Maastricht bill
resumes its progress through the Commons. They fear that outlining these
will help government's business managers. However, it seems the strategies
of the two parties will only occasionally coincide.
Labour's leadership is opposed to a 'guillotine' debate on the bill, and to
a referendum. Liberal Democrats would probably favour both.
Liberal Democrats also put more emphasis on increasing the democratic
accountability of European Community institutions, including the
introduction of proportional representation for the European parliament.
One significant overlap is that both parties back re-instating the social
chapter. Mr Cunningham said that without it, Labour would not vote in favour
of the legislation on its third reading. But the inclusion of the social
chapter is not an issue that would bring a single Tory Euro-sceptic into the
opposition division lobbies.
Moreover, Labour faces internal schisms on Europe. Many of its MPs are
fiercely opposed to Maastricht, but others had to be persuaded to vote
against the government.
Mr Roy Hattersley, former deputy Labour leader and a pro-European MP, warned
on BBC radio yesterday: 'We must not be party to any stratagem employed by
the Euro-sceptics designed to destroy the bill.'
With one exception - Mr Nick Harvey, MP for Devon North - the 20 Liberal
Democrats are likely to remain more or less united.

<TEXT>
IRELAND is to hold a general election in three weeks, following the defeat
of the government on a confidence motion yesterday.
The opposition parties were joined by the Progressive Democrats (PDs), who
had withdrawn from the coalition on Wednesday evening, in voting against the
government on the motion, resulting in its defeat by 88 votes to 77. The
election date will be November 25. An abortion referendum originally
scheduled for December 3 will now be held on the same day.
In yesterday's debate on the confidence motion, unemployment, the recession,
taxation, Northern Ireland and public probity were signalled as issues that
will dominate what will be a brief but intense electoral campaign.
In the first clashes of the campaign, the prime minister, Mr Albert
Reynolds, accused the PDs of undermining his government. He said:
'Coalitions where the junior partner holds the senior one to ransom do not
work with the same cohesion and effectiveness (as single-party
governments).' He claimed that the opposition parties would be unable to
form a stable government and said: 'I believe that single-party, Fianna Fail
government under my leadership can do far more for this country that a
chaotic motley coalition led by deputy Bruton.' Mr John Bruton, the leader
of the main opposition party, Fine Gael, accused Mr Reynolds' party of
having been 'a glitzy soap opera' while in government.
Mr Des O'Malley, the PD leader who was at the centre of the recent coalition
crisis, said he regretted his decision to abandon the coalition, but added:
'The need to give this country the opportunity to choose an effective
government must come first.'
Mr Dick Spring, leader of the Labour party, which may hold the balance of
power in a hung parliament after the election, warned that in any new
coalition 'there will have to be fundamental changes in the present set of
policies on offer from (Fianna Fail and Fine Gael), and a fundamental
commitment to a much higher level of integrity than has been evident up to
now'. His party intends to wage 'an all-out attack on unemployment' which
would be accompanied by 'a judicious and carefully planned increase in our
borrowing capacity' he said.

FT  06 NOV 92 / Survey of Ireland (6): Concern not to over-react / Profile
of Tom Healy, of the Dublin stock exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the Irish stock exchange severs its umbilical cord to the London stock
exchange in about one year's time, responsibility for the market's
regulation will fall largely upon the shoulders of Mr Tom Healy, the Irish
exchange's general manager.
Under planned legislation, the central bank will become the overall
regulator of all financial services, delegating specific tasks, such as
overseeing the stock market, to persons such as Mr Healy.
A graduate in economics from Trinity College, Dublin, he went into public
relations and marketing before entering the financial services sector five
and a half years ago, when he was appointed the exchange's general manager.
Nine months after settling into the job came the 1987 crash. 'Everything
that one had learnt about stock markets up until then had to be relearnt,'
he says. Since then he has travelled widely, visiting stock exchanges
throughout Europe and in places as far-flung as Sri Lanka. He has watched
closely the emerging stock markets in eastern Europe (some promoters of
which have come to Dublin to seek advice).
Turning Dublin into a stand-alone exchange, made necessary by the rapid
development of onscreen and paperless trading in the UK, will now be a
relatively simple task, Mr Healy says. Ireland's plan, in moving into
electronic dealing and settlements, is to aim for demobilisation of paper -
rather than its dematerialisation, as in the UK. This requires fewer legal
changes, but a new independent status vis-a-vis the London exchange.
Mr Healy is emphatic, though, that Dublin's standards will be maintained.
'We will continue to work closely with the regulators in the UK for
technical support and advice, to maintain the standards achieved hitherto.'
Have not the well-publicised series of business scandals in Ireland pointed
to the need for tightening controls? 'We have laws against murder, but
people still commit murder. In the best regulated markets there are still
scandals and failures.'
Mr Healy adds that new standards now being adopted by the accountancy
profession - alongside the 1990 Companies Act, which has outlawed insider
trading - will make it harder for unscrupulous directors and companies to
abuse shareholders and investors. His concern is to avoid an over-reaction
leading to unnecessary restrictions being placed on the market as a whole,
holding back its development.
'The important thing is that price-sensitive information is made available
and out in the open. We must be seen to hit hard at companies that do not
disclose the information that they are obliged to. Directors have to be made
more responsible for the information their companies provide. That is
starting to happen now.'
Mr Healy does not share the scepticism of those who think that business will
shift to London and other financial centres once the EC single market is
completed next year. 'We have effectively been an open market competing
directly with London for the past 20 years. Despite that, 95 per cent of
dealings in Irish company shares are done through the Dublin exchange. That
is a fact that other smaller exchanges in the EC can take encouragement
from.'
More worrying, he says is the prospect of foreign takeover bids swallowing
up one or more of the bigger companies on the Dublin market. The ten top
companies on the exchange account for 75 percent of the market's
capitalisation. 'A takeover of one or more or those would take the heart out
of the market. And we have no major privatisations or a big queue of private
companies waiting to be given a listing,' he says.

FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: R. H. Macy unveils business plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
R. H. MACY, the bankrupt New York-based department store chain, yesterday
unveiled a five-year business plan which, it claims, will 'return it to
profitable growth'.
In a 300-page document, essentially a report to creditors, the retailer's
management outlines plans to cut expenses by as much as Dollars 356m by
1998.
The measures to achieve this would include refocusing advertising and
adjusting the media mix, for a Dollars 91m saving in 1998; reorganising the
selling organisation saving Dollars 77m; cutting other expense categories
saving Dollars 65m; and introducing a single benefit plan for all employees
saving Dollars 123m.
The store group said that the plan did not anticipate any increase in sales
before 1994, and expected comparable store sales to grow from 3 per cent to
6 per cent a year thereafter.
The plan projects that earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation could total about Dollars 811m in 1998, or approximately 9 per
cent of group sales.
Without the measures in the document, Macy claims that the underlying
earnings figure would be about Dollars 213m.
Sears, Roebuck, the troubled US retail and financial services group, said
last night it had won a federal court ruling that would allow it to issue
Visa credit cards, writes Alan Friedman in New York.
The court said Visa had violated federal anti-trust laws by blocking Dean
Witter, the Sears financial services division, from issuing the Visa card.
Visa said it would seek to overturn the verdict and block Sears from issuing
its cards. Sears competes with Visa because it issues its own credit card,
called the Discover card.

FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: US retailers release encouraging
sales figures

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US retailers yesterday unveiled modestly encouraging sales figures for
October. This is the second successive month in which an improvement in high
street sales has been evident, suggesting that a small upturn in the US
consumer confidence may be emerging.
Among the nation's largest retailers, Sears, Roebuck reported a 3.9 per cent
increase in domestic store sales.
At K mart, the picture was similar - with the general merchandise side in
the US showing a 3.3 per cent same-store sales advance, and the specialty
retail division posting a 4.2 per cent improvement.
Both companies were outstripped by Wal-Mart Stores, the aggressive
Arkansas-based group. Wal-Mart, the nation's top-selling retailer, posted a
16 per cent increase in same-store sales in October, and has increased
same-store sales in the first nine months by 16 per cent. Its total sales in
the year so far stand at Dollars 38.4bn, compared with Dollars 30.2bn in the
same period of 1991.
Among the big department store groups, J. C Penney posted a 7.3 per cent
same-store sales gain in its main department store division. Neiman Marcus
produced a 5.7 per cent improvement in like-for-like revenues, while
Federated Department Stores managed a 7.4 per cent improvement.
Some of the specialty store chains appeared to fare less well. The Gap,
which has generally weathered the tough retail climate in good shape, posted
an increase of only 2 per cent in same-store sales last month, while The
Limited managed only 3 per cent. Woolworth fared poorly, with an overall 0.4
per cent decline in domestic same-store sales, but blamed this on heavy
promotion of its athletic footwear in the same period of 1991.
On Wall Street, The Gap fell heavily losing Dollars 3 at Dollars 30 1/8 ,
while The Limited fell by Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 23 5/8 . Sears gained
3/8 at Dollars 42 1/2 , although K mart slipped by Dollars 1 to Dollars 27
1/4 and Wal-Mart eased  1/8 at Dollars 61 7/8.

<TEXT>
THE FAMILY of Lord Thomson of Fleet has sold the bulk of its controlling
interest in Hudson's Bay Company, Canada's biggest department store group
and North America's oldest public company.
Woodbridge, the Thomsons' holding company, said yesterday that it has raised
CDollars 545m (USDollars 439.5m) through the sale to a group of underwriters
of 20m Hudson's Bay shares. The stock will be distributed to investors at a
price of CDollars 27.25 a share, to be paid in two instalments over the next
year.
The sale cuts Woodbridge's stake in HBC from 65 per cent to 25 per cent. The
Thomsons will remain HBC's largest single shareholder for the time being.
They have agreed not to sell their remaining interest for at least a year
without the underwriters' consent.
Woodbridge said the initiative for the sale had come from the underwriting
group and 'senior management decided the price was right'.
The funds will be used to cut debt and augment working capital. Some of the
proceeds will be available for unidentified future investment, though these
are unlikely to be in the retail field.
The present Lord Thomson of Fleet, who prefers to be known simply as Mr Ken
Thomson, is the son of the former proprietor of The Times of London. With
the help of a group of low-profile managers, he has diversified the family
business, which now includes controlling stakes in Thomson Corporation, the
media and travel group, and Markborough Properties, a North American
property company, as well as the stake in Hudson Bay, originally acquired in
1980.
HBC has a colourful history stretching back more than three centuries, when
it was set up by King Charles II as a fur trading enterprise. It now
controls three groups of department stores with revenues last year of just
over CDollars 5bn. But it has had a spotty earnings record, suffering a
CDollars 4.5m loss in the three months to April.
