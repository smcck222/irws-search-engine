FT  04 NOV 92 / Fall-off found in company failures
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of companies passing into receivership or administration last
month fell for the ninth month running compared with the previous year,
according to statistics released yesterday.
The figures from the official London and Edinburgh Gazettes led Touche Ross,
the accountancy firm, to predict that there will be a significant decline in
the rate of medium-size business failures for the full year compared with
1991.
There have been 4,317 failures in the 10 months to October this year, down
12 per cent on the same period last year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH STEEL is considering extending Christmas holidays in its strip
division to reduce production.
It could not say how many workers faced short-time working and extended
Christmas holidays. Market conditions were 'changing all the time' and not
all workers were likely to be affected in the same way.
The corporation said that it would not rule out redundancies although it
emphasised that no final decision had been taken.
It would not to disclose how many of its 3,000 workers at the Llanwern strip
production plant were working 15 shifts a week rather than the usual 21.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Lamont rejects call for royal tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, the Chancellor, last night ruled out taxing the royal
family.
In a written reply to Labour's Mr Jim Cunningham (Coventry SE), Mr Lamont
said he had 'no plans' to extend income tax to members of royalty at present
excluded from paying.
Labour condemned Mr Lamont's response. Mr Dennis Canavan (Falkirk W) said:
'It is a deplorable answer, particularly bearing in mind the fact that the
Queen is one of the richest people in the world.'
Mr Andrew MacKinlay, Labour MP for Thurrock, said: 'This will make a lot of
people angry. It is demonstrably unfair. The Queen ought to pay tax and so
should other members of her family.'
Mr Alan Williams, Labour MP for Swansea West, said: 'The Queen is a
billionaire. Her income from investments is a closely guarded secret. Why
should she pay no tax when her subjects on minuscule incomes are paying
tax?'

FT  04 NOV 92 / MI6 praises Iraq exports case defendant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAUL HENDERSON, the managing director of Matrix Churchill, the
Coventry-based machine-tool makers, passed information about eastern
European affairs to MI6 for more than 10 years before he began spying on
Iraq, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.
Mr Henderson was also praised by his MI6 controller for his bravery in
gathering intelligence on Saddam Hussein's regime.
Mr Henderson is one of three former Matrix Churchill directors who deny
breaching export controls by pretending that machine tools exported to Iraq
in 1987 and 1988 were for civil, not military, purposes.
His MI6 field controller, giving evidence anonymously from behind a screen,
confirmed that Mr Henderson had worked for MI6 from the early 1970s until
the 1983, giving information on commercial contracts behind the Iron
Curtain. He had also been 'reactivated' for such work between 1985 and 1986.
The officer also said Mr Henderson had frequently visited Iraq and gathered
intelligence, knowing Saddam's reputation for ruthlessness and that foreign
agents were particular targets.
Mr Henderson had done so when his business was under pressures.
'There are very few people who would take such risks and take them in their
stride,' the MI6 officer told Mr Geoffrey Robertson QC, for Mr Henderson.
During their meetings, the officer said that Mr Henderson had supplied
information concerning a number of long-range missile projects planned by
the Iraqis. He gave his MI6 controller blueprints relating to a projectile
capable of being fired 1,200 kilometres and said Matrix Churchill had been
approached by the Iraqis to make machine tools for the project, known as
ABA.
A technical report from one of the meetings went to a 'very high'
ministerial level, the officer said.
Questioned by Mr Allan Moses QC, prosecuting, the officer said Mr Henderson
had not told him Matrix Churchill would be carrying out the work on the ABA
project, or that it had a contract to supply the Chilean arms dealers
Industrias Cardoen with bomb fuses destined for Iraq.
In September 1989, Mr Henderson was interviewed by MI6 technical experts at
a 'safe house' a short walk away from the Foreign Office in London.
Afterwards, he expressed concern that the delay in processing his company's
export licences could cost hundreds of jobs at the company. His MI6 contact
told him he would be better off complaining to the Foreign Office and
introduced him to a suitable contact.
The trial continues today.

FT  04 NOV 92 / High road costs criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Transport ends up paying an average of 28 per cent more on
road contracts than the price originally agreed, according to a report
published today by the National Audit Office.
The report catalogues a series of cases where costs have been pushed up for
the department by factors such as unforeseen ground conditions, changes to
designs and outright errors.
In one case a road bridge was designed without enough headroom for trains
passing underneath. The road had to be raised after work on the bridge
started. Total costs resulting from the bungle were Pounds 70,000 for the
extra work.
It also led to a claim of Pounds 350,000 from the contractor for delays and
disruption, and an estimated Pounds 450,000 in the cost of delays to road
users.
The report says the final cost of government road contracts will almost
always be higher than the tender price because civil engineering work is
unpredictable.
The Transport Department accepts the risks of unforeseen alterations rather
than requiring contractors to price for all possible risks.
The audit office, however, says the overruns are much greater than they
should be.
The department set itself a target of reducing average increases from 18 per
cent in 1985-86 to 15 per cent in 1988-89. Instead, the figure rose to 28
per cent and continued at that level in 1990-91.
The audit office says the department has paid close attention to reducing
the risk of collusion between tendering companies and has made substantial
efforts to ensure fair competition.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Plan to curb phone ads for bogus jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUGHER measures to curb the growing practice of advertising bogus jobs via
premium-rate telephone numbers were proposed yesterday by the industry
watchdog.
The Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone
Information Services (ICSTIS) said unemployed people were being encouraged
by unscrupulous operators to call premium-rate numbers at a cost of up to
48p a minute.
The jobs advertised sometimes did not exist, but the advertiser benefited by
receiving more than half the cost of the call. ICSTIS has received an
increasing number of complaints about 'work' services despite a code of
conduct introduced this year to curb such abuses.
A report published yesterday by ICSTIS concluded that work services should
be banned from premium-rate lines unless they were provided directly by a
potential employer rather than through an agent. It added that companies
offending its code of conduct should be fined. ICSTIS would consider a ban
on work services if that did not prevent abuses.
ICSTIS said about 20 companies regularly provide work services. Answering
Services, based in Bracknell, Berks, which was the subject of four
complaints in September alone, refused to comment.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Miners drop case after pits pledge: Unions accept British
Coal's out-of-court offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINERS' UNIONS yesterday called off their High Court attempt to force
British Coal to resume immediate production at 10 pits after receiving
assurances that no pit would become unworkable during consultations.
British Coal management had earlier told lawyers acting for the National
Union of Mineworkers, the Nacods pit supervisors' union and the Union of
Democratic Mineworkers that it would take every step necessary to prevent a
deterioration of coal, faces, roadway, and equipment at pits where
production has ceased in the past three weeks, and would make daily reports
on their conditions available to the unions.
Under the out-of-court agreement, British Coal has stated that it will not
include the cost of resuming production at the pits in estimating their
economic viability.
British Coal has also agreed to give an undertaking that, in considering
redundancies, it will not discriminate against miners opting to remain in
employment during the 90-day consultation period.
Mr Mark Stephens, a solicitor for the NUM, described yesterday's agreement
as a 'major step forward' in union efforts to save the pits.
'We were preparing to go to court because we feared British Coal was
adversely affecting the future economic viability of the pits,' he said. 'We
have stopped British Coal from doing that. We believe these pits are now
redeemable.'
Nevertheless, yesterday's move was the second time in two weeks that the
unions failed to win an assurance from British Coal that miners at the 10
pits would be kept in work.
Union concerns about the future of the pits looked set to be refuelled
yesterday after British Coal confirmed that it had sent out
notice-of-redundancy forms to its 50 collieries in anticipation that
hundreds of miners would apply for voluntary redundancy over the next few
weeks.
British Coal said it was complying with the terms of the Trade Union and
Labour Relations Consolidation Act 1992, under which employers must give
notice to the government and the unions if 100 or more employees are to be
dismissed or made redundant over 90 days or less.
Mr Ken Capstick, the NUM's vice-president said last night: 'The government
and British Coal are deceiving the British people into believing there is
going to be a period of consultation. But they are already in the process of
closing the pits down.'

FORMER MINERS starting their own businesses are to be offered factories and

Helical Bar, the property company which in 1987 acquired the residual assets

yesterday, will be available to any British Coal employees made redundant
since June last year.
Three units at Aycliffe and 21 at Peterlee are on offer. Helical Bar chief

unit on average - to cover insurance and ground maintenance - instead of
Pounds 250.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Coal sales 'may be boosted'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL'S sales to the two big power generators could be 15m tonnes
greater than envisaged under the present pit-closure plans, the former
commercial director said yesterday.
Mr Malcolm Edwards told the Commons trade and industry committee that
British Coal would have to get its price down from Pounds 1.50 to Pounds
1.33 a gigajoule to achieve those sales in the face of competition from
other sources. But British Coal was already aiming to reach that price in
the new five-year contracts being negotiated. These are based on sales of
40m tonnes, falling to 30m over the period.
The other key condition would be measures to prevent the power generators
running down their stocks. Those stood at about 33m tonnes but the
generators wanted to get them down to 20m, he said.
He said the government should have the power to oblige generators to
maintain higher stocks, although he agreed that they would need greater
working capital to finance them, and that might drive up the price of
electricity.
British Coal would also have to accept two-year rolling contracts rather
than the five-year deal it was offering.
Mr Gerard McCloskey, publisher of a coal industry information service, told
the committee that the scope for enlarging coal's market might be even
greater - more than 25m tonnes. He believed that the UK's imports of French
electricity, equivalent to 7.5m tonnes of coal, could be reversed and turned
into a similar amount of exports to countries such as Spain, Portugal and
Italy.
He urged that Nuclear Electric's ageing Magnox reactors should be closed
down, creating scope for an additional 9m to 11m tonnes of coal-based power.
He believed those measures might save half the 31 pits threatened with
closure.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Cadbury faulted by Ernst &amp; Young
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECOMMENDATIONS of the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of
corporate governance are laudable but not feasible, accountants Ernst &amp;
Young said in an unusually strong attack yesterday.
The firm said it doubted that the present system of self-regulation was
'robust or responsive enough', raising the prospect of a US-style Securities
and Exchange Commission in its place.
The latest criticism comes days before the Cadbury committee meets to
approve a final revised draft of its report issued over the summer. The
report is due to be released in December.
The Ernst &amp; Young conclusions include:
Cadbury's proposed code of best practice will not be persuasive for
directors.
The statement of compliance with the code will be highly subjective and
impracticable for auditors to verify.
The role of chairman and chief executive should always be separate.
The committee's expectations for non-executive directors are unrealistic.
It will be difficult to find non-executive directors of sufficient calibre.
The Cadbury proposals on non-executives suggest a 'two-tier' board that may
be inconsistent with present law or effective practice.
The Stock Exchange should reduce the time before filing annual and interim
accounts to three months after year-end.

FT  04 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Sceptics focus on treaty details
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG ALL the lists of potential Tory rebels on Maastricht, the document at
the centre of the row is in danger of going unnoticed - except by the
Euro-sceptics who have examined it clause by clause and swap detailed
references to articles and protocols.
The 130 or so pages of the English text of the treaty include the changes to
the existing treaties about the European Economic Community - or the
European Community as it will now become - as well as 17 protocols and 33
declarations.
The most important changes to the previous treaties relate to economic and
monetary union. Those would set up in three stages the replacement of
national currencies with the Ecu as the single European currency, and the
replacement of national central banks with an independent European central
bank.
The transitional provisions include the setting up of a European Monetary
Institute to strengthen monetary co-operation and facilitate the use of the
Ecu; and progress by the member states towards low inflation, stable
exchange rates and low budget deficits, as the 'convergence criteria' for
the basis of economic and monetary union.
The UK has secured an 'opt-out' from the final stage of economic and
monetary union, but the treaty language makes clear that all member states,
whether or not they are likely to be included in the single currency, are
expected to work towards meeting the convergence criteria.
Other changes extend the Community's policy range in some areas and give the
Community a new role in others such as industrial policy, research and
technological development and trans-European transport and
telecommunications networks. The treaty extends the Community's role in
environmental policy and paves the way for it to have a say in civil
protection, energy and tourism.
Separately from the amendments to earlier treaties, the Maastricht agreement
pro-vides for intergovernmental co-operation in foreign and home affairs.
On foreign and security policy, it is the Council of Ministers that will
decide what should be covered in a common policy although the Commission
will be 'fully associated' with the policy.
Most foreign and security policy decisions will have to be taken
unanimously, but some implementation decisions will be by qualified majority
voting. The Western European Union, the European element of Nato, is given a
prominent role in the defence implications of the foreign policy.
The most significant declaration - and the area of the other UK opt-out - is
that on social policy. The UK will be unable to take part in the discussions
about improved working conditions and social protection, but will not have
to bear the costs of implementing those policies.
Of the other provisions, the most controversial at Westminster is the
setting up of a 'cohesion fund' to help less developed countries in the
Community.
Beyond the changes themselves, the language of Maastricht is itself an issue
at Westminster. In particular, its references to marking a new stage in
creating 'an ever closer union' and its establishment of 'citizenship of the
union' will doubtless be raised today whenever the government argues that
the treaty is a turning point away from European centralisation.

FT  04 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Why MPs will have to vote twice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs will vote twice at the end of the debate. First on a Labour amendment
that further consideration of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill
should await the outcome of the Edinburgh meeting of the European Council
next month. Then on the government motion.
If the amendment were carried, the government motion would be dead and MPs
would be asked to vote again on the Labour amendment. A Yes vote on the
Labour amendment by 324 MPs, or fewer depending on the number of
abstentions, would carry it.
Tory rebels might opt collectively to support the Labour amendment in the
first vote. If the amendment were then carried, they could logically support
the amended government motion in the second.
If the the Labour amendment fell, then hard-line Tory rebels would probably
vote against the original government motion, which gives a green light for
the Maastricht bill. That represents the rebels' best chance to stymie the
process. Soft Tory rebels would probably abstain.

FT  04 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Boardrooms back strong links with
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF BRITAIN'S biggest companies had a vote in the Commons tonight, the
endorsement of Mr John Major's pro-Maastricht motion would be beyond
question.
Although some of them have reservations about aspects of the treaty and look
to the Edinburgh summit for clarification, any doubts are overcome by what
is seen as the need for Britain to be in the mainstream of European
political and economic development.
Judging by the reaction of more than 50 of Britain's largest corporations,
the blueprint for continuing development enshrined in the Maastricht treaty
is not a cause for wild enthusiasm.
But the consequences of being left on the sidelines are considered too bleak
to contemplate. Many companies also believe that, whatever the difficulties,
a Britain at the heart of Europe has a better chance of resolving them.
Few businessmen share the apparent disinterest of Mr Michael Gifford, chief
executive of Rank Organisation. He said he had not read the treaty and had
no view on it, adding: 'I have no view about what they do in the Commons. I
just get on with minding the store, if you don't mind.'
Elsewhere, there may be confusion over the full implications of a treaty on
which Mr John Major is staking so much but there is a recognition that the
outcome of the debate will have a profound impact on Britain's prospects.
Its ability to continue to act as a bridgehead for investment by non-EC
companies operating in Europe is a particular source of concern.
Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, said that a 'stand-aside'
Britain would risk losing its excellent record on inward investment. His
view was shared by Mr Clive Thompson, group chief executive of Rentokil. He
said: 'Inward investment, particularly by the Japanese, would not be nearly
so attractive if Britain was seen to be dragging its feet over Maastricht.'
Mr Bob Wilson, chief executive of RTZ Corporation, said it was important to
protect the UK's role as a magnet for inward investment. An anti-Maastricht
vote would damage that reputation.
Many companies also emphasise that the successful operation of the single
market and of the subsequent initiatives contained in the treaty Maastricht
are indivisible. The idea that Britain could continue as a successful
trading partner while remaining outside the later stages of political and
monetary union is widely dismissed.
BAT Industries, the financial-services-to-tobacco group, said Britain would
encounter serious difficulties in the single market if it failed to ratify
the treaty. The company said: 'The treaty is a vital part of completing the
single market. A single currency is the glue that will keep the single
market together.'
Sir Anthony Pilkington, chairman of Pilkington, said Britain's industrial
and commercial future demanded a Yes vote. 'Within the treaty, we can begin
to address some of the problems resulting from uneven enforcement of
directives and the occasionally erratic approach of the commission,' he
said.
Cadbury Schweppes said the completion of the single market was the most
important aspect of EC development, but the Maastricht treaty had to be
ratified if Britain was to extract maximum benefit from that market.
One dissenting voice came from Willis Corroon, the insurance group, which
backed full British participation in a common market but said that failure
to back the Maastricht treaty would not necessarily lead to isolation from
the rest of Europe. The company said that there was 'probably more than one
way of going about' continuing to develop the EC.
Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen, said a vote against the
government would help to leave Britain 'isolated within Europe on an unknown
course' which would harm its trading prospects.
That view was echoed by Mr Mike Hoffman, group chief executive of Thames
Water, which has ambitions to expand in Europe. He said: 'Not everything in
Maastricht is ideal, but we do not want the country or our company to be
isolated from the rest of the community.'
Mr Richard Everitt, a director of BAA, the airports operator, said that if
Maastricht was a code word for the UK playing a leading role in Europe, it
had to be supported.
He said: 'The vote is really on the role that Britain should play in Europe.
Should we be in the centre of things or should we be sitting on the
sidelines? We think it is very important that we are at the centre.'

FT  04 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Waverers warned against undermining PM
at summit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT wants its motion carried in order to strengthen Mr John
Major's negotiating position at December's European summit in Edinburgh.
Cabinet ministers warn wavering colleagues sotto voce that the prime
minister's credibility in Europe may be at stake. Mr Major warns of the loss
of inward investment and of a collapse in economic confidence in the UK if
Maastricht's ratification is hindered.
THE TORY LOYALISTS remain the largest part of the Conservative party. Those
who have few qualms about Maastricht, or welcome it, are likely to be joined
by opponents who will nevertheless vote with government.
Some of the latter have been persuaded by appeals to loyalty. Others -
including some junior ministers and parliamentary private secretaries - will
decide that today is the wrong time to rebel.
THE HARD-LINE REBELS vary from the long-standing opponents of the EC to
those who believe, like former prime minister Baroness Thatcher, that
Maastricht is a treaty too far, commits Britain to a federal destination and
has to be blocked.
What unites them is a determination not to be swayed by government lobbying.
They put defeat of Maastricht as a higher priority than saving Mr Major.
THE SOFT REBELS are more easily persuadable about Maastricht's contents and
more susceptible to assurances from cabinet ministers that it does not, for
instance, commit Britain to an early return to the ERM. Their instinct is to
put off ratification on Maastricht - arguing that, far from weakening Mr
Major's hand at Edinburgh - it will actually persuade other European
countries that there is a British, as well as a Danish 'problem'.
LABOUR says it backs closer European union but argues that today's debate is
about confidence in Mr Major. The Labour leadership feels its job is to
oppose the government, whatever its own thinking, and to exploit
opportunities to weaken or embarrass ministers. More practically, with
numerous opponents to Maastricht within Labour's ranks, a decision to oppose
the government is the easiest way to ensure the party is united.
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS argue that the future of Europe should be above
domestic politics and will back the government motion. They join ministers
in warning of the economic consequences of the government motion's being
defeated. They also reject Labour's call for a delay before Maastricht is
considered by MPs. But Mr Nick Harvey, Liberal Democrat MP for Devon North,
is expected to vote against the government.
THE OTHERS: of the 24 MPs from the smaller parties, the nine Ulster Unionist
MPs oppose Maastricht but may yet abstain. The three Democratic Unionist
party MPs are also likely to vote against the government, as are the four
MPs of Northern Ireland's Social Democratic and Labour party, the three
Scottish Nationalist party and four Plaid Cymru MPs. The lone Ulster Popular
Unionist party MP is likely to support the government.

FT  04 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Business organisations demand end to
uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE: want Yes vote to help end the damaging decline
in business confidence. Richard Brown, British Chambers director of policy,
said: 'Uncertainty has proved unsettling to the extent that even exporters
have not taken advantage of the devaluation of sterling and confidence
levels are at their nadir. The vote must be a step towards ending that
uncertainty.
'A two-speed Europe has only two gears: forward and reverse. Ratification of
the treaty will, on balance, be supremely beneficial'. Failure to ratify, Mr
Brown said, will leave Europe without a clear long-term strategy for
economic and political stability.
ENGINEERING EMPLOYERS' FEDERATION: is looking for 'a clear Yes' tonight,
underpinning a firm commitment to Europe. Mr Neil Johnson, federation
director-general, said the UK - which last year sent 63 per cent of its
engineering exports to the rest of Europe - 'simply cannot afford to send
the wrong signals to our European partners.
'Maastricht may have its shortcomings but they pale into insignificance
compared with the problems we could face if we reject it. Being temporarily
outside the ERM is one thing; being permanently outside the mainstream of
the Community is altogether something more serious.' The UK should develop
Maastricht, not reject it.
BUILDING EMPLOYERS CONFEDERATION: believes a vote rejecting the government
motion would inflict incalculable harm on Britain and provoke a political
crisis further damaging confidence, according to Sir Brian Hill, its
president.
Sir Brian said a No vote would mean Britain was 'putting its head in the
sand' when it needed to play an active part in the development of Europe.
'It is vitally important for industry that urgent decisions are taken which
will set the British economy on course for growth,' he said.
With construction facing its worst recession since the 1930s, further
political upheaval must be avoided, he added.
INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS: today's vote is a constitutional oddity and an
unnecessary distraction from detailed debate on Maastricht.
The IoD queries the government's urgency to ratify, given the recent
disarray in the exchange rate mechanism, which is central to the Maastricht
programme. It views the debate more as a battle for survival by Mr John
Major, and it believes he has stuck his head above the parapet
unnecessarily.
Mrs Ann Robinson, head of the IoD policy unit, says: 'We do not need this
debate. It has had its second reading and should proceed to the committee
stage, where all its imperfections and ambiguities can be properly
examined.'
SOCIETY OF MOTOR MANUFACTURERS AND TRADERS: warned Tory MPs that the
re-emergence of the UK as a successful car manufacturing nation would be
seriously at risk if the government was defeated tonight.
The optimistic medium-term outlook for UK car producers, according to Sir
Hal Miller, chief executive of the SMMT, 'would be undone should we be faced
with a two-speed Europe or the break-up of the single market'.
Urging Tory MPs 'not to put Britain into Europe's slow lane', the SMMT
warned that EC competitors would seek 'any excuses to prevent UK car exports
by Japanese car manufacturers operating in Britain'.
CONFEDERATION OF BRITISH INDUSTRY: director-general Mr Howard Davies said
ratification of Maastricht was vital to Britain's national interests and for
a revival of economic confidence.
Failure to back the treaty would leave Britain's EC partners to resurrect it
or to construct something like it. 'The government will need to make some
difficult decisions in the coming months if we are to right the balance in
our economy and secure recovery,' Mr Davies said.
'Without the authority it will gain from completing the ratification
process, it will be unable to make those tough decisions stick, with
damaging consequences for the nation as a whole'.

FT  04 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Major's shaky authority faces moment of
truth - Richard Ryder, the government's chief whip, has presided over a
concerted lobbying effort by ministers as the government has sought to head
off the biggest uprising by Tory MPs since John Major became premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR must win. A victory over his party's Euro-sceptics will not in
itself restore the shaky authority of his government, but it is an essential
precondition.
That much was agreed by the prime minister's friends and enemies at
Westminster on the eve of today's vote.
If he loses, his colleagues will urge him to soldier on. But loyalty is not
an adequate substitute for the widespread conviction that his government's
authority would be fatally undermined. The Euro-sceptics deny it publicly,
but acknowledge privately that they are ready to wreck Mr Major's
premiership.
Ironically, the actual vote has no legal significance. It was promised by Mr
Major after the Danish referendum - a device to placate Tory Euro-sceptics
before Labour had swapped its conversion to Europeanism for the more
familiar politics of opportunism.
The motion for debate calls simply for the MPs to give the go-ahead for
consideration in its detailed committee stage of the European Communities
(Amendment) Bill. Labour's amendment says that it should be delayed until
after the Edinburgh summit. But the legislation has passed its second
reading, so, win or lose today, Mr Major could technically press ahead
whenever he wished.
Defeat would deprive him of moral authority. In politics, that is far more
important than legal niceties. He would no longer be in charge of his party.
His foreign policy would lie in ruins alongside the economic policy that
perished on Black Wednesday.
At best, the prime minister could hope to bring the Maastricht bill back
after next month's summit. More practically, it is hard to see how the
process could resume until next year.
Downing Street has retreated awkwardly from the suggestion that defeat would
prompt a general election. It is true that each and every one of Mr Major's
cabinet signed up to the strategy behind today's debate, some albeit
reluctantly. But it has been impossible to find one of them who believes
that losing today would be sufficient cause to issue an open invitation to
Mr John Smith to win an election.
Mr Major's own position is more difficult. In private as well as public, he
has made clear that Maastricht is about both Britain's place in Europe and
his personal authority. He has suggested that the rejection of the treaty
would be an historic mistake comparable to Britain's decision not to sign
the Treaty of Rome.
He regards the struggle as a fight for the soul of the Conservative party.
He has said that if it is not willing to trust him to defend Britain's
self-interest in Europe then it had better find someone else.
The prime minister has made the direct link between Europe and the economy.
His economic strategy was destroyed by sterling's ignominious exit from the
European exchange rate mechanism. Now the new emphasis on recovery, based on
temporary indifference to the level of the exchange rate and further cuts in
interest rates depends for its success on a restoration of political
confidence.
So if his party acts in a way that suggests it is ungovernable, Mr Major
might stand down. There will be no direct pressure to do so from his
colleagues. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the most powerful and one of the most
pro-European member of the prime minister's cabinet, is his most obvious
successor, but he would not wield the dagger. The Euro-sceptics and their
Thatcherite colleagues have no credible candidate of their own.
If Mr Major wins, he will have the chance to salvage his government. It will
not be easy. The economic outlook remains bleak, the Euro-sceptics promise
trench warfare when the Maastricht bill returns, the council tax is
beginning to look like an unexploded bomb. This week's cabinet sessions
underline the difficulties the government will face in meeting its Pounds
244.5bn public spending target.
One senior minister at the centre of the storm confessed recently that it
was 'madness' to stick to a figure agreed when all were convinced that
economic recovery was under way. But like DM2.95 before it, it had become a
totem from which the government could not budge. Creative accounting will
ease some pressure, but the Autumn Statement next week may foreshadow
another stream of Tory rebellions like that over the coal industry.
An unaccustomed victory instead of a defeat for the prime minister would
bring the possibility also that the Conservative party might come to its
collective senses.
The disgruntled and disenchanted on the back benches may realise that
rebellions harm no one but their own party and their own leader. Mr Major
would have a breathing space during which the economy might yet show signs
of life; and a chance at least to begin the painstaking process of
rebuilding his authority.

FT  04 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: The options
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs will vote twice at the end of the debate.
First on the Labour amendment Then on the government motion.
If the amendment were carried, the government motion would be dead and MPs
would effectively be asked to vote again on the Labour amendment. This calls
for the return of the Maastricht bill to be delayed till after December's
European summit in Edinburgh.
A Yes vote on the Labour amendment by 324 MPs or fewer, depending on the
number of abstentions, would carry it.
Tory rebels have a number of tactical voting possibilities.
They might opt collectively to support the Labour amendment in the first
vote. If the amendment were then carried, they could logically support the
amended government motion in the second.
If the the Labour amendment falls, with or without their support, then
hard-line rebels would probably vote against the original government motion,
which gives a green light for the Maastricht bill. That represents the
rebels' best chance to stymie the process. Soft Tory rebels would probably
abstain.
The situation is further complicated since a few Tory MPs have made clear
that they will not back the Labour amendment even if they subsequently
oppose the government motion. Some or all Ulster Unionists might act the
same way. This suggests Labour's amendment could fall by a misleadingly wide
margin.

<TEXT>
JAPANESE-owned companies in Britain believe a 'no' vote in parliament today
over the Maastricht treaty could damage their businesses in the long term,
Daniel Green writes.
Most Japanese-owned companies contacted by the Financial Times said their
immediate business plans would not be affected by the vote, whatever the
outcome.
They said that over time Britain should move closer to the rest of Europe,
especially over the single market and single currency.
Reflecting the views of other senior executives, Mr Kazumi Ueda, managing
director of County Durham bearings maker NSK, said: 'The UK and other
governments are being hasty in pushing it (the Maastricht treaty) through. A
rejection would cause confusion for a short time (and) in the long term the
treaty should be approved.'

<TEXT>
THE CABINET of Mr Chuan Leekpai, the Thai prime minister elected in
September in the aftermath of a bloody confrontation between the army and
pro-democracy forces, yesterday revoked laws that had given the military
sweeping powers, Reuter reports from Bangkok.
'From now on, for all military operations that deal with civilian or
political rallies, the armed forces must seek approval from the cabinet,'
Major-General Sombat Rodphothong, the deputy defence minister, told
reporters.
The Internal Security Act was promulgated in 1979 after a coup. It empowered
the armed forces chief to mobilise troops and order military operations
throughout the country.
When mass protests erupted in May against the military's domination of
politics, military chiefs used the law to crush demonstrations. Dozens of
people were killed and hundreds wounded.
General Suchinda Kraprayoon, the unelected prime minister and leader of a
coup in 1991, was forced to resign in disgrace.
An interim government removed other senior commanders. Pro-democracy parties
forged a coalition after elections to return the country to democracy in
September.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Burma plans to speed reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   RANGOON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BURMA'S military government plans to accelerate its economic reforms to
attract foreign investment and strengthen the fledgling private sector,
according to Brig-Gen David Abel, the finance and planning minister.
He acknowledged, however, that impoverished Burma's economic growth would be
curtailed by the refusal of foreign donors to provide aid and by the
deadlock in Burma's negotiations with the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund.
The ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc) has announced a
stream of economic and political reforms in the past few months, including a
privatisation programme, the easing of restrictions on tourists and
journalists, and the lifting of a night curfew.
But many foreign investors remain sceptical, and western governments are
withholding aid because of the Slorc's dismal human rights record and the
continued detention of Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader who won
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.
'Deregulation will be set at a faster pace,' Gen Abel told the Financial
Times in an interview. He said that the 1988 switch from a centrally planned
to a free market economy had already taken root and that the private sector
now accounted for half of the country's exports.
'There are a lot of difficulties,' he acknowledged, 'and we have to minimise
these problems. That will take some time, say two or three years, to get it
on a much firmer base.'
Such difficulties include the reluctance of newly legalised traders to pay
border tariffs after decades of smuggling from China and Thailand, and the
government's fear that an outright devaluation of the kyat - Burma's
currency which trades on the black market at a 20th of its official value -
would fuel inflation and urban unrest.
A handful of foreign companies, including Pepsi-Cola, have recently made
small investments in Burma, but other potential investors are deterred by
the overvalued currency, government red tape and the fear of further
political instability.
Asked about the difficulties foreign companies have in repatriating profits,
he said they were entitled to do so under the law if the profits were
proven, but complained: 'They operate on the black market rates and they
want to repatriate at the official rates.'
Gen Abel said that Burma, as a mainly agricultural country, was less
vulnerable to the worst effects of rapid economic reform than industrialised
eastern Europe.
But he made clear that the Slorc wanted a slower pace of structural
adjustment than the IMF or the World Bank were prepared to support in the
event of funds being made available.
'I think we're at a deadlock,' he said. 'Structural adjustments on currency
would have to be done with great care and caution. They should offer us a
safety net or cushion so the adjustments can be done properly.'
Gen Abel complained that the US refusal to renew a bilateral textile
agreement meant that textile companies in Burma, which include South Korean
and Hong Kong joint ventures, were operating below capacity, but he said the
withholding of foreign aid would achieve nothing except slower economic
growth.

TWENTY-THREE servicemen and nine rebels were killed yesterday when Tamil
separatists ambushed a patrol in eastern Sri Lanka, Reuter reports from
Colombo.
A helicopter gunship, armoured cars and about 500 troops were rushed to
reinforce the patrol, which was surprised by about 100 guerrillas in the
eastern Amparai district, an army spokesman said.
The 40-strong joint air force and police patrol was searching for road mines
when it was surrounded by the rebels. Police said 13 airmen and 10 policemen
were killed.
The bodies of nine rebels from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who are
fighting for a separate state in the island's north and east, were recovered
after a one-hour battle, the officer said.
The ambush was the latest in a series of hit-and-run attacks on similar road
patrols by marauding groups of Tigers.
The Tigers massacred at least 166 people in a raid last month on mainly
Moslem villages in the north-central region.
The Tigers are trying to drive Sinhalese and Moslems out of the island's
eastern areas, which the rebels claim are part of their traditional
homeland. About 25,000 people have been killed since the Tamil rebels
launched their separatist struggle in 1983.

   PHNOM PENH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Phnom Penh government called yesterday for a United Nations-brokered
disarmament plan in Cambodia to be scrapped so that its soldiers can go back
in the field to counter attacks by Khmer Rouge guerrillas, Reuter reports
from Phnom Penh.
'We want the UN to declare an official end to Phase Two of the ceasefire,'
government spokesman Khieu Khanarith said. 'We want troops that have been
cantoned to go back to their positions.'
The second phase of the accord signed last year requires fighters from the
four Cambodian factions to enter UN-guarded camps and hand in their guns as
a prelude to demobilisation.
The process has stalled because of the Khmer Rouge's refusal to go along
with the plan, which they signed with two allied guerrilla armies and the
Phnom Penh government in October 1991.
Accusing the Khmer Rouge of a series of recent ceasefire violations, Mr
Khieu said: 'We cannot canton while the Khmer Rouge has the right to attack
us - it creates an imbalance.'
The radical faction should be excluded from the process and lose its seat on
the Supreme National Council if it continued to spurn the peace treaty, he
said.
Mr Khieu said the mandate of the huge peacekeeping operation, the UN
Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac), should be changed to let its
soldiers train the three other Cambodian armies to fight the Khmer Rouge.
He said his government wanted a presidential poll before general elections
scheduled for next May.
Such a poll would anoint Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the former leader of the
guerrilla alliance and now the neutral head of state, as president. If this
was not done his government would reconsider its participation in the
general election, he said.
The Khmer Rouge, led by the same chiefs who subjected Cambodia to a reign of
terror in the 1970s that cost over a million lives, have threatened to
boycott the election.
Mr Khieu said his government's army was not planning to launch an offensive
but it needed to make counter-attacks against Khmer Rouge advances. The
Khmer Rouge, among other conditions, refuses to join other factions in
disarming until the UN verifies that all Vietnamese troops have left
Cambodia.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Israeli Jews' birthrate falls to its lowest level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIRTHRATE among Israel's Jewish population has fallen to its lowest ever
level, but mass immigration from the former Soviet Union has sustained the
politically sensitive level of the Jewish majority in the country, latest
government figures show.
Jews accounted for 82 per cent of the 5m population living within the
pre-1967 borders of Israel and both parts of Jerusalem in 1991, despite a
fall in the birthrate per Jewish woman to 2.6.
The rate among Moslem women rose slightly to 4.7. But the difference was
offset by Jewish immigration of 170,000, most from former Soviet
territories.
Demographics are an integral part of the Arab-Israeli dispute. Israeli
governments have long feared that the proportion of Arabs in the population
would rise to levels that would threaten the Jewish character of the state.
They have looked to immigration as the way to bolster the Jewish majority.
Ironically, the latest fall in the Jewish birthrate was attributed to very
low birthrates among the immigrants, partly because of a high proportion of
the elderly among the newcomers. But demographers say the overall Jewish
majority is unlikely to alter much over the next 20 years if immigration
continues at present rates.
However, they say immigration has only postponed by a few years projections
that the balance of Arab-Jewish populations within Israel and the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip will be equal within 25 years.
At present there is a 60 to 65 per cent Jewish majority. This likelihood is
a factor behind the Labour-led government's willingness to cede most of the
West Bank and Gaza to the Palestinians.
Within pre-1967 Israel, recent immigration has made former Soviet citizens
the biggest ethnic group, overtaking those of Moroccan origin.
This, too, may have a political effect as support from recent immigrants was
seen as a big factor in Labour's June election victory over the hardline
Likud party, which tends to draw much of its support from North African
communities.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Australian treasurer under fire over loans
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S Labor government suffered a serious setback yesterday when the
left-wing Democrats joined the conservative Liberal and National parties to
force a Senate inquiry into government borrowing practices.
The inquiry will investigate opposition allegations that Mr John Dawkins,
the treasurer (finance minister), concealed a ADollars 1.3bn (Pounds 570m)
increase in borrowing by the former Labor government of the state of
Victoria.
The increase breached guidelines set down by the Loans Council, an
inter-governmental monitoring body chaired by Mr Dawkins which co-ordinates
federal and state borrowing.
The conservatives claim the debt increase was kept secret by Mr Dawkins to
assist the re-election prospects of the Victorian Labor government, which
was defeated in a landslide earlier this month.
Mr Peter Reith, the conservative treasury spokesman, said the inquiry would
provide evidence to force Mr Dawkins to quit. However, Senator John Coulter,
the Democrats' leader, refused to support calls for the treasurer's
resignation 'at the moment'.
He said the Democrats would try to ensure that the inquiry focused on the
structure of the Loans Council, which appeared to be 'totally inadequate'
for controlling public borrowing. The conservatives claim Mr Dawkins knew in
June that Victoria's debt would exceed Loan Council guidelines, but that he
knowingly included incorrect figures in the August federal budget.
Mr Dawkins said the federal government has no power to control the borrowing
practices of individual states, or to query the figures supplied to the
treasury by state governments. He also released papers showing that he was
advised not to publicise Victoria's debt problems by the federal treasury,
which feared the news would exacerbate nervousness in the financial markets.
The controversy has contributed to recent weakness in the Australian dollar
and an increase in bond yields which has added about ADollars 30m to the
Victoria's debt servicing costs this year.
Mr Dawkins agreed on Monday night to support an application to the Loans
Council by the new Victorian government for a ADollars 1.6bn increase in its
borrowing limit to cover existing debts and fresh spending announced last
week.
The announcement of a Senate inquiry revived speculation that the government
will call a federal election before the end of the year, rather than wait
until mid-1993, when the inquiry would have reported.

FT  04 NOV 92 / China's ethylene city waits for investors and
infrastructure: A look at planning and funding shortfalls at Haicang's
ambitious development project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALF an hour's drive from China's special economic zone of Xiamen City is
one of the largest infrastructure developments on the mainland's eastern
seaboard.
Haicang, which planners say will cost Rmb5bn (Pounds 578m) to complete, is
being hailed as China's 'ethylene city', with plans for deep-water berths to
unload oil and for factories to convert it into a host of downstream
plastics and chemicals.
The first apartment blocks are finished, mainly to house farmers dislodged
by site flattening. New roads are nearly ready to be tarmaced, and will
relieve the existing dusty track, which groans under the weight of
construction vehicles and residents taking produce to market.
Despite the activity, Haicang may become famous as a planners' folly.
Designed to attract foreign petrochemical companies, none have yet arrived.
In 1990, Mr Wang Yung-ching, the chairman of Formosa, Taiwan's largest
plastics company, announced he would build a naphtha cracker in Haicang.
China, and some foreign observers, assumed much of Taiwan's downstream
plastics industry would follow.
But Mr Wang was blocked by political pressure from Taiwan's government.
There are now rumours he is looking elsewhere in China.
Mr Xie Tingmu, a Haicang official, said foreign investors will come, but
only when the infrastructure is ready. 'Haicang is an objective necessity.
It will continue with or without foreign investors,' he said.
Whatever Haicang's fate, it neatly illustrates the difficulties faced by
China in co-ordinating rapid economic coastal growth with its
infrastructure. While Haicang runs before it can walk, the area's ports,
roads and telecommunications limp along behind, unable to keep pace with
double digit economic growth.
Xiamen's port is operating above capacity. Some foreign companies now send
goods by land to Hong Kong, even though it costs about 30 per cent more.
Roads inland and up the coast are often poor and so choked that progress is
very slow. Due to the influx of foreign businessmen seeking cheap land and
labour, flights to Hong Kong are booked months in advance and long distance
telephone lines are engaged by mid afternoon.
Xiamen's port is being expanded and by the end of next year capacity will
increase to 9.5m tonnes from 6m tonnes. Following growth in container trade,
which expanded 6 per cent in terms of tonnage and 66 per cent in containers
handled last year, capacity is set to quadruple to 400,000 containers a
year.
A further development plan, which according to Mr Lin Zhongqi of Xiamen's
harbour bureau has won 'oral' but not yet official approval from China's
State Council, will take capacity to 1m containers a year by the end of the
century.
A Rmb260m, three-year expansion of the city's airport is under way and will
lift passenger capacity to 5m, up from this year's forecast of 2m. Also, the
runway is being extended to cater for Boeing 747s.
Xiamen's Posts and Telecommunications Bureau has spent Rmb120m increasing
the number of local lines five times to 50,000 and long distance lines six
times to 2,000.
The bureau now aims to at least double local lines by 1994, according to Mr
Li Zhenqun, the bureau director.
But these improvements barely seem able to keep pace with demand. Once the
port is improved, road traffic will again switch back to using containers.
Mr Li said as soon as new phone lines are installed they are overloaded.
Most of the money for these projects has been provided by the central and
local governments, although the port expansion has been partly financed by a
Dollars 36m long term, low-interest World Bank loan. Kuwait provided Dollars
18m of low-interest loans towards the airport and Japanese government loans
have helped buy telephone equipment.
But central government funding is becoming more difficult to obtain, mainly
because Beijing's bailing out of lossmaking state industries has led to a
budget deficit.
Xiamen is also having to compete for funding and low-interest loans with
other coastal areas, especially the Pudong development in Shanghai.
Xiamen officials said they will increasingly have to seek new sources of
funds. Following the example set by Guangdong, where Hong Kong businessmen
have built roads and power stations, Fujian is also now courting foreign
investors for infrastructure projects.
So far the results have been small in comparison with Guangdong, but are
encouraging nonetheless. Fujian's drawback is that although Taiwanese
investors, who have language and often family ties with the province, are
investing in processing industries, they have not targeted infrastructure.
Such projects are probably seen as too risky because of Taiwan's continuing
rift with China and the lack of investor protection agreements between the
two sides.
Possibly the most ambitious project being considered is a 'bullet train'
from Xiamen to the provincial capital Fuzhou. Japan's Ikawa Trust is
conducting a feasibility study on the Dollars 2bn project.
If built, it would reduce travel time between the two cities to one hour. At
present it takes six and a half gruelling hours by car along unpredictable
roads.
Hong Kong investors have taken a 30 per cent stake, worth Rmb600m, in a 1.2m
KW coal-fired power station being built near Xiamen. Another Hong Kong
company has become the first foreigner to invest in Chinese port ownership,
rather than management, with a 80 per cent stake in a Rmb200m berth in the
city's port.
Earlier this year a Chinese Malaysian investor exchanged contracts to build
a 40 km highway from Xiamen to the inland city of Zhangzhou, which would
greatly improve communications away from the coast. But the investor is now
being investigated by Hong Kong securities officials, and the project is in
doubt.
Western observers say Fujian's slower economic growth means it does not yet
share Guangdong's power shortage problems but in other respects it is
lagging behind. What Fujian needs, they say, is a large-scale infrastructure
investment like that made by Mr Gordon Wu with his 'super highway' north
from Shenzhen. As construction continues at Haicang, Xiamen officials are
left to wonder if, and when, Mr Wang is their man.

KENYA will hold its first multi-party elections for 26 years on December 7,
according to state television, Reuter reports from Nairobi.
President Daniel arap Moi had said often the polls will be 'very soon' and
election fever has gripped the nation during weeks of often violent
campaigning. A late and reluctant convert to democracy, Mr Moi faces a
fragmented and squabbling opposition whose disarray enhances the chances of
his ruling Kenya African National Union (Kanu).
In a rare display of unity, the opposition yesterday unveiled a common
strategy for reviving the faltering economy. A coalition of four opposition
parties said they had agreed joint policies to revive growth and bring
prosperity to the east African country.
The strategy pledges to reform the mainstay tea, coffee and tourism sectors
and to end corruption which has driven away foreign investment. A heavy
turnout was reported as Ghanaians voted in presidential elections which end
the military rule that has helped make the country a model of economic
success, AP reports from Accra. The Angolan capital Luanda was quiet
yesterday and life started returning to normal under a United
Nations-sponsored ceasefire after weekend fighting that state radio said
killed up to 1,000 across the country.
However, witnesses said a convoy of military vehicles moved out of Luanda to
the north-east towards Bengo province where Unita rebels were reported last
week to have massed 7,000 soldiers. Cameroon's President Paul Biya was sworn
in for a third five-year term yesterday, promising changes to the
constitution and silencing challenges to his re-election with an army
crackdown in the north-west, Reuter adds from Yaounde. Mr John Fru Ndi,
opposition candidate, is under house arrest.

Market porters sleep on their push-carts outside shuttered shops in New
Delhi yesterday. A nationwide strike call by the opposition Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) disrupted commercial activity and some clashes were reported in
parts of India yesterday, Shiraz Sidhva reports. The strike was called to
protest against a decision by the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao to
raise fertiliser and petroleum prices. Most markets and businesses in New
Delhi and the four BJP-ruled states were closed and rail and bus services
were partially disrupted. Elsewhere the call by the Hindu right-wing party
to paralyse the country was ignored. In Bombay, the office of the chief
minister was ransacked by political activists who gatecrashed the state
headquarters. In Bihar, BJP leaders alleged that police used force to
disrupt peaceful processions. The strike is part of a BJP attempt to
increase its support among farmers in a party made up mostly of traders.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Deficit and politics sway Cavallo: Argentina's economy
minister has taken tough steps to protect industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospect of Argentina's first trade deficit since 1981, the threat of
recession and the political priorities of President Carlos Menem have forced
Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister, to backtrack on his promise to
apply the full discipline of the market on Argentina's unruly economy.
Last week he agreed to industry's demands for additional support for exports
and increased protection from imports, notably from Brazil. His measures
also aim to avoid recession in 1993, an election year. The measures, which
amount to an indirect 5-10 per cent devaluation of the peso became
inevitable as Argentina's currency became increasingly overvalued.
Mr Cavallo has eliminated a fuel tax and broadened tax rebates for
exporters, a boost worth about Dollars 1.1bn a year. He reduced the highest
import tariff from 35 per cent to 20 per cent and maintained a zero tariff
for some capital goods while raising tariffs for many intermediate
industrial products. He 'temporarily' raised to 10 per cent a previous 3 per
cent statistics tax on nearly all imports.
This has the virtue of offsetting preferential tariffs on Brazilian imports.
Taxes are not affected by the 1991 treaty creating the Mercosur common
market between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, which is gradually
lowering tariffs.
Industry's cries for help to stem a mounting trade deficit with Brazil -
which is expected to exceed Dollars 1bn this year - were the catalyst for
last week's package.
Mr Manuel Herrera, secretary of the Argentine Industrial Union which
represents manufacturers, says: 'Twenty per cent of Brazil's output is
equivalent to all our output. They are selling products at artificial prices
here that they cannot sell in other markets.'
Alarm over Brazil is now acute. Officials say that economic chaos there
makes the December 1994 deadline for full integration increasingly
improbable.
Many Argentines want to scrap Mercosur and opt instead for rapid association
with the North American Free Trade Agreement. But US officials warn
Argentina has no chance of joining Nafta soon and urge perseverence with
Mercosur.
Mr Cavallo is confident of eliminating Argentina's trade gap in 1993. This
year's deficit is estimated at between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 2bn, against
1991's Dollars 3.87bn surplus. This is because imports are up 60 per cent
over last year while exports remain steady at about Dollars 12.0bn.
Exports, which represent only 8 per cent of GDP, clearly need encouragement
and industrial exports need special attention. The share of manufacturers in
Argentina's exports has declined every year since Mr Menem took office in
1989. Farm goods and raw materials now account for two-thirds of exports.
However, Mr Cavallo has previously said that a trade deficit was no reason
for concern. After the peso became fully convertible and was pegged to the
dollar in April 1991, the theory was that prices and productivity would
converge at world levels. Divergences would be automatically corrected by
recession.
Mr Cavallo has made great headway in trade lib-eralisation, privatisation
and deregulation, but he has not tamed inflation. Retail prices have risen
by over 40 per cent since April 1991, relentlessly increasing pressure on
the exchange rate and making recession inevitable.
But Mr Menem's political agenda allows no room for a bruising recession. He
wants his Peronist party to sweep the 1993 congressional mid-term elections
and forge ahead with his controversial bid to amend the constitution to
allow him to stand for re-election in 1995.
Initially, economic reform boosted the government's popularity by driving
inflation down to between 1 and 1.5 per cent a month and unleashing a
consumer boom. But the spending cuts, unemployment and brutal shakeouts now
required are not popular anywhere.
Pessimists will say last week's decisions are depressingly familiar.
Argentina's governments have a tradition of embarking on impressive reform,
only to retreat when the going gets tough.
Mr Cavallo says he is only fine-tuning the economy and has reaffirmed his
commitment to fiscal rectitude and liberalisation. He says his new package,
plus a previous round of deregulation and cost-cutting, will boost
productivity by between 16 and 21 per cent.
However, the changes ease the pressure on industry to perform. An American
trade analyst says: 'Companies must instill a new kind of management. They
have to become stingy penny-pinchers and fight harder for markets. But
they've learnt - and they're being proved right again  - that it's easier to
lobby for rule changes and devaluations.'
By creating a precedent for special pleading, Mr Cavallo will come under
more pressure to soften his policies. Further concessions would worsen
inflation and diminish his credibility. Independent economists already
predict higher inflation will wipe out the package's effects by early next
year.
Argentina is still ridden with inflation, despite the pace of reform, as it
originates from a rigid labour market and retail sector.
Hiring and firing is difficult and expensive, wage costs are high and
productivity low. Mr Cavallo's repeated attempts to tackle the labour market
have failed because Mr Menem cannot risk losing the unions' backing.
As a result, an average industrial worker costs companies Dollars 1,000 a
month in wages, taxes, social security contributions and other costs. Heavy
deductions cut net wages to only Dollars 600 a month, so unions are
constantly agitating for pay increases. They have now called a general
strike for November 9.
Consumer prices are high because retailers, facing little competition, raise
prices with impunity. Wages may seem princely by regional standards, but
their purchasing power is probably less than in Chile or even Brazil.
Mr Cavallo has shown weakness for the first time in his 21 months as
minister.
He must, at all costs, accelerate reform if he is to avoid repeating so many
brave, but ultimately abortive, attempts to halt Argentina's inexorable
decline.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Victory For Clinton: It's just too much for folks in Little
Rock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LITTLE ROCK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXCITED crowds of Arkansans and tourists yesterday descended on a 16-block
area cordoned off in Little Rock for a giant America's Watch Party and to
celebrate a historic shift in US politics.
Governor Bill Clinton's final punishing 28-hour, eight-state drive to win
the US presidency had ended when his aircraft touched down in Little Rock at
10am and he was surrounded by 500 supporters. Looking energised, he drove by
motorcade to vote.
When his limousine stopped near an elementary school, children he had often
visited rushed over. His secret service guards seemed less nervous as he was
engulfed in a mass of tiny arms.
Not yet accustomed to special treatment, Mr Clinton, his wife Hillary and
their daughter Chelsea, waited in a long queue to vote. From there he was to
go to the governor's mansion to rest.
In the Clinton-Gore headquarters in the Arkansas state capital, red-eyed and
weary, 400 senior officials had supervised a massive turn-out-the-vote
effort.
Some 12m telephone calls were made to voters in the last hours of the
campaign; 250,000 workers were organised to bring voters to the polls.
Ms Betsey Wright, deputy chair of the Clinton campaign, said plans were
under way to extend this effort to give US voters a role in the transition
to a new government through 'a modern communications mechanism'.
Clinton staff have talked of establishing a special toll-free telephone
number to allow citizens to express 'those ideas that have been stifled
across the country'.
Ms Wright expressed intense bitterness about President George Bush's
criticism of Arkansas during the campaign and said it was unprecedented for
a sitting president to attack a state. The president had opined that Mr
Clinton was 'the failed governor of a small state'.
Many Little Rock people seemed stunned by the visiting hordes. Many
expressed indifference to Mr Clinton and talked about his tax increases.
'Bill Clinton is much more unpopular in Little Rock than he is outside
outside the city,' said Mr Marc Ginsberg, the governor's deputy press
secretary.
'Little Rock is an island unto itself. There is an historical relationship
of hostility between the city and the rest of the state. It is sort of like
Paris to the rest of France.'
However, at Hot Springs, 55 miles from Little Rock, there were few
indications of popular support for the governor. One sign proudly proclaimed
Hot Springs 'Bill Clinton's Home Town'. Another sign along the highway
exhorted: 'Christians, vote God's heart, not your pocket book.'
Back in the Paris of Arkansas, outside the centre set up for the media,
crowds of tourists listened to blaring jazz and rock music. Visiting
dignitaries and wealthy contributors were checking into the luxury downtown
hotels. Shops did a brisk business in campaign buttons, balloons and
T-shirts.
Inside the headquarters, tourists were reading letters from small children
to Mr Clinton. One demanded to know if he would raise taxes.
A seven-year-old girl said he had won her backing, not because her parents
supported him, but because 'I think you will make a better tomorrow and I
think you would be for women's rights.'

FT  04 NOV 92 / An island pulled up by a Bootstrap: Incentives which
enriched Puerto Rico remain vital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VISITORS recently to the offices of Fomento, Puerto Rico's economic
development agency, were greeted by an exhibition of photographs depicting
aspects of the island's economy. Some photos, which record scenes in
factories and fields in the early 1940s, were mounted beside others showing
more recent economic undertakings.
Even the most cursory look at the exhibition forcefully made the point.
Fifty years ago this year, Puerto Rico, impoverished and backward - the
poorhouse of the Caribbean, says official literature - took a giant step
forward. The result today is one of the more industrialised economies in the
Americas. The spark was Operation Bootstrap, a web of incentives which have
lured big companies to establish plants on the island.
'Puerto Rico today without Bootstrap would be terrible,' said Mr Alfredo
Salazar, administrator of Fomento. 'We would still be struggling with
agriculture alone, and would still be facing the hopelessness of the 1940s.
This would have been an empty island as most of the population would have
left.'
The change has been, by any standard, dramatic and significant. Per capita
income has risen from Dollars 120 in 1942 to Dollars 6,500, while GNP has
grown from Dollars 287m to Dollars 17bn. Agriculture, which contributed 23
per cent of GDP in 1942, now accounts for 1 per cent and has been replaced
as the backbone of the economy by manufacturing, with the number of
industrial plants growing from about 50 in 1942 to 2,000 today, employing
155,000 Puerto Ricans, against 15,000 50 years ago.
The volume of trade has grown from Dollars 2bn to Dollars 35bn. Puerto
Ricans are now expected to live 74 years, 30 years longer than in the 1940s.
Companies drawn to Puerto Rico gained not only from a tax holiday, but from
the fact that the island, as a US possession, offered political stability,
low wages and relative proximity to the mainland market.
But Puerto Rico found itself losing business to competitors in south-east
Asia and in the mid-1970s obtained further advantages under Section 936 of
the US Revenue Code which encouraged mainland companies with subsidiaries on
the island to deposit their profits in local banks. These deposits, of about
Dollars 15bn, have become a pillar of the island's financial stability.
Puerto Rico's Caribbean neighbours, overtaken by economic and social
problems, sometimes look with more than passing envy at the results of
Operation Bootstrap. It is clear, however, that the Puerto Rican experiment
and its seeming success cannot be emulated.
Puerto Ricans are US citizens but cannot vote for a president. The island's
representation in Washington is limited to a commissioner who has no vote to
influence legislation.
'There are lessons in Puerto Rico for other Caribbean and developing
countries, although there are few parallels,' concludes Mr Pat Thompson,
executive director of the Caribbean Association of Industry and Commerce, an
umbrella for the region's private sector.
Puerto Rico's position as a part of the US is similar to that of French
overseas departments such as Martinique and Guadeloupe, and allows for
assistance which others cannot get. 'The lessons for us from Puerto Rico are
in the organisation and management of finance, and in negotiations with
major companies and industrial sectors for joint venture industrial
projects,' says Mr Thompson.
It is clear, however, that what Puerto Rico is today is more than the work
of Operation Bootstrap and the incentives contained in special arrangements
such as Section 936. Despite its giant leap over the past 50 years, the
island is still the least affluent part of the US. The average income of
Puerto Ricans is a third of that of mainland residents.
The economy is underpinned by federal transfers of about Dollars 4bn per
year under programmes such as those for medical aid and food stamps. The
island also receives hundreds of millions of dollars from rebates of federal
excise taxes and duties collected on exports such as rum.
Citizenship of the US has also facilitated easy migration to the mainland.
Mr Salazar says that while 3.5m Puerto Ricans live on the island, another
2.5m are on the mainland. This is an obvious safety valve against social
pressures, without which unemployment in Puerto Rico would be worse than the
current 17 per cent.
The fruits of Operation Bootstrap have helped Puerto Ricans answer some of
the questions about their political future. They know what they do not want.
Advocates of political independence have always been placed a distant third
when votes are taken on political status. Economic and political problems in
some neighbouring islands appear a powerful argument against casting adrift
from the US. The argument is mainly between remaining the same or becoming a
state of the union.

FT  04 NOV 92 / World Trade News: New threat of trade war over oilseeds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Community and the US last night failed to achieve a hoped-for
breakthrough in their oilseeds dispute, heightening concern that the US may
announce trade sanctions and touch off a damaging trade war.
The EC-US talks in Chicago had stretched into a third day in an effort to
reach a deal before trade diplomats from the 105 Gatt signatories meet in
Geneva today.
The dispute over the EC's controversial system of oilseed subsidies is a key
issue blocking agreement in the so-called Uruguay Round of world trade
liberalisation talks.
Mr Ray MacSharry, EC farm commissioner, said the US and the EC had hit an
impasse in the oilseeds talks, although they had come 'very close'.
Mr Edward Madigan, the US agriculture secretary, said he would recommend to
President Bush that the US go ahead with trade sanctions against EC
foodstuffs.
But Mr Madigan added he was willing to continue to meet EC officials on the
issue. Mr MacSharry, too, said he was willing to have a further meeting,
though none has been set.
Mr Madigan said he envisaged that the US and EC could continue meeting on
the oilseeds dispute even if the US announced trade sanctions, which would
not take effect until 30 days later.
'We can withdraw concessions and continue to meet and I think the US would
be willing to do that,' he said.
The EC would have, 'no moral basis' to impose counter-sanctions, he added,
as it had not suffered financial injury yet in the case.
Earlier, Mr MacSharry had voiced optimistism, suggesting there was 'a deal
in the making, all the pieces are there'.
But in the end few new proposals emerged, and EC negotiators seemed
satisfied at least to have made the gesture.
Ms Carla Hills, the US Trade Representative, has already prepared a list of
about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) in sanctions. Mr Madigan said a second list
might be in preparation.
US farm interests expect that sanctions will be announced at today's Gatt
meeting in Geneva and that talks will continue during the 30-day waiting
period before the penalties become effective.
US soyabean producers first filed an official complaint against the
Community's oilseed subsidies programme in 1987 and twice won their case
before Gatt panels.
Earlier yesterday, senior EC officials said that, apart from oilseeds, the
farm trade elements integral to a Uruguay Round deal were all but settled.
They were hopeful of a deal including the following:
The volume of subsidised exports would be cut 21 per cent over six years,
rather than by the 24 per cent prescribed in the Uruguay Round 'final act';
EC compensation payments to farmers, for the price and production cuts in
its reform of the CAP, would be exempt from cuts under the Round;
The US would agree to a 'peace clause' undertaking to settle future trade
disputes multilaterally through Gatt procedures;
The US would undertake to 'prevent any surge' in exports of cheap cereals
substitutes to the EC, which could undercut even the near-world market price
for cereals introduced by CAP reform.

At the end of a two-day official visit, he said his talks had laid the
groundwork for a real partnership between France and its former north

'Instead of assisting Morocco's development we will now set up a veritable

Discussions had advanced on a series of projects in the phosphate industry,
energy, electric power and telecommunications.

FT  04 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Mercosur takes to the highways - A look at
plans for a Dollars 2.5bn network to further economic integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS for a 'South American Super Highway' linking Brazil, Uruguay and
Argentina have been put forward to advance the three countries' commitment
to economic integration.
The three governments are for the first time calling on the private sector
to put up the money and take the risk. It will be the continent's most
ambitious highway project in recent years and the first such tripartite
co-operation.
The proposed 2,500 km expressway to link the commercial centres of Buenos
Aires and Sao Paulo will cost an estimated Dollars 2.5bn. Its construction
is thought critical to the success of Mercosur, the southern cone common
market serving over 200m people which becomes fully operational in 1995.
Since the Mercosur treaty was signed in 1990, regional trade has already
doubled to Dollars 6.5bn and exporters say an urgent improvement in roads is
needed.
Plans based on a study commissioned by the InterAmerican Development Bank
(IDB) were presented to businessmen, technicians and government
representatives last month. The governments of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay
then formed a commission to detail a proposal by next year.
Mr Enrique Iglesias, president of the IDB, says that the bank will provide
technical assistance and financial guarantees for the project, the cost of
which would be recovered mainly through toll revenues.
This is a revolutionary concept in countries with often wasteful state
spending. . Mr Iglesias, said: 'Construction companies are shocked when we
tell them now it's your turn to go to the market and raise finance'. But Mr
Alberto Goldman, the Brazilian Transport minister, says there is no other
option: 'The state has no more money. Next year for example my budget is
only Dollars 500m yet just to recuperate existing roads I would need Dollars
2.5bn."
The planned South American Super Highway is the most important of several
projects to improve infrastructure within Mercosur to cater for rapidly
increasing regional trade.
The idea stems from well advanced plans to build a 50 km bridge across the
La Plata river linking Colonia in Uruguay to Buenos Aires, reducing the
journey between the capitals of Argentina and Uruguay by 280 km. Bids for
the Dollars 1bn construction will be invited on a build operate and transfer
basis.
Based on the construction of the bridge, the IDB initial study by Louis
Berger International suggests that the best route for the highway is along
the coastline of southern Brazil and Uruguay.
Costs would be kept down by using existing roads, improving their condition
and widening them from two to four lanes. Estimated costs vary from Dollars
110,000 per km for a two lane road rehabilitation to Dollars 1m for a new
four lane bypass.
Mr Joseph Revin who co-ordinated the study, suggests investment be
recuperated through an open toll system.
He estimates the rate of return as 16 per cent in real terms with some
sections such as Curitiba - Porto Alegre yielding 37.5 per cent. Viability
studies are expected to be finished next year and bidding invited in 1994
for construction to then start in 1995.
There are, however, many uncertainties not least the financing. Mr Humberto
Busnello, who runs a Brazilian construction company, says he has doubts
about the rate of returns, adding 'a lot depends on the bridge - whether
that is part government financed'.
Members of the Uruguayan delegation admit it could be difficult to get
public approval for a heavy traffic highway along the country's coastline.
Brazil still needs to pass legislation to allow private concessions of
public services.
Mr Roberto Requiao, governor of Parana state through which the road will
pass, says 'its absurd to give the private sector the liberty to fix tolls.
It could become a monopoly where the local economy will not be able to
afford to use it.'
Despite these fears, interested European and Latin American companies have
already formed one consortium with financial support from Banque Nationale
de Paris.
Mr Olivier de Saint Lager, director of the French company Lyonnaise des
Eaux-Dumez said his company had formed a consortium with CBPO, a subsidiary
of Odebrecht, one of Brazil's leading construction companies, Intreglio, an
Italian construction company and Cartelloni, a leading Argentinian firm, to
prepare a bid for the highway project.
He says 'it is not a Pharaonic dream but a viable project. We would not have
invested so much in it if we did not think so'.

FRANCE is not alone in not wanting a hasty world trade deal, Spain's Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez said yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris. Some EC
partners were using the French stand to protect themselves. 'I do not
believe France is isolated,' Mr Gonzalez declared after meeting France's
President Francois Mitterrand. 'Other countries are shielding themselves
behind the French position.'
France, anxious to avoid angering its farmers, in revolt over EC farm policy
reforms, has said it does not want an accord in the stalled Gatt talks
before the US presidential election. 'We will reach an agreement in the Gatt
talks, but there are certain conditions I, too, would not accept,' Mr
Gonzalez added.
France has been blamed for the deadlock, mainly over subsidised farm exports
and oilseeds trade, which is delaying a wider deal to liberalise world
trade. 'It's absurd to blame each other as we do,' Mr Gonzalez said. 'That
is a simplification, and they are almost always dangerous.'

<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS' plan to buy just under 50 per cent of the French regional
airline Transport Aerien Transregional (Tat) is being investigated by the
European Commission, write Andrew Hill in Brussels and Daniel Green in
London.
Brussels' competition authorities have decided that the deal, part of the
British carrier's strategy to create a global airline, falls under its
merger control rules. BA called the decision 'routine'; it had notified the
Commission's merger task force on October 23 and had been expecting the
announcement.
British Airways, which will spend Pounds 17.25m on the 49.9 per cent stake
in Tat, still expects the deal to be completed by January. It will also
acquire an option to buy the rest of the airline by April 1, 1997.
However, if the Commission decides after a month that it has 'serious
doubts' about the effects of the deal on competition in the Community it
will launch a four-month in-depth inquiry. If it is still dissatisfied at
the end of that period, it could block the deal or ask for it to be amended.
A Commission decision to clear the BA/Tat deal would almost certainly
irritate Air France, the state-owned French airline. Brussels last year
forced Air France to sell its 35 per cent stake in Tat when it took over
UTA, the French long-haul carrier, and Air Inter, the French domestic
airline.

compromise over animal trials
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COSMETICS manufacturers in the European Community will be banned from
testing their products on animals from January 1, 1998, ministers agreed
yesterday - but only if alternative testing methods have been developed.
The accord was welcomed by the industry as a sensible compromise, but
immediately attacked by European animal rights campaigners for not going far
enough. Mr Chris Fisher of the British Union for the Abolition of
Vivisection said: 'The council's decision is a cruel deception: it looks
like a ban, but it is not.'
The European parliament added proposals for a total ban to a more general
directive on the free movement of cosmetics in June.
Before yesterday's meeting of consumer affairs ministers, only Denmark and
Germany supported the amendment. Other countries seemed worried that a ban
might disadvantage companies competing against non-EC manufacturers not
subject to a ban, or exporting to countries which insist on animal testing.
But ministers yesterday rallied round the compromise proposed by Britain,
which holds the EC presidency. Under this, the Commission would take the
advice of a technical committee and could propose an extension of the
deadline by at least two years if acceptable alternative testing methods had
not been developed before January 1, 1997.
The directive is quite narrowly drawn. It applies only to cosmetics, not to
pharmaceuticals in general, and it would not restrict imports from non-EC
countries of products tested on animals. But Mr Karel Van Miert, consumer
affairs commissioner, hailed the compromise as the first step towards a
wider ban on animal testing, which he hoped would be taken up beyond the
Community.
Mr Robert Vanhove, secretary general of Colipa, the European cosmetics
industry federation, said he was sure that the industry would have developed
alternatives to animal testing for eye and skin irritation by the 1998
deadline. Alternatives to less important tests could take 10 or 20 years to
develop, he added.
Alice Rawsthorn adds from Paris: An outright ban on animal testing would
have little direct effect on the cosmetics industry, because most leading
manufacturers have phased out such experimentation in recent years.
This change of strategy was prompted partly by consumer concern and partly
because the industry realised that legislative curbs were inevitable. The
major manufacturers have also responded to the competitive pressure from
such companies as the UK's Body Shop, which has won a significant market
share because of environmentally-responsible policies.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Italy found wanting on aid: Rome's Third World policy is
under scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTIGATIONS by Rome magistrates into the alleged misuse of Italian
contracts to supply food aid to impoverished Albania have thrown the
spotlight on the whole issue of Italy's foreign assistance programme.
Magistrates disclosed last month that they were acting on complaints from
Italian deputies that food supply contracts had been put out to
uncompetitive private tender and had then been improperly distributed inside
Albania. Last September, Italy stepped in to assist Albania with a large
programme of emergency assistance that included 125,000 tonnes of food to
carry the country through the winter.
As a sign of concern over the allegations, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro
postponed a visit to Albania last week.
Rome magistrates have indicated they intend to spread their investigations
widely.
The taboo of investigating state institutions was broken earlier this year
by Milan magistrates examining illegal payments to political parties in
return for being granted public works contracts.
Deputies and subsequent newspaper articles have alleged this was merely the
latest of a string of abuses of Italy's foreign aid. Other countries singled
out include war-torn Somalia and Mozambique. This week, the police took away
documents concerning Italy's foreign aid, understood to relate to
Bangladesh.
The investigation coincides with severe budgetary constraints on aid
transfers and a more general scrutiny of both the nature and quality of
Italy's foreign aid programme. The main complaint is that aid has been
poorly focused and inefficiently co-ordinated; while the public accounts
office has warned there is insufficient monitoring of programmes. Already
there are signs that Mr Emilio Colombo, the foreign minister since August,
is seeking to exercise more direct control over the directorate for
co-operation and development, which is responsible for foreign aid.
It was only during the 1980s that Italian aid flows began to match those of
its main industrialised partners. In the period 1979-1989, Italy's foreign
aid programme enjoyed a decade of continuous real increases, rising on
average at 10 per cent a year. This was one of the highest rates among the
industrialised countries, lifting Italian aid to Dollars 3.6bn (Pounds
2.2bn) a year. As a percentage of GDP, aid flows rose from 0.13 per cent to
0.42 per cent, close to that of France.
Since then there has been a gradual decline, falling back to about 0.32 per
cent of GDP and the 1993 budget is proposing to lop off a further L1,500bn
(Pounds 691m). Such a rapid rise, after a relatively late start, was closely
linked to expanding Italian trade. Essentially, aid has been been used as a
tool to obtain overseas contracts for Italian companies rather than assist
the development of countries. A study just completed by IRI, the state
holding company, shows that of all the industrialised countries, Italian aid
is the most tied - mainly in the form of soft credits to assist import
finance for Italian goods and services. Although the short-term returns have
been often high for individual companies, there has been insufficient impact
on either the development process or in terms of a positive spill-over
effect on the rest of Italian industry.
Such heavy emphasis on tied aid is becoming out of tune with the
accelerating internationalisation of world trade and the IRI study suggests
future policy should be oriented less towards aiding projects and more to
helping programmes. In this way the aid process would link both donor and
receiver into a longer term relationship, especially helping developing
countries to become more familiar with Italian know-how and technology.
According to the study, Italian aid should focus more on programmes which
stimulate financial flows into receiver countries. It also says more
attention should be devoted to technical co-operation, one of the hardest
but ultimately most productive aspects of aid. Aid should be less
exclusively bilateral and much more multilateral - both within the context
of EC initiatives and international financial institutions. In the past
bilateral aid has been as high as 73 per cent of the total; but is now below
60 per cent.
The IRI study argues too much of Italian aid has been 'concentrated
geographically, in sub-Saharan Africa'.
This applies especially to grant aid in foodstuffs which covers more than a
third of all assistance. In the five-year period, 1986-90, an average of 69
per cent of all grant aid went to African countries.
The sub-Saharan emphasis reflects former colonial links with Ethiopia and
Somalia; and the IRI study points out the latter countries have not only
received the greatest single quantities but have been the biggest failures.
After the case of Albania, magistrates have also hinted they may turn their
attention to alleged abuses in Somalia.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Bangemann gives reply to the EC's minimalists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Maastricht treaty is a milestone along the road to a federal European
state, ensuring that 'more and more decisions can only be taken at the
European level', according to Mr Martin Bangemann, vice-president of the
European Commission.
Mr Bangemann, a former German economy minister and Bonn's senior
commissioner in Brussels, said the EC must integrate further before it takes
in new members, and that the notion of 'subsidiarity' - ensuring decisions
are taken at the most appropriate level of government - 'presupposes the
idea of a federal European state'.
His remarks, although entirely unexceptionable from a German federalist and
not unsupported by the contents of Maastricht and common EC policy,
nevertheless provided ammunition to British anti-treaty MPs trying to defeat
Mr John Major's government in today's vote on Maastricht.
Mr Bangemann, former leader of Germany's liberal FPD, the junior coalition
partner in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, was speaking in Berlin to a
conference on Europe's future.
His remarks challenge the minimalist interpretation of the treaty Mr Major
and Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, have been presenting to
their domestic constituencies.
As Mr Bangemann recognised, neither he nor the Commission have any powers to
determine what decisions are taken at EC level, when the Community should
enlarge, much less what the 12 should decide in the review foreseen by
Maastricht for 1996. 'It is the Council not Commission which decides on all
Community matters,' he underlines. But his remarks constitute an
uncompromising if mainstream federalist view of EC development, and of the
need for more 'deepening' before the Community 'widens'.
They also echo last week's warning from Commission president, Mr Jacques
Delors, that Denmark risks being left on the sidelines if it fails to ratify
Maastricht in a new referendum. In the treaty, 'the goal of a federal
European state is spelled out for the first time', Mr Bangemann says.
'Although Maastricht did not see the creation of a federal European state,
the breakthrough must come with the next step,' he adds, in a reference to
the 1996 review, 'so that the Community can open its doors to new members
and assume its Europe-wide responsibilities.'

FT  04 NOV 92 / France seeks talks on nuclear tests
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE is proposing to launch discussions with the other four big nuclear
powers on future policies for weapons testing, writes David White, Defence
Correspondent, in Paris.
The talks are expected to take place at ambassador level in Geneva. The
initiative comes as both France and Russia face decisions on whether to
resume underground nuclear tests.
Tests by both countries, as well as by the US and Britain, are currently
subject to a temporary freeze as a result of separate national decisions.
France followed Russia by announcing a one-year moratorium in April. A
recent US bill, reluctantly signed into law by President George Bush,
brought in a nine-month freeze followed by a restricted programme of tests
over the following three years.
After then, as the law now stands, there would be a complete ban on
underground nuclear explosions in the US unless tests are carried out by
other nuclear powers (understood to mean principally Russia).
The US curbs are also binding on Britain, which relies on facilities in the
Nevada desert to test its nuclear warheads. None of the western nuclear
powers favours a complete ban on testing. Defence chiefs of both the US and
Britain have continued to argue that tests are needed to ensure the safety
and reliability of nuclear weapons.
France also wants to bring China into the discussions. Senior French
officials said the initiative was aimed at a 'reflection' on testing
policies in the light of overall security concerns.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE mood in German business and industry is gloomier than at any stage for
10 years, and talk is openly of recession, according to the annual survey of
business opinion by the German chambers of commerce and industry (DIHT).
The poll covering more than 25,000 enterprises in both east and west of the
country shows that the number believing the current state of the economy is
good has halved in the past year, from 44 per cent to 22 per cent.
The number judging it bad has more than doubled, from 11 to 25 per cent.
The same gloomy picture emerges from employment forecasts - with 32 per cent
expecting to cut their payrolls, against 9 per cent promising expansion.
'For German business, 1993 will be a tough year,' Dr Franz Schoser, chief
executive of the DIHT, said yesterday. 'Since the unification boom is over,
a recession can no longer be ruled out.
'For the coming months, we see no chance of a fundamental change in economic
growth prospects.'
German industry is equally pessimistic about export prospects, because of
the stagnating international economy, and expected the appreciation of the
D-Mark within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism to curb them further, he
said.
The one ray of light spelt out by the survey is that investment plans in
eastern Germany are expected to continue to increase - in spite of the
latest decisions by Mercedes-Benz and Krupp to shelve big plans for
expansion there.
Just 19 per cent of west German enterprises expect the economic situation
next year to improve, whereas 31 per cent expect it to get worse. Dr Schoser
suggested that the recent report of the five German economic research
institutes might be over-optimistic in expecting the beginning of a recovery
after the second quarter of 1993.
In east Germany, the mood of enterprises has become more cautious in the
last six months, although it is more hopeful than last year. The survey
expects the pace of job losses to slow down, although the process of
large-scale structural change has by no means finished. The survey
identifies the main factors cited by investors as a brake on investment in
eastern Germany.
Western industrial investors put legal uncertainty top (38 per cent said
so), followed by the lack of administrative capacity, lack of
infrastructure, and the burden of environmental damage.
East German investors cited lack of access to finance as by far the greatest
problem (70 per cent of industrial enterprises, although only 35 per cent of
commercial concerns).
Within west Germany, the only region with an overall positive expectation in
the coming year was Hamburg.
FAG, the large German ball-bearing producer, yesterday announced the closure
of its subsidiary in east Berlin with the loss of 470 jobs.
The east Berlin company had losses this year of DM22m (Pounds 8.9m) on sales
of DM18m.
IBM Deutschland said it would cease hardware production at its west Berlin
plant which would be converted to software output and service. About 150
jobs will be lost.

<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl's ruling coalition last night agreed on budget cuts
totalling DM3.2bn (Pounds 1.29bn), and reallocated another DM2.5bn in social
spending, in an effort to reduce a gaping deficit in 1993 government
spending.
The measures fall far short of the estimated DM20bn shortfall forecast by Mr
Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, estimating the likely shortfall in
next year's tax revenues, and additional needs for both east Germany, and
unemployment benefits.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, is proposing to cover the revenue
shortfall - estimated at around DM6bn for the central exchequer - by
increasing the net borrowing requirement in the budget from DM38bn to
DM44bn.
The extent of new spending needs in the east is still uncertain, with a
cabinet debate scheduled for today now postponed until next week.
The cuts agreed last night by the Christian Democrats (CDU), Christian
Social Union (CSU) and Free Democrats (FDP), the three parties in the
coalition, will fall most heavily on the defence and transport ministries,
and on programmes to clean up environmental damage in east Germany.
The defence budget will be cut by DM540m, and the transport budget by
DM450m, without any indication of the precise areas of saving.
Another DM200m will be saved from the programme to repair the ravages of
Soviet uranium mining in the former East Germany. There will also be
spending cuts on cleaning up military bases after the departure of Soviet
troops.
A further DM400m is to be cut from the budget to fund government property
purchases in Berlin, suggesting a delay in the programme to transfer the
German government and parliament from Bonn to Berlin.
Mr Waigel's savings package seems certain to be condemned by the opposition.

THE BUNDESBANK yesterday set a string of conditions for further cuts in
German domestic interest rates and said it would not allow its monetary
policies to be dictated by financial markets, Reuter reports from Leipzig.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the bank's president, told reporters in the east
German city of Leipzig that lower rates depended on success in cutting
public sector deficits, on the level of wage deals in the 1993 pay round,
and on reining in money growth.
His deputy, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, told a news conference in Hamburg that the
Bundesbank aimed to keep short-term German money market rates below 9 per
cent. He added, however: 'We will not allow ourselves to be pushed in one
direction or the other by market expectations. We will make a sovereign
decision.'
Both men were speaking at events to mark the election of new vice-presidents
to two regional German central banks.
Mr Schlesinger's remarks were interpreted on some markets as meaning that
further cuts in official Bundesbank interest rates may be more distant than
market analysts had expected. German interest rate levels have forced other
western governments to keep their own rates up to defend their currencies
against the strong D-Mark, despite a desire to make borrowing cheaper for
recession-hit industry and consumers.

<TEXT>
THE FATE of Ireland's coalition government hung in the balance last night,
as confusion surrounded an effort by a parliamentary inquiry to establish
the facts at the centre of a political row between the two coalition
partners.
Mr Des O'Malley - the leader of the Progressive Democrats (PDs), the junior
coalition partners - was accused last week of 'dishonesty' by Mr Albert
Reynolds, the prime minister, in evidence given at a parliamentary inquiry
into the beef industry.
The PDs had set a deadline of the cabinet meeting yesterday for Mr Reynolds
either to withdraw the accusation or face the loss of PD support in the
coalition.
In an eleventh-hour retreat from the ultimatum, Mr O'Malley said, in his
first public comment since the crisis began, that the decision on the PDs'
future position in the government would now be postponed until tomorrow,
pending a 'special investigation' by Mr Justice Liam Hamilton, the chairman
of the parliamentary inquiry, into the accusation.
However, Mr Hamilton said yesterday evening that Mr O'Malley's statement was
'inaccurate and misleading'. He said that he will not be holding a special
investigation into the allegations of dishonesty, but would seek to clarify
the facts during the normal course of the inquiry's hearings today.
Mr O'Malley said later that he 'regretted' the misunderstanding, but gave
the clearest signal yet that his party would withdraw from the coalition
tomorrow. 'There is no point in carrying on a charade and inviting the
people of this country to believe that this government can continue. It
can't and it won't,' he said.
The cabinet meeting yesterday proceeded without the two PD ministers,
confirming the impression that the coalition government has broken down for
all intents and purposes.
Verbal clashes in the local media between the coalition partners have
continued to resound. When Mr Seamus Brennan, the education minister,
defended Mr Reynolds's position on radio yesterday, Mr Michael McDowell, the
chairman of the PDs, accused him of using 'weak-minded weasel words', to
which Mr Brennan replied: 'I will not sit here and be insulted.'

MR John Major appeared last night to have made a breakthrough in his efforts
to thwart the Tory revolt in today's critical Commons debate on Maastricht
after five of the party's most prominent rightwing MPs indicated they were
preparing to give him their public backing.
With the prime minister fighting to avoid a House of Commons defeat that
would threaten the future of the treaty and his own political career,
leading members of the '92 group, including the chairman Sir George
Gardiner, met Mr Major and now plan to write to him saying they will support
the government today.
They urged colleagues to rally behind the prime minister, although they will
reserve their position in future.
Hard-line Euro-sceptics, numbering at least 30, still threaten the
government's majority, but the public endorsement from a previously
rebellious wing of the party could be critical in persuading other waverers
to swing behind the prime minister. Cabinet ministers are increasingly
confident of victory tonight.
Further help may yet come from some of the nine MPs of the Ulster Unionist
party who, although supposedly anti-Maastricht, may abstain or even vote
with the government. Earlier yesterday, Mr Major clashed with a European
commissioner over the implications of the Maastricht treaty. He described as
'very silly and ill-informed' a speech in which Mr Martin Bangemann said
Maastricht was a milestone on the road to a federal Europe.
Mr Bangemann, Germany's senior commissioner, is a vice-president of the
European Commission.
A group of 34 Euro-sceptic Tories and one Ulster Unionist met last night to
discuss tactics. Mr James Cran, Tory MP for Beverley, said: 'We have got 37
who will take a tough line tomorrow.'
The Ulster Unionists meet this morning, but will not decide their position
until just before the vote at 10pm - perhaps allowing time for ministers to
hint at incentives such as establishment of a Commons Northern Ireland
select committee or extra regional assistance for the province.
Downing Street refused to contemplate the possibility of defeat, saying the
prime minister expected to win. He saw more Tory MPs at the Commons
yesterday.
Tory MPs are under orders from their whips to attend Parliament tomorrow,
which would ensure an easy government win on a confidence motion, should
there be such a debate.
It was clear Mr Major was annoyed by the timing - if not the content - of
the speech Mr Bangemann gave at a Berlin conference on Europe's future.
Speaking in the Commons, the prime minister said Mr Bangemann was 'an
official' who had not been involved in European summits at Maastricht,
Lisbon or Birmingham.
The European Commission had made it 'absolutely clear these were personal
remarks by Mr Bangemann and did not reflect the views of the Commission', Mr
Major said.
'Nor, I can assure you, are they my views, the views of this government or
the views of any mainstream government in Europe,' he added. Mr Major was
backed last night by Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner, who said Mr
Bangemann had given 'a purely personal view'.
However, Mr Kenneth Baker, the former home secretary, said Mr Bangemann had
'let the cat out of the bag'.

<TEXT>
YUGOSLAVIA'S prime minister, Mr Milan Panic, yesterday narrowly survived a
no-confidence vote in the upper house of the federal parliament.
The attempt by followers of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to oust
Mr Panic failed after the vote of 18 to 17 in the 42-member house, which is
divided between deputies from Serbia and Montenegro.
Montenegro, the other member of the reconstituted Yugoslav federation, has
supported Mr Panic and Mr Dobrica Cosic, the president of Yugoslavia.
Since nominating Mr Panic as prime minister in June, Mr Milosevic has
orchestrated a campaign to oust him. Mr Panic and Mr Cosic have pledged to
democratise Serbia and stop the war in Bosnia. They have also called on the
Serbian president to resign.
Mr Panic lost a no-confidence motion in the lower house of parliament on
Monday. The lower house is dominated by Serbia's ruling Socialists and their
ultra-nationalist allies, who accused the federal leaders of treachery and
serving foreign interests. Mr Panic survived another no-confidence vote in
September.
Meanwhile, the future of the Bosnian peace negotiations in Geneva remained
uncertain following Monday's decision by the 'parliament' of the
self-declared Serbian Republic of Bosnia to withdraw from the talks unless
the republic was formally recognised by the international mediators, Mr
Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen.
Diplomats said they did not expect a unilateral Serb walk-out from the
negotiations. They noted the parliament's decision said constitutional
proposals made by the international mediators for a decentralised state with
7-10 autonomous regions were unaccept-able as 'the sole basis' of
negotiation.
Mr Nikola Koljevic, head of the Bosnian Serb delegation in Geneva, yesterday
handed Mr Vance a copy of the decision, and Mr Vance was due to see the
Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, last night.
Elsewhere, Croatia yesterday refused to grant sanctuary to thousands of
refugees fleeing Jajce, a town in central Bosnia seized by Serb forces on
Friday. Croatia is already sheltering over 600,000 refugees.

FT  04 NOV 92 / End of drink ration cheers the Faroese

<TEXT>
THE inhabitants of the rugged Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic are
getting their first taste of unrationed, over-the-counter alcohol after the
lifting of a Draconian 85-year-old drinks law, Reuter reports from
Copenhagen.
Until this week, each Faroese had to order liquor and wine from Denmark,
subject to individual rationing, and delivery would take place between eight
and 10 days later. Now, with the opening on Monday of the islands' first
liquor, wine and beer store, the waiting is over.
About 1,000 of the islands' 47,000 inhabitants lined up for the inauguration
of the monopoly store in the capital, Torshavn, to experience for the first
time what it is like to buy alcoholic drinks over the counter.
Before the law was lifted, the ration was 12 bottles of liquor from Denmark
every three months. Beer could be bought from local breweries, but had to be
ordered a day in advance.
Politicians on the Faroes, a self-governing Danish province, believe the
change will lead to a more moderate and relaxed drinking culture.
The original law was introduced to combat a serious drinks problem on the
islands, but people effectively circumvented it by ordering their maximum
rations to be on the safe side.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Owen claims wide acceptance of Bosnia proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE constitutional proposals for Bosnia and Hercegovina made by Mr Cyrus
Vance and Lord Owen, the United Nations and European Community peace
negotiators, have had a far wider acceptance than has so far been
recognised, the latter said in London yesterday.
Lord Owen, who was addressing the annual dinner of Britain's Diplomatic
Writers' Association, was speaking only a day after some of Bosnia's Serbian
leaders announced they were pulling out of the international peace talks in
Geneva.
They were reported to be withdrawing from the talks until their 'basic
demand' for an ethnic division of Bosnia was met. Lord Owen, however,
claimed that no-one had openly challenged the 'extremely strong human rights
safeguards' or the rigorous procedures whereby ethnic cleansing could be
reversed, 'over the years', by individuals wishing to return to their homes
in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
'On the fundamental point of the need for more than three provinces, not
just a three-way split between Moslem, Serb and Croat, it seems to have
passed unnoticed that we have won the support of the key Moslem and Croat
decision-makers,' Lord Owen said. Under the Vance-Owen proposals, Bosnia
would be divided into 7-10 units along economic, rather than ethnic lines.
The Croats, for instance, believed that there was a natural case for a
separate province encompassing Bosanki Brod, in Posavina, which was not
linked geographically to a province in West Hercegovina, Lord Owen said. In
this context, he stressed that there was no evidence to support the claim
that the Bosnian Serbs had forced their way into Bosanki Brod as a result of
a secret deal with the Croats.
Lord Owen said that, given the views of some of the Bosnian Serb leaders, it
had come as no surprise that they had rejected the peace negotiators'
proposals 'at this stage.' No more naked challenge to the authority of the
international community could be found than the statement by the head of the
Bosnian Serb army, General Ratko Mladic, who had said that his army and the
Serb republic was a fact. 'Whether the world wants to recognise it or not is
their affair,' the general had added.
But that was a challenge which the world would not shirk, Lord Owen said.
The principles adopted by last summer's London peace conference on
Yugoslavia were not just 'Boy Scout' maxims; they were based on realpolitik.
'It is not just morally wrong to tolerate ethnic cleansing and territorial
aggrandisement, but it is against our vital interests. To abandon those
principles would weaken us all when dealing with the problems created by the
collapse of the Soviet Union.' Moreover, the Islamic world would hold a
justified grievance against the world, and particularly Europe, for
centuries ahead, if it acquiesced in the Moslems being driven out of their
homes and living as a beleaguered people forever.

THE MAN alleged to have fronted the corruption scheme which brought the
current suspension from office of Brazil's President Fernando Collor is
planning to turn against him today during Latin America's first impeachment
trial.
Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, known as PC, seems to be furious over Mr Collor's
defence so far, which tries to pin all the blame on him. Today, he will end
his long silence over his former boss, hoping to reduce any forthcoming
criminal charges against himself.
Mr Augusto Farias, his brother and a congressman, was yesterday reported as
saying: 'The ex-president is treating my brother as an enemy and not as the
dedicated and loyal friend he has always been. PC has no option but to
unleash all his fire on Collor.'
The hotly awaited hearing may well be crucial in forming a verdict by the
Senate, which is trying Mr Collor on corruption charges and will impeach him
if it finds him guilty. The trial started last week. Yesterday, the first
prosecution witnesses were called to testify before a packed Senate. They
include Mr Luis Motta Veiga, former head of Petrobras, the state oil
company.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Canadian banks cut prime rate as recovery steadies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SPATE of encouraging economic statistics has lifted hopes that Canada's
recovery is at last on firm ground. Despite earlier warnings that a No vote
in last week's constitutional referendum would be a serious blow to investor
confidence, many economists are optimistic that uncertainty during the
referendum campaign has only slightly delayed the upswing.
Canadian banks yesterday implemented the second cut in their prime lending
rate since the referendum, bringing the rate down by a quarter of a
percentage point to 7.5 per cent. The prime rate jumped by two points in the
run-up to last week's vote.
Mr Ernie Stokes, chief economist at the Wefa consultancy group in Toronto,
predicted that the sharp rise in interest rates prior to the referendum
would delay the recovery by no more than about three months. Wefa forecasts
the prime rate will drop as low as 6.25 per cent next year.
Evidence of strengthening business conditions includes a 0.4 per cent
increase in Statistics Canada's composite leading indicator in August, the
biggest rise since last November.
The government also reported real growth of 0.5 per cent in gross domestic
product in August, pointing to an annualised expansion of about 2 per cent
in the third quarter. With the exception of some forestry and energy
companies, corporate profits showed a marked improvement between July and
September.
Economists expect a growth rate of about 2 per cent for 1992 as a whole,
rising to about 3 per cent next year. 'While this is a slow and
unspectacular recovery, it remains a recovery nonetheless,' said Mr Ravi
Bulchandani, of Goldman Sachs in New York.
The pace of the upswing is expected to depend heavily on the Bank of Canada,
which has so far kept monetary policy tight to avoid a plunge in the
Canadian dollar. With inflation running at slightly more than 1 per cent,
real interest rates remain high.
Mr John Crow, the central bank's governor, has indicated, however, that
while monetary stability is a priority the authorities have few immediate
concerns about inflation. Mr Crow said in a speech last week that inflation
had fallen faster than expected.
'What is particularly important is the fact that costs of production in
Canada are now under much better control,' he said.

MOODY'S Investors Service, the US rating agency, has extended its European
operations with the creation of a subsidiary in Spain, writes Richard
Waters.
The agency, which already has operations in London, Paris and Frankfurt, has
maintained its practice of opening offices from scratch rather than forming
joint ventures with local agencies, a method favoured by its rival, Standard
&amp; Poor's.
The move was prompted in part by legislation which will make securitisation
easier for Spanish borrowers, said Mr Jan Konstanty, managing director of
Moody's in London.

COMPANIA de Telefonos de Chile, the Chilean telecommunications company
quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, may place between Dollars 150m and
Dollars 200m of convertible bonds in US and European financial markets.
Claudio Garcia, CTC's financial vice-president, said the company's board
would meet this week to consider the bond issue. 'They will be 10-year bonds
convertible into shares after the third year, but we have not yet fixed the
coupon they will carry,' Mr Garcia said.
Goldman Sachs is to manage the placement, and CTC's present shareholders are
to be given first option in taking up the offer. Telefonica of Spain owns a
controlling 46 per cent stake in CTC.
CTC is the main local telephone company in Chile and controls a sizeable
portion of the long-distance and cellular telephone market. The bond issue
would help finance CTC's Dollars 500m investment outlays planned for 1993,
as well as reduce borrowings.
The company posted an accumulated net income of 46.27bn pesos (Dollars 123m)
for the first nine months of 1992.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Birds Eye on soya charges
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BIRDS Eye meat products were found to contain textured soya protein that was
not mentioned in the food description, Telford magistrates in Shropshire
heard yesterday.
Branded items described as 'pure ground beef with a hint of seasoning' or
'two pieces of southern fried chicken' were not all they might seem from the
packet descriptions, the prosecution alleged.
Birds Eye Walls Ltd, of Walton-on-Thames, Surrey - part of the Unilever
Group - denied seven charges brought by Shropshire County Council's Trading
Standards Department.
Four charges under the food labelling regulations said the name used for the
products was not sufficiently precise to tell a buyer of the true nature of
the food. Three others alleged false trade descriptions.
Mr Robin Spencer, prosecuting, said the case centred on the use of textured
vegetable protein in meat products and the way it was declared.
The soya protein content was listed in the ingredients but was not included
in the name of the products, even though it formed a substantial proportion
of their make-up. 'The prosecution do not suggest there is any dishonesty to
mislead but perhaps in the labelling Captain Birds Eye was sailing a little
close to the wind.'
When interviewed, Birds Eye allegedly said the soya was used to add texture
and strength to the product and prevent shrinking.
The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.

US TREASURY prices yesterday regained the ground lost on Monday as investors
calmly awaited the outcome of the presidential election.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 95
5/16 , yielding 7.645 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  1/8
at 99 21/32 , yielding 4.416 per cent.
Traders said turnover remained light as many participants sat out polling
day. Although the final opinion polls predicted a victory for Mr Bill
Clinton, the market had already discounted a Democrat win.
There was no one particular factor behind the gains. The day's only economic
news - a 0.3 per cent decline in September's leading indicators - was mildly
positive for the market. It suggested that the economy continues to move
sideways, rather than forward as would normally be expected at this stage of
the economic cycle.
Uncertainty over the size of the next quarterly refunding programme had
contributed to Monday's losses, so it came as a relief to investors when the
Treasury announced it would raise Dollars 37bn from the November operation,
slightly more than in the previous quarter but not as much as some players
in the market had feared.
UK government bonds ended firmer, helped by sterling's strength against the
D-Mark in the foreign exchange markets and a slightly improved political
background concerning the outcome of today's Maastricht debate.
The pound closed at DM2.42, from DM2.4030, lending a firmer tone to gilt
prices. On the political front, fears that the government would be unable to
muster a majority in the House of Commons today paving the way for a bill to
ratify the Maastricht treaty, are easing, dealers said.
The 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 rose from Monday's close of 120 1/32 to
trade at 120 7/32 by late afternoon.
GERMAN government bonds ended slightly firmer, but activity was subdued as
market participants awaited the US presidential election result.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 91.33 and dipped to a low of 91.31
before recovering to end at around 91.47, the high of the day. Most of the
interest was concentrated in the five-year sector of the market again,
dealers said.
Dealers said the market shrugged off statements by Mr Helmut Schlesinger,
Bundesbank president, who warned that further German rate cuts depended on
slower money supply growth. He added that moves on German rates depended on
further cuts in the budget deficit and on wage levels in the 1993 pay round.
ELSEWHERE in Europe, French government bonds strengthened, following
Monday's quarter-point cut in the key interest rates. The Treasury is due to
auction between FFr14bn and FFr16bn of government bonds tomorrow.
On the Matif futures exchange in Paris, the December bond futures contract
closed at 110.60, up 0.16 from late on Friday. The yield on the 8 1/2 per
cent bond due 2002 was unchanged from Monday at 8.17 per cent.
The Treasury said it would offer FFr14bn-FFr16bn of tap stock at its regular
monthly auction tomorrow when it plans to sell the 8 1/2 per cent bond due
2003 and the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2008.
New York's Commodity Exchange was today due to open its fledgling Eurotop
100 futures two hours earlier than usual, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago.
Trading in the Pan-European index will commence at 5.30am EST, although the
closing time of 4.15pm pm will not be altered.
The Comex, better known for its gold and silver futures contracts, opened
futures trading on the Eurotop 100 on October 26 and volume so far has
averaged just 1,000 contracts a day.
Mr David Halperin, Comex president, said the earlier trading hours were
expected to maximise the overlap between the futures market and the period
in which most of the underlying European stock markets were open.

FT  04 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: 'Soft' commission deals set
to spill into Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO-CALLED 'soft' commission agreements, which have become increasingly
commonplace in the equity market, are about to spill over into European bond
markets following a recent ruling from regulators in London.
Investors have traditionally not paid commissions on bond trades. As a
result, the development is likely to prompt concern among some fund
managers' clients about whether their interests are being harmed.
Soft commissions arrangements involve brokers refunding part of the
commissions they receive to a fund manager in the form of services.
Specific guidance on how these arrangements should work in fixed income
markets was only given to certain brokers a fortnight ago by the Securities
and Futures Authority, a self-regulatory organisation in London.
According to the SFA, brokers can issue contract notes to their fund manager
clients showing a single net price, including the broker's own mark-up, or
'commission'. However, the broker must send a complete statement at least
once a month detailing its own commissions, and this has to be shown to the
fund manager's client.
Hoenig, part of the US soft commission group, and Thamesway, owned by BZW,
have now both begun marketing soft commission services to bond investors. A
third house, Tiedemann Investment Research, is understood to have been
offering similar services in London for some time, though its president, Mr
Nicholas Bullman, refused to comment yesterday.
Hoenig said that fund managers' clients would not be harmed by the
development, since fund managers would only be able to deal if the soft
commission broker offered a price which was at least as good, after adding
in its own 'commission', as that quoted by at least two other market-makers.
Thamesway said that the extra service provided by an independent broker
would justify the 'commission' involved.
'As bonds have been a principal market to date, it is very important to do -
and be seen to do - a proper agency job,' said Ms Karen Morgan Thomas of
Thamesway.

FT  04 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: French bonds see more rate
cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of France took the bond market by surprise with its decision to cut
official interest rates on Monday.
However, given the stability of the French franc in the wake of the cuts,
many bond market analysts believe there is scope for a further easing in
French interest rates within the next few weeks, even without a simultaneous
reduction in German rates by the Bundesbank.
Hopes of a further interest rate cut are expected to boost the French
government bond market and economists are predicting a narrowing in the
French-German yield spread over the next couple of months.
Last week, the Bank of France lowered its five-to-10 day repurchase rate to
10.5 per cent from 13 per cent. That reversed a rise in the middle of
September, when the franc came under considerable speculative pressure. By
lowering the rate to 10.5 per cent, the Bank of France was seen as
signalling an end to the currency crisis.
Whereas the markets had expected the return of the five-to-10 day repurchase
rate to its pre-crisis level, Monday's announcement - of a cut in the
repurchase rate to 10.25 per cent and a quarter point cut in the
intervention rate to 9.35 per cent - came as a surprise.
'The franc has held up extremely well since the cut,' said Ms Marie Owens
Thomsen, international economist at Midland Montagu.
The franc traded at 3.3880/83 to the D-Mark yesterday, and Ms Owens Thomsen
predicts it will appreciate further to reach 3.37 by the end of the year.
She believes the Bank of France is allowing call money rates, currently at
9.5 per cent, to slip lower, testing the franc's ability to hold up in the
foreign exchange markets and making room for a small cut in official
interest rates.
'If the central bank allows market interest rates to fall and the franc
holds up, we could see another cut in the official interest rates,' she
said.
However, such a cut is likely to be limited to about 25 basis points, said
Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg Securities - though
if the Bundesbank cuts its key interest rates soon, the Bank of France would
have scope for a bigger easing.
Mr Adrian James, economist at NatWest Capital Markets, predicts the 10-year
French-German yield spread will fall from the current 79 basis points to 50
basis points over the next 12 months, given the strong economic fundamentals
in France.
Inflation at 2.6 per cent is well below German levels, and economic growth
of 2 per cent is forecast for this year.
While political concerns are likely to come to the fore in the run-up to the
general election next March, the immediate prospects for the bond market
appear favourable.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Bottomley saves consultant's job
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A HOSPITAL consultant who claims she was made redundant after criticising
patient care should continue in her job, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health
secretary, ruled yesterday.
Dr Helen Zeitlin, former consultant haematologist at a West Midlands
hospital, was told last year by health officals she would no longer be
needed because of a reduced workload. She claimed the real reason was that
she criticised nursing shortages at the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch,
Birmingham.

FT  04 NOV 92 / British Steel may cut shifts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH STEEL is considering extending Christmas holidays in its strip
division to reduce production, Catherine Milton writes.
However, the company emphasised that a final decision had not been taken,
refusing to disclose how many of its 3,000 workers at the Llanwern strip
production plant worked 15 shifts a week rather than the usual 21.
British Steel, one of Europe's most efficient steelmakers, said it would not
rule out redundancies.
It said it might temporarily halt shifts attracting premium pay, such as
those during unsocial hours.
British Steel could not say how many workers faced short-time working and
extended Christmas holidays. Market conditions were 'changing all the time'
and not all workers were likely to be affected in the same way.
British Steel said last week it would cut production of liquid steel by as
much as 20 per cent in the present quarter because of a decline in the
demand for steel products in the UK and in export markets.
The company said in June that the workforce would be cut to below 42,000 by
the end of the current fiscal year from 44,800 at the end of March.

FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: RBC sets aside an extra CDollars
900m for loan losses
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Bank of Canada, the country's biggest financial institution, is almost
doubling its 1992 loan loss provisions to reflect unexpectedly heavy
write-downs on its real estate portfolio and other corporate loans to
customers in the Toronto area.
The additional loan loss provisions and a one-time restructuring charge will
slash the bank's net earnings for fiscal 1992 to about CDollars 100m
(USDollars 83m), down from CDollars 983m in 1991.
The bank said yesterday it was setting aside an extra CDollars 900m in
provisions for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1992, which ended on October 31.
This would raise provisions for the year to CDollars 2.1bn, from an earlier
estimate of CDollars 1.2bn.
Restructuring costs of CDollars 130m will also be charged against income.
These charges will result in a fourth-quarter loss of about CDollars 480m,
or CDollars 1.65 per share.
The bank said more than half the additional write-down applied to 'a number
of accounts' in the commercial real estate industry.
Earlier this year, RBC added CDollars 300m to its loan-loss reserves,
largely to cover expected losses from CDollars 780m exposure to Olympia &amp;
York. But this was offset by an identical reversal in earlier provisions on
Third World loans.
RBC said the remaining write-downs were concentrated among corporate
customers around Toronto, among the hardest-hit parts of Canada during the
recession.
Non-performing loans on October 31 totalled about CDollars 3.7bn, a CDollars
500m increase from three months earlier. The bank said it had classified as
non-accrual accounts those which are still servicing their debts but which
may run into difficulty later on.
RBC said it expected to maintain its dividend and that its capital ratios
remained well above regulatory requirements. It said problems were confined
to its corporate loan portfolio and that its retail, treasury and securities
businesses were performing strongly.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Further fall reported in house prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES fell on average by 2.7 per cent last month, the biggest monthly
fall for two years, Nationwide Building Society said yesterday.
The drop is likely to increase pressure on the government to come up with
ways to help the housing market in the Autumn Statement on November 12.
It is the fifth successive monthly fall and follows September's 1.4 per cent
decline. The Halifax Building Society house price index, based on a larger
survey, showed a fall of 3.1 per cent in September, but the month was
considered atypical because of the ending of stamp duty relief in August.
Nationwide said: 'The cut-off date for our month is a few days earlier than
the Halifax's so we may be reflecting this month what we missed last month.'
The Halifax house price index will be issued later this week.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide, attributed the fall to
the ending of stamp duty relief and economic uncertainty.
He said: 'Two significant events affected the housing market in the latter
half of September - the end of the stamp duty holiday for house buyers and
the interest rate volatility around the time of the UK's withdrawal from the
exchange rate mechanism.
'The uncertainty caused by these events has continued into October. In
addition, uncertainty about the general economy and employment prospects
continues to dampen the confidence of potential house buyers.'
The figure is disappointing as house-buying normally picks up by October. Mr
Bob Pannell of the Council of Mortgage Lenders said activity was usually
robust in October.
The drop brought the average house price down by Pounds 1,491 from the
previous month to Pounds 53,038 according to Nationwide's house price index.
House prices in October were 6.6 per cent lower than in the same month last
year.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Firefighters are awarded 4.9% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT plans to hold down public sector pay were challenged yesterday
with the announcement of a 4.9 per cent pay increase for firefighters who
work for local authorities.
The increase was made under a formula which lifts the pay of Britain's
42,000 firefighters retrospectively in line with the growth in earnings
received by the top 25 per cent highest-paid adult male manual workers.
These earnings grew by 6.2 per cent in the year to April according to the
government's recent New Earnings Survey. But the formula projects this
figure forward to November to take account of more recent pay awards in the
private and public sectors.
The Local Government Management Board, which negotiates on behalf of local
authorities, described the 12-month deal, which will come into effect on
Saturday, as the last of this year's public-sector pay round. The
government, however, is likely to see it as among the first of next year's
pay agreements, and thus a test of its resolve to hold down public-sector
pay rises to about 2 per cent in 1993.
The government cannot intervene directly to stop local authorities paying
the firefighters' increase but it might not make full allowances to local
authorities in next year's Rate Support Grant to cover the costs from April
1993.
The management board said the award was the lowest ever produced by the fire
pay policy, established in 1977.
The major policy committee of the Civil Service unions yesterday discussed
speculation that the government may want to impose a public-sector pay
freeze.
Mr Bill Brett, chairman of the committee, said union members would 'react
strongly' to any such proposals. 'Any attempt to single out public sector
pay, or Civil Service pay, will be grossly discriminatory,' he said.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Government policy on mergers reaffirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPETITION IN all sectors of the economy is 'the spur to increased
efficiency and innovation', Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister,
said yesterday.
His speech to the European Policy Forum, a rightwing think tank, was a
reaffirmation of the government's commitment to competition as the best
weapon against industrial decline.
Mr Hamilton was speaking on the day after Mr Heseltine, trade and industry
Secretary, apparently signalled a change of policy by waving through British
Airways' takeover of Dan-Air in spite of concerns about a reduction in
competition.
Mr Hamilton denied that the merger policy prevented UK companies from
becoming big enough to compete internationally. In general, the more
competitors there were in a market the fewer competition concerns there
would be.
That was not to say, however, that there could not be adequate competition
where one company had a very significant share of the market.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Victory For Clinton: Schemes for job creation are ready
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton has plans ready to meet members of the new Congress as
early as possible, in order to present a job-creation package soon after his
presidential inauguration on January 20, writes Nancy Dunne.
The jobs plan would send 'a strong signal' to the financial markets of Mr
Clinton's commitment to reduce the huge US budget deficit, according to Mr
Gene Sperling, his campaign economic policy director.
Speaking in Little Rock, he said Mr Clinton would seek immediate
congressional passage of the two components of his economic plans which he
believed would be most effective in creating jobs: a Dollars 20bn (Pounds
12.2bn) infrastructure programme and an investment tax credit for business.
This would be aimed at giving a quick lift to employment in public and
private sectors.
'He will probably draw criticism because he does not want to rely on deficit
spending,' Mr Sperling said. 'He feels he has to draw a balance between
getting the economy going and the need to send a strong signal that he is
committed to reducing the deficit.'
The governor would be focusing on a shift from consumption to investment
spending, Mr Sperling said.
The idea was to halt the depletion of tax revenues created by the recession,
as the government collects less in taxes and pays out more for social
programmes.
Mr Clinton's promised tax cut for the middle class was not an immediate
priority. It was a 'fairness issue' to compensate the middle class for the
higher taxes it had begun to pay in the 1980s, according to the Clinton
camp.
Mr Sperling said it was possible the Clinton economic team would be able to
devise a plan to implement the tax cuts 'to provide some stimulation, but
mostly we want an investment-led recovery'.
A Clinton administration would move on its economic programme swiftly, he
said.
'Every week, every month, counts when people are out of work,' declared Mr
Sperling.
'George Bush never acted like there was a domestic crisis. People saw his
energy for only one month during the Gulf war. The rest of the time they
never had a feeling that he thought that their health care, their jobs, the
economy, the education of their children were really that important.'
He said President Bush had given the impression the US had been caught up in
a global recession, when it had really gone into recession earlier.
Talks under way in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade were 'a high
priority' for Mr Clinton'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MS CAROL Moseley Braun (right) will become the first black woman in the
Senate, after winning the Illinois seat, writes George Graham. All the
evidence suggests it was her gender, rather than her race, which was the
determining factor in her appeal to voters; at present the Senate boasts
only two women members of any race.
Her Republican opponent, Mr Rich Williamson, had struggled in vain against
anonymity and remained almost totally unknown to voters right up to polling
day.
Ms Braun, by contrast, spent much of the campaign posing for the covers of
glossy magazines, helped by a magnetic smile and a warm personality.
She ran into trouble in the final weeks of the campaign because of reports
that she had committed financial irregularities to ensure that her mother
continued to qualify for Medicaid, which provides medical care for the poor.
But sceptics' forecasts that this scandal would allow latent racism to come
into play, and frustrate her bid for the seat, proved to be unfounded.

THE DEMOCRATS were faring well in the 12 gubernatorial races which took
place yesterday, with early returns suggesting a net gain for the party of
three state houses.
Mr Evan Bayh, a liberal Democratic incumbent in generally Republican
Indiana, held his office, as did Governor Gaston Caperton in West Virginia.
In Vermont, Governor Howard Dean kept the job he entered last year when
Republican Governor Richard Snelling died.
Rhode Island's Bruce Sundlun was also re-elected.
The Democrats captured three state houses, however. Mr Jim Hunt, governor of
North Carolina from 1977 to 1985, will return to the mansion after defeating
Republican Lieutenant-Governor Jim Gardner. In Missouri, Democratic
Lieutenant-Governor Mel Carnahan beat Republican attorney-general William
Webster in a race dominated by the abortion issue.
In Delaware, the Democrats also gained the governor's mansion when former
Congressman Thomas Carper won.
A brighter spot for Republicans was New Hampshire, a traditionally
Republican state where Mr Steven Merrill defeated a strong challenge from
Mrs Deborah Arnesen, a Democratic state legislator. She had committed
herself to a state income tax.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Democrat sweeps into Oval Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BILL CLINTON, the 46-year-old governor of Arkansas, last night completed
an improbable 15-month odyssey and became the first Democrat in 16 years to
win the US presidency.
President George Bush, conceding defeat, promised that his administration
would work closely with Mr Clinton's team to ensure a smooth transition of
power. 'There is important work to be done . . . so we will get behind this
new president and wish him well,' a clearly deflated Mr Bush told supporters
at his campaign headquarters in Texas.
By 11pm on the east coast, the television networks projected that Mr Clinton
had won the midwestern state of Ohio, giving him more than the 270 votes in
the electoral college needed to become the country's 42nd president.
Moments later it was announced that he had swept through the west coast,
transforming an already impressive win into a landslide comparable to that
achieved by the man he despatched from the White House last night, Mr Bush.
His great triumph was built steadily all evening. He destroyed the
Republican base in the industrial north, won everything going from New York
on upwards, and divided the last great Republican bastion, the deep south.
His sweep of California, the Pacific northwest and Hawaii meant, according
to television projections, that Mr Clinton had carried 31 states with 362
electoral college votes, to only eight for Mr Bush with a meagre 64
electoral votes. Still unresolved were close contests in Mr Bush's adopted
home, Texas, and Florida.
Mr Ross Perot, the independent candidate, carried no states but was scoring
about 15 per cent of the popular vote. With about one third of the nation's
precincts reporting, Mr Clinton had about 45 per cent of the vote to Mr
Bush's 40 per cent, a gap that was expected to widen with the impact of the
west coast.
Mr Clinton went for an evening run in Little Rock and admitted that it
'looked good.' Mr Ron Brown, the elated chairman of the Democratic Party,
pronounced that the country could not stand four more years of Mr Bush and
had voted overwhelmingly for 'a new kind of Democrat'.
Early returns from Congress confirmed the inevitable, that the new
Democratic president would be working with an overwhelmingly Democratic
legislature. The only noteable Democratic casualty in the Senate was Terry
Sanford in North Carolina. It appeared, with several races outstanding, that
the Democrats were about to gain one or two seats in the upper house.
Women scored some impressive victories. Ms Carol Mosely Braun, the Democrat
from Illinois, became the first black woman ever elected to the US Senate.
Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer were returned to the Senate from
California and Ms Patty Murray carried the state of Washington.
Mr Clinton put together his majority with a rush when the northeastern and
midwestern states began to report. Within minutes of the polls closing at
8pm, eastern time, the networks announced that he had won Illinois,
Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Jersey, Missouri, Maryland and Connecticut, all
of which Mr Bush had taken four years ago. Only in Ohio were the two leading
candidates running neck and neck.
Mr Clinton's southern breakthrough was first evident in Georgia and then in
Kentucky. He easily won his native Arkansas and Tennessee, home of the next
vice-president, Senator Al Gore. Even Mr Bush's adopted home state of Texas
was thought too close to call, as were Florida, Louisiana and North
Carolina. The president was able to hold on to South Carolina and Virginia.
Mr Clinton also walked away with the northeast. New York and Massachusetts
were no surprise, but Maine, where Mr Bush has a holiday home, Vermont and
New Hampshire have been solid Republican territory for years. Vermont, for
example, has voted for a Democrat only once since 1860.
He even cracked a singular Republican monolith in the southwestern states,
by carrying Colorado and New Mexico, and was running Mr Bush close in
Arizona and Wyoming.
Mr Bush's early consolations were few and far between. He did hold on to
Indiana, vice-president Dan Quayle's home state, but by nothing like the
60-40 per cent margin in 1988. His victories in Virginia, Oklahoma and South
Carolina were slim in comparison with four years ago.
Even in Indiana, according to the centralised network exit poll service,
voters found Senator Gore more qualified than Mr Quayle by a 52-37 per cent
margin.
Exit poll trends, mostly from the eastern and central parts of the country,
suggested that voters, who apparently turned out in greater numbers than in
any recent election, were much more influenced by the issues stressed by Mr
Clinton and, to an extent, Mr Perot than by Mr Bush.
Some 43 per cent thought the economy and jobs were the major issues in the
election, followed by the budget deficit (23 per cent) and health care (21
per cent). Eight out of 10 of those surveyed had a pessimistic view of the
economy and 67 per cent disapproved of the president's management of it.
Of the central messages of the two main candidates, 37 per cent thought that
the ability to bring about change was an essential quality in a candidate,
while only 14 per cent rated honesty and untrustworthiness as most
important. In fact more people felt Mr Bush had not told the truth over
Iran-Contra than did Mr Clinton on the draft. Only 8 per cent rated foreign
policy experience as top of their list. Mr Clinton also seems to have
profited immensely from the gender gap.

<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR firmed against leading currencies in volatile Tokyo trading this
morning, as it became clearer that Mr Bill Clinton was on his way to victory
in the US presidential election.
In early Far East trade, US and UK banks, waiting for election results, sold
dollars for D-Marks and sterling on technical position adjustments. But the
start of the Clinton landslide prompted speculation of higher US interest
rates due to a tighter fiscal policy, triggering dollar-buying.
Traders in Tokyo said hopes that Mr Clinton would rebuild the US economy
also pushed up the dollar. The US currency, firmed to DM1.5745 at lunchtime
after opening at DM1.5683, while sterling slipped to Dollars 1.5415 from
Dollars 1.5500 at the opening.
Rumours that a Clinton aide wanted the dollar to fall to Y100 prompted
speculators to sell dollars for yen. But the US currency ended the morning
at Y123.35 against an opening Y122.5.
Dealers in New York this morning said that, although trading was quiet, the
reaction of currency markets to the early results showing a clear Clinton
victory was predominantly favourable. Mr Michael Dessa, head of foreign
exchange trading at Citibank, said: 'The landslide is regarded as a
positive. The fact that Clinton will have a clear mandate means he will be
able to affect many of his policies in his first year.'
London dealers reported extremely volatile trading, with the dollar
strengthening markedly as Tokyo traders took their lunchtime break.
The election results had little impact on Japanese share prices. The Nikkei
index was down some 50 points at around 16,800 at mid-session, with brokers
saying investors were more concerned about poor corporate results.
Hong Kong share prices fell initially. Brokers said that although a Clinton
win was expected, some investors felt uncomfortable with the outcome.

<TEXT>
TO THE end he was unconventional. While Bill Clinton and George Bush
practised political correctness and waited until the last polls had closed
on the west coast, Ross Perot threw in the towel half an hour early.
But what a towel and what a concession: the man who had spent an estimated
Dollars 35m (Pounds 21m) of his own money on television advertising in the
last two and a half weeks did not really admit defeat at all. He said 'the
battle was only beginning'.
He did concede that 'the American people have spoken, they have chosen
Governor Clinton, let's give him a round of applause'. Perhaps half a dozen
people in a crowded Dallas hotel ballroom did as they were bid.
But Mr Perot had taken his time getting there. 'You are the people who have
done it all,' he proclaimed and ordered the band to play 'When the Saints go
marching in'.
'You call the shots, you're the boss,' he then shouted, and ordered the band
to play his new theme song, 'Crazy'. He danced with his wife then his
daughter; the television networks, not exactly grateful for the largesse he
had showered on them, did not know what to do and cut away to non-political
commercials.
They returned in time for the world to hear him say 'we're keeping going as
long as you want us to keep on going'.
He used one of his favourite aphorisms - 'I'm just the grain of sand in the
oyster, and I irritate the oyster until the pearl comes out'.
Finally he got round to saying Mr Clinton had won and he deserved all the
support he could get.

<TEXT>
The number of unemployed in Italy has reached 2.66m, equivalent to 11 per
cent of the active workforce, according to the latest quarterly figures
published by Istat, the national statistics office, writes Robert Graham.
This compares with a 10.5 per cent jobless rate 12 months ago. However, the
figures cover the year to last July, and union officials believe the number
of jobless has accelerated this autumn. As many as 71 per cent of the
unemployed are aged 29 and below, mostly first-time job seekers.
This confirms the reluctance of employers to take on new labour in the
recession and while employment laws remain so rigid. Meanwhile, industry
shed 148,000 in the same period. Among the worst affected areas are Lombardy
and Piedmont, Italy's industrial heartland.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US financial markets seemed almost unnaturally calm in the approach to
yesterday's presidential election. For the markets, President George Bush is
a known quantity, while they have also had plenty of time to get used to the
idea of a Bill Clinton presidency.
The generally positive mood on Wall Street also reflects the slightly better
tone of some recent economic reports. The 2.7 per cent economic growth
reported for the third quarter overstated the economy's momentum and
appeared to come too late to give President Bush's campaign much of a lift;
but it was nevertheless better than expected.
The news this week that the Purchasing Managers' Index moved back above 50
per cent last month, signalling a mild expansion of manufacturing industry,
was also seen as a good omen.
But economic clouds continued to mar hopes of better times. Figures
yesterday showed a 0.3 per cent decline in the official index of leading
economic indicators in September, a blow after a decline of similar
magnitude in August.
Officials said the index of coincident indicators, designed to measure the
current state of the economy, was even weaker and would have fallen 0.8 per
cent in September but for distortions caused by Hurricane Andrew.
The behaviour of financial markets in the final weeks of the election
campaign has been entirely logical. As polling day neared, share prices and
the dollar either held their ground or strengthened, while bond prices
weakened steadily.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 9.73 points yesterday to 3,252.48.
The traditionally pro-Republican stock markets have approached the
possibility of a President Clinton with surprising equanimity. When the
Democratic challenger retained his big lead in the polls after the
Republican convention in August investors began scrambling to prepare for a
Clinton victory.
Stocks expected to benefit from higher government spending and stronger
economic growth rose, while stocks likely to suffer from increased
government regulation or higher taxes fell. The overall result was mixed and
by mid-autumn a Democratic triumph was fully priced into equities.
The market ultimately concluded that President Clinton would be moderately
bullish for stocks as he would do more to boost the economy in 1993 than
would a second-term President Bush.
The Republicans' late surge in the polls at the end of October had little
impact on equities. If anything, prices weakened as the market grew jittery
because an element of uncertainty had been introduced.
The dollar, meanwhile, drew strength from the polls showing a likely Clinton
win, because under the Democrats economic growth would be expected to gather
pace and interest rates would be expected to rise.
The prospect of higher interest rates under a Clinton presidency, however,
partly explains why the bond markets have performed so poorly during the
final weeks of the campaign. Many investors in government securities fear
that a Democrat-controlled White House and Congress would mean three things:
rising interest rates, rising inflation, and a widening budget deficit.
The fears are predicated on an aggressive fiscal stimulus during the first
few months of a Clinton presidency.
However, some close advisers to Mr Clinton, such as Mr Robert Shapiro, have
repeatedly denied that any fiscal stimulus is planned.
'The mood is one of hope,' said Mr Stephen Roach, a senior economist at
Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street investment bank. 'Markets are willing to
give a new president a chance.'
He predicted a brief honeymoon period for such an incoming administration.
'The next test for the market will be the new economic appointees and the
detailed policy proposals for next year.'
Mr David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities, was more cautious.
'The stockmarket has yet to come to grips with the rise in long bond yields
in recent weeks.' Unless the fiscal roots of bond markets fears were
addressed by a new Clinton administration, higher long-term rates would
impair the recovery next year.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Victory For Clinton: Boy from Hope who beat the odds - A
lifelong passion for the workings of government has shaped the next
president
</HEADLINE>

NOBODY becomes president of the US by accident or acclamation. Even those
vice-presidents who have inherited the job by dint of resignation, natural
death or assassination have been ambitious and successful enough to put
themselves a heartbeat away from the Oval Office and thus to lay reasonable
claim to the position.
William Jefferson Clinton, born Blythe, still only 46 years old, has been
running for president for a very long time. His has been a career never
removed from politics and government and, if each step along his long road
from a modest beginning in Hope, Arkansas, has not been entirely
predictable, there is no question about his devotion to his chosen trade,
nor about his ultimate goal.
Mr Clinton's father was killed in an accident three months before he was
born and his grandparents were influential in his early years as his mother
earned additional nursing qualifications away from home. She remarried and
he and his brother had a difficult relationship with their stepfather, who
suffered from alcoholism. Bill was educated at state schools in Arkansas.
His political interests were apparent early. As a teenager he shook hands in
the White House with John Kennedy and preserved a filmed record. At 23 he
wrote to his draft board that he was registering for military service
because he wanted to preserve his 'political viability'. He was in the thick
of the civil rights movement as an undergraduate in Washington, demonstrated
against the Vietnam war in London, and helped organise Texas for George
McGovern in 1972.
He was attorney general of his state in his 20s and governor by the time he
was 32, one of the youngest ever to assume such a position.
Defeated after one two-year term, he went back to the drawing board, saw
what he had done wrong and won re-election, a more pragmatic, less
confrontational politician. He began to seek to change the balance of power
inside the national Democratic party, mostly through his leading role in the
resolutely centrist - and southern dominated - Democratic Leadership
Conference.
In the summer of 1987, when he announced he would not seek the Democratic
presidential nomination the following year, he admitted he had his eye on
the presidency some day. Until a surprisingly poor keynote address at the
Democratic convention of 1988, he was considered one of the rising stars of
his party. In 1989, he contemplated not seeking re-election as governor, so
as to devote himself exclusively to a run at the presidency.
In the back of his mind was undoubtedly the thought that although Arkansas
had produced conspicuous figures on Capitol Hill - J. William Fulbright,
legendary chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, and Wilbur
Mills, doyen of ways and means in the House, for example - it had not placed
anybody on a national ticket since 1928, and then in the junior position.
There was also the feeling that Jimmy Carter had given obscure southern
governors a bad name. But Mr Clinton stuck with his state. He is now the
longest serving governor in the nation. He was not rated in the first tier
of Democratic aspirants 15 months ago but, one by one, the party
heavyweights declined to take on President George Bush, then immensely
popular, leaving Mr Clinton the best prepared and the best organised of a
disparate crew.
By the start of this year, he had earned the position of front runner - some
say he was 'anointed' such by a favourably disposed media - and the primary
season demonstrated that the early judgment was not misplaced. His
determination was more than evident as he overcame waves of charges about
his personal behaviour.
Both then, and during the campaign proper, he has been the subject of
scrutiny to an unprecedented extent, to the point that it cannot be said of
him, as it was of Mr Carter, that he comes to the presidency a closed or
under-read book. This does not mean that it is possible to predict with
great precision how he will perform and what he will do as president, but
certain salient characteristics are apparent.
His intelligence, for example, is not in dispute. Georgetown, Oxford as a
Rhodes Scholar and Yale Law School constitute a substantial academic
pedigree, particularly for a small-town youth from a state like Arkansas.
His wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, from suburban Chicago, whom he married in
1975, is of a comparable intellectual stature: she was first in her class at
Wellesley, also Yale Law School, and subsequently a successful advocate with
the most influential law firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, and as a policy
activist on issues such as children's rights.
The common view is that she is more liberal than her husband. She was known
socially and professionally by her maiden name until after Mr Clinton's
first defeat in Arkansas. But it cannot be said, after all they have been
through this year, that they do not form a formidable partnership.
For political reasons, Mrs Clinton has taken a more deferential role in
public in recent months but she is likely to be a power in the White House,
perhaps along the lines of Eleanor Roosevelt. Though more legally qualified
to serve as attorney general than was Robert Kennedy, appointed to the post
by his brother, a cabinet position for her is unlikely.
Both Mr Clinton and his wife are 'policy wonks' - they like to get into the
interstices of policy, to argue fine points into the dead of night and to
try to find the right mix of what may be contrary proposals. Mr Carter had
similar tendencies, successfully deployed during Camp David.
Mr Clinton, however, comes to the White House with much greater familiarity
of most of the main issues of the day than could be said of Mr Carter 16
years ago, largely because of the reforms in education, training and health
that he has introduced in Arkansas.
He seems to like the presentation of different points of view and subsequent
reconciliation of those differences. It may be a help that he clearly is
beholden to few, if any, of the traditional power blocs inside his party,
and saddled with little personal ideological baggage, beyond the conviction
that government, properly applied, can be good for the nation. In this
respect he is very much the product of his formative years - the 1960s - and
the antithesis of the Reagan-Bush era.
His southernness is an important ingredient in his make-up. There remains a
neighbourliness to the south which requires politicians to keep their feet
on the ground, particularly in smaller states such as Arkansas. It certainly
was the case throughout the long campaign that Mr Clinton, far more than his
Democratic rivals and President Bush, seemed able to understand and
articulate the concerns of average people.
Mr Clinton grew up in the south at a time of huge social and economic
change. Like many of his generation from the region, he is at ease with
minorities, especially blacks.
He sends his daughter, Chelsea, to a thoroughly integrated state school. He
sensed that to take on the Rev Jesse Jackson was not necessarily to
sacrifice black support, a calculation that Walter Mondale and Michael
Dukakis, the previous Democratic candidates, never felt confident enough to
make. The Baptist rhythms of his speech, when he is on form, are not an
artifice.
The contemporary southern heritage mixes social liberalism with financial
conservatism. Mr Clinton has been obliged by state law for his 12 years as
governor to balance the Arkansas budget. This does not translate into
support for the constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget, but
it does mean that he is accustomed to taking tough budgetary decisions and
it does mean that he favours the 'line item' veto, whereby offending
elements in an omnibus bill may be identified and struck out.
The south's progress over the last 25 years has also been predicated on the
creation of a favourable climate for the private sector, in which Arkansas
under Mr Clinton's direction has been no exception. He prefers co-operation,
not confrontation, between business and government and has praised the
German and Japanese models in this respect. Conventional liberals are uneasy
with his willingness to accommodate business at the expense, they allege, of
the environment and the workforce.
Southerners have also been traditionally 'conservative' on foreign policy
issues, including support for a strong military. Mr Clinton obviously lacks
formal foreign policy experience, and he did not exactly encourage
discussion of foreign policy in the campaign, other than to pick holes in
the Bush record where necessary and to support it where appropriate. But
this does not denote either a lack of interest or knowledge in the world
outside. Indeed he seems to understand that the end of the cold war offers
the opportunity for new approaches, including the evolution towards a
leaner, more flexible military. His foreign policy advisers have been
noteably mainstream.
As a Democrat, therefore, he is different in the sense that he does not
appear to be either isolationist or protectionist, the prevalent trends in
the party for much of the last dozen years. But this does make him easier to
read. He certainly comes to the office having spoken volumes about every
known subject but, perhaps because of the very profusion of his words, with
some of the contradictions as evident as some of the consistencies.
An Arkansas mafia has been with him over the years, but it is nothing like
as large nor as central as Mr Carter's Georgian crew and is supplemented by
his old academic friends, including several Rhodes Scholars, and by his
political network.
The style, therefore, that Mr Clinton may bring to Washington is likely to
be eclectic. He likes popular music, answers to the nickname Elvis and has
played the saxophone on late night television; he hits golf balls and goes
running, the latter because of a tendency to gain weight; his taste in
literature is said to be catholic: he likes a social drink and plays cards.
But mostly he likes to talk and mostly about what makes government work -
and very late into the night.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Victory For Clinton: Incumbents ride out election storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONGRESSMEN of both parties had braced themselves for a massacre of the
incumbents; in the end, however, the traditional advantages of incumbency -
coupled, for the Democrats, with the presidential coat-tails of Governor
Bill Clinton - seem to have prevailed in yesterday's congressional
elections.
The most closely contested races, of course, were also the slowest to show a
reliable result. Yet by 11pm Eastern time, only two notable incumbents had
fallen to their challengers: Senator Terry Sanford of North Carolina and
Senator Robert Kasten of Wisconsin.
Even Senator Sanford's defeat at the hands of Mr Lauch Faircloth, a
Republican businessman, was scarcely typical. His open-heart surgery a month
before the election raised doubts about his physical fitness to serve
another six-year term.
In Wisconsin, however, Mr Russell Feingold, a little known Democratic state
legislator, fought a humorous outsider's campaign to defeat Mr Kasten.
Democratic women enjoyed a triple success on the west coast as Dianne
Feinstein and Barbara Boxer won the two Senate seats at stake in California
and, further north, Patty Murray triumphed in the Senate race in Washington
state.
In the House of Representatives, some of the incumbents who had appeared to
be most at risk won re-election: in Kentucky, one of the first states to
close its polls, Republican congressmen Harold Rogers and Jim Bunning were
among the earliest to be returned, along with Democrat Romano Mazzoli.
In North Carolina, Democrats Tim Valentine and Martin Lancaster were
returned, as was Nick Rahall in West Virginia.
Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican minority whip at the
top of every Democratic hit list, claimed victory in his district after one
of the most venomous campaigns.
Some pundits had held their breath for what would have been one of the
biggest upsets of all, the defeat in Illinois of Congressman Dan
Rostenkowski, chairman of the House ways and means committee; it did not
take place.
The first Senate results to be declared showed incumbents winning
re-election in Alabama, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland,
Oklahoma and Vermont. Even Senator John Glenn, who had faced a bitter
onslaught from his Republican challenger, Mr Michael DeWine, over his
involvement in the Keating Savings and Loan scandal, won his race in Ohio.
Senator Ernest Hollings, too, won a sixth Senate term in South Carolina in a
close race.
On the Republican side Senator John McCain, another who had been tarred with
the Keating brush, won re-election in Arizona and Senator Alfonse D'Amato
was expected to win a fierce battle against Mr Robert Abrams in New York.
With 80 per cent of the votes counted, Mr D'Amato - who spent millions of
dollars on negative television commercials - had 51 per cent against 49 per
cent for Mr Abrams. The senator is a right-wing populist who distanced
himself from President Bush.
Mr D'Amato, although he has been investigated on several alleged corruption
charges and was even censured by the Senate ethics committee for
systematically misusing his Senate office, managed to fling plenty of mud
and received plenty back from Mr Abrams.
One of the closest Senate races was in Colorado, where Democratic
Congressman Ben Nighthorse Campbell was running neck-and-neck in opinion
polls with Republican businessman Terry Considine.
But Mr Campbell - a Cheyenne jeweller, cattle rancher and Olympic judo
champion who is the only Native American in Congress - edged out Mr
Considine to take the seat vacated by Senator Tim Wirth.
Early returns for the House showed mostly incumbents winning re-election.
They included Socialist Congressman Bernard Sanders, the only independent in
the entire Congress, who retained his seat in Vermont.
Results were not yet available for the sitting members who had been most
damaged by their abuse of the generous overdraft facilities of the House's
private bank.
Democratic campaign managers said before yesterday's voting that their
polling suggested a consistent 10 per cent disadvantage for incumbents;
Congressman Guy Vander Jagt, chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, who was himself defeated this year in a primary,
estimated the drag at 20 to 30 per cent.
Even without the collapse in public esteem for Congress, many sitting
members faced hard re-election battles.
US House districts are redrawn after the census every 10 years.
With population still moving from the north and east towards the west and
south, many sitting members have seen their districts dwindle or disappear
altogether.
All told, Democratic campaign managers estimate that 34 Democratic
incumbents were adversely affected by redistricting, and a dozen
Republicans.
Redistricting has brought a substantial increase in the number of districts
where most voters belong to ethnic minorities to comply with the Voting
Rights Act.
Among the beneficiaries was Ms Eva Clayton, a Democrat who last night became
the first black woman ever to represent North Carolina in Congress.
Although it was still too early to make any projection of the party
composition of the new Congress, Democratic party officials confidently
predicted that there would be no change in their party's domination of both
the House and the Senate.
Before voting began, Democrats said they expected a net loss of between 20
and 25 seats in the House, not enough to dent their 101-seat majority.
In the Senate, which the Democrats previously controlled by 57 seats to the
Republicans' 43, Republican hopes of reclaiming the majority faded long ago.
Their greatest concern in recent weeks has been whether they could prevent
the Democrats from picking up three additional seats.
The 60-seat figure would be critical to the prospects of pushing through a
legislative agenda, as it would deprive the Republicans of the 40-seat bloc
which under Senate rules is enough to sustain a filibuster and so hold up
any legislation indefinitely.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CUBA and Russia signed trade and shipping accords yesterday and apparently
agreed to keep open an electronic intelligence-gathering station once run by
the Soviet armed forces on the communist-ruled island, Reuter reports from
Havana.
The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said the accords, including provision
for a possible sugar-for-oil deal, were signed in Moscow by Mr Lionel Soto,
Cuban vice-president, and Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russia's deputy prime
minister for foreign economic affairs.
The agreements appeared to be the most important reached between Havana and
Moscow since the break-up of the Soviet Union, the Caribbean island's main
political ally and economic supplier for three decades.
Prensa Latina quoted Mr Soto as having said the two sides were also seeking
a third partner to help complete a nuclear power station until recently
being built in Cuba with Soviet aid.
Cuban President Fidel Castro suspended work on the plant on September 5,
saying the country could not afford to accept terms offered by Russia to
finish it.
Mr Soto said guarantees were needed to ensure the supply of nuclear fuel to
the Cuban plant, according to Prensa Latina.
The agency described the accords as 'important for the future development of
bilateral relations'. It quoted Mr Soto as having said they would help to
widen and stabilise ties between the two countries.
Prensa Latina said the bilateral agreements, valid for 1993, covered trade,
economic co-operation, shipping and the 'permanence in Cuba of the ex-Soviet
radio-electronic centre'.
This was a reference to a military signals intelligence facility at Lourdes
and believed to be one of the biggest operated by the Soviet military in the
western hemisphere during the cold war.
Cuba and Russia agreed in September to withdraw the last remaining former
Soviet combat troops on the island. Russian officials said at the time that
the Lourdes installation, now the responsibility of the Russian government,
would be the subject of separate talks.

FT  04 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Rumours surface of jumbo Swedish issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUMOURS about a further jumbo borrowing by the Kingdom of Sweden, this time
in US dollars, dominated the international bond market yesterday.
The talk is that the next stage of the country's borrowing programme could
be for up to Dollars 2bn over five years under a global programme, at a
spread of between 50 and 60 basis points over comparable US Treasury bonds.
'It's a question of when rather than if,' said one banker. 'But you could
say the same of several sovereigns.'
Rarity was a key word among the new issues which emerged. The
quality-sensitive Swiss market is pausing to catch its breath after the
recent volume of paper, particularly in private placements, but quality
remains in demand.
Lead-manager UBS described BMW Finance, which is raising SFr150m through an
eight-year public issue, as an attractive name with scarcity value with
particular appeal to retail investors. Other banks said the issue was more
aggressively priced than the quality merits, although the rarity value
helped it trade within fees in the grey market.
Also described as having rarity value was the Fl 300m eight-year issue from
Akzo, the Dutch chemicals and pharmaceuticals company, which has been absent
from the market for several years. Led by Rabobank Nederland, the first
Euro-style guilders issue for almost a month was rapidly increased from Fl
250m at launch, reflecting a general shortage of longer term new issue
paper.
Some traders were slightly surprised at the DM100m 10-year reverse
floating-rate note for Deutsche Genossenschafts Hypothekenbank. They would
expect such transactions to be for smaller amounts and to be done privately
rather than publicly because they are normally targetted to specific
investors. The interest rate will be fixed at 10 per cent for the first two
years, and thereafter at 21 per cent minus twice six-month Libor.
High interest rates, exchange controls and EMS turmoil are among obstacles
hindering significant expansion of the Spanish fixed income market, though
it shows promise, Standard &amp; Poor's writes in its weekly newsletter, Reuter
reports.

MR INIGO Oriol, the chairman of Iberdrola, the Spanish utility, said he was
hopeful 1992 group profits would rise about 10 per cent. In 1991, pre-tax
profit rose 40 per cent to Pta96.12bn (Dollars 863.6m), Reuter reports from
Madrid.
He said last month's peseta devaluation should not have any adverse effect
providing provisions could be spread out over several years. Otherwise he
saw a Pta8bn provision next year.
Mr Oriol spoke after a shareholders' meeting to approve terms for completing
a merger between Iberdrola I and Iberdrola II, which will create Spain's
largest private sector utility.
He said profits rose about 9 per cent in the first nine months.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MAJORITY of Swedes now oppose European Community membership, according to
a new poll.
It found that 53 per cent would vote No if a referendum on the issue were
held now, the first time that opposition has broken through the 50 per cent
level. Only 30 per cent are in favour of membership.
Opposition is particularly strong among women, the under-30s and blue-collar
workers. The anti-EC mood has intensified during the year, with March the
last time more Swedes favoured membership than opposed it. A month ago, 45
per cent were against the EC, and 35 per cent in favour.
The poll's findings will alarm not only Sweden's centre-right coalition
government, but also the opposition Social Democrats. Both back the
country's attempt to join the EC in 1995. A binding referendum on the issue
is due to take place in 1994.
Meanwhile, US credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's has given a significant
endorsement to recent Swedish policy initiatives by maintaining its 'AAA'
rating for the country.
It highlighted the country's determined defence of the krona, tough measures
to reduce the budget deficit and promised support for the financial system.
'Continued wage moderation and the government's stated plans to reinforce
fiscal adjustment are the key near-term factors supporting Sweden's 'AAA'
rating,' the agency said.

UKRAINE might bring six new nuclear reactors into operation as a partial
solution to the Slav republic's mounting energy crisis and to combat
dependence on increasingly expensive Russian oil.
Mr Hryhory Hotovchets, the minister responsible for the Chernobyl clean up,
said yesterday that although the Chernobyl nuclear power station will be
closed down on schedule next year, six new reactors could be brought on
line. A moratorium on the construction of the six unfinished reactors was
declared by parliament just last year.
'Ukraine cannot manage without nuclear power, any more than many other
countries,' said Mr Hotovchets.
Ukraine's 14 operating nuclear reactors already provide up to 40 per cent of
the country's energy supply.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Moscow tries to reassure Baltic states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TALLINN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Vitaly Churkin, the Russian deputy foreign minister, yesterday sought to
reassure leaders of the Baltic states that President Boris Yeltsin's
decision to suspend Russian troop withdrawals did not mean a fundamental
change in policy. Moscow's intention of pulling out 'has never been
questioned,' he told Estonian leaders yesterday.
Mr Yeltsin's action has been seen as a protest against the way Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania have deprived many ethnic Russians of the vote by
insisting on residential, linguistic and other voting qualifications
designed to favour the indigenous population.
His decree set alarm bells ringing in the Baltic states and caused
widespread concern in the west with Nato urging the Russians to continue
withdrawal by 1993 as originally agreed. Senior US officials warned the pace
of withdrawals would be seen as a litmus test of Russia's good intentions
generally.
Yesterday Mr Lennart Meri, the Estonian president, said in an interview he
had been reassured in talks with Mr Churkin that Russia would not pursue any
linkage between human rights extended to its 500,000 strong Russian-speaking
population and the withdrawal of Russian troops.
Russia, which had 30,000 troops in Estonia at the end of 1991, has in the
past year reduced the force to 11,000. However, most of those who left were
conscripts, leaving behind officers increasingly resistant to moving - and
putting pressure on Moscow to delay their departure.
The new Estonian government is anxious not to increase Mr Yeltsin's domestic
political problems. Mr Trivimi Velliste, the Estonian foreign minister, said
in an interview the 'Yeltsin government is the best Russian government we
are ever likely to have'.
The Estonian soft diplomatic line comes after months during which relations
between the 1.6m strong state and its giant Russian neighbour had grown

Mr Meri said Mr Yeltsin's move to centralise negotiations with the three
Baltic states under the presidential security council directed by Mr Yuri
Skokov was a sign that Mr Yeltsin is 'making a settlement of the Baltic
question a matter of his own prestige'.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Turkey suffers interest rate blow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A 5 per cent interest rate rise by Turkey's largest state- owned bank has
dealt another blow to the anti-inflation policy of Mrs Tansu Ciller, the
treasury minister.
The interest rate hike by Ziraat Bank, the state agricultural credit bank,
is likely to intensify competition for funds and raise the cost of the
government's own borrowing at the weekly treasury auction.
Lowering interest rates has been a central plank of Mrs Ciller's strategy to
reduce the government's internal debt servicing - the largest budgetary item
accounting for 20 per cent of expenditure.
The financing of the public sector borrowing requirement - the budget
together with the deficits of the state sector enterprises - is largely
responsible for the 67 per cent inflation rate. In 1991 the PSBR rose to a
record 12.5 per cent of GNP.
Mrs Ciller's interest rate policy has brought her into conflict with Mr
Rusdu Saracoglu, the central bank governor.
Her earlier moves to increase liquidity as a way of exerting downward
pressure on rates, briefly threatened the lira, before the central bank
intervened, selling dollars to the market - an operation which cost the bank
Dollars 2.3bn in the first six months of 1992.
Mrs Ciller was also criticised for resorting to the bank to pay civil
servants and other treasury expenditures. The legal ceiling on the central
bank cheap lending to the treasury has now been reached, leaving Mrs Ciller
with little option but to see the state banks raise interest rates to
attract depositors.
Ziraat's move, although seen as government inspired, also reflects the
special problems of the bank which has been hit by a series of natural
disasters like the Erzincan earthquake earlier this year, where it has had
to reschedule credits.

<TEXT>
FRANCE and Spain yesterday ruled out changing the Maastricht treaty on
European union to meet Denmark's demands for a special status, Reuter
reports from Paris.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, said in Paris that Denmark's
proposals for binding legal exemptions from key provisions required an
unacceptable rewriting of the treaty on EC political, economic and monetatry
union.
Speaking after talks with President Francois Mitterrand, he said the Danish
government did not yet appear to have a final position.
But he told reporters: 'As they have been formulated in the document, I
think the (Danish proposals) require a change in the Maastricht treaty which
I believe will not be acceptable to the member states.'
France's European affairs minister, Ms Elisabeth Guigou, said in a
parliamentary debate yesterday that France would study Denmark's proposals
but ruled out any renegotiation of the accords.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Rival to ask OFT to examine high street activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The confirmation that Midlands Electricity will pool its retailing
operations with those of Eastern and Southern signifies a further step in
the commercialisation of the once-nationalised sector, writes John
Thornhill. But for rival electrical goods retailers it raises renewed
questions about the nature of this newly liberalised competition.
Dixons, the UK's biggest electrical retailing chain, yesterday said it
intended to file a submission with the Office of Fair Trading alleging
unfair retail competition from the regional electricity companies (Recs).
Mr Mark Souhami, deputy chairman, said the Recs were subsidising their
retail activities from profits generated by their electricity interests to
the disadvantage of rival retailers and the detriment of electricity
customers.
'It means consumers are possibly having to pay more for their electricity
because these companies are choosing to subsidise unprofitable retailing
activities. This goes to the heart of the regulatory environment,' he said.
'At the time of the privatisation we drew attention to what we thought would
happen. But we have had to wait a bit before sticking our heads above the
parapet again and shouting 'Yaboo]''
Mr Eamon Bradley, chief executive of the joint venture, yesterday rejected
the charge although he accepted the retail businesses would lose money this
year as a result of restructuring charges. 'Our retail businesses are
stand-alone businesses and are not subsidised by the electricity companies.
The merger will hold up to scrutiny from any source. We are delighted to see
how worried the competition are,' he said.
Originally, the Recs opened high street showrooms to offer customers
facilities to pay their bills and provide information. Many of them also, as
a sideline, sold electrical appliances to promote the wider use of
electricity. Retail activities still represent less than 10 per cent of Recs
turnover.
But following their privatisation two years ago, many Recs developed a more
serious interest in retailing seeing it as an attractive avenue for
expansion in a related but unregulated market.
Many Recs believed there were considerable advantages in merging their
retailing, marketing and buying skills and began to acquire more stores as
the loss-making Rumbelows chain announced it was making a phased withdrawal
from the market. Several Recs have also expanded into more profitable
out-of-town locations - even outside their own catchment areas.
Mr Rodney Forrest, stores analyst at stockbrokers Credit Lyonnais Laing,
says their commercialisation will be a slow process. Over the long term, he
suggests, the Recs will form professional retailing businesses run on strict
commercial lines. But this is only likely to lead to the closure of many of
the unprofitable smaller outlets leading to a more rational market. 'I
cannot believe that Dixons or Comet will suffer much over the next five
years,' he said. Indeed, he suggested that they might benefit from the
commercialisation process.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Midlands joins electrical retail group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLANDS Electricity yesterday confirmed it was to join a consortium with
two other privatised regional electricity companies to create the UK's
third-largest electrical retailing business.
Midlands said it would exercise its option, first announced in May, to
acquire 28 per cent of the shares of E&amp;S Retail, an electricity joint
venture created by Eastern Electricity and Southern Electricity. These two
companies will each hold 36 per cent of the remaining shares.
Midlands will transfer all its 82 stores, including three out-of-town
outlets, to the joint venture on April 1. This will swell the joint
venture's store portfolio to 311 shops with a combined turnover of about
Pounds 250m.
Only Dixons and Comet, owned by the Kingfisher Group, have bigger turnover
in the electrical retailing sector.
Midlands said: 'On its own our retailing business is not of sufficient size
to have a future by itself and we believe that the joint venture is the
right thing to do to strengthen its future.'
The jobs of 800 Midlands stores and distribution staff will be secured
although an unspecified number of redundancies will result from the
abolition of some administrative support functions.
The combined retailing business will be run as a separate company from
Bicester, Oxfordshire, under the direction of E&amp;S's current chief executive,
Mr Eamon Bradley. However, Midland's trading director, Mr Bryan Clayton,
will join the board of E&amp;S in an executive post.
'It is a completely free-standing operation focused on retailing which is
divorced from the electricity companies,' said Mr Bradley.
He said the main thrust of future expansion would come from out-of-town
superstores. The joint venture will run 11 such stores following the merger
but has plans to open up to 50 within five years. The company will fund this
expansion programme from its own financial resources.
The three companies' stores will continue to trade under their regional
trading names although E&amp;S Retail will be renamed to reflect Midlands'
inclusion.

FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Fukutake seeks to renegotiate
Berlitz purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICE of Berlitz shares slumped by more than 10 per cent yesterday
morning after the Princeton-based language school and publishing group
disclosed that its prospective Japanese buyer was seeking to renegotiate
terms.
The request for a renegotiation came after Berlitz reported a sharp drop in
third-quarter operating income.
Berlitz shares fell by Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 19 5/8 yesterday after the
company said that Fukutake Publishing of Japan was seeking to alter the
financial terms of its planned acquisition.
Under the original plan, Fukutake was to pay roughly Dollars 270m as part of
a complex transaction that would have created a new Berlitz holding company,
of which the Japanese buyer would own 67 per cent.
Berlitz, meanwhile, said its operating income for the three months ended
September 30 was Dollars 1.211m, down sharply from the Dollars 5.248m
achieved in the same period a year earlier.
Sales for the three months were Dollars 69.606m, against Dollars 62.537m in
the same quarter of 1991.
For the first nine months of 1992, Berlitz had operating income of Dollars
9.825m, compared with Dollars 18.484m.
The Berlitz saga is complicated by the fact that some 56.5 per cent of the
company's shares were pledged to banks last year as collateral for loans
made to the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
These shares had been nominally owned by Macmillan, which was at the time
part of the Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC).
MCC is now operating under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law and the status of
the Berlitz shares is the subject of various legal actions.
The Fukutake deal involved cash payments to existing Berlitz shareholders;
the setting up of a new holding company that would assume Dollars 160m of
debt; a formula for Berlitz shareholders to eventually receive a total of 33
per cent of the new Berlitz company; and promises for payments to
shareholders that would be based on certain MCC notes held by Berlitz.

<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN Airlines Systems (SAS) has decided not to participate in any of
the bids for Continental Airlines, the US air carrier which has been in
bankruptcy since late 1990.
SAS has had a co-operation agreement with Continental since 1988, under
which it feeds around 150,000 passengers a year into Continental's US
network.
This was cemented by a Dollars 106m investment in Continental, since written
off.
The Scandinavian carrier said yesterday that it saw no point in making a
further investment in Continental as the co-operation was now 'firmly
established' and would continue.
SAS has three members on the Continental board.
The bid deadline for Continental expired on Monday, with at least three
suitors thought to be still in the running.
Continental confirmed that Lufthansa, the German airline which had
considered making an offer with Mr Marvin Davis, the Californian financier,
was no longer pursuing a deal.
This appeared to leave three contenders: a consortium lead by Mr Charles
Hurwitz's Maxxam group; an offer from Mr Alfredo Brener's Houston Air; and a
proposal from Air Canada in conjunction with a Texan investment partnership.
Shortly after bids closed, Air Canada confirmed it was still interested in
Continental, but declined to give more details. The Maxxam group also said
it had submitted an offer by the deadline.
Although both the Air Canada and Maxxam consortia confirmed that they had
submitted bids for Continental by Monday's deadline, Houston Air was less
forthcoming.
'In the interest of the future of Continental Airlines and integrity of its
bidding process, Houston Air believes it would be inappropriate to make
further comment on the status of its bid for the airline at this time,' it
said.
Continental has to present the 'best offer' to the bankruptcy court on
November 9.

BANCO EXTERIOR, the flagship of the state-owned Argentaria financial group,
has raised its third-quarter net profits by 11.3 per cent to Pta21bn
(Dollars 188.4m) over the same period last year due to increased fee income
and a stringent control of costs and of bad debts.
Exterior's financial income fell by 7.1 per cent to Pta267.8bn over the
first nine months, but other ordinary revenue, mainly commissions, was up by
9.5 per cent to Pta16.6bn. Operating expenditure rose by only 3.8 per cent
after a 4.3 per cent reduction in overall costs.
Pursuing 'a very active' strategy over insolvencies, Exterior realised
Pta22.1bn in bad debts, a 136 per cent improvement on the previous year's
volume. Customer loans were reduced, year-on-year, by 8.7 per cent and
Pta43.7bn was put aside for doubtful debts, a 19.8 per cent rise in the
provisions allocated in the first nine months of last year.

Invesco MIM said that both sides had been in regular contact. 'We have every

Peregrine bought its latest tranche of shares at 77p. The shares were
apparently bought from Legal &amp; General Investments and Daido Mutual Life.
Invesco's shares, which added 9p to 84p on Monday, gained a further 4p to

LOWNDES LAMBERT, the insurance broker which was floated last year, has
acquired Crowley Colosso Holdings, which owns a fine arts and jewellery
specialist broker.
The initial consideration is Pounds 1.4m, comprising Pounds 697,000 in cash
and the issue to the vendors of 253,455 new Lowndes shares.
Further consideration in shares or cash to a cap of Pounds 1.9m will be paid
in proportion to any brokerage income during the next two financial years to
October in excess of the most recent year's earned brokerage fees till last
June.
Mr Richard Shaw, Lowndes' chairman, said he would be surprised if the
additional payments exceeded half of the capped limit.
The accounts for Colosso for the year to June 30 1991 showed pre-tax profits
of Pounds 53,000 on turnover of Pounds 1.37m.
The new shares will rank equally with existing shares, and the vendors have
pledged not to dispose of them for 12 months after completion.

Last-minute talks will be held today to try to reach agreement on an offer
for Independent Television News that would involve Pounds 30m in financial
support.
Representatives of all ITN shareholders will meet Mr Michael Green, chairman
of Carlton Communications, before the 3pm deadline for the expiry of the
offer.
Carlton, the television production and services company, is a member of the
four-company consortium which is offering Pounds 1 for each Pounds 1 ITN
share and promising to put up Pounds 30m to deal with a deficit of Pounds
25m over five years on ITN's London headquarters.
The other consortium members are Central Television, London Weekend
Television and Reuters Holdings. Together they would take 80 per cent of
ITN.
It is not expected that full agreement will be possible on present terms
before the deadline expires. Some companies who might sell do not like the
Pounds 1 price. Others, such as Thames, Granada and possibly Yorkshire,
which would like to continue as ITN shareholders, do not want to be
shoe-horned into the remaining 20 per cent envisaged by the proposal.
If progress is made at today's talks the deadline may have to be extended.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARAB Banking Corporation (ABC), the biggest Arab bank, has nearly doubled
net profit for the first nine months of 1992, Reuter reports from Manama.
The bank, traded on the Bahraini and Paris bourses, said profit after
estimated taxes rose to Dollars 60m in the period from Dollars 31m the year
before.
Mr Abdullah Saudi, chief executive, attributed the rise in the net to a
lower cost of funds, lower taxes, expanded business in trade financing and
the recovery of some Dollars 20m in interest that had not been paid on loans
to Argentina.
He said unaudited operating profits rose 36 per cent to Dollars 183m from
Dollars 135m. It boosted the provisions it was making for bad loans to
Dollars 98m from Dollars 53m.
After Dollars 6m for minority interests in subsidiaries such as Banco
Atlantico in Spain, pre-tax profits showed an increase of 22 per cent to
Dollars 79m.
Despite the higher pre-tax profit, estimated taxes fell to Dollars 19m from
Dollars 34m because the branches with little or no tax did relatively better
than heavily taxed units in Europe.
Lower interest rates also meant it was less costly to fund non-performing
loans. The bank remained cautious about new lending, total loans and
advances rising modestly to Dollars 11.2bn at the end of September from
Dollars 10.6bn a year earlier.
Total assets rose to Dollars 20.8bn from Dollars 19.6bn. Total deposits rose
to Dollars 16.6bn from Dollars 16.1bn.

FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Ansbacher agrees S African offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HENRY ANSBACHER, the UK merchant bank, has agreed terms for a takeover by
the First National Bank of South Africa which includes a higher payment to
minority shareholders.
The offer, which will be sent to shareholders shortly, values Ansbacher at a
slight premium to its current market value of Pounds 52m.
It is the first time a South African bank has acquired a British bank. First
National plans to expand Ansbacher, which specialises in South African debt,
to service its South Africa-based multinational clients.
Pargesa, the Swiss investment group controlled by Mr Paul Desmarais, the
Canadian financier, and Mr Albert Frere, the Belgian financier, has been
keen to sell its 62 per cent stake for more than two years.
Along with Kuwaiti-controlled Wafra Intervest, which has another 11 per
cent, Pargesa has accepted an offer believed to be in the region of
yesterday's closing price of 28p.
However, Mr Richard Fenhalls, chairman, could not recommend that price to
minority shareholders, which are now to be offered at least 10 per cent more
at a price above 30p a share.
Mr Fenhalls, who was brought in to rescue the bank from near collapse in
1985, is expected to relinquish the chair within six months but continue his
connection with the bank as a non-executive director.
First National has made it clear that it intends to replace Mr Fenhalls and
most of the directors with its own appointees. The only senior board members
to stay on will be Mr Gordon Adam, a director of the bank, and Mr William
Guinness and Mr David Sebire, directors of the holding company.
First National has told Ansbacher that it intends to keep most of the 97
staff.
The South Africans approached Ansbacher in May when it learnt that Mr
Fenhalls was resisting a takeover by Singer &amp; Friedlander.
Ansbacher's return to profit - it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.9m
(Pounds 1.1m) in the six months to end-June following losses of Pounds 8.2m
for 1991 - will be underlined in the offer document containing details of
increased profits for the nine months to the end of September.
Shareholders' funds exceed Pounds 80m with only a small amount of corporate
lending.

FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Consumers' Association joins disapproval of
Dan-Air deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHORUS of disapproval at the government's decision not to refer British
Airways' takeover of Dan-Air to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
gathered force yesterday with the Consumers' Association slating the
outcome.
'We are appalled,' said Mr Derek Prentice, assistant director. 'It reduces
competition. When consumers have less choice, they lose out.'
Mr Prentice and Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland, both said
that it might have been better for competition if Dan-Air had gone bust.
In that case several airlines could have enhanced their scheduled networks
by picking up the popular routes, rather than allowing 'the dominant airline
to grow even more dominant,' as Mr Prentice put it.
Sir Michael contended that the government had had 'the wool pulled over its
eyes by BA' and had swept competition issues under the carpet. The decision
simply helped BA to cut its costs, and hence its losses, at Gatwick. The
result was a commercial benefit to BA.
He argued that fewer jobs would have been lost if Dan-Air had collapsed and
its routes taken on by several airlines. 'The more airlines participate, the
more jobs because staff are duplicated and you don't get the benefits of
scale.'
He referred to the Civil Aviation Authority's view that the takeover raised
serious competition issues - although the CAA did not go so far as to
recommend referral to the MMC.
Aggrieved competitors, which also include Virgin Atlantic and Air UK, are
taking legal advice on whether the government's decision can be challenged.
They are also calling for an independent watchdog body that might be called
'Ofair', similar to the regulators of privatised utilities.
A longer term thrust is to seek changes to the rules affecting slots at
Heathrow so that BA's hold on about 38 per cent of them might be weakened.
BA replied that other airlines had had the chance to do a deal with Davies &amp;
Newman, Dan-Air's parent, but it was the only one prepared to mount a
rescue.
Its establishment of a low-cost operation at Gatwick would benefit consumers
and its post-merger 21 per cent share of that airport's slots did not amount
to domination.
Jobs had been saved and redundancy packages were better than in a
liquidation, trade creditors had been protected and many travellers' plans
had not been wrecked.
BAA, Gatwick's landlord, stressed that it would be good for the airport to
have BA, with its international marketing clout, as a big operator.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Allied to dispose of Chateau Latour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED-LYONS, the UK drinks, food and retailing group, has put Chateau
Latour, one of the four leading Bordeaux vineyards, up for sale. Preliminary
talks are being held with prospective buyers, including Groupe Axa, the
French insurance company, according to industry sources.
The Medoc estate - once described by Allied's chairman, Mr Michael Jackaman,
as 'the jewel in our crown' - was estimated a year ago to be worth about
Pounds 160m. But in the depressed state of the French wine industry, Allied
might struggle to find a buyer at that price.
The Bordeaux wine industry has been hit by bumper crops, recession in the
US, UK and other world markets, and increased competition from Australia,
New Zealand, California and South Africa. Several chateaux have been put on
the market and wine merchants have closed.
Allied's decision, however, owes more to changes in the group's management
strategy than market conditions. Since the Pounds 147m loss on currency
trading early last year, the new team of Mr Jackaman and Mr Tony Hales,
chief executive, has focused the group on international growth brands and
improving the return on assets.
Allied bought the vineyard in 1988 for Pounds 58m - more for Latour's
prestige than its profitability - to add the 53 per cent shareholding of
Pearson, publishers of the Financial Times, to the 25 per cent it already
owned. It has since bought out most of the remaining minority shareholders.
A year ago, Mr Jackaman admitted that with profits of about Pounds 5m a year
the investment was difficult to justify on the basis of return on capital.
Allied last month announced the sale of its Kendermann and Langenbach wine
businesses in Germany, with a combined turnover of DM70m (Pounds 29m) a
year, to the Gunther Reh group. However, Allied continues to distribute
Black Tower and Crown of Crowns wine brands.
Allied is considered unlikely to dispose of its other wine businesses which
include Callaway and Clos Du Bois in California, Calvet in France, Harveys
and Grants of St James's, the shippers and wholesalers, and the Victoria
Wine retail chain.

FT  04 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Electrical retailing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Midlands Electricity may be throwing in its lot with Eastern's and
Southern's electricity shops consortium, but the combined group lacks the
potential to shine. The venture intends to keep most of its high street
shops while electrical retailing's centre of gravity moves relentlessly out
of town. Three separate corporate images will also be maintained, making it
difficult to establish a national brand. Nor is there yet an attractive
format to replace the dreary look of the traditional electricity showroom.
The approach can in part be explained by the desire of the regional
electricity companies (RECs) to maintain a high profile with consumers.
There are also customer service requirements which pin the companies to town
centres. But given the very tough market for electrical goods, the
electricity shops look increasingly like spoilers which can afford to stay
in the game only because they have rich parents.
Under the circumstances the complaints from Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of
Dixons, are hardly surprising. Whatever the truth about suggestions of
cross-subsidy, the losses incurred by the retailing operations of the RECs
are a gnat-bite compared with their electricity transmission profits. The
financial strength of the RECs also allows them to bid up the price of
potential sites. Then again, Dixons' view of competition in electrical
retailing is in contrast to its fears about monopoly when it was defending
itself from Kingfisher.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Arts: Innovation, but only for the minority - Ten years on,
Christopher Dunkley assesses the achievement of Channel 4
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Channel 4 is 10 years old this week and the plaudits are pouring in from the
mediacracy. 'It undoubtedly' (a give-away word meaning, I suspect this is an
overstatement) 'changed the face of broadcasting', according to independent
producer Sophie Balhetchet who made The Manageress and The Camomile Lawn for
C4. Can you imagine any other British channel showing such drama? You can?
All of them? Well, yes, perhaps so.
'Channel 4 has admirably fulfilled every hope we had for it', enthuses
Anthony Smith, once editor of the BBC's 24 Hours and more responsible than
anyone for shaping Channel 4's 'publisher' concept. Smith praises C4 for
'allowing all sorts of communities to have a greater stake in television . .
. creating a following for things like American football'. Few of us in the
TV4 Campaign in the 1970s would have guessed that one of the aims of our
co-agitator was to bring American football to British screens, but you live
and learn.
Independent producer Michael Darlow maintains that the channel has done
quite well: 'Things have been freed up and new people have got in'. Darlow,
of course, worked for the BBC and ITV before working for C4. In the view of
John Wyver, another independent, C4 'has immeasurably' - a bit like
undoubtedly - 'enriched British broadcasting'. Mr Channel 4 himself, Jeremy
Isaacs, who was Chief Executive for the first eight years, claims that
'Channel 4 made the case for hour-long news'. Of his successor, Michael
Grade, he says 'I give him high marks for the position the channel is in. I
wouldn't want to be doing his job now. I've done what I could there and I'm
now doing what I can elsewhere. And I'm learning to garden', a reference,
presumably, to Covent Garden, the opera house of which Mr Isaacs is now
General Director. And Grade himself? What does he think about C4? 'Why
should we change when things are going so well for us? We have a winning
formula'.
Since convention requires that for major anniversaries, as for funerals, we
set aside our true feelings and offer only soft soap and bouquets, it might
be argued that these panegyrics, all culled from recent broadsheet
newspapers, are merely showpiece civilities for public consumption. Yet
anybody who has followed the mediacracy's pronouncements about C4 over the
years must doubt this. There has been widespread support for the claims made
by C4's own personnel that the channel triumphantly fulfils its famous remit
to encourage innovation and experiment and cater for tastes and interests
not generally catered for by other channels, and that it wins about 10 per
cent of the national audience. Both claims are true, but the implication
that C4 wins its 10 per cent share by screening experimental or minority
programmes is eyewash.
Anyone who actually likes television and watches lots of it knows this.
Channel 4 is where we turn for the best contemporary American comedies
(Cheers, The Golden Girls), for serious news if we want it early in the
evening, and for vintage series (TV Heaven, The Avengers, The Twilight
Zone). The current BARB ratings show that The Top 20 programmes on C4
comprise five American comedies, five editions of a game show, three
episodes of soap opera, three British sitcoms, one old American drama
series, one repeat from a popular ITV drama series, one old movie, and one
documentary (Animal Squad Undercover) which achieves an unexpectedly high
place because it has a repeat within the week.
Those, of course, are not the programmes which the mediacrats are talking
about when they praise C4; there is not one which would look out of place on
other channels. You do begin to wonder whether these people really watch
television like ordinary viewers, or whether their ideas about C4 are formed
more by the occasional whiz through a cassette and a lot of industry talk
about the latest independent contracts. In the bar of the Groucho Club it is
the programme description that really counts, not the fact that it will be
transmitted to an uncaring world at lunchtime on a Saturday. It is worth
remembering that one of Jeremy Isaacs' pet phrases when things became
fraught at C4 was 'Come on, it's only television', which brought mock-wry
smiles from the book-bred, cinema oriented mediacracy.
Consider this evening's offerings from Channel 4: The Magic Roundabout: A
French series brought to Britain 27 years ago by the BBC (repeat). Treasure
Hunt: Copy of a French game show featuring frequent rear views of Anneka
Rice in tight trousers (repeat). Channel 4 News: 50-minute early evening
news copied (like every British TV news innovation for 30 years) from the
US; sometimes nearly as good as BBC2's Newsnight. Comment: A real
innovation; five minutes of personal opinion straight to camera. Brookside:
Soap opera with an audience smaller than that for BBC1's much derided
Eldorado. Anton Mosimann - Naturally: Old fashioned kitchen-bound cookery
programme (repeat). Dispatches: Good current affairs series much like those
on other channels. Short And Curlies: Worthy series of 10-minute films by
new directors. The Golden Girls: American sitcom. Packing Them In:
Embarrassingly poor variety show not saved by attempts to disguise an
ancient format with backstage frolics. The Prisoner: Over-rated ITV 'cult'
series made by Lew Grade in 1967 (repeat). The Steve Allen Show: Cheap black
and white 1950s American variety show. The Best Of The Worst: Clips from
American shows. Azaad: Hindi film, starting at 1.10 in the morning.
Innovative? Experimental? Catering for minorities? Here and there, perhaps,
in the nooks and crannies, for five or ten minutes in a six hour stretch.
There is, however, one thing that should be said in defence of Michael
Grade. The repeated suggestion that he is taking C4 down market and that
this is shown by the large number of American imports merely proves again
how little the mediacrats actually watch. It was under Isaacs that C4 pushed
its American content up to a level above that of any channel in Europe; more
than 30 per cent. My impression is that there are now rather fewer American
programmes in prime time, though the over all proportion may remain much the
same.
So is there nothing good to be said about Channel 4? Several things. It had
enormous influence in creating a British independent programme sector which
now numbers 700 to 800 companies; historically this may prove to be C4's
most significant achievement. It showed that you can put opinion straight on
the screen. While others were looking iffy, it championed freedom of
expression (Isaacs and Grade both showed personal courage and deserve our
gratitude). Above all its occasionally inspiring, occasionally irritating
policies have been powerfully influential in the development of BBC2 into
the most impressive channel for the demanding viewer in this country and
perhaps the world.
No doubt this will be considered not merely a back-handed compliment but an
insult, yet the point is a perfectly serious one. For 35 years Britain's
broadcasting 'duopoly' has proved a remarkably benevolent structure with the
commercial side frightening and inspiring the public service side to greater
efforts at popularity, and the public service side shaming and challenging
the commercial side to greater efforts at prestige. The highly beneficial
effects of C4 on BBC2 may be the final chapter in that story. Come January
1993, with C4 selling its own advertising and the new ITV franchises in
force, British commercial television could disappear into the market
enterprise vortex just as the BBC turns its back to begin the trek to the
Himalayan uplands of quality and worthiness. The old fight in the centre for
popularity with quality may well be abandoned, to the detriment of good
popular television.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Management: Battle to rebuild family store - In the second
of two articles on BhS, John Thornhill looks at the widespread purge of
staff that underpinned the restructuring of the UK retail group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In January 1990, a group of 15 senior managers from BhS apprehensively
assembled in a hotel in Newbury to discuss the future prospects for the
ailing UK retailing group.
The mood was subdued, tense and heavy with anticipation. The company's
trading background had sharply worsened over the past few weeks as the
recession had begun to intensify. The arrival of an enigmatic American chief
executive two months previously had excited a flurry of speculation. And a
frightful gale, which buffeted the hotel, knocking out its electricity
supply, heightened the sense of crisis as the group huddled around an open
fire to review the company's performance.
'We just sat around that fire and talked and talked and talked for three
days. We discovered very few strengths and lots of weaknesses,' recalls one
participant.
BhS's past mistakes were dispassionately dissected. Its competitive position
was analysed and a forthright management consultant's report was kicked
around in a free-for-all discussion.
Out of the talk was born a simple 52-word mission statement that was to
serve as a blueprint for a series of whirlwind changes that were to
transform the group over the next two years.
'The BhS mission is to be the first choice store for dressing the modern
woman and family. We are committed to service, quality, harmony, innovation
and excitement in all that we do. We will succeed by being a focused
organisation in dynamic partnership with our customers, suppliers and each
one of us,' the statement ran.
When the new chief executive, David Dworkin, joined the company he knew he
had to act fast to reverse the sense of drift. 'We had to superimpose some
vision on the business very quickly. We also had to streamline it. There was
too much noise and too many layers,' he says.
Dworkin says the company was a staid, male-dominated hierarchy where head
office staff only met the directors when they were invited to do so. At
lunch time staff were strictly segregated into different dining rooms. BhS's
head office contained 1,041 people while similar-sized retailers had half
that number.
Dworkin promised a refreshing new informality. BhS staff still recall the
shock of attending meetings when Dworkin strolled in wearing a T-shirt,
cycling shorts and bare feet, eating a pot of yoghurt.
To simplify and focus the structure of the business, Dworkin launched a
twin-track attack to effect change: first, by taking out several management
layers, reducing costs by Pounds 10m; and second, by introducing incentives
for the talent remaining in the business and recruiting fresh thinkers from
outside. People were to become the company's greatest source of competitive
advantage.
In all, 900 head office and store managers were dismissed, including 10 of
the 15 managers who attended the Newbury meeting. About half the 130 store
managers were replaced, along with 60 per cent of buyers and merchandisers,
and all but two of the 20 most senior line managers.
The main criterion for deciding whether to retain people came from their
perceived flexibility to accept change. Dworkin says he was looking for 'a
sensitivity and a sense of looking at the world anew. We needed an openness
and a religious commitment to the view that things could be done better'.
Dworkin says some mistakes were undoubtedly made but is unrepentant at the
scale of the purge. 'I would argue that it did not destroy morale. It might
have made a lot of people unhappy but my role is not to be sensitive to
that, but to be sensitive to shareholders and give them a productive team.
The new team now has extremely high morale,' he argues.
Given the staggering turnover of staff, it is a wonder to an outsider how
the company continued to function at all. Yet while this 'creative
destruction' was being implemented, a simultaneous thrust allowing new ideas
and people to emerge was also appearing. An action programme, headed by
Steve Bedford, the human resources director, known as Activity Value
Analysis (AVA) was launched to scrutinise and improve every group activity.
Bedford tirelessly explained the company's mission statement to managers at
a series of seminars and they, in turn, discussed with their staff how it
could be achieved.
Twelve individual 'change agents' took a prominent role in stimulating this
participative process. 'We put these people together from different levels
and different functions to be the leaders of change. They trained and
energised everyone else. We received more than 5,000 ideas on how to improve
the business,' says Bedford.
As a result, old ways of running the business were updated. New performance
targets were devised and successful staff were given bonus payments.
This change process cascaded through the company embracing every function
and department. At the store level, layers of back office managers were
stripped out and the proportion of staff on the sales floor increased from
60 per cent to 80 per cent.
As one example, Mark Bowland, store manager at the BhS store in the Metro
Centre in Gateshead, says he cut the number of managers from 23 to 11. But
the obverse side of this painful process was that it devolved greater
responsibility both to the remaining managers and increasingly to the shop
floor associates, who were encouraged to exercise greater individual
initiative.
The whole process attempted to tilt the management effort towards supporting
ideas from the front-line staff. 'At the end of the day we are the people
who take the money,' says Bowland.
This 'unfreezing' process was accompanied by extensive training programmes.
Shop floor staff, including part-timers, were encouraged to take the retail
exams for the National Council of Vocational Qualifications. For the first
time, BhS devoted more of its training budget to its 15,000 shop associates
than to its head office staff. 'I think the greatest respect you can pay to
anybody is to want to invest in them,' says Bedford.
But training also yielded cost benefits by reducing substantially the high
levels of staff turnover. It also meant that sales associates could
increasingly assume the functions of junior managers.
Yet in spite of all these improvements, it is arguable that BhS has, as yet,
only won the easy victories. The dramatic gestures and changes have been
made. Now comes the infinitely harder process of establishing a 'learning
organisation' whereby continuous daily improvements can be made.
The company has also to avoid the danger simply of introducing a new
orthodoxy that will itself ossify. 'Because we challenged every aspect of
what we did, we made people think that everything we did in the past was
wrong and everything we were going to do in the future was right. We have to
overcome that attitude,' says Helena Packshaw, marketing director.
Although sales per square foot are beginning to show impressive improvements
they are coming from a low base and still lag a long way behind BhS's main
rivals. Based on estimates from Verdict, the retail consultants, BhS's sales
per square foot were less than one third of the Pounds 536 that Marks and
Spencer achieved last year.
Some staff say morale is still fragile as a result of the massive personnel
upheaval. One insider at BhS, who does not wish to be named, says: 'The
company is still run by fear. There was a lot of flab in BhS that had to be
cut out but people are still afraid for their jobs. It is not a nice
atmosphere.'
Some observers suggest the impetus of change may dissipate now that Dworkin
is helping to push through similar changes at Mothercare, after becoming
chief executive of Storehouse, the parent of both companies, in July. The
doubts remain but Dworkin, at least, is convinced that the company has
pushed the reforms far enough to ensure they are sustained. 'Change is a
mind-set,' he says.

The Inland Revenue has announced the names of the two private sector members
of its new management board, which was launched in April this year as part
of a series of wider reforms.
Lady Wilcox, chairman of the National Consumer Council, and Sheila Masters,
a partner in KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, are joining as
non-executive members.
Masters, a chartered accountant, is no stranger to the challenges facing
large organisations undergoing change.
She was seconded from KPMG to the National Health Service as director of
finance to the management executive and since her return, has helped
co-ordinate the firm's internal reorganisation, called 20/20 vision.
The chancellor of the exchequer announced in March that 'a number of members
from the private sector' would be added to a new management board to provide
expertise, experience and advice to the department.
The existing seats on the management board are held by the five members of
the board of the Inland Revenue, and a further six senior revenue officials.
The Revenue expects to appoint a number of other private sector members over
the next few months.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Management: Managers unite in attempt to raise profile - A
look at this week's launch of the Institute of Management in Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new Institute of Management, launched this week, brings together the
British Institute of Management and the Institute of Industrial Managers.
With 75,000 members, it claims to be Europe's largest management institute.
However, the IM is more than an amalgamation of two associations. Its aim is
to raise the profile of management training, emphasising the development of
management competences - not just the imparting of management theory -
through qualifications approved by the National Council for Vocational
Qualifications.
As Sir Derek Hornby, IM chairman, put it at the launch: 'We have a central
aim - to develop good management practices. We achieve this by implementing
management lead body standards through our education programmes and by
including business and management courses within our integrated approach to
professional management.'
Peter Wilson, vice-chairman of IM and director of Luton College's management
college at Putteridgebury, is an ardent advocate of the competence approach
to management training. He is also anxious to see more done for managers who
are unemployed or facing redundancy.
His college enrols unemployed managers, or those facing redundancy, on
courses at reduced fees to enhance their job prospects and help them
re-orient themselves.
The IM is marketing hard its 'competent manager' programmes. These are
self-study packages leading to a certificate and diploma in management at
NVQ levels 4 and 5, available on an in-house basis or through a public
programme offered through IM or one of its licensed centres.
At the heart of the programme is a 'modular training structure', focused on
the application of an individual manager's working environment. With 103
branches, the institute runs tailored courses for companies and more than 70
short 'open' courses on all the main areas of management practice. It has an
information centre based at its Corby office.
The Institute of Management, 2 Savoy Court, Strand, London WC2R OEZ.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Court told of worry on Plasser methods
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER secretary with Plasser Railway Machinery GB said at the Old Bailey
yesterday she thought business methods used by the company 'sailed close to
the wind' and could have amounted to corruption.
Mrs Stella Bond, secretary to Mr Norbert Jurasek, the company's managing
director, and Mr Michael Brooks, its company secretary, said her training as
a policewoman made her concerned about Plasser's methods.
When Mrs Bond expressed her concerns, though, she was assured it was
'perfectly all right'.
Plasser GB, Mr Jurasek and Mr Brooks all deny giving bribes to Mr David
Currie, a former British Rail head of civil engineering. Mr Currie denies
receiving bribes.
When Sir Robert Reid, a former BR chairman, visited Plasser's Austrian works
during a recent holiday the company imposed hospitality upon him, Mrs Bond
told the court.
Sir Robert was known as 'not being 100 per cent a Plasser man' and had told
the company he wanted to be on his own.
'I think it was felt as he was going to be in that part of the world Plasser
would cash in and give him some hospitality,' she said.
The trial continues today.

FT  04 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Scania signs joint venture for vehicle
assembly in Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCANIA, the Swedish truck and bus maker, has signed a joint venture contract
for the small volume assembly of vehicles in Poland. It has reached
agreement with Kapena, a Polish company engaged in maintenance and repair of
heavy buses and special vehicles, to assemble Scania vehicles at Slupsk,
near the Baltic coast.
Volvo, Scania's rival Swedish truck and bus maker, has signed an agreement
with Jelcz, the Polish commercial vehicle maker, to assemble articulated
buses for use in city traffic based on Volvo components. Production of
Scania vehicles in Poland is planned to begin next spring with the assembly
of kits supplied from its Swedish plants.
Output is set to start at 200 units a year but could be increased according
to local demand. Scania said the project also called for gradual integration
of Polish-made components. It established an importer/distributor, Eurowax,
in Gdansk last year, which is responsible for establishing after-sales
facilities in Poland.
The Capena deal is the first move into local assembly in eastern Europe by
Scania, one of the world's leading heavy truck makers. Volvo will transfer
technical documentation to Jelcz and provide technical aid to allow gradual
inclusion of locally-made components.
Initial output by Jelcz, Poland's biggest maker of heavy-duty trucks and
buses, will concentrate on articulated buses, with the aim of selling about
100 vehicles in Poland in 1993; The products range may be expanded later.
The bus chassis for assembly in Poland will come from Volvo, the body from
Steyr Bus, its Austrian subsidiary. The Jelcz pact allows for exports of
Jelcz-made buses to parts of the former Soviet Union.
MAN, the German truck maker, has signed a letter of intent with Raba, the
Hungarian engineering company, and Mogurt, the trading company, to
co-operate in assembly of trucks in Hungary. The aim is for MAN to deliver
diesel engines and truck cabs to Raba, chiefly for all-wheel drive vehicles
exclusively for the Hungarian market.

GENERAL Mills, the Minnesota-based foods company, said it and Nabisco, a
unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings, had mutually agreed to terminate a contract
signed on September 1 for General Mills to buy Nabisco's US and Canadian
ready-to-eat cold cereal business, Reuter reports from Minneapolis.
The companies said the prospect of a lengthy and prolonged review by federal
and state regulatory authorities, which now appeared likely, would preclude
completion of the transaction within a reasonable period of time.
General Mills agreed to purchase the ready-to-eat cereals business of RJR
Nabisco for Dollars 450m cash.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Haider plays xenophobic card in Austria: Right-wing party
leader takes a hard line on foreigners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC FREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jorg Haider has Austria's political establishment running scared. The
charismatic leader of the right-wing Freedom Party (FPO) is calling for a
drastic change in Austria's policy toward foreigners and has set the
government an ultimatum to accept a 12 point-programme on tougher
immigration rules by November 15.
If the Social Democratic Party and the conservative People's Party, the two
members of the ruling coalition, do not submit, Mr Haider is threatening a
nationwide petition drive.
Representatives of all other parties, the big newspapers and the Catholic
church have rejected his initiative and accuse him of inciting hatred and
violence against foreigners.
'In contrast to Germany, our arsonists are not standing on the street, but
are sitting in parliament,' said Ms Madeleine Petrovic, the parliamentary
leader of the Greens.
Mr Haider's 12 points include some measures the government claims are
standard practice, such as the deportation of alien criminals, while others
are policies that could not or should not be instituted, critics say.
Mr Haider is calling for the halt of all immigration until the problem of
illegal aliens in the country has been solved 'in a satisfactory way'. He
also wants an amendment to the constitution specifying that Austria is 'not
an immigrant country'. Both of these would violate international conventions
and the rules of the European Economic Area treaty, which Austria signed
earlier this year.
Another proposal to limit the number of foreign students in any school class
to 30 per cent could be achieved only by US style bussing in parts of Vienna
with a high share of foreign residents. It would also affect thousands of
children born in the country who have German as their mother tongue and are
no different from Austrian children.
Still, observers say the Freedom Party could collect as many as 1m votes,
out of a population of 7m, feeding on the growing xenophobic sentiments in
the country.
Austrian law does not require the government to hold a referendum because of
a petition. But a successful drive would put the two ruling parties on the
spot. If they dismissed the initiative, they would open themselves to
charges of ignoring the people's will. If they adopted any of the proposals,
Mr Haider could claim a great political victory.
Austria has not experienced the kind of right-wing violence against refugees
seen in neighbouring Germany. But the influx of thousands of people from
Eastern Europe and former Yugoslavia seeking asylum and work - 50,000 from
Bosnia alone - has brought the question to the top of the political agenda.
In a recent poll, 79 per cent said they do not want new immigrants. In the
latest sign Austria is not immune to growing intolerance and racism in
Europe, 80 graves were defiled in a Jewish cemetery in the town of
Eisenstadt south-east of Vienna last Sunday.
The populist Mr Haider has used real every-day problems and vague fears in
the population for his political purposes and has made inroads into the
other parties' voting blocs by appealing to xenophobia and racism. Last
November, the Freedom Party achieved 23 per cent in communal elections in
Vienna after campaigning on an anti-foreigner platform.
This latest initiative comes at a time when the party's rise in the national
polls has levelled off at about 17 per cent. Unwilling to stand still, Mr
Haider is using the petition to step up his offensive against the ruling
parties.
In an effort to pre-empt him both the Social Democrats and the People's
Party have shifted to the right on immigration issues. New laws were passed
last summer to restrict the number of asylum seekers and foreign workers. Mr
Erhard Busek, FPO chairman, last month demanded the deportation of thousands
of illegal aliens.
Mr Haider has even received support from Mr Helmut Schuller, director of the
Catholic charity Caritas and a leading advocate of a liberal immigration
policy.
Other leading church representatives quickly distanced themselves from Mr
Schuller.
As always when he makes controversial outbursts, Mr Haider faces some
dissent within his own party, although the number of credible opponents is
small following a number of resignations and one sacking in the past year.
Ms Heide Schmidt, a ranking FPO member of parliament and her party's
presidential candidate last spring, is the most important remaining critic,
but she has been pressured to withdraw her opposition to Mr Haider's latest
campaign.
Her likely departure from the party's leadership would remove the last
internal resistance to Mr Haider's nationalistic course, but it may cost the
party credibility, if not votes.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (11): A battle on many fronts
 -Oil and the Environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE battleground is familiar, but the conflict is not slackening. Oil and
gas companies have for years been one of the main targets of environmental
regulation and of 'green' pressure groups. The companies claim in turn that
they have spent a fortune looking after the environment, and that standards
have greatly improved.
It is true there have been vast improvements in curbing pollution - and at
considerable cost. But with the addition of global warming to the list of
potential environmental threats, the industry faces new pressures:
international calls for energy conservation and for taxes to curb the use of
fossil fuels.
Environmental regulation, which affects the oil and gas industry from
production to consumption, began in most countries by focusing on local and
regional pollution, where the threats to health and the source of the
pollution could easily be identified.
One of the earliest campaigns - and one of the most successful - has been
aimed at limiting the emission of sulphur dioxide from refineries and fuel,
and so reduce acid rain that can travel many miles across international
boundaries. According to industry estimates, emissions of sulphur from OECD
refineries have decreased by more than a third in the past decade and are
continuing to fall.
A second focus has been on the risk of oil leaks, particularly after the
Exxon Valdez disaster in 1989 when 267,000 barrels of oil were spilled off
the coast of Alaska. In 1990, the US passed the Oil Spill Act requiring new
tankers to have double hulls; and this June the International Marine
Organisation, which regulates shipping worldwide, also tightened rules on
ship design.
Commercial penalties for slight infringement of environmental rules can be
so great, particularly under US tort law, that companies are prepared to go
to some lengths to avoid risk. Mr David Simon, group chief executive of
British Petroleum, says: 'One only has to consider the political, economic,
commercial and public relations repercussions of a major environmental
accident to understand why no oil company in its senses would ever
needlessly run risks or cut corners.'
Environmental groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth are
sceptical about those claims. According to Mr Simon Roberts, a campaigner
with Friends of the Earth, companies have sometimes tried to meet emission
and discharge standards 'by exporting the problem and locating operations in
areas with slacker rules, such as developing countries.'
Pressure groups are right to point to the discrepancies in international
standards - the former Soviet Union countries, which collectively still
produce most of the world's oil and gas, arouse some of the main
environmental concerns.
However, environmentalists sometimes dismiss too lightly the cost of meeting
environmental rules. The costs were not always apparent when the rules were
made - and many oil companies argue that ultimately they are borne by the
consumer.
Speaking at the World Energy Congress in Madrid in September, Mr Simon
suggested the cost to the US oil industry of complying with all US
environmental laws, regulations and standards was between Dollars 15bn and
Dollars 20bn a year - compared with present US petroleum profits of between
Dollars 20bn and Dollars 25bn a year.
Industry estimates suggest that the cost of complying with existing EC rules
are between Dollars 8.5bn and Dollars 9.5bn a year, equal to the net annual
income worldwide of Europe's top seven oil companies.
The EC estimates the investment needed to reduce sulphur in heating gas oil
and diesel fuel at Ecu5bn (Dollars 6.5bn) to Ecu7bn (Dollars 9bn) up to the
year 2000 and European oil companies and consultants have suggested that the
cost of reducing sulphur in fuel oil and shipping could be Dollars 20bn over
the same period.
According to Ms Fiona Nichol, oil analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities,
'it's getting a little bit scary particularly in the US - rules are now
being passed which are technically hard to put into practice, and the costs
are rising because the easy stuff has been done.'
Heading the list of difficult problems which have yet to be tackled
adequately is the risk of global warming, linked to the emission of carbon
dioxide from burning the fossil fuels coal, oil and gas. International
discussions have focused on carbon or energy taxes rather than regulation,
partly because the sources of emissions are so diverse.
The EC has proposed a tax that rises from 3 per cent to 10 per cent by 2000,
levied half on energy value and half on carbon content. According to the
Commission, fossil fuels account for 85 per cent of all energy consumed in
the EC, and EC countries have acknowledged that without a tax they stand no
chance of meeting international targets of stabilising carbon emission
levels at 1990 levels in the year 2000. Recession in the US and Europe has
temporarily depressed energy use and made some of the targets easier to
achieve, but it has also increased opposition to the new proposals and their
accompanying costs.
The economic slump has, however, moved energy efficiency initiatives higher
up the agendas of governments. But while efficiency measures could help
extend the life of non-renewable fuels, they could also threaten the
short-term revenue of the energy companies, and some environmentalists have
been sceptical about industry's support for these investments.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (10): Spirit of independence
 -The post-Soviet risks and opportunities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RUSSIA has two overwhelming macro-economic priorities
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
to end its dependence on hard currency-consuming food imports and boost its
production of hard currency-earning energy exports. But doing either means
fundamental changes to the mentality of people brought up on the theory that
nature is a free gift, not merely to be used but to be violently assaulted.
Thanks to such thinking the former Soviet Union became the unchallenged
world leader at turning precious natural resources into stinking ecological
disaster areas. That recent past, and lingering, deep seated suspicion of
the intentions and working methods of western oilmen, is the main obstacle
to large scale western investment without which both the oil and gas
industry is doomed to further decay.
Most existing Russian oil regions have been so irrationally and badly
developed that the cost of modernising them and cleaning up the
environmental damage often exceeds the real market value of the oil
recoverable. The main western companies interested in such areas are those
like Canadian Fracmaster and others who specialise in delivering spare parts
and working repairs, and those suppliers of equipment assured of hard
currency payment.
However, with more than 27,000 wells idle in the Tyumen oil province of
western Siberia alone due to shortage of the most basic spare parts and
repair kits, there is enormous potential for business and for rapid
productivity gains from relatively small but timely inputs. Any rational
Russian oil policy would put energy conservation, war on waste and getting
existing facilities up and running at the top of the priority list.
It is difficult to educate oil workers and managers in the need for rigorous
cost controls and ecological precautions, however, while prices remain well
below world levels and their own living and working conditions are so bad.
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian deputy prime minister responsible for
energy policy, suggested last month that prices would be allowed to rise by
stages to world levels by the end of 1993, under state control. This
followed a decree by President Boris Yeltsin which doubled the price of
crude oil in mid-September to 20,000 roubles (Dollars 20) a tonne, still a
fraction of the world price.
The delayed move towards world pricing levels keeps the industry deprived of
the resources it needs. At the same time what looked earlier this year like
promising moves towards a genuine devolution of power and responsibility to
smaller operating companies is now in question again as the recentralisers
and their KGB friends retake the initiative. Given the overall deterioration
in economic conditions, and the natural attraction of the oil and gas
industry to the parasites of the former Soviet system, it will be an uphill
struggle for years, to create a modern industry.
Most western experts, and the current reformist Russian government, believe
that the industry needs to be privatised as soon as possible if it is to
acquire the flexibility and operational efficiency required to make good
local partners. Mr Alexander Samusev, the deputy fuel and energy minister,
recently warned that delay in launching such structural reforms would only
increase the industry's decline.
Oil output is expected to drop to between 390m-395m tonnes this year, around
8m barrels a day, from 460m tonnes a year in 1991 and 624m tonnes at its
peak in 1988. while The gas industry is also hard pressed to maintain output
at current levels.
Mr Samusev said the government was working on plans to restructure the
industry by creating a handful of powerful, vertically integrated companies
responsible for refining and marketing their own crude and establishing
joint ventures with foreign companies.
Western oil companies are used to working in difficult places and are
looking hard to diversify sources of supply and improve their reserves in
the 21st century. They have no doubts about the vast oil and gas potential
of Russia and several of the other republics. What they want is a framework
which would secure acceptable terms, which is to say terms similar to those
in the rest of the world, for participation above all in greenfield ventures
in which they can be involved from the very beginning.
A succinct rundown of the basic requirements demanded by western companies
and financial institutions before serious business can be done is contained
in a report issued by the World Bank in August after a study of the West
Siberian oil industry. With a possible Dollars 870m of funding in the
balance the Bank made clear that investment would only be forthcoming if:
oil prices were raised to world levels within 24 months.
taxes on the oil extraction sector were both cut and restructured.
specific individuals responsible for reforming the industry were clearly
identified.
oil industry legislation were drawn up and adopted.
machinery for both providing credit and monitoring its use were put in
place.
Significantly the need to create world-type conditions to attract investors
has been accepted most whole-heartedly by those parts of the former Soviet
Union which were formerly Russia's subservient colonies, such as Kazakhstan
and Azerbaijan. Freed from Moscow's heavy hand the leaders of these newly
independent republics have taken the decisions needed by western businessmen
before agreeing to commit billions of dollars to long term projects.
Chevron's Dollars 2.5bn agreement with Kazakhstan to develop the huge
potential of the Tengiz oil field, the Pounds 3.1bn British Gas, Agip and
Statoil contract to explore and develop the 20 trillion cubic metre
Karachaganak gas field, and the Dollars 1.7bn deal with United BMB of Turkey
to develop four oil fields and build four gas fired power stations at
Aktyubinsk are clear indicators that this policy is paying off. Kazakhstan
is set to become a significant 21st century energy supplier.
Several other projects are also under discussion while elsewhere in the
region the Stan Cornelius Consortium of US investors recently reached
agreement to develop the 800m barrel Mingbulak oil deposit in Uzbekistan;
and Amoco, together with Unocal and McDermott, has made a joint venture with
Azerbaijan's Kaspmorenefetegaz to develop the offshore Azeri field in the
Caspian sea.
These are just a few of the dozens, possibly hundreds of deals of all shapes
and sizes currently under discussion all across this vast area from the
Arctic Ocean to Sakhalin Island.
It is not easy getting oil and gas out of the ground and safely to market
from anywhere in this huge area. But for those involved and those pondering
the plunge, the break up of the former Soviet Union has provided some of the
most exciting oil and gas prospects in the world.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Portugal (9): Quality, not quantity - A shift in
strategy in the tourism sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLIDAYS spent amid the dust and noise of building sites cause the biggest
number of complaints from British tourists who visit Portugal's southern
Algarve coast, according to a recent survey for the Department of Tourism.
These visitors are victims of constructors who have been trying to keep pace
with a boom in tourism that has transformed the country's main holiday
region in the past decade. Tourism has been growing at a rate of 11.5 per
cent a year since 1980 and high-rise hotels and apartment blocks have
mushroomed at a similar speed. European tourism as whole has grown at a rate
of only 3.5 per cent a year over that period.
Recent statistics reflect the dramatic expansion of tourism. This year
Portugal expects to welcome 20m visitors, double the population, and almost
10m tourists (visitors who stay one night or more). This compares with 7m
visitors and 2.7m tourists in 1980.
As a result, the importance of tourism to the Portuguese economy has greatly
increased. Today, it accounts for 6 to 8 per cent of the gross domestic
product, a contribution to national wealth that equals that of textiles,
civil construction or the financial sector.
Foreign currency receipts have grown from Es57.5bn (Pounds 263m) in 1980 to
Es530bn in 1991. These earnings cover half of Portugal's trade deficit,
making an important contribution to the current account balance.
To ease the strain of this boom on the Algarve, where some areas are
becoming overcrowded, disorganised and ugly, the government has devised a
new strategy for the tourism sector. It switches the emphasis from new
building to diversification and expanding the use of existing facilities.
According to Mr Alexandre Relvas, secretary of state for tourism, 'our
resources have their limits and sooner or later we will reach saturation
point'.
Instead, tourism policy will switch from a heavy dependence on sun and sea
holidays and an over-strong reliance on the UK and Spain, to more emphasis
on investing to improve facilities rather than build new ones.
To this end, the Department of Tourism has drawn up a 19-point plan with the
overall aim of improving the competitiveness of Portuguese tourism. The
strategy will be backed up with an Es50bn (Pounds 230m) two-year financial
programme to support investment.
'To be competitive in the 1990s, tourism has to invest heavily in quality
rather than quantity,' says Mr Relvas. 'This financial programme will help
us create a competitive tourism industry in the future.'
A total of Es20bn from the new fund will be provided as grants for
investment, 60 per cent financed by European Community structural funds.
Grants will cover up to 25 per cent of the total cost of investment. But
unlike the past, very little will be made available for building new hotels.
Instead, the money will go to modernise and re-equip existing units, for the
construction of additional facilities such as golf courses and congress
centres and to diversify from beach holidays into sports and cultural
tourism.
A further Es30bn will be made available by the Tourism Fund, a special
credit institution, and banks at low interest rates.
Portugal's new tourism strategy is also aimed at combating a worrying trend.
While the number of tourists has increased spectacularly, the amount they
spend is falling. In 1980 average spending per tourist was 35 per cent above
the European average in dollar terms. Today, it is 15 per cent below.
Tourists currently spend a mere Es9,000 a day on hotels and restaurants.
Tourism authorities have mapped out two main strategies for changing this.
Beach holidays have become a mature market, where growth is falling off
rapidly. Tough competition between major operators and the globalisation of
the market through airline liberalisation is forcing down prices.
Portugal is trying to diversify away from this sector into congresses,
cultural tourism and golf and other sporting holidays. 'This development
will offer the twin advantages of attracting higher-spending tourists and
being able to use existing Algarve facilities in the off-season,' says Mr
Relvas.
Officials also want to attract tourists away from the Algarve, which
accounts for 40 per cent of total bed nights, to other areas, such as the
Lisbon coastline and the unspoiled Alentejo region north of the Algarve.
Though Portugal will maintain promotional efforts in Britain and Spain,
which together account for half its bed nights, efforts will also be made to
boost the Italian, French and German markets and to break into the US and
Japan. Regular flights from Japan, scheduled to begin in 1994, should help
increase the number of its tourists from the current level of 30,000 a year.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Portugal (11): TV is no longer a state monopoly -
The Media
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW era opened on October 6 when Portugal's first private television
station, SIC, hit the airwaves, thereby ending 35 years of state monopoly.
Early next year, SIC (Sociedade Independente de Comunicacao) will be joined
by a second private station, TVI (Televisao Independente), which is backed
by the Roman Catholic Church. Their fight for survival in an uncertain
advertising market pitches them against two stations partly financed by the
government and run by RTP (Radiotelevisao Portuguesa), Canal 1 and TV2.
SIC is headed by Mr Francisco Pinto Balsemao, a former prime minister and
Portugal's only media magnate. Mr Balsemao, whose publications include
Expresso, the country's most respected weekly newspaper, has no doubt about
the significance of the launch of private TV. 'It's important for the people
to be aware of what's going on in the country and the world, and it's
important for them to exercise the right of choice, (and) the right to be
different, which have not existed until now,' he says.
Under the dictatorship which fell in 1974, RTP was part of the regime's
propaganda machine. Even after Portugal's return to democracy, the station
has been accused of being too close to the government. Mr Jose Eduardo
Moniz, RTP's head of news and programmes, says the days of subservience have
gone. 'We feel we have changed quite a lot in the last six or seven years,
and that we have managed to gain the trust of a large part of the
population.'
Mr Balsemao disagrees. He is convinced that SIC can be more independent and
impartial than his state-run rivals, especially when it comes to news.
Surprisingly, his station is taking on RTP's popular Canal 1 with an almost
identical prime time programme structure, preceding and following the main
evening news with telenovelas, the racy Brazilian soap operas that regularly
keep the Portuguese glued to their sets.
Advertising analysts warn that this policy of direct confrontation with the
state networks contradicts all market rules, but Mr Balsemao is confident.
'We had two strategic possibilities: either to accept that we would be a
small alternative television aiming at maybe 10 to 15 per cent of the
audience, or the one we have chosen,' he says.
SIC's remaining programmes, like RTP's, consist of game and chat shows,
subtitled feature films, and mainly American sitcoms and series.
Tight finance will also leave SIC with little money to splash out on
expensive home-grown productions, especially drama. The government has
established tough requirements which all networks will have to meet within
three years. Forty per cent of all output must be in Portuguese,
three-quarters of which has to be produced in Portugal. RTP, with its Es16bn
budget for the current year compared to SIC's projected Es8bn for 1993, will
find it considerably easier to meet such targets.
So far, SIC's confrontation strategy has been only partially successful. Its
news programmes are tighter, more dynamic, and have a more popular appeal.
The titles, inspired by Brazilian designers, are slicker and more colourful
than RTP's. But telenovela lovers have found that RTP was given first choice
of the Brazilian supply, leaving SIC to screen older productions. In fact,
Brazil's TV Globo, the main producer of telenovelas, looks like the only
clear winner so far by selling its products to all three channels.
SIC's capital of Es6bn represents the biggest investment made in Portugal's
media industry. Soincom, an investment company controlled by Mr Balsemao, is
SIC's largest single shareholder with a 25 per cent stake - the maximum any
individual or group is allowed to hold. Foreign participation is limited to
15 per cent, and in SIC's case, this is fully taken up by TV Globo which
provided a great deal of technical assistance.
Mr Balsemao hopes to break even by the end of the third year and to capture
some 30 per cent of TV advertising within five years. This would leave 50
per cent for RTP's two channels and 20 per cent for TVI. But with its 10m
inhabitants, Portugal is a small advertising market. Although its economy is
expected to expand at a rate above the European Community average, growth
has slowed. Portugal's advertising market grew by a sturdy 25 per cent in
the first half of 1992, but this is far short of annual growth rates of up
to 40 per cent in the second half of the 1980s.
Television takes about 45 per cent of all advertising in Portugal, but the
future is uncertain, and it is hard to predict whether and how advertisers
will increase or shift their budgets. 'Companies will make some efforts to
have a bigger advertising budget,' says Mr Carlos Sousa, deputy manager of
Universal Media Portugal. 'However, I don't think that growth will be very
significant'.
Mr Sousa admits to no surprise that SIC has captured a satisfactory amount
of advertising for the initial period. 'Everybody is trying to be there for
the first few weeks. Let's wait for the audience figures,' he cautions.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Portugal (10): Blue flags and a tinge of green -
Environmental Awareness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH PROVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 50km south of Lisbon in the protected natural park of the Serra da
Arrabida, 2,000 tonnes of toxic waste were dumped in the open air almost six
years ago. The waste came from environment-friendly Switzerland - part of
20,000 tonnes exported to Portugal between 1987 and 1990 by a Zurich-based
aluminium recycling plant, writes Sarah Provan.
The Portuguese company that received the waste lacked the facilities to deal
with it. The Swiss company has closed, and Switzerland refuses to take the
waste back since it was exported more than four years ago - the legal limit
beyond which waste cannot be returned to Switzerland.
Local protests, and an open letter by Quercus, an environmentalist group, to
Mr Carlos Borrego, environment minister, failed to get the waste removed. In
desperation, the park authorities began moving it themselves last month.
Environment groups condemn the Portuguese authorities' lack of concern. 'The
environment is hardly a top priority for the government. It seems more
important to increase industry (and) build more roads,' says Mr Antonio
Eloy, a consultant of Friends of the Earth in Lisbon.
Mr Borrego, whose ministry was promoted to cabinet level less than three
years ago, says the criticism is unfair. 'Portugal is not the European
Community country with the worst environment.' This, he admits, is partly
due to Portugal's structural backwardness. 'However, it is precisely for
this reason that we've had greater difficulties in applying certain
regulations that other countries have applied for years.'
In a programme outlined to parliament last month, he stressed the need to
raise public awareness. Priority areas were 'hydraulic resources, and the
preservation of natural spaces, together with ecological education',
especially among the younger generations.
Environmentalists are unconvinced by the minister's programme. 'In 1971, the
government targeted water and natural spaces; 20 years later, protected
areas continue to be eaten up by fires, tourism, urban development and
industry,' Mr Eloy says.
Mr Jose Macario Correia, former secretary of state for the environment,
agrees. 'We don't need more laws, we have enough legislation.' The problem,
he suggests, is enforcement.
As a relatively poor country, Portugal lacks the resources available to its
richer European partners to fight pollution, but environmentalists say the
country's recent rapid pace of development makes action to protect the
environment more urgent. Every summer, fires - not all accidental -
devastate large chunks of forest and countryside, about 25 per cent of
rivers are subject to pollution while around half the 10m population has
inadequate water supplies; many beaches near the main towns are polluted,
and in the cities, noise, exhaust fumes and chaotic building sites
contribute to making life less pleasant and more hazardous.
This year, Portuguese beaches could muster only 50 EC blue flags which give
them a clean bill of health, compared with 96 flags in 1991. Only Germany,
Britain and Belgium were worse off. Mr Borrego blames this year's decline on
a sanitary technicians' strike which prevented proper analysis of the
country's beaches. But the biggest culprits are inadequate sewage systems
and factories which dump chemicals and waste in nearby rivers or unused
land.
The picture is not all bleak. Uncontrolled development has ruined part of
the coastline in the Algarve and as a result the authorities have began to
impose strict building regulations in an effort to avoid further damage. The
experience is also encouraging local authorities elsewhere in the country to
give more thought to the environmental consequences of planned developments.
Late to industrialise, Portugal also has avoided many of the environmental
pitfalls of rapid postwar reconstruction. 'Portugal emits much lower
quantities of carbon dioxide than any other country (in Europe). The UK
emits 2.4kg per inhabitant a year, while Portugal emits 0.9kg,' Mr Borrego
says.
But it still has a long way to go towards improving awareness of green
issues. People will carelessly toss wrappers and rubbish onto the streets,
ignoring the many green plastic bins dotted around the capital and many
other cities. Lisbon has few bottle banks, and paper recycling is poorly
organised.
For all these shortcomings, people have become more conscious of the need to
care for the environment. The press and television are more aggressive in
reporting environmental issues, and there have been official publicity
campaigns to raise awareness. Mistakes that have been made, as in the
Algarve, will be costly to correct, but Portugal in its dash to
modernisation is still ready to benefit from the experience of others.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (8):  Inquiries, inquiries -
Turmoil in the UK Gas Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS'S announcement in August that it had decided to submit itself to
an investigation by the UK competition body, the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, was greeted with astonishment and anger by the rest of the gas
industry.
Rival suppliers saw the UK's hard-won independent gas market plunged into a
year of turmoil. British Gas had itself been hoping to avoid a full-blown
MMC inquiry which, it acknowledges, casts a shadow of uncertainty across the
industry. But the company's decision to throw itself open to scrutiny is a
reflection of the level of frustration felt within British Gas at the hands
of its regulators.
The gas industry's problems date back to the privatisation of British Gas as
a single entity in 1986. The regulators have been eager to promote the
development of competition since then, but rival suppliers have been slow to
take root.
In a bid to break the hold of British Gas on the market, Sir James McKinnon,
director general of the Office of Gas Supply (Ofgas), the industry
regulator, has subjected the company to a growing number of measures aimed
at eroding its market share.
British Gas has complained of the rules constantly changing mid-game. In
October last year, Ofgas was joined by the Office of Fair Trading in calling
for a more rapid growth in competition in the UK gas market. The OFT called
on British Gas to give up half of its share of the industrial gas market by
1995 as well as to hive off its transportation and storage arm. British Gas
reluctantly agreed to these onerous demands but became embroiled in
discussion of their detail.
The flashpoint which caused the company to take the unprecedented step of
calling in the MMC came over the failure to agree with the regulator an
acceptable rate of return for the separate pipeline business. But by then,
British Gas's already strained relationship with Sir James had degenerated
into an acrimonious state of warfare.
British Gas has congratulated itself in the past on its willingness to cede
market share and encourage competitors, but rivals, which have often found a
champion in Sir James, have accused the company of exploiting its monopoly
grip on the market.
Nevertheless, independent suppliers have managed to capture 30 per cent of
the market for firm contract gas. The firm contract market represents half
of the overall industrial market and British Gas still retains a monopoly
over domestic customers.
Independent suppliers have been hampered by the long-term gas purchasing
patterns that exist in the North Sea. British Gas had contracted to buy up
so many North Sea fields that there was little left over for independents to
market. As a way round this dilemma, the OFT recommended that British Gas
sell off some of its supplies to rivals in a bid to encourage them into the
market.
The first of these gas auctions got underway in June with 32 rival suppliers
bidding for gas. The OFT argued that the gas auctions would allocate supply
to new companies until they are able to buy directly from the North Sea
later in the decade.
But many established gas marketing companies are critical of the way the
creation of competition in the gas market is being handled. They say the
regulators are encouraging independent companies with a short-term view of
the market and who could prove to be unreliable suppliers in the long run.
At least half of the independent companies to rival British Gas in the
market have been set up in the past year and some observers fear the
industry is attracting a flavour of the Wild West with short-term operators
rushing to make a quick buck.
British Gas is not allowed to discriminate between long-term players and
newcomers in its gas auctions. Rivals are, however, fearful that British Gas
is still exercising its clout in order to squeeze them out of long-term
supply when they try to buy into North Sea fields.
Enron, the large US gas company, was thwarted in a recent attempt to buy an
interest in a block of North Sea gas production from the US oil company,
Chevron, when other companies participating in the block - British Gas,
Phillips Petroleum and Agip - exercised their pre-emption rights. British
Gas said the move was not an attempt to block a competitor, and pointed out
that Enron was still negotiating to buy gas from the field.
Enron is also leading a consortium to build a 1,725 megawatt gas-fired power
staion at Imperial Chemical Industries' Wilton site in Teesside, north-east
England, to be supplied by the Amoco-operated Everest and Lomond fields in
the central North Sea. The Pounds 800m plant is due to come on stream in
April 1993. Enron plans to market surplus gas from the project.
As well as looking to gain a greater hold of the industrial market, rival
suppliers are also positioning themselves to enter domestic supply.
The government has said it will progressively raise the ceiling on the
amount of gas a user must take before it can source outside British Gas.
This should mean a choice of supplier for domestic households by 1996.
Several regional electricity companies have moved to set up gas marketing
arms so that by 1996 they will be in a position to provide a full-range of
energy services to householders.
However, it is still not clear how a free market in domestic energy will
work; the government has yet to decide how the market will be regulated or
how much responsibility British Gas will bear as the supplier of last
resort.
The government and regulators believe that this rush of competition will
bring down costs for users, cutting the price of domestic fuel bills. In a
recent survey of participants in the gas market, the consultants Ernst &amp;
Young found that the majority believed increased competition would reduce
prices. But they also pointed to concerns that industrial users of
interruptible gas could face higher costs.
Interruptible gas users currently pay the cheapest prices for supply from
British Gas as the company reserves the right to cut them off during periods
of peak demand. Since it is almost impossible to make a profit on these
supplies, rivals have not entered the market. British Gas has, however,
signalled that, as its market share is eroded, it may retreat from this
market sector, or be forced to raise prices.
As the UK moves to free its gas market, many issues remain unresolved, not
least the sort of shape British Gas will find itself in by this time next
year. The MMC could well call for the monolithic British Gas to break up
into a into a series of regional supply companies, like those in the
privatised electricity industry, as a way to encourage competition.
Many observers believe that if British Gas had been privatised as a series
of smaller regional companies in the first place, there would have been no
need for the machinations of the past six years.
The MMC is sure to consider a recommendation by the OFT that British Gas
sell off its pipeline business as a separate entity. The OFT only backed off
from this demand in return for British Gas's co-operation with the rest of
its recommendations. Mr Jonathan Stern, independent gas expert, thinks that
British Gas stands a 50 per cent chance of being broken up. One of the few
things that are certain is that the industry will remain in limbo throughout
the MMC inquiry which is likely to take this year and most of next to
complete.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (9): A healthier atmosphere
for supplier and customer - US gas prices harden after five year trough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE gloom is finally starting to lift from the US natural gas industry
thanks to rising gas prices, after five years when it seemed that they would
never recover.
Hurricane Andrew can take some of the credit for the reversal of ill
fortune. When the hurricane swept through the Gulf of Mexico in August, not
only did demand for gas rise sharply, but it also knocked out a fair amount
of production which helped fuel a further spike in gas prices.
By September, the gas futures contract had hit a peak of Dollars 2.74 per
million British thermal units (Btu), compared with prices as low as Dollars
1.05 per million Btu earlier this year.
But prices had started to creep higher months before the hurricane hit. Gas
delivered to Henry Hubb, Louisiana, - a major pipeline interchange point -
had an average price of Dollars 1.21 per million Btu in February. By May,
the average price was up to Dollars 1.59 per million Btu rising to Dollars
1.75 per million Btu in July before soaring to Dollars 2.33 per million Btu
in September.
Ironically, part of the reason for the underlying price improvement lies in
the high storage levels at the end of last year's very mild winter. Shortly
after the stored gas was dumped on the market at very low prices, demand for
gas shot up thanks to unusually cool weather in March and April.
According to Mr Thomas Driscoll, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, storage
actually fell below target levels, pushing prices higher as the storage was
refilled later in the summer. When the hurricane struck, market supply was
already tight and storage was still below target levels.
Barring an extraordinarily warm winter, analysts expect prices to hold at
higher levels, albeit below their September peaks. The improved prices bode
well for the industry's short-term outlook, but may do little to alleviate
the industry's fundamental problems.
'The balance of supply and demand in the gas industry is a comedy of
errors,' say Mr Driscoll. 'Right now it just happens to be in good shape.'
Mr Driscoll is one of many observers who believes the erratic fortunes of
the US gas industry are 'the legacy of congressional meddling and what that
has meant for prices and demand'.
De-regulation of the US gas industry, which started in the early 1980s,
fostered conditions conducive to cost undercutting. The creation of an open
access transportation system prompted competition among interstate
pipelines, while the monthly bidding process for 30-day spot natural gas
supplies contributed to volatile prices.
Producers exacerbated the pricing problem by trying to bolster sales volumes
to counter the damage of plummeting prices.
Compounding the industry's troubles was legislation dating to the 1970s
which prohibited the use of gas for fuel in new industrial plants and
electrical power plants.
The move was designed to preserve what was perceived as a rapidly depleting
resource. Largely as a result, natural gas has never challenged coal as US
industry's main fuel. The biggest use of gas is in the residential market -
making up about half of all energy consumed in US homes.
Although industrial demand for gas is expected to rise, now that the ban has
been lifted, it is unlikely to change the face of the gas industry.
In addition, a tax credit introduced by Congress in 1980 to stimulate
drilling in difficult areas has dampened prices by allowing the government
to subsidise a large portion of gas production. The Section 29 tax credits,
enacted at a time when conventional wisdom expected the world to run out of
energy, is now being phased out. The credit will only apply to drilling that
starts by December 21, although the output from that drilling will continue
to be subsidised through 2002.
Given that about half of all wells drilling today are drilling for Section
29 gas, analysts expect production to fall sharply, unless the credit is
extended, which should help support higher gas prices.
The gas industry also hopes to benefit from the 1990 Clean Air Act, under
which US cities with the worst air pollution must take alternative fuel
measures in the next decade. Demand for natural gas as a cleaner burning
fuel in vehicles is expected to rise as a result. In addition, electric
utilities will probably turn to natural gas to meet the acid rain provision
of the Act.
According to Mr Driscoll, the Clean Air Act is starting to have an impact on
the gas industry, but it is unlikely to improve conditions dramatically. 'If
you look at all the natural gas vehicles and all the power plants that will
have to reduce emissions, it still won't affect today's performance. If you
look at the numbers, there's still not a lot of demand for gas.'
It is estimated that prices would have to climb to a range of Dollars 2.50
to Dollars 3 per million Btu to stimulate a significant increase in drilling
and exploration. Largely as a result of the low prices, weak demand and
environmental pressures, most of the big US gas producers have turned their
attention away from the US and are concentrating on drilling overseas.
Independent producers, however, are still focused on the US and are starting
to buy the assets being sold by the major companies, which will leave the US
somewhat more dependent on independent gas producers in years to come.
'The gas industry is now changing rapidly on the production side,' says Mr
Driscoll. 'At this point, the major producers have decided to move overseas
and the ability of the gas industry to drill is quickly declining. I think
it will take a long time to turn that around. The government does very
little to help the industry and in many ways is driving the industry out of
the US.'

FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Portugal (8): Farm reform will be painful -
Drought has added to the problems of the agricultural sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH PROVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN last winter's drought was at its worst in Portugal's southern Alentejo
province, desperate farmers and entire communities joined in emotional
processions and prayers for rain. Whether by divine intervention or as a
result of the passing seasons, rain duly came, but not soon enough to avoid
the debilitating consequences of one of the country's worst drought in
decades.
In March, the government hastily put together a Es20bn package to help those
in the most badly affected areas, but farmers say they are still waiting for
the promised compensation. With about 1.5m hectares severely affected by
drought, farmers say they will go bankrupt unless assistance is available
soon.
'The whole Alentejo region is in ruin because of the effects of the
drought,' says Mr Manuel Rebocho from the Commission for the Fight Against
Drought, which was set up this year to represent farmers in the Alentejo.
The drought was a sad reminder of the broader problems facing Portuguese
agriculture, which threaten the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of
farming families. In 1990, almost 18 per cent of the labour force worked on
the land or in the fishing industry, according to a European Commission
report. Portugal has 10 per cent of the Community's farmers, but they
produce only a fraction of EC output. Agriculture accounted for 5.5 per cent
of Portugal's gross domestic product in 1989.
Difficult conditions and limited prospects have contributed to a sharp
decline in the number of people living on the land. Since 1986 the rural
population has fallen by about 1.7 per cent annually. The total number of
farms has declined from about 700,000 a decade ago to 550,000 today. Mr Raul
Miguel Rosado Fernandes, president of the Portuguese Farmers' Confederation,
(PAC) admits Portugal has too many farms and that a more efficient figure
would be closer to 100,000 farms.
He says a large number of farms have been abandoned already, and many small
farms are teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. 'The average farm has about
five cows. Nobody is interested in taking over these farms, or protecting
under-performing co-operatives.'
The potential social problems are enormous. 'We must have other choices for
these people - in industry and the service sector,' says Mr Armindo de Sousa
Ribeiro, former president of Ifadap, the financial support institute for
agriculture and fisheries responsible for channelling EC funds into
agriculture.
But while farming in the north is often a complementary activity with the
bulk of a family's income coming from other sources, farmers in the south
have no such cushion. With skills limited to farming and low educational
attainments - illiteracy is above 30 per cent in rural areas - and farming
as a way of life, providing alternatives will be difficult.
Portuguese agriculture is divided between small family farms found mainly in
the north and much larger units in the cereals-dominated south. The problem
is that family plots are far too small to be competitive, while the larger
farms are poorly managed and badly need investment in irrigation and new
production methods. Inefficient distribution and marketing networks are
further obstacles.
Since Portugal joined the EC in 1986, considerable funds and expertise have
been channelled towards its agriculture. Between 1986 and 1991, EC aid for
Portuguese agriculture was about Es195bn - representing 16 per cent of
structural funds received by Portugal. This year, the EC has pledged Es40bn
for agriculture.
EC aid is used to improve infrastructures and communications in isolated
rural areas, provide electricity and running water, and to finance training
programmes aimed at keeping young farmers on the land.
Many farmers have benefited, especially in the region around Lisbon and
along the Tagus river where the proximity to a large market and easier
access help to make farming more competitive.
Mr Manuel Rocha, a farmer in the Ribatejo province close to the capital,
says EC subsidies worth about Es30.5m helped him expand and modernise his
18-hectare farm, and switch from producing oranges to peaches and plums.
He says it was easy to obtain subsidies, but complains that technical
assistance was scarce, and advice on marketing practically non-existent.
Farmers' organisations say the government's economic policy does not help.
With some of the highest interest rates and energy prices in Europe, farmers
argue they cannot produce more cheaply. Mr Rosado Fernandes says the impact
of EC membership on Portuguese agriculture would have been much more
positive had the government adopted a less restrictive monetary policy.
All the same, until now Portuguese agriculture has enjoyed the benefits of
EC membership without many of the accompanying hardships, but reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy will change all that.
Ironically, getting the Community to agree on farm reform was one of the
main achievements of this year's Portuguese EC presidency, but it will be a
hard pill to swallow for Portugal's farmers. Phased reductions in beef and
cereal prices, along with cuts in subsidies and the dismantlement of many
import restrictions from January 1 1993, will hurt Portugal's farmers who
had until recently largely been shielded from outside competition.
Many farmers know they must improve productivity and diversify to compete
against other European producers by 2001 when Portuguese agriculture's
extended transition period to adapt to EC rules will end, but it is likely
to be a painful transition.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Portugal (7): The survival of the fittest -
Industry, especially in the Vale do Ave region, faces a difficult period of
transition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARLES DARWIN's theory of natural selection is catching up fast with
Portuguese industry. Threatened by the single European market and
fast-growing competition from newly industrialised countries and eastern
Europe, industrialists are increasingly talking about the survival of the
fittest.
Extinction looms over many companies in Portugal's traditional sectors -
clothing, textiles and footwear - whose competitiveness has relied for too
long on depressed prices, low wages and a exchange rate policy geared to
keeping prices competitive despite high inflation.
'That era is definitively ended,' Mr Luis Alves Monteiro, secretary of state
for industry, states emphatically. 'Portugal's integration into the European
Community means turning a page in our economic history to a period when
quality will be selected over quantity.'
His words are echoed by exporters who today complain of the effects of a
strong escudo, high interest rates and economic recession in their main
markets. Average Portuguese wages, Dollars 4.16 a hour in 1991, according to
the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, may be only a fifth of those in Germany.
But they are being undercut by Europe's increasing openness to textile and
other imports from the Third World.
Portugal faces a difficult transition from traditional industries afflicted
by low value-added products, inefficient management and outmoded technology,
to a diversified industrial base where the competitive factors are high
quality, advanced technology, modern management and aggressive marketing.
It will be a costly change that is expected to lead to the closure of a
third of the country's plants in the textiles, footwear and clothing sectors
with the loss of 60,000 jobs over the medium term. In regions dependent on a
single industry, such as garment making, the country faces acute social
problems.
The hardest-hit area is likely to be the northern Vale do Ave textile
region, where some 120 firms with more than 30,000 workers are in
difficulty. Special EC funds are being channelled into this crisis area in
the hope of rehabilitating viable companies. Incentives will be used to coax
alternative industries into the area. South Korea's Samsung is currently one
of the prime candidates.
The government is to discuss a recovery plan for the Vale do Ave region
prepared by Mr Miguel Cadilhe, former finance minister. The scheme's main
points are:
an Es50-100bn (230-460m) risk capital fund for capital reinforcement,
financial restructuring and investment by viable companies;
tax incentives, including investment tax credit and contractual tax
incentive schemes to attract new industries and interest-rate tax exemptions
for banks on medium- and long-term loans;
a reduction of the red tape involved in mergers, closures and company
formation and
new training and research bodies focused on technology, design, marketing
and management. Added to these assets are a trained workforce that can be
easily adapted to new skills through vocational training, industrial plants
ready for adaptation, greenfield sites and relatively good infrastructure.
Officials are trying to bring about a change in the Vale do Ave region
similar to the one wrought in the Setubal peninsular, south of Lisbon.
Massive foreign investment, mainly in the automobile sector, has transformed
Setubal from a depressed shipbuilding and fish-canning area into the modern
hub of Portuguese industry.
The jewel in Setubal's crown is the Es450bn Ford-Volkswagen plant that from
1994 will begin producing 180,000 multipurpose vehicles a year. The plant
will account for a massive 30 per cent of Portugal's exports. But its value
also lies in the incentive it will provide for Portuguese automobile
component producers and other suppliers.
Suppliers for the Ford-VW project have to meet stringent quality
requirements. Despite the poor reputation for quality of much of Portuguese
industry, companies are responding well to the challenge. By the end of the
year about 30 suppliers are expected to be given Q1 status by Ford-VW, which
requires a reject rate of under 2 per cent over a 12-month period.
Another 40 have a strong possibility of meeting the required standard. Other
Portuguese suppliers are fulfilling similar requirements for other
multinational investors in Setubal, such as Ford Electronics, General Motors
and Valmet Tractors of Finland.
But officials are aware that most Portuguese companies are not up to Q1
standard. 'Many enterprises don't yet possess the elementary instruments
required for the management of quality,' says Mr Luis Morales, deputy
chairman of the Portuguese Association of Industrialists. 'They don't use
standards, they don't certify products, they don't use test laboratories or
carry out adequate quality control. They are not sensitive to the costs of
non-quality.'
But, ultimately, it is the transition from struggling garment producers to
Q1 suppliers to Ford-VW that Portugal hopes to make. 'Our industrial
structure is engaged in a great effort of transition and specialisation,
says Mr Alves Monteiro. Economists agree that the main areas where changes
are needed to achieve that objective are:
Education and professional training: Portugal has a chronic shortage of
skilled workers, technicians and managers. More than 60 per cent of workers
have only primary education and 15 per cent of the population is illiterate.
Infrastructure: Considerable progress is being made, but poor
telecommunications handicap companies, the road and port network is still
inadequate and the railways are inefficient.
Research and development: Links need to be forged between science and
industry. More investment in research is needed to improve competitiveness.
Regionalisation: Portugal suffers from marked regional imbalances. Political
power remains centralised and the government has not yet determined a
programme of regional power structures.
Bureaucracy: Despite improvements, red tape remains a hurdle for investors
and hampers business. Government departments lack co-ordination.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (6): North Sea mid-life
crisis - Britain's offshore activity has passed its peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME say the North Sea oil industry is suffering a mid-life crisis from
which it will soon recover; others that it has begun a terminal decline.
The signals are, admittedly, confusing. Events such as the lay-off of 1,300
workers at McDermott Scotland's construction yard near Inverness have hit
the headlines, along with warnings of further redundancies amid gloomy
forecasts of workloads for UK yards over the next two years. MPs and some
oil companies have called, unsuccessfully, for a change in the North Sea tax
regime to bring forward new developments.
Mr David Bramley of consultants Arthur D Little says the likely lack of
interest in this year's 14th UK licensing round could be something of a
watershed in the evolution of the North Sea, marking its transition into a
mature and ultimately declining production area.
On a more positive note, two surveys in August forecast a bright future.
Grampian Region Council's Update of Oil and Gas Prospects said the North Sea
would see substantial activity and production for at least 25 years, even
though overall levels of employment might fall. More than 90 new fields were
likely to be developed in that time, 15 in the next two and a half years.
Arthur Anderson Petroleum Services predicted capital spending in the North
Sea in the next three years would be almost Pounds 18bn, 55 per cent more
than in the previous three years. Oil production was predicted to reach
another peak of between 2.5m and 2.8m barrels a day by 1995.
Gas production was seen rising steadily from 5.1bn cubic feet a day to 9.2bn
cubic feet a day by the end of the century, when it would account for 45 per
cent of offshore output.
An earlier survey by County NatWest WoodMac identified 57 probable
developments already on the books, with recoverable reserves of 2.3bn
barrels of oil and 14,300bn cubic feet of gas.
Oil companies, too, claim to be positive about the North Sea. Mr Chris
Gibson-Smith, chief executive, Europe, of BP Exploration, told a Financial
Times conference on the future of the North Sea earlier this year that he
believed it would have 'at least two decades more of active life'. The
majors stress that it will continue to be a mainstay of their programme
despite their moves into frontier areas.
They say the North Sea is a known quantity, with a stable political
situation and a tax regime that has been relatively supportive of new
developments and of exploration investment. It also benefits from a
highly-developed infrastructure.
These advantages contrast with the political risks, the lack of
infrastructure, and the local hazards - ranging from bandits in Colombia to
unexploded mines in Vietnam - they confront in frontier regions.
But there is no doubt the nature of the North Sea is changing. While most
industry experts believe there are at least 10bn barrels of oil yet to be
discovered, the average size of new field discoveries has declined
dramatically from the 2bn-barrel giants of the early 1970s to 50m barrels or
less today.
'It is the same for all exploration provinces in the world,' says Mr Harold
Hughes, director-general of the UK Offshore Operators Association. 'You find
the big ones first, but then you are down to the needle in a haystack
variety.'
In a climate of low oil prices, many new fields are on the fringes of
economic viability. To develop them will call for important changes in oil
companies' working methods to cut costs - which have increased considerably
in recent years - from the exploration stage right through to production.
This may explain the slight uncertainty that hangs over the industry. Mr
Gibson-Smith said he thought the oil industry had 'not yet completed the
process of adjustment to marginal economics and sector maturity. Much of the
recent activity has been a function of earlier expectations and decisions.'
Operators are, however, starting to adapt.
They are already making use of recent advances in technology that should
make development of presently marginal fields possible in the future.
At the exploration stage, this means increasing use of three-dimensional
seismic surveys to produce more accurate geological models of oil and gas
structures than has ever been possible before and increase the effectiveness
of both appraisal and development drilling.
More precise information also aids the effective use of another
technological development: horizontal drilling. A single horizontal well can
be many times as effective as a traditional vertical well, and in itself can
make the difference between a field being economic or uneconomic to develop.
There are other ways in which field developments will change. The days of
giant platforms with 200-strong crews - and of several manned platforms
exploiting the same field - are numbered.
Shell/Esso's Gannet field development, 112 miles east of Aberdeen, is a good
example. Three subsea satellites, instead of the three separate platforms
originally envisaged, are tied back to a single large deck capable of
processing 50,000 barrels of oil and 180m cubic feet of gas a day but with
an operational crew of only 20 people.
Shell is also de-manning all but three of its 17 platforms in the southern
gas basin. On the Leman field, the North Sea's first producing gas field
launched in 1967, the number of crew living offshore will be halved by 1996,
with gas processing moved from satellite platforms to central compression
complexes.
Mr Chris Fay, managing director of Shell Expro, has said such changes in
practice meant Shell was likely to cut about 4,700 offshore and onshore jobs
by the end of the decade.
In addition to subsea satellites and unmanned platforms, the industry is
expected to make more use of floating production facilities. Amerada Hess
has led the way with its Angus development, a field of less than 10m barrels
being exploited through the Petrojarl, a specially-modified floating
production, storage and offloading vessel.
Mr Sam Laidlaw has a vision of floating production vessels criss-crossing
the North Sea by the end of the decade, being reused on different fields.
Independents Kerr McGee, Clyde, Santa Fe and Aran recently purchased the
ship-shaped Tentech floating production vessel with which they hope to
develop the 100m-barrel Gryphon field in under a year. Many independents
believe the changing nature of the North Sea makes it less attractive to the
majors, while they can benefit by taking more flexible and innovative
approaches.
At the same time, however, the era of custom-designed platforms - which,
industry insiders admit, were sometimes over-designed - is coming to an end.
More standardisation and streamlining of platforms and equipment will be
necessary to cut costs.
Working practices and inter-company attitudes will also have to change to
bring costs down, analysts say. In what could prove a model agreement, eight
companies with interests in six adjacent blocks in the Clair area - Amoco,
BP, Chevron, Conoco, Elf, Enterprise, Esso, and Mobil - agreed last year to
drill appraisal wells and carry out future work on a joint basis.
Mr Bramley of Arthur D Little says companies are becoming more willing to
talk to one another and share information, and have been cooperating in
benchmarking exercises to compare their costs.
However, despite the overall decline in field sizes, some believe the days
of the giant discoveries may not be entirely over. There is still the
possibility, says Mr Sam Laidlaw, of 'looking for a needle in a haystack and
finding the farmer's daughter'.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (7): Desert gas for
electricity - Only politics mars Algeria's attractions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE decision of Italy's state electricity company, ENEL, to sign a 20 year
contract with Algeria's oil and gas monopoly, Sonatrach, reinforces Italy's
position as Algeria's principal overseas market for gas.
The deal, for delivery of 4bn cubic metres of gas a year starting in 1995,
also marks out Italy as the most exciting market for Algerian gas,
especially as supplying gas for power stations demands more flexibility from
the supplier than other types of contracts.
The latest contract confirms the shift in attitude of Sonatrach, a company
which has, since 1988, increasingly come to recognise the mutual benefit to
be gained from working together with international oil and gas companies and
sharing the benefits of their combined resources.
The rush of oil companies signing exploration deals with Sonatrach
continues. So high is the chance of any company finding gas rather than oil
that it was only earlier this year, when exploration terms for gas were
improved to an acceptable level, that major oil companies decided the risk
was worth taking.
The new hydrocarbons law passed last December was the personal achievement
of Mr Nordine Ait Laoussine, the former Minister of Energy, who left the
government after the assassination of President Mohamed Boudiaf last June.
The policies he promoted have, however, been strongly endorsed by the new
minister, Mr Hasen Mefti, and the Prime Minister, Mr Belaid Abdesslem.
From 1965 to 1977 Mr Abdesslem was the architect of Algeria's energy policy.
Since the new law was passed, Sonatrach has signed exploration agreements
with Occidental Petroleum, Total, Arco, Mobil, Phillips Petroleum and BP and
an important service contract with Halliburton. These come on top of
contracts with Total, Cepsa, Agip and Repsol.
Apart from the political factor, nearly everything else in Algeria is
attractive. The political uncertainty comes from the continuing violence
between Islamic fundamentalists groups and the security forces following the
cancelling of Algeria's first multiparty elections last January. These
events have not affected the guarantees the US, Japan and France are
prepared to give for exim-type loans whose proceeds are earmarked for the
revamping and extension of the country's existing gas liquefying capacity.
Nearly Dollars 1bn worth of loans to this effect have been signed this
month.
Conditions have changed on two fronts simultaneously. First, Algerian terms
for exploration have become more rewarding for gas. Companies searching for
oil and finding gas now have a realistic chance of getting a return on their
exploration investment. As a result some companies might be willing
specifically to look for gas.
Another dimension of the new law is that it creates investment opportunities
for foreign companies able to enhance production from Algeria's existing oil
and gas fields. Rates of recovery had fallen below 20 per cent because
Sonatrach lacked the same degree of international experience gained by
global operators. Like many countries in the 1970s and the early 1980s,
Algeria's drive to assert its own sovereignty over all oil and gas
production excluded it from the advanced technology that less closed third
world countries such as Indonesia were able to enjoy.
Meanwhile, external demand for Algerian gas has grown beyond Sonatrach's
current ability to supply it. Sonatrach is also lucky in another respect. As
James Ball, director of Gas Matters points out, in a world where greenfield
liquefied natural gas projects cost Dollars 4bn for a couple of trains of
LNG able to produce 5bn cubic metres of gas a year, the prospect of
increasing capacity by 10bn cubic metres a year for half this outlay must be
as frightening to competitors as it is comforting to customers.
Through the renovation and upgrading project being carried out by the same
three companies that built the LNG plants in the late 1960s and 1970s, M. W.
Kellogg and Bechtel of the US and Sofregaz of France will increase capacity
at LNG plants in Arzew and Skikda from 19bn cubic metres to 32bn cubic
metres.
Meanwhile, the capacity of the nine year-old trans-Mediterranean pipeline
which brings gas to Italy through Tunisia and the Straits of Sicily is being
increased from 16bn to 24bn cubic metres. Two or three extra pumping
stations in Algeria could boost that figure further. Exports to Spain are to
increase and the first supplies are to reach Morocco.
Spain, a long established buyer of Algerian LNG, committed itself earlier
this spring to continuing its imports at the current level once the gas
pipeline scheduled to run through Morocco and under the Straits of Gibraltar
is completed. It is to supply Spain with 6bn-7bn cubic metres a year from
1997. The dramatic rise in Spain's gas requirement is largely driven by a
policy decision to freeze the nuclear programme in favour of gas fired
power. A further 1bn cubic metres will be bought by Morocco.
Agreements have already been signed to supply LNG to Turkey and Greece,
while newcomers such as Portugal and Germany have expressed interest in
buying Algerian gas. The collapse of the US market for LNG, the latest
possible victim being a 2.4bn cubic metres contract Sonatrach had signed
with Shell US, will free some extra supply for such customers and potential
Central European buyers. All in all, Sonatrach has set itself a ceiling of
60bn cubic metres of exports a year by the second half of the 1990s, with
commitments of 56bn cubic metres already made.
In addition to traditional oil and gas sales, a significant number of spin
offs have produced new joint venture opportunities. One of the first such
ventures was that between L'Air Liquide, Air Products and Sonatrach to
extract helium from the gas stream going into the LNG plants.
A much larger joint venture is the expansion of liquid petroleum gas export
facilities at Arzew. It encompasses the expansion of the existing 'Jumbo'
LPG plant and the increasing of production as a result of an upstream field
enhancement project in which Total is playing a key role.
The Algerians can only hope political uncertainty will not bedevil their
plans, particularly at a time when political and other uncertainties make
Russian gas far less secure than it was until the break up of the USSR.
Algeria has a window of opportunity which those who manage its oil and gas
industry seem intent on exploiting to the full.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (2): To strange horizons -
How exploration has changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE world's biggest oil and gas companies are turning to ever more exotic
parts of the globe to look for new supplies. This so-called frontier
strategy is taking companies such as British Petroleum into the Colombian
jungles and British Gas into the former republics of the Soviet Union.
Frontier exploration is devoted to extending the limits of known energy
reserves but carries a risk much higher than companies face in their more
traditional areas of influence such as the North Sea and North America.
Some of this exploration is conducted in extremely hostile environments
where the oil majors face many environmental drawbacks as well as possible
disruption to drilling programmes by guerrilla action. In addition host
governments are often unstable and could turn hostile at very short notice.
The fact that many companies are prepared to run these huge risks is
evidence of their often desperate search for new oil reserves.
Most big discoveries are thought to have been found in the North Sea and,
while there still remains a lot of oil and gas to drill, production profiles
are expected to tail off towards the end of the decade. At the same time,
the environmental lobby has closed much of North America for oil exploration
and raised the cost for companies still operating there. Mr Robin West who
advises companies on their frontier strategy at Petroleum Finance Company,
the Washington-based consulting group, points out that most traditional oil
majors have done a poor job of replacing their reserves of energy. British
Petroleum, for example, saw the level of its proven oil reserves drop by
four per cent last year, since the company has much of its production
concentrated in the mature oilfields of the North Sea and Alaska. 'Companies
are now being forced to turn from quick pay-out, low-risk investment in the
North Sea and North America to riskier prospects,' Mr West explains.
The drive for oil companies to replace their reserves with new discoveries
has occurred at a time of rapid political change across the globe which has
seen the opening up of many countries where governments were previously
hostile to western oil companies.
These countries  - from Vietnam and Russia to Laos and Yemen  - are looking
to exploit mineral resources to expand hard currency earnings.
They look to the oil and gas majors for valuable investment in
infrastructure and development in return for drilling rights on tracts of
potential oil-bearing land.
Nowhere is the rush to explore more evident than in the former Soviet Union.
In spite of the difficulties of negotiating with changing political regimes
and large scale bureaucracy, most western companies are hoping to secure at
least some acreage or production-sharing deals.
British Gas recently landed exclusive rights to negotiate for the
development of a huge field in Kazakhstan which is the first stage before
agreeing a contract. But negotiations can drag on for months or even years
and many companies have become embroiled in discussing technicalities. Mr
Kenneth Derr, chairman of Chevron, the US oil major, was negotiating with
Kazakhstan for over four years, but he explained the company's persistence
in terms of the significance of the field in which he was interested. 'It is
unique in size and could have a meaningful impact on a company of our size
for a very long time.'
The republics of the former Soviet Union provide a safer bet for companies
looking to frontier exploration since, in spite of production difficulties,
they collectively remain the world's largest producer of oil with vast
proven grossly under-exploited reserves.
Companies searching for oil in Vietnam, Laos and Colombia are running a
greater risk of ending up with dry holes. Clyde Petroleum, a small UK
exploration company, was forced to write off its Dollars 8m investment in
offshore Vietnam when it discovered a large reservoir of carbon dioxide last
year instead of the natural gas reserves it was hoping for.
Companies must collect extremely expensive high-tech data on the country's
geology before deciding where to drill which is, in the end, a subjective
decision. Oil exploration is a notoriously hit-and-miss affair even in the
best researched locations.
Much of the impetus for frontier exploration came after the Gulf war early
last year when many oil producing nations began to talk of a dialogue, if
not partnership, with consumers. Most nations in the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) are in need of capital to complete
capacity expansion plans, but many are short of hard currency.
Dr Subroto, secretary general of the organisation, estimates that its 13
members need roughly Dollars 25bn in capital over the next decade to finish
expansion programmes.
These capital requirements have seen Opec nations actively courting western
oil companies to form partnerships that would have been unthinkable a decade
ago.
Industry analysts call this a 'new bargain' between countries and companies.
Mr Dan Yergin, who heads Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an oil
consulting group and the author of The Prize, a best-selling history of the
oil industry, said: 'It is the antithesis of what we saw in the 1970s when a
wave of nationalism across the world led to many of these companies being
thrown out of countries they were operating in.'
Iran, which expelled western oil companies after the revolution in 1979, is
now eager to entice them back. Tehran has even hosted conferences on
producer-consumer dialogue in an effort to court wary western companies.
Countries are competing for scarce cash amid global credit shortages which
means they are often prepared to offer western companies extremely
favourable deals in order to attract their investment and sophisticated
technology. For the few companies that strike lucky in frontier exploration,
the high stakes can offer rich rewards.
Companies are hoping for an 'elephant'  - a discovery of 1bn barrels or more
 - which will ensure earnings growth for at least a decade.
British Petroleum's oil find in the foothills of the Colombian mountains is
rumoured to contain more than 1bn barrels. Although the company has played
down the significance of its discovery, it badly needs a boost to its
reserves and, among the majors, has pioneered the risky frontier strategy.
The company is painfully aware of the fact that the successful energy
companies in the 1990s will be the ones that strike lucky in the jungles of
Laos and Vietnam or strike favourable deals in the former Soviet Union.
The stakes have been raised once more in the risky oil exploration business.

Neil Buckley assesses prospects for a surge in world prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DON'T be surprised if oilmen become obsessed with weather forecasts this
winter, or suddenly start talking about Mount Pinatubo.
Of all the factors influencing oil price movements over the next few months,
weather could be the most important. The markets and oil companies alike are
hoping for a colder-than-normal winter for the first time in five years.
Their hopes were buoyed last month by predictions from a senior forecaster
at the US National Weather Service that October to December temperatures
were likely to be colder than normal over much of the mid-west and
north-east of the US. Scientists also say atmospheric dust from last year's
eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines gave many parts of Canada east
of the Rockies their wettest and coollest summer in a century, and could
make the North American winter particularly cold.
Cold weather across the northern hemisphere could push up underlying demand
for crude oil by 0.6m barrels a day  - sufficient to make a significant
difference to prices. It would also bring about a large draw on oil stocks
which are already at a four-year low, helping to push prices up in the first
quarter of next year.
Mild weather, on the other hand, could see prices weakening towards the end
of the fourth quarter, and, with less of a draw on stocks, first-quarter
prices next year would continue to be weaker.
Given average weather, the fundamentals for oil prices look relatively
strong. Moreover, in spite of continuing tensions in the Middle East, many
observers believe 1993 could see more price stability than in recent years.
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed at its September
meeting in Geneva that its market share for the fourth quarter should be
24.2m b/d, with Kuwait allowed to continue to increase its output as it
rebuilt its oil industry after the Gulf war. This would imply total Opec
production rising to about 24.5m b/d.
However, true Opec output in September is already estimated to have been
higher than that  - at around 24.7m b/d  - and forecasts of average output
over the fourth quarter range from around 24.7m b/d to a maximum of 25.1m
b/d. Despite this, analysts generally agree that Opec output will be closely
balanced by the actual call on its oil, producing a tight market.
Cambridge Energy Research Associates, the international consulting group,
sees average Opec production at 24.8m b/d in the fourth quarter, with
underlying demand between 24.6m and 24.8m b/d. This is based on estimated
world demand of 68.6m b/d and a draw on world stocks of 1m b/d. Kleinwort
Benson, the London brokers, projects Opec production at 25.1m b/d, but says
this will be matched by demand, with a draw on stocks of only 600,000 b/d,
and world demand at 68.3m b/d.
The outlook for oil prices is therefore positive. Mr Mehdi Varzi of
Kleinwort Benson is sticking to his forecast of Brent crude prices reaching
a peak of Dollars 22 a barrel this winter, and averaging Dollars 20 for the
whole of 1992.
Mr Joe Stanislaw, managing director of CERA, broadly agrees, basing his
forecasts on the Opec basket of crude prices  - nowadays just over Dollars 1
a barrel cheaper than Brent crude. While the Opec basket averaged only
Dollars 18.69 a barrel up to October, Mr Stanislaw sees it climbing towards
Opec's target of Dollars 21, averaging Dollars 20.50 over the fourth
quarter. For the year, this would lift the average price of the Opec basket
to Dollars 19.10.
A cold winter could add 75 cents to the price, he adds.
There are, however, other factors apart from the weather which could boost
prices.
One is what CERA calls the 'capacity factor'. Most estimates put Opec
production at only about 1m b/d less than its total capacity. Some of the
difference is accounted for by heavy, sour oil which is not very attractive
to the market, so the real leeway is very small.
This makes the markets nervous, and some observers believe any short-term
supply disruption  - for example, a sudden cut in exports from the former
Soviet Union as recently happened with natural gas  - could produce a price
spike of up to Dollars 25 a barrel.
In the longer term, the most important factor is economic growth  - and
particularly the rate of economic recovery in North America and Europe. CERA
forecasts world economic growth in 1993 of 1.5 per cent, only a slight
improvement on this year's 1 per cent.
However, outside the the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and
Development countries, as well as eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union, oil demand growth continues to outstrip growth in gross national
product. Overall, CERA expects average world oil demand to grow by about
0.5m b/d next year  - as it did this year  - to about 67.7m b/d.
'One thing we have learned is that oil demand continues to grow in spite of
any recession in the developed countries,' says Mr Varzi.
Moreover, production by the former Soviet Union is likely to continue to
fall, from an average of about 9.1m b/d this year, possibly as low as 8m b/d
in 1993, allowing some room for increased production by Opec and elsewhere
to be absorbed.
The second important factor influencing oil prices in 1993 is whether Iraq
is permitted to begin exporting oil again. This poses potentially the most
serious threat to the delicate balance within Opec and in the world oil
market.
Some observers have suggested that if Mr Bill Clinton is elected US
president, he might adopt a less combative stance towards Iraq than
President Bush, which could speed up Iraq's return to the market. Recent
reports from Iraq that Saddam Hussein's power may be weakening have produced
speculation that Iraq could return sooner rather than later.
The 12 other members of Opec have said that room will be made for Iraq in
the oil market when it comes back, calling for adjustments in each member
country's production. This could provoke a bitter row.
Iraq's re-entry would probably be most difficult in the second quarter of
next year when oil demand is traditionally low. If it did not come back
until later, when there is greater seasonal demand for Opec oil, and an
improving economy and cold winter weather might further boost demand, there
is still a possibility that Iraq could be absorbed without too much turmoil.
There are other views, however. 'I have a slightly perverse theory that Opec
might actually find it easier to absorb Iraq in the second quarter, when the
need to cut back on production to make room for it is most obvious,' says Mr
Stanislaw.
'Opec performs best, relatively speaking, in a crisis.'

FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Portugal (5): A three-times victor - The Social
Democrats and Cavaco Silva
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS A student, Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva was a keen athlete and, so it is said,
a highly effective hurdles runner. Close associates say the prime minister
not only maintains a runner's gait, but he applies his skills to the art of
politics: always preparing for the next hurdle as he leaps over the
immediate one.
Whether or not that is the secret of Mr Cavaco Silva's success to date, his
achievements are real enough: three consecutive general election victories,
the last two with resounding absolute majorities, have left his opponents
standing in the blocks and in disarray.
The moderate socialist party (PS) is at war with itself, the small
right-wing Christian Democratic party (CDS) is in the midst of purification
rites, the once-powerful hard-line Communist party (PCP) is in decline and
fighting for survival. All of which leaves the prime minister's
right-of-centre Social Democrats (PSD) with as near enough a free hand to
shape the political agenda as it could wish.
Leadership of the opposition should fall to the Socialist party, but riven
with internal strife, and incapacitated by personal rivalries and ambitions,
it appears ill-fitted for the role. After its general election defeat in
1991, the PS elected Mr Antonio Guterres, then leading the Socialists in
parliament, as new leader, with great hopes that he would modernise the
party's image and give it a new impetus. But his honeymoon was short- lived,
and groups within the party have resumed their small wars.
Instead much of the focus for discontent has shifted, willy-nilly, to
President Mario Soares, whose relationship with the prime minister is polite
but hardly warm.
Now in his second, and last, five-year presidential mandate, Mr Soares has
emerged as the main source of irritation in the Sao Bento prime ministerial
residence. Though the president has few real powers, he can delay
legislation by presidential veto which he has been doing with increasing
frequency - at times to the surprise of his socialist supporters. Mr Soares
denies any intention to interfere with government, but he says he must speak
out on issues that affect the country's well-being and against what he
perceives as creeping 'conformism and monolitism', and what he claims are
the 'hegemonic' tendencies of the ruling party.
Mr Cavaco Silva dismisses the accusations. 'We have a majority, and we have
to govern even if that means taking some unpopular decisions,' he says. As
PSD leader, he has steered his occasionally quarrelsome party with a firm
hand, and ensured its electoral success. He has no real contender within his
party, and the opposition is too weak to pose an effective challenge.
The principal reason for Mr Cavaco Silva's success is simple: he is
perceived as the main architect of Portugal's relative prosperity and as
guarantor of political stability.
Though it was President Soares, then socialist leader and often prime
minister, who led the courtship with the European Community at a time when
Portugal was still struggling to overcome the debilitating after-effects of
right-wing dictatorship and leftist revolution, it was Mr Cavaco Silva who
tied the knot. And it was Mr Cavaco Silva's pragmatic, reformist, and
market-oriented diligence which ensured Portugal would get the most out of
its EC membership.
Since 1986 when it joined the EC, Portugal has undergone a dramatic
transformation. The economy went through an unprecedented boom, it has been
liberalised and modernised, the constitution has been reformed, standards of
living have risen, unemployment at around 4 per cent is among the lowest in
the Community, and Portugal has rediscovered a sense of national pride.
There is still poverty, and living standards remain below those in the
Community's richer countries, but for most Portuguese, the past few years
have been a time of unquestionable progress.
The future is more uncertain. The international environment is no longer as
propitious as it was in the 1980s, and some of Portugal's main trading
partners are in recession or face serious economic difficulties. The
European Community itself is facing a crisis of confidence, and the
Portuguese economy has began to slow.
This gives the opposition a new chance as the government prepares to embark
on a further bout of unpopular reforms in its drive for modernisation.
With eyes fixed on European economic and monetary union, the government is
preparing to tighten the screws. A rigorous 1993 budget aims to reduce the
government deficit from above 5 per cent to less than 4 per cent of GDP.
Public expenditure will fall in real terms, as will public sector wages if
the government succeeds in convincing trade unions to accept 5.5 per cent
pay rises for next year, and if its inflation target of 5-7 per cent is
achieved.
Ministries will cut recurrent expenditures by 5 per cent, the civil service
will be trimmed, the health service reformed and partly privatised, the
armed forces rationalised and cut, the police reorganised, university fees
will be raised, and labour relations will be tightened up with a new strike
law.
All these proposals have brought vocal opposition from unions, professional
associations, students, army officers, and interest groups which feel
threatened by reform. But with single-mindedness, the government is pressing
ahead on all fronts at once, knowing it will meet opposition and that it
will cost the government in popularity, but convinced it can see its
programme through.
'We can't be accused of delaying measures which we think are important for
the modernisation of the country,' Mr Cavaco Silva says.
These are the immediate hurdles. Further down the track are municipal and
local elections next autumn, a general election in 1995, and presidential
elections in 1996.
The government calculates that now is the time to push through unpopular
measures, and that there will be time enough later to reap the rewards of
success. If the strategy works and Portugal emerges successfully from the
current uncertainty, then Mr Cavaco Silva could comfortably face the
prospect of re-election in 1995, or even try his luck at the presidency in
1996.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Portugal (6): At peace with its past - Peter Bruce
assesses the country's foreign policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE

<TEXT>
FROM the ramparts of St George's castle, overlooking Lisbon and the vast
estuary of the Tejo river spilling into the Atlantic, it is easy to feel the
pull of the sea and the west.
Out there, for centuries, Portugal sought, and found, its place in the
world. Nearly 200m people in Africa, America and Asia speak its language
now. And while the stories of an often bitter decolonisation have been told
many times, it is still striking, just walking along Lisbon's streets and
observing the black, the golden and the white faces, how comfortable the
country seems to be with its past.
But Portugal has been able to put the past in its place. While the British -
probably Portugal's oldest European ally - still hanker for old colonial and
Atlantic ties, the Portuguese have turned their heads, if not yet all of
their hearts, to Europe. It is important, this, because it makes Portugal
predictable.
As a member of the European Community, though, Portugal has had to let
itself be counted with the laggards, not the leaders. It is one of the
'southern' lot (including Italy) which forever seem to be asking their
richer northern partners for more money or more time to do hard things. Its
almost seven years of EC membership have brought about wrenching changes to
the way the country works. Today three-quarters of the country'sexports go
to Europe, more than double the proportion of a decade ago.
But there are perhaps more important though less obvious ways to measure the
effects of EC accession. In the first half of this year the country assumed
the presidency of the Community, a task which demanded a huge modernising
effort of its cobwebbed public administration. Civil war in the former
Yugoslavia and the ECs efforts to mediate in it propelled the country and
its urbane foreign minister, Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, into the centre of
the kind of European dilemma that Portugal had time and again turned its
back on.
Even now, as the European Community's leaders struggle to find ways to calm
growing internal scepticism about the way the EC's institutions function,
Portugal is busily discovering completely new foreign policy postures for
itself.
At issue are accusations across the Community that the European Commission
is reaching well beyond its powers to control minute aspects of life in
member countries. In Britain, Germany and Denmark, governments are trying to
find ways to convince voters that this is not so and that the principle of
'subsidiarity' makes control from Brussels impossible.
'I loathe the word 'subsidiarity',' says Mr Deus Pinheiro. 'Let's talk about
'proximity' or 'openness'.'
The concept, which the Portuguese enthusiastically support, means that EC
institutions should not try to govern aspects of life in member countries
which are best left to national governments. Arcane, perhaps, but for
Portugal an ideal issue upon which to take sides and, perhaps, make new
friends.
The subsidiarity debate does three things for Lisbon. There is little
opposition to EC membership in Portugal, and the issue is a useful tool for
the government to use to insist on a more transparent EC without appearing
to have been put under pressure into doing so.
Also, it marks a clear separation from its closest neighbour, Spain, which
fears that subsidiarity, if applied too deeply, could for ce it to c e d e
powers to powerful regional governments in Catalonia and the Basque Country.
And it ranges Portugal alongside the virtuous and the mighty, especially
Germany.
'We are one of the oldest countries in Europe and we don't want to lose our
national identity,' says the foreign minister. 'We have fought hard for it.'
It is clear that the hard lessons of European unity that now reverberate in
the UK are being quickly taken on board in Lisbon. There may not be much EC
opposition now but should the economy slow even faster than it has this year
and generate ill-feeling, the government wants to be ready for it.
So much so that Mr Deus Pinheiro happily discusses holding referenda on
European issues in the next few years. The point, though, would be to avoid
the French and Danish traps and make the questions very specific. 'I would
not be surprised if we had some referenda,' he says, looking to 1995 and
1996. 'I think people should be asked if they are prepared to have a common
European defence policy, for instance.'
There is symmetry here. Just as foreign policy determined the fate of the
Salazar dictatorship - his colonial wars in Africa were the old regime's
undoing at home - Portugal's actions in Europe are moulding life at home
now.
If the old colonies, particularly in Africa, still matter, they do so not so
much as influence lost but, for thousands of Portuguese, as beloved homes
hurriedly left.
While both Angola and Mozambique work their way unsteadily towards ending
their civil wars, many people in Portugal wonder whether they might not be
able to pick up the strands of their younger lives there. Given that
unemployment in Portugal is set to increase as it struggles to become more
competitive, the emergence of potentially rich Portuguese speaking nations
in Africa must be a tantalising prospect for threatened workers and a
worried government.
Lisbon has been hard at work for years preparing a mini Marshall plan,
funded with its new European partners, to help consolidate peace in Angola.
Some Es80bn is already in place to help resettle guerrilla fighters.
But can Portugal have it both ways? 'We want to be a good friend and an
honest broker' in Angola and Mozambique, says Mr Deus Pinheiro. 'Africa is a
natural extension of the culture of Europe.'
Perhaps only a Portuguese or French foreign minister could still say
something like that with a straight face.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (5): Diluting the monopolies
 -European Single Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBERALISATION of the European Community gas market was regarded as one of
the most difficult obstacles to a true single market when the British took
over the presidency of the EC in July.
Indeed, faced with the joint opposition of energy producers and government
in most member states, Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, EC energy commissioner,
and Sir Leon Brittan, responsible for competition, had already watered down
their parallel proposals for the gas and electricity markets since last
year.
The directives, published in January, aim to open the gas and electricity
networks to greater competition from the start of next year, allowing large
energy users to buy from suppliers anywhere in the Community, and, if
successful, extending the principle to smaller users on January 1, 1996.
Ministerial discussions since then have produced tentative support for the
ending of monopoly rights over the construction of gas networks, and the
'unbundling' of integrated energy companies' accounts to improve
transparency.
But debate has always stalled on the ultimate aims of the Commission
proposals  - the concept of 'third party access' to gas networks. Britain,
arch-privatiser of the 1980s and champion of free trade, was thought the
ideal presidency to push ahead with liberalisation. But Commission hopes
that discussion might be finished by the end of this year look wildly
optimistic.
On top of the controversial nature of the proposals, the political climate
has changed. The Danish vote against the Maastricht treaty, and the very
narrow French vote in favour have made the Commission wary of treading too
hard on member states' toes. As a result, individual states, sensing they
have the upper hand, are even more reluctant to relax their opposition.
'There are clearly problems and we will be reporting these to the council
(of energy ministers),' says one British official, somewhat ruefully. When
those ministers meet on November 30, Britain will attempt to soften them up
with a quiet discussion of the main difficulties which have arisen among
national officials.
Security of supply will be one area under discussion  - opponents of the
plans believe it would be severely jeopardised by the introduction of third
party access to gas networks. Another area of concern is the protection of
small gas consumers: critics say the main benefits of the Commission
proposals would accrue to the large customers. Those which use more than 25m
cubic metres of gas a year  - such as steel and aluminium plants, large
construction sites, chemical, glass and fertiliser factories  - are the only
ones to qualify for third party access under the first phase of the Brussels
plan.
If there is a glimmer of hope for energy liberals, it comes from Sir Leon
Brittan, who still seems prepared to use autonomous powers to punish member
states which transgress strict EC treaty rules on competition. Last month,
for example, he threatened court action against member states which had not
adapted their legislation on exclusive gas export/import rights to EC law.
Opponents of Brussels' plans, by contrast, hope that changes in the
composition of the Commission in the New Year may reduce the pressure for
liberalisation. Sir Leon, although he is certain to stay in Brussels, may
change portfolios, giving up competition to a less forceful colleague. Mr
Cardoso e Cunha  - who took up the liberalisation crusade almost as soon as
he started the energy job in 1988  - is leaving the Commission.
'There is a chance of starting off on a better footing with a new
commissioner who would be less committed to a particular policy,' Mr Peter
Claus, secretary general of Eurogas, the natural gas industry's lobby group,
points out.
If the main trophy of energy liberalisation looks like remaining unclaimed
at the end of the British presidency, then the UK is still hoping for a
consolation prize. Officials believe ministers may be able to agree on
Commission plans which would guarantee free and open competition between
companies applying for oil and gas exploration and drilling licences in the
EC.
The directive, published in March, is the first aimed directly at ensuring
the oil producers enjoy the benefits of the single European market from
January 1, 1993.
Some member states still restrict the rights of natural resources companies
to drill for oil and gas. The Commission's proposals would not force
national governments to accept the lowest bid for exploration and drilling
contracts, and member states could still restrict licensing on the grounds
of national security, or to prevent depletion of natural resources.
But other discrimination, most notably on the grounds of nationality, would
have to be eliminated.
The EC industry's main worry is that the new directive might be used to
cancel out long-term contracts which are already running.
'If you go forward from (the end of the existing contract) with new
legislation, then that's fine  - but don't tear up old agreements,' says one
industry source.
More worrying for the Commission is the possibility that Norway may
challenge the plan next year, through the medium of the European economic
agreement (EEA)  - the free-trade area which comes into being on January 1.
Norway wants to continue to give state-owned Statoil 50 per cent of every
licence it grants. 'That's clearly discriminatory and will never be
acceptable,' says a British official. But if Norway can muster the support
of its partners in the European Free Trade Association (Efta) it could block
the Community legislation.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (4): Cartel at the
cross-roads - Neil Buckley on how a weakened Opec is responding to the New
World Order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GONE ARE the days when the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries
could hold the world's oil market to ransom. But it still plays a dominant
role.
The immediate Dollars 1 rise in world oil prices after Opec's May meeting
decided to roll over its second quarter output ceiling provided ample
demonstration of that. Some observers suggested this was a small piece of
sabre-rattling ahead of June's Earth Summit in Rio, to show Opec's
opposition to plans for a carbon tax.
However, the cartel still has an unenviable capacity for internal disputes
and for failing to do what it set out to do.
What had been expected to be an easy meeting of its ministerial monitoring
committee in Geneva in September ended with the second-largest producer,
Iran, publicly dissenting from the agreement that Opec's market share in the
fourth quarter of 1992 should be 24.2m b/d, excluding any increase in
production by Kuwait. Meanwhile, its second-smallest producer, Ecuador,
announced it was pulling out of full membership of the organisation and
returning to associate membership status.
The disagreements confused the oil market and helped to lessen the meeting's
upward pressure on oil prices.
Opinions differ about what may happen at Opec's next meeting on November 25.
Some believe Iran will press hard for the meeting to address what is
potentially the thorniest issue: how the cartel will handle the eventual
return of Iraq to the oil export market.
United Nations sanctions banned Iraq from exporting oil after its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990. Since then, many of Opec's members have been pumping at
close to capacity, while its biggest members have increased their output to
make up for the shortfall in supply.
Saudi Arabia has been the principal beneficiary, raising its output from
4.9m barrels a day in 1989, to close to 8.4m b/d in recent months, an
increased market share it will be loath to relinquish.
Iran, by contrast, has only raised its output from 2.8m b/d to 3.5m b/d. The
republic has made repeated statements about the increase in its production
capacity, which it says is already 3.8m b/d and will reach 4.5m b/d next
year.
It may also press for Opec to adopt some kind of general principle in
November on how it will respond to the return of Iraq. Mr Joe Stanislaw,
managing director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, believes that
while the November meeting may discuss Iraq, it is highly unlikely to agree
anything.
'Why rock the boat? There is no need to deal with the issue until it
actually hits them.'
In the absence of public agreements or disputes about Iraq, November's
meeting is expected to have little impact on oil prices. Most analysts
expect it to adopt a similar agreement to that reached in September,
referring not to an 'output ceiling' but instead to a projected 'market
share' for the first quarter of 1993, likely to be unchanged from the last
meeting, or to show a modest rise to between 24.5m and 24.8m b/d.
This would reflect the reality of how Opec now operates. Mr Stanislaw says
the September meeting established that Opec has adopted a market-oriented
approach, which is based on a rising market for Opec oil, unlike the
situation in the 1980s when Opec's market shrank.
While the numbers Opec announced at the end of its meetings were once output
ceilings, they have in effect become production floors, below which output
will not drop, but with the tacit agreement that output may increase to meet
market demand.
Analysts point out that most Opec members are in debt and are keen to
maximise revenues. However, many believe it is the biggest producer, Saudi
Arabia, that is really driving Opec's policy.
Mr Hisham Nazer, Saudi oil minister, told journalists in September he would
not talk about the kingdom's production plans but stressed these were part
of a careful, long-term strategy. Analysts believe this strategy is to
maintain its share of Opec production, and ensure there is enough oil to
meet demand, and avoid price spikes that would damage the world economy or
risk lowering oil's share of the energy market by prompting consumers to
switch to cheaper fuels.
Within these constraints, however, Saudi Arabia is happy to get whatever
price it can for oil. It wants to provide, in the words of Mr Stanislaw,
'enough oil to satisfy demand but not so much that it prohibits producers
from gaining that extra dollar or two that consumers do not seem to mind
paying'.
This would explain Saudi Arabia's behaviour at Opec's May meeting when it
failed to make its expected call for a 1m b/d increase in the output ceiling
 - a move which boosted oil prices and prompted some observers to talk of a
'policy change' marking the kingdom's transformation into a price hawk.
Mr Nazer warned in September against becoming obsessed with the Dollars 21 a
barrel objective for the Opec basket of crudes  - adopted in July 1990  -
saying this was a 'reference' price, not a 'target'. However, he seems happy
for the price to move towards Dollars 21 provided this is supported by
fundamentals. Indeed, if reports are true that Mr Nazer rejected demands
from Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh, the Iranian oil minister, for a cut in Opec
output, because he thought this was not necessary to push prices towards
Dollars 21, recent analysts' forecasts suggest he may have been right.
In the disagreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, however, may lie the
seeds of a wider split concerning Opec's role.
If Saudi Arabia sees it essentially as a kind of market regulator, it is
clear from Iran's accusations after the meeting that other other countries
were 'not serious' about pushing up prices  - and the likely departure of
Ecuador  - that other, poorer members, see things differently. For them,
Opec is a cartel whose job is to manipulate production to achieve a certain
price.
Ecuador's ostensible reason for leaving is that it is unhappy with its quota
and wants to increase oil revenues to help pay off its Dollars 13bn foreign
debt. It may also be wondering if its hopes for economic improvement would
be better served by other organisations such as the International Monetary
Fund, where not being an Opec member could strengthen its negotiating
position.
The danger for Opec is the 'domino effect': other smaller  - and even larger
 - members starting to question the benefits of membership. But it could
perhaps withstand losing some members.
'The only people that really matter in Opec are the big producers. It has
been an organisation of six members and not 13 for some time now,' says Mr
Vahan Zanoyan of the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington research and
advisory group.
But some analysts argue that the smaller members play an important role in
building consensus and support for different points of view, and diluting
the impact of personal differences.
There may, however, be countries willing to replace any that leave. The
former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan has already expressed interest in
joining, and there is speculation that Kazakhstan, or even Russia, might
follow suit, offering an intriguing vision of how Opec may respond to the
New World Order.

<TEXT>
AFTER years of riding high on the fast lane of economic growth,
liberalisation and privatisation, Portuguese banks are having to change
gear. While the 1980s were a time of rapid expansion, the watchword now is
consolidation.
Banks are still building up their branch networks, but the pace of expansion
is slowing as margins decline and costs rise. 'Most of the banks have more
or less completed their expansion plans,' says Mr Alexandre Vaz Pinto,
president of the Portuguese Bankers' Association and executive vice-chairman
of Banco Espirito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa, one of Portugal's top three
banks.
He says the number of bank branches could reach 3,000 by the end of next
year compared with around 2,500 now, but that would be a manageable number
for the Portuguese market. Some areas of the country may be over-banked, but
with one branch for about 4,000 inhabitants, the average ratio of branches
per population is half that of Spain.
At the same time, growing costs and risks are making expansion more
difficult. Rapidly building up networks has not always brought the hoped-for
results. 'Some banks didn't get the (additional) clients they expected,' he
says.
Mr Jorge Jardim Goncalves, president of Banco Comercial Portugues (BCP),
Portugal's most striking banking success story, agrees. '1993 will be the
final year for conquering market share, after that it will be possible only
through acquisitions,' he says.
BCP, a private commercial bank established barely six years ago by a group
of entrepreneurs from Portugal's industrial north, has grown spectacularly
to become the country's second largest capitalised bank, and fourth largest
in terms of assets. It now heads a diversified banking group with insurance,
brokerage, fund management, leasing and factoring activities, and it is
currently awaiting authorisation to launch a mortgage bank.
Mr Jardim Goncalves says BCP will continue to expand - it will have more
than 300 branches by the beginning of next year, giving it one of the
largest networks in the country - but the emphasis will be on consolidating
its position.
Some of the smaller banks, especially foreign institutions, are expected to
continue to expand at a relatively high rate. Barclays Bank has built up its
network to 49 branches, about 30 of which were opened this year, and plans
to open up another 16 branches early in 1993. Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
(BBV) which started with 12 branches when it bought Lloyds Portugal two
years ago, now has 38 branches and plans to open another 40 branches next
year, with further expansion aimed at raising its market share from 2 per
cent now to 5-7 per cent.
Barclays and BBV are likely to have the most aggressive strategies among
foreign banks in the near future. Two other Spanish banks, Banesto and Banco
Santander, are already well established through their partial ownership of
Banco Totta &amp; Acores and Banco de Comercio e Industria respectively.
'Size is important,' says Mr Vaz Pinto. 'Below 5 per cent of the total
number of branches you cannot be a critical player in the market.' The rush
to win market share either through organic growth or by buying one of the
institutions being privatised has contributed to a noticeable increase in
competition between banks. Publicity campaigns have been more aggressive,
and the banks have vamped up their image.
As the day approaches for full liberalisation of financial services required
by the European single market on January 1 1993, banking in Portugal is no
longer quite the cosy cartel it used to be when most banks were in state
hands.
Mr Artur Santos Silva, president of the group headed by Banco Portugues de
Investimento (BPI), a highly successful private investment bank, says a
crucial factor to remain competitive in the new single market era will be
the ability to finance investments in technology, networks, marketing and
new products.
Without such investment, banks will find it difficult to survive, especially
the smaller ones. 'In three or four years' time there'll be a smaller number
of Portuguese banks (on the market),' he says, forecasting further mergers
and acquisitions.
To meet the challenge, last year BPI bought Banco Fonsecas &amp; Burnay (BFB), a
medium-size commercial bank that was privatised, thereby gaining access to a
broader source of funds as well as widening its role in the market. It is
now looking at the possibility of further acquisitions.
The single market comes at a difficult time. Interest rates are falling as
the government strives to meet criteria for European economic and monetary
union. Bank margins have fallen to their lowest levels for years, though at
4-4.5 per cent they are still high by international standards.
Mr Francisco Veloso, president of Banco de Comercio e Industria, says
interest rates are not the big issue for banks. 'Interest rates will fall
but the banks will cope. Competition is so strong now that the banks have to
adapt and become more efficient. If they don't they'll disappear.'
The problem is that margins are falling just as the banks need to make
substantial increases in provisions to cover bad debt. In the past, this was
mainly a concern for the state-owned institutions, but even the best-run
private banks now have to increase provisions as the economic climate
deteriorates and many companies face bankruptcy. Mr Vaz Pinto says bad
credit for all banks stands at around Es430bn, and is rising.
Bankers are also concerned by the high compulsory cash reserve which they
have to place with the central bank at low interest. Cash reserves are
currently set at 17 per cent of deposits, and remunerated at rates ranging
from 8 per cent to 13.25 per cent. Mr Vaz Pinto says this discriminates
against Portuguese banks. 'Foreign banks don't have the same liquidity
problems, and we want a reduction of the reserve co-efficient as an
essential step for fair competition.'
Banks were also upset by the government's increasing use of highly
competitive treasury certificates - freely available through the post office
 -to encourage savings. At one point the certificates were paying close to
10 per cent above average bank deposits, but this problem was solved last
month and rates for certificates have been brought into line with those
offered by the banks.
The central bank's sharp cuts in interest rates last August and its
announcement that it was accelerating the liberalisation of capital
movements are expected to affect bank profitability adversely. The bank
decided to abolish the compulsory deposit on foreign credit for Portuguese
companies on August 31; end the restriction to non-resident investments in
floating rate bonds from October 31; and fully liberalise non-resident
investments in the domestic money market by the end of the year.
Some analysts predict real operating income for commercial banks will fall
off sharply next year as a result. So, after seven years of heady growth,
banks that are insufficiently capitalised or which have drawn on their
deposit base to finance expansion had better watch out.

THE RECENT sharp fall in London Metal Exchange ZINC prices was extended
yesterday morning before consumer interest appeared at last to steady the
market. The three months price, which had fallen Dollars 190 during October,
reached Dollars 1,092 a tonne during the morning before steadying to close
at Dollars 1,096.50 a tonne, down Dollars 16 from Friday. The recovery
continued in kerb (after-hours) trading, which ended with three months zinc
at Dollars 1,101.50 a tonne. COPPER traded narrowly in dollar terms,
reflecting a fairly lifeless performance on the New York market, and three
months metal ended at Dollars 2,272 a tonne, down Dollars 13. The weak pound
boosted sterling copper prices with the three months position ending the
kerb session at Pounds 1,496.50 a tonne, its highest level for more than two
years and a gain of Pounds 20.25 from Friday's kerb close. COCOA futures at
the London Futures and Options Exchange were also boosted by sterling's
fall, the March position ending the day Pounds 19 up at Pounds 724 a tonne.

hurricane losses

<TEXT>
CIGNA, one of the biggest composite insurers in the US, yesterday unveiled a
large drop in third-quarter earnings, but was profitable despite heavy
losses from Hurricane Andrew which ravaged southern Florida and Louisiana in
August.
Cigna said after-tax profits for the three months to end-September totalled
Dollars 55m, down from Dollars 123m a year ago, with realised investment
gains contributing Dollars 52m (Dollars 10m). The third-quarter results
reflected catastrophe losses of Dollars 139m, before tax, of which Dollars
131m came from Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki. In the same three months of
1991, Cigna's catastrophe losses were Dollars 17m.
As a result of these losses, Cigna's property-casualty division produced a
Dollars 270m deficit for the quarter, despite after-tax investment gains of
Dollars 29m against a Dollars 5m profit, including after-tax investment
gains of Dollars 7m, in the same period in 1991.
However, the company added that its other three divisions had 'strong'
earnings in the third quarter, and  - although some analysts had predicted
that realised investment gains would keep the company in the black despite
the hurricane losses  - the shares gained Dollars 1 1/8 yesterday at Dollars
52 1/2 .
Cigna is now showing after-tax profits of Dollars 286m for the first nine
months of the year, including realised investment gains of Dollars 122m. At
the same stage in 1991, the figure was Dollars 341m, helped by realised
investment gains of Dollars 51m.

THE bid deadline for Continental Airlines, the large and bankrupt US
carrier, expired yesterday, with at least three suitors thought to be still
in the running.
Earlier, Continental confirmed that Lufthansa, the German airline which had
considered making an offer with Mr Marvin Davis, the Californian financier,
was no longer pursuing a deal. This appeared to leave three contenders: a
consortium lead by Mr Charles Hurwitz's Maxxam group, an offer from Mr
Alfredo Brener's Houston Air, and a proposal from Air Canada in conjunction
with a Texan investment partnership.
Shortly after bids closed, Air Canada confirmed it was still interested in
Continental, but declined to give more details. The Maxxam group also said
it had submitted an offer by the deadline. Houston Air was not immediately
contactable.
Continental has to present the 'best offer' to the bankruptcy court on
November 9.

into SelectNet

<TEXT>
THE New York Stock Exchange has called for an inquiry into the the
all-electronic share trading system run by Nasdaq, a rival stock market
operated by the National Association of Securities Dealers.
In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the securities
industry watchdog, the NYSE argues elements of Nasdaq's SelectNet trading
system circumvent the SEC's rules on information disclosure. SelectNet
allows traders to negotiate prices and execute trades over a computer
screen. This is more advanced than normal Nasdaq market trading, where
prices are listed on screens but most trades are initiated over the
telephone.
Currently only Nasdaq stocks can be traded on SelectNet, but Nasdaq filed
for SEC approval earlier this year to begin trading NYSE-listed stocks on
the system.
The NYSE's opposition to SelectNet is based on its claim that prices are not
disseminated widely enough on the system to assure that the standards of
price discovery mandated by government regulations are met. The NYSE, not
only wants to block approval for the trading of NYSE stocks on SelectNet,
but wants a wider inquiry into the current operation of the entire system.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Portugal (2): Workers face pressure - Plans to
reform the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY PORTUGUESE are still nostalgic about the 1950s. It was a time when they
were arguably the richer of the two countries on the Iberian peninsula.
Bankers and government officials in Lisbon remember how cheap it used to be
to visit Spain and shop there. Now, say many, the main relief after crossing
into Spain is that they feel safer driving on the Spanish roads.
That says more about Portuguese driving than it does about Spain's. But it
is astonishing how quickly the world has turned. In Spain, GDP per head is
now nearly 80 per cent of the European Community average while Portugal's
struggles at around 56 per cent.
For while General Franco, Spain's late dictator, opened up his economy to
foreign invest- ors and visitors in the 1960s, Portugal's ruler, Antonio de
Oliveira Salazar, bankrupted his country by fighting hopeless colonial wars
in Mozambique and Angola. Franco's democratic heirs inherited a
fundamentally sound market economy in the mid-1970s. Salazar left behind him
a poisoned economy which the country only began to tackle seriously in the
1980s.
Not to labour the Iberian comparisons, Spain saw EC accession (at the same
time) as a opportunity to spread its wings and show off to the rest of the
world. Portugal saw it as a salvation.
Indeed, the results have been impressive. The escudo has managed to maintain
a remarkable degree of stability in spite of the monetary turmoil unleashed
in Europe in the last few months. A con- fident centrist government, in its
third term, has clung deter- minedly to a strong exchange rate to force
domestic indus- tries to become more compet- itive. More recently, it
pledged itself to full liberalisation of capital movements in an effort to
force down interest rate margins in a banking system revitalised by
privatisation.
In banking alone, investment last year rose nearly 40 per cent, with some
500 new branches being opened around the country. Imports of machinery rose
30 per cent in 1988 and 40 per cent in 1989. Volkswagen and Ford have set
Portuguese hearts racing with a planned Dollars 3bn joint investment to
build 'space wagons' near Lisbon.
In the meantime, unemployment is only 4 per cent, the current account is in
surplus (just), inflation targets (designed not to be too precise) are
largely being met and two of the EC economic and monet- ary union (EMU)
convergence targets - holding the budget deficit to 3 per cent of GDP and
public debt to below 60 per cent of GDP - are within a whisker of being
achieved.
But the worldwide economic slowdown has not passed Portugal by, which some
people in and out of govern- ment think is no bad thing. Yet, handled
correctly, that could be the excuse to begin a drive for true convergence
and competitiveness.
Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, the country's forceful finance minister, couches
what is about to happen in the measured tones of all governments about to
shake up the economy. '1992 should be looked at as the beginning of a
multi-annual adjustment process,' he says. That means policies which
analysts say inevitably lead to higher unemployment.
The process has already begun, with the government quietly implementing a
far- reaching reform of the public service. 'It is just not working very
well,' says the finance minister. His 1993 budget, presented last month will
force ministries to cut recurrent spending by 5 per cent and the government
is taking a deter- mined stand, in wage talks with unions and employers, to
keep wage rises to a minimum.
'We cannot go on with wages rising at four or five times the EC average,'
says Mr Braga de Macedo. 'We have to enforce greater wage discip- line.'
Lisbon's initial target in these talks is 5.5 per cent, which, if 1993
inflation turns out at the top of its 5 to 7 per cent target band, would
mean a real wage cut. Needless to say, the unions are threatening to strike
and the government - which uses these talks to set public sector pay as a
guideline for the private sector - may be pushed further up.
But the point is being made. And it is already being supported by a sharp
reversal of the country's growth projections for this year from 3.5 per cent
forecast at the start of the year to 2.5 per cent now. At the same time,
exports to Portugal's biggest trading partner, Spain, are stagnating and
made even more difficult by the 5 per cent devaluation of the peseta in
September.
Mr Miguel Namorado Rosa, chief economist at Banco Com- ercial Portugues,
says he believes the 1993 inflation tar- get is too optimistic, especially
as there is great pressure to devalue the escudo. 'We are just not a low
inflation coun- try.' An inflation target of 5 to 7 per cent for 1993 would,
he feels, be credible if consump- tion were flat. But the govern- ment is
also forecasting robust GDP growth of 3 per cent.
The government may be intent on using public investment - forecast to grow
12 per cent - to maintain growth but it will need to be careful to avoid
falling into the same trap as Spain did when it rushed into large project
spending after EC accession only to find itself paying much more than it had
anticipated. Investors have begun demanding much higher yields on the debt
Spain issues to finance its deficits.
The Portuguese may be cushioned from this, though. Private savings are high
 -21 per cent of disposable income. The government is also planning a big
drive to streamline tax collection (and thus collect more) and it still
hopes that its richer EC partners will approve, from next year, the
financing of a 'cohesion' fund established in principle at the Maastricht
summit last year to help fund national projects in the Community's poorer
margins.
Mr Braga de Macedo's hope, of course, is to converge with Europe, even
nominally, and hold prices stable at the same time. He scoffs at suggestions
that he needs a recession to do it even though recent European money market
turmoil might have put the brakes on a gentle slide in Portuguese interest
rates in the summer.
But what cannot be known now is how much unemploy- ment the government will
need to create to make the country competitive. Perhaps the better question
is: what level of unemployment becomes a serious electoral threat? The
potential for job cuts may be enormous as current figures disguise
widespread underemployment.
In the private sector, there seems little hope that hundreds of inefficient
textile, shoe and leather goods indus- tries will ever survive serious
international competition and the country's farms, which employ nearly 20
per cent of the working population (compared to 13 per cent in Spain, 15 per
cent in Ireland and just 9 per cent in Italy) are a constant source of worry
to Lisbon.
Nevertheless, it is probable that a two or even three point rise in
unemployment is sur- vivable politically, and the gov- ernment will be
careful to make a great fuss about its increased spending on infra-
structure, health and social programmes. 'We are reform- ists,' says the
finance minister, 'and a reformist is never worried. He is always tranquil.
There is no alternative to what we are doing.'

FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (1): The worst has passed -
World oil production is more closely aligned to demand than for many years.
But there are fears of renewed instability once the UN decides to end its
embargo on exports by Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S oil and gas companies have been living through difficult times
in 1992, but there are signs the outlook may be improving.
More than ever before, the global oil and gas industry is dominated by
questions of balance, and a delicate balance is now returning to some key
areas.
Oil prices drive the whole industry, and these have generally been firmer
and more stable, thanks to a very tight balance between supply and demand,
although there was a worrying Dollars 1-a-barrel retreat last week.
One of the principal factors that could upset the balance this year is not
the actions of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or Middle
East politics, but something more mundane: the weather. A
colder-than-average winter in the northern hemisphere for the first time in
five years could add up to 75 cents to the price of a barrel of oil.
That price is already expected to rise close to Dollars 22 a barrel for
North Sea Brent crude this winter, and to Dollars 20.50 or more for the Opec
basket of world crudes  - close to the target of Dollars 21 a barrel Opec
adopted in July 1990.
However, with Opec production now within 1m barrels a day of its estimated
total capacity, analysts say any short-term disruption in supply  - for
example, from the former Soviet Union  - could still produce a price spike
of up to Dollars 25 a barrel.
That fact illustrates the continuing dominance of Opec over the world's oil
markets, but the post-Gulf war era has seen signs of change within Opec.
Many believe the organisation is becoming more market-oriented, responding
to the changed outlook which sees demand for Opec oil rising in the 1990s,
unlike the 1980s when its market shrank. Most members, including Saudi
Arabia, are in debt and keen to maximise revenues, and yet they are
carefully being nudged by Saudi Arabia into extracting the highest price the
market will support, while still ensuring there is enough oil to meet market
demand.
There is, however, one black cloud on the horizon that threatens to shatter
the delicate balance within Opec and the world oil market: the possible
lifting of the United Nations ban on oil exports by Iraq. Opec may find
itself in 1993 having to absorb 2.5m b/d or more of Iraqi oil, something
bound to provoke disagreement.
While oil prices are still crucial to oil companies, they must pay
increasing attention to gas prices, as gas consumption grows across the
world.
Here, too there is better news. Balance is returning to the US gas market,
and the 'gas bubble' which has severely depressed prices is finally thought
to be over. Prices dropped from about Dollars 2.50 per thousand cubic feet
in the early 1980s to Dollars 1.63 in 1986, and bottomed out at a mere 90
cents in February this year. They then climbed to a peak of Dollars 2.60 in
September  - buoyed a little by the drop in production caused by Hurricane
Andrew.
They have since settled back to about Dollars 2.40, but supply and demand
are seen as being closely matched for the foreseeable future. The only
threat is that if prices climb too high, some users might switch to burning
fuel oil.
The higher prices are especially good news for the exploration and
production companies without downstream interest who specialise in finding,
producing and selling oil or gas. Natural gas stocks were the best
performers on the New York Stock Exchange for the six months to September,
according to a recent report by First Boston.
Meanwhile, in the UK, the devaluation of sterling in mid-December has helped
push the sterling oil price above Pounds 12, compared with an average of
little more than Pounds 10.50 for the first half of the year. Expectations
of a continued strengthening of the dollar are prompting analysts to
reassess their 1993 earnings forecasts for UK independent oil companies, and
some of these have seen their share price rise 30 per cent or more since
mid-September.
The outlook for the major integrated companies, whose activities encompass
not only exploration and production but refining and marketing and
petrochemicals operations, is less bright. Slower economic growth in the Far
East, hesitant economic recovery in the US, and continued weak economic
activity and recession in parts of Europe are likely to keep refining and
chemicals margins under severe pressure.
Such pressures have forced the majors into aggressive cost-cutting, but
here, too, they face a question of balance. They must weigh the need to cut
costs against the growing necessity of replacing their reserves  - something
they have consistently failed to do in recent years.
As many of the traditional producing areas such as the North Sea and the
Gulf of Mexico reach maturity, and no longer hold out the prospect of giant
field discoveries, the quest for reserves is taking oilmen into uncharted
and often risky territories, from Laos to Colombia. The oil companies' drive
for international expansion has conveniently coincided with the opening up
of many traditionally closed areas of the world, and many analysts expect
there to be virtually no countries where international oil companies cannot
operate by the end of the decade.
The republics of the former Soviet Union, with the world's sixth-largest
known reserves of oil and largest reserves of gas, are proving a magnet for
oil companies. But, nearly a year after the break-up of the Union, progress
is still sluggish. While a number of new joint ventures have been formed
with Russia, the biggest deals have been done with Azerbaijan and
Kazakhstan, and the smaller republics seem to be proving more fleet-of-foot
than the lumbering Russian bear when it comes to attracting Big Oil.
Oil companies must also balance the need for spending on exploration with
the investment required to meet ever stricter environmental legislation. The
threat of a carbon tax has, for now, receded. But Mr David Simon, chief
executive of BP, told September's World Energy Congress in Madrid the
estimated cost to oil companies of meeting environmental legislation in the
US was between Dollars 15bn and Dollars 20bn, and in Europe Dollars 9.5bn  -
equivalent to the net annual income worldwide of Europe's top seven oil
companies.
Environmental concerns may also alter the global balance between oil and gas
consumption.
The US energy Bill that finally cleared Congress last month encouraged the
use of natural gas as a fuel for motor vehicles and power generation, and
gave tax relief to gas drillers. Gas advocates say the US could cut its
reliance on foreign oil, its trade deficit, and its emissions to the
atmosphere, by switching to a gas-based economy from oil.
On the other side of the Atlantic, the decision last month to close 31 of
the UK's remaining 50 coal mines (a decision now being reviewed) was blamed
on the 'dash for gas' by the privatised electricity generators. The ensuing
row has reopened the whole debate about the UK's energy policy.
An important plank of that policy has been privatisation, but there have
been numerous difficulties stemming from the fact that British Gas, the
former monopoly supplier, was sold in 1986 as a single entity. Attempts to
speed up the development of competition have had limited success. A series
of rows between British Gas and its regulators, the Office of Fair Trading
and the Office of Gas Supply, culminated in the decision in August to refer
the whole UK gas market to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for a
wide-ranging investigation. The result could be fundamental changes in the
gas industry.
The US began deregulation of its gas market in 1984, but the process is
still continuing. What is intended to be the final phase, the Federal Energy
Regulation Committee's Order 636, is due to be implemented next year. The
Order will finally spell the end of the dominant merchant role of the
interstate pipelines, allowing hundreds of suppliers to compete to provide
reliable long-term gas services without having to own long-distance
pipelines. But analysts predict its implementation could be dogged by
uncertainty and controversy.
European countries are unimpressed with the sometimes clumsy attempts by the
UK and US to develop a competitive gas market, and powerful monopolies in
many countries will resist any attempts to make similar changes. While the
UK said it would use its presidency of the European Community to push for a
single energy market, this has been overtaken by a fundamental debate about
the future of the Community.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Portugal (1): Euro-train's bumpy ride - The
country's modernisation drive is slowing down as it wrestles with ambitious
targets for European economic and monetary union. The challenge now will be
to keep on track
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PORTUGAL'S express train to modernisation is having to slow down as economic
and political uncertainty threatens to derail plans for European Economic
and Monetary Union (Emu). No-one has yet pulled the emergency brake in
panic, but after the recent financial markets' turmoil, some passengers are
wondering if it might not be a good idea to jump off the Euro-train
altogether.
Firmly in the driving seat, Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva shows no sign of
trepidation. For the prime minister and his right-of-centre social
democratic administration, there is no realistic alternative to deeper
European union for Portugal - or for Europe. He believes much of the damage
caused by upheavals in the financial markets could have been minimised or
avoided had appropriate institutions and instruments been there to counter
it. 'What all this (turmoil) has shown is that we need more, not less,
co-operation; that it is important to press ahead more urgently with Emu,'
he says.
There is broad support for this policy in Portugal, from the ruling Social
Democrats to the Socialist opposition. Portugal will not have a referendum
on the Maastricht treaty, whose ratification will be approved by parliament
shortly. This requires minor constitutional amendments, but the socialist
party says it will support the necessary changes.
Dissent over Europe, which had been subdued and mainly left to the political
fringes, was given a boost by the Danish No to Maastricht and the narrow
victory of the Yes vote in France. Arguments about sovereignty, however,
have taken second place to concern over the costs of European union. Farmers
and industrialists who feel threatened by the single market have been more
insistent in their calls for protection, lower interest rates and a
devaluation of the escudo.
The government's response is that interest rates are falling anyway, and
that producers must become more efficient rather than rely on competitive
devaluations to sell their wares.
The problem for Portugal is that as a small, open economy it cannot avoid
the consequences of economic downturn - or significant currency devaluations
 -in its major markets. Lower international growth already is reflected in a
downward readjustment of expectations for Portuguese GDP growth to 2-2.5 per
cent from 3 per cent forecast a year ago. While this remains sturdy enough
by European standards, it is sharply down on the 4.5 per cent average annual
growth rates registered by Portugal in the five boom years that followed its
accession to the Community in 1986.
'Of course growth will be lower, but we'll keep growing. We have no
indications pointing to a recession. We are concerned about the
international situation and our budget reflects our concern. This is the
time to cut expenditures,' says Mr Cavaco Silva, who is prepared to use the
crisis in Europe as an additional reason for tightening up at home.
A tough budget for 1993 aims at further reducing the budget deficit from
above 5 per cent to below 4 per cent of GDP. As there will be no extra taxes
to help balance the government's books, the difference will come mostly from
reducing expenditure, with most ministries asked to cut recurrent spending
by 5 per cent. Unnecessary or inefficient public services will be abolished
or rationalised, and public sector wages will be kept firmly in check, both
to control costs and to set an anti-inflationary example to the private
sector. Inflation is forecast to decline, from a little above 9 per cent
this year to 5-7 per cent.
Keeping inflation and wages down may prove difficult with unemployment at
below 4 per cent, while investment must be maintained at high levels if the
process of modernisation and restructuring of the Portuguese economy is to
continue. However, the government is prepared to accept a rise in
unemployment as it would help to reduce labour market rigidities.
The government is to attack inefficiency on several fronts at once. The
civil service will be trimmed, the health service reformed and partly
privatised, the country's top-heavy armed forces will be cut with a large
number of officers given early retirement, the capital's police force will
be reorganised, university fees are to be raised and set according to a
means test, and a new law aims to make strikes more difficult, especially in
the public sector where labour unrest is greatest. Privatisations will be
accelerated.
There have been howls of protests from students, army officers and trade
unions - a combination that proved such a potent political cocktail in the
heady days of revolution in 1974-75. But today each group pursues widely
different and divergent interests, the colonial wars are over, democracy has
been firmly anchored, and prosperity has raised individual expectations.
There has been a sea change in attitudes, and the government is confident it
can ride the storm.
Part of this confidence stems from experience. A two-month strike by public
sector transport workers last winter was highly unpopular and ended, not for
the first time, in defeat for the unions. Earlier reforms also proved
unpopular initially but eventually went through. With an absolute majority,
the government has another three years before a general election, and by
then it hopes to reap the benefits it expects to flow from its reforms.
Meanwhile, the opposition is in disarray and in no condition to mount an
effective counter-attack. As the largest opposition party, the moderate
Socialist party should be leading the charge against the government, but its
policies on key issues are not fundamentally different from those of Mr
Cavaco Silva's Social Democrats, and it is weakened by internal party
strife. The once-powerful hard-line Communist party is ageing and declining,
while the small right-wing CDS is looking for a coherent programme under a
young and relatively inexperienced new leader.
With the political initiative firmly in the government's hands, an economy
still growing and the general feeling of most Portuguese that they are
better off today than they were five or 10 years ago, Mr Cavaco Silva would
seem to have little to worry about, were it not for international
uncertainties which could throw the government's strategy off course.
A major part of that strategy relies on continued high levels of investment,
with foreign investment playing a crucial role. The opening up of eastern
Europe has not noticeably affected investment levels in Portugal, but the
worldwide economic downturn is delaying investment decisions, as well as
making it harder for Portuguese manufacturers to export.
Yet Portugal needs more investment and EC assistance to engage in real
economic convergence with its richer EC partners. That is why a resolution
to the current crisis within the Community and early agreement on a new
package of EC funds including the new 'cohesion' fund to help the EC's
poorest states modernise their infrastructures is so important for Lisbon.
The transition from a backward, underdeveloped economy to a modern one has
only recently begun, with striking progress achieved in the past six years.
But much has still to be done to overcome structural weaknesses and make
industry competitive.
'We have a problem in the agricultural sector, and even at the end of the
transition period (2001) which we have negotiated with the Community, it
will not be easy to compete abroad. It's a sector where we have real
difficulties. Another matter for concern is the limited capacity of
entrepreneurship in Portugal, and you can't create that by decree,' says Mr
Cavaco Silva.
So far, the government's strategy of gradual change has been remarkably
successful - with help from the EC and a favourable international
environment. The challenge now is how to keep on track towards Emu under
less auspicious conditions - provided that is, that the Emu station itself
has not been knocked down or specially redesigned for trains running at
different speeds.

FT  03 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: American boost for Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Glaxo rebounded following buying in the US, prompted by a
recommendation from one highly influential US securities house.
Dr Jonathan Gelles, the top-rated pharmaceuticals analyst at Wertheim
Schroder, sent out a note reminding clients why Glaxo is on Wertheim's 'most
favoured' list.
He argues that the dividend is set to increase by 22 per cent per annum in
the short term and sees the stock hitting Pounds 13 a share within 18
months. He says that, while the Standard &amp; Poor's industry average is
expected to fall, Glaxo's earnings per share growth will rise to 20 per cent
over the next few years. And he added that the house had been buying the
stock very heavily on behalf of US institutions. The shares were firm all
day and closed 21 better at 820p.
Media activity
Selected media stocks were boosted by a re-evaluation of the prospects for
satellite group BSkyB. Big shareholders Pearson, News International and
Granada were all strong performers yesterday.
Agency broker James Capel, Hoare Govett and Morgan Stanley have all
significantly increased valuations. The figures range widely depending on
whether debt is included and what discount rate is used. Hoare Govett
estimates Pounds 3bn, up from Pounds 2.2bn at the end of last year, using a
discount rate of 13 per cent and inflation of 3.5 per cent. The house bases
its optimism on an increased take-up of more expensive subscriptions, the
Premier league deal and renegotiated film contracts.
Granada, which Hoare believes to be the 'principal buy' among the
shareholders, climbed 17 to 298p. News International which owns 50 per cent
of BSkyB and is always a tightly traded stock, gained 17 to 298p, and
Pearson, which has 16 per cent, moved ahead 15 to 363p.
Reed International, which has around a 3.7 per cent stake, also firmed but
was probably more influenced by switching from its new partner, the Dutch
publisher Elsevier. It closed 7 higher at 589p.
Waters in demand
Water issues were easily the best performers in a generally strong utilities
area of the market as the institutions focused on the prospects of
well-above market average dividend increases from the sector.
The water sector's interim dividend season kicks off this morning with
results from Thames Water, the biggest of the 10 privatised water companies
as measured by market capitalisation, and continues until December 17 when
Wessex Water reveals its figures.
The general consensus around the market was that dividend increases across
the sector will average around 9 per cent. Kleinwort Benson's utilities team
expects the sector as a whole to report pre-tax profits of Pounds 846.5m,
7.4 per cent up on a year ago and dividends up an overall 8.7 per cent,
ranging from 8 per cent at South West Water to 9.4 per cent at Severn Trent.
Kleinwort maintains its recommendation that funds overweight in the sector
should use any strength to lighten their holdings. Mr Steve Doe at Hoare
Govett, on the other hand, maintained the sector 'is still attractive
relative to the market and the electricity sector'.
Anglian was the best performer among the sector's Footsie constituents,
adding 15 at 468p, followed by Severn Trent, 13 higher at 450p.
British Gas was given a strong push by market heavyweights such as Hoare
Govett and Kleinwort Benson and settled 3 1/2 ahead at 273p. Shell rose 5 to
538p, largely at the expense of BP, which could manage only a minor
improvement at 234 1/2 p, after one of the leading UK integrated broking
houses recommended a switch.
Lasmo dipped 1 1/2 to 174 1/2 p ahead of tomorrow's seminar on its
Indonesian gas interests.
Sentiment continued to strengthen ahead of J. Sainsbury's interim results
tomorrow, with market talk suggesting that sales had edged forward around 5
per cent on the same period last year. Trading was also said to have
benefited from the group's recent promotion with British Airways. The shares
rose 8 1/2 to 510p. Some of Sainsbury's gain was at the expense of rival
Tesco, off a penny at 232p.
A downgrade held Booker back, the shares retreating 6 to 359p. BZW trimmed
Pounds 3m from its current year forecast to Pounds 99m, blaming difficult
trading conditions in the food distribution business.
Slightly better than expected figures from Associated British Foods added a
halfpenny to the shares at 443p, although did nothing to improve the market
outlook for milling and baking. Dealers linked this with the fall in bid
target RHM, the shares ending down 12 at 263p ex-dividend, a penny short of
Tomkins' alternative cash offer.
Barclays shares dipped early in the session after recent profits and
dividend downgrades and the possibility of more to come were highlighted in
the Sunday press. They later rallied to close 4 higher at 350p, having
touched 338p at the outset.
There was slight disappointment in the market with Prudential's stated 1991
figures, reworked under the accruals method, and the shares settled 2 1/2
easier at 276p.
Invesco MIM,the UK fund management group, shot up 9 more to 84p after a
number of big blocks of stock, totalling 22m shares, were crossed in the
market at 77p a share. Late in the session it was announced that Daido
Mutual Life Insurance had sold a 4.99 per cent stake in Invesco. Last week
Peregrine Investments, the Hong Kong investment house backed by Mr Li
Ka-Shing, increased its stake in Invesco to 14.9 per cent.
Turnover in British Steel rose to 15m as the shares closed unchanged at 47p,
after Smith New Court cut its forecast and labelled the stock a sell down to
20p. The broker expects current year losses to reach Pounds 165m, against
its previous estimate of a Pounds 50m loss.
Lucas Industries moved 9 ahead to 115p after BZW was reported to have had a
buyer of 1m shares. Simon Engineering bounced following last week's profits
downgrading from Smith New Court and jumped 10 to 89p.
Nervous trading ahead of tomorrow's interim figures left William Cook 6
lighter at 89p.
Bargain hunters helped Tomkins recover some lost ground and the shares
closed 10 up at 222p as developments on the RHM bid were awaited.
Stag Furniture rose 21 to 95p as the market caught wind of an approach from
a rival. The Midlands company confirmed the rumours but withheld the name of
the bidder. There was speculation that bathroom maker Spring Ram (up a penny
at 151p) was poised to launch an offer worth 105p a share.
Blue Circle Industries remained one of the market's takeover favourites, the
shares jumping a further 8 to 175p.
Weakness in Allied Lyons last week was corrected, helped by analysts
returning from a visit to the company's Spanish operations. The shares rose
7 to 633p.
The recent strength in Queens Moat Houses continued as talk surrounding the
hotel group's rumoured strategic discussions with Bass persisted. The latter
also benefited from a reiterated buy stance from BZW and the shares put on 7
to 556p. Queens Moat gained a penny to 44p.
Turnover in Tiphook, boosted by a block of 2.3m shares dealt at 231p a
share, reached 4m. The stock closed unchanged at 239p.

FT  03 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: US buying helps lift London equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETTER economic news from across the Atlantic and interest rate cuts in
France helped the UK stock market resist political uncertainties yesterday
and turn higher towards the close of the trading session.
US buyers appeared in London for the blue chip internationals, while the
broad range of domestic stocks responded to hopes that interest rate cuts
and moves to stimulate the domestic economy will survive tomorrow night's
Maastricht debate in parliament.
Trading volume was light for much of the day, with investors clearly
cautious at the beginning of a week which will be featured by the
presidential election in the US and the challenge to Mr John Major's
government in the paving debate over the Maastricht treaty.
In early trading, equities were sluggish, barely succeeding in recovering an
early fall of 9.2 on the FT-SE Index by midsession. Renewed weakness in
sterling cast a cloud over interest rate hopes, and equities were restrained
by falls in government bond prices.
The second half of the session saw share prices climbing slowly until
mid-afternoon when the pace speeded up, reportedly when a leading UK
securities house stepped in to the London market with a Pounds 150m buy
order from a US investment fund.
Also helping equities was a modest rally in sterling after the reduction of
some French base rates appeared to improve the chances for similar moves in
the UK. The FT-SE Index closed at the day's best of 2,687.8 for a gain on
the day of 29.5 points.
Traders suggested that the US fund buyer of London stocks might simply be
hedging positions while awaiting the outcome of the presidential vote. But
sentiment towards the US economy benefited from news late yesterday that the
US National Purchasing Managers Index had risen to 50.6 per cent and that
construction orders had increased by 1.3 per cent in September, the largest
monthly rise since April.
The rise in the equity market spread from the blue chip international
sectors to take in the wider range of stocks reflected in the FT-SE Mid 250
Index. The increased focus on stocks outside the FT-SE 100-share Index over
the past fortnight has indicated the search by institutions for stocks
likely to benefit from moves to stimulate the UK economy.
Retail and consumer shares edged forward after a dull start and building and
construction issues, also immediate beneficiaries of lower base rates, found
buyers. But gains were generally modest. as were trading volumes.
A handful of bid situations also re-emerged, partly in view of perceptions
that the Hanson camp, challenged in its bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall, may
turn to other targets, some of them identified in previous tussles.
Takeover speculators were active on the insurance pitch, where a French bid
was suggested, and also among the construction stocks.
However, strategists warned that the market might have over-reacted
yesterday to modest buying interest.
On the domestic front, hopes for economic stumulus must take account of the
government's struggle to achieve acceptance tomorrow for the Maastricht
proposals, and may then have to wait until the official autumn economic
statement, due at the end of next week.

FT  03 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS in the derivative markets reported a dull session with investors
said to have been in a cautious mood ahead of today's US presidential
election and tomorrow's Maastricht debate in the UK, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, the December contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,679 and
immediately came under selling pressure which drove it down to 2,666, the
day's low point, within the first hour of trading.
Thereafter, December moved steadily forward and by mid-day was trading at
2,682. During the afternoon, a squeeze on the back of a firm Wall Street
sent the contract sharply forward to recover some of the earlier losses. For
most of the session December traded at a 5 to 10-point premium. It finished
at 2,714, around 30 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash,
which has come back this account to around 17 points. Turnover was 7,198
contracts.
In traded options, volume remained poor, reaching only 22,749 lots, but was
an improvement on Friday's meagre 19,164 contracts. The FT-SE 100 option
traded 5,448 contracts and some 3,284 lots were dealt in the Euro FT-SE
option.
British Steel led the league table among the stock options with 2,977
contracts. That total included a seller of 1,000 April 60 calls at 2p. This
was followed by BP, in which 1,260 lots were transacted.

FT  03 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rises on unexpected good
news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices rose across the board on some unexpected good news on the
economy, as investors calmly awaited today's presidential election, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 35.93 at 3,262.21, its
high for the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 4.07 at 422.75, while the
American SE composite firmed 0.98 to 382.70 and the Nasdaq composite bounced
back from early losses to end a net 2.40 ahead at 607.57. Turnover on the
New York SE was heavy at 203m shares, while advances led declines by 1,091
to 734.
Prices opened slightly weaker in thin trading, but rose strongly after the
National Association of Purchasing Management announced that its index of
manufacturing activity had risen from a September level of 49.0 per cent to
50.6 per cent last month, and the Commerce Department reported a 1.3 per
cent rise in September construction spending.
Both increases were larger than analysts had expected, and provided some
investors with an excuse to purchase stocks. Price gains were further
boosted by a round of program buying in mid-morning, and by a further burst
of demand in the last two hours of trading.
Otherwise, the political situation remained the dominant influence on the
market. The latest polls have shown a slight widening in Mr Bill Clinton's
lead over President George Bush, but because the market has fully discounted
a Democratic victory the changes had no effect on prices. Many analysts
pointed out that the stock market has rallied on the day before 14 out of
the last 16 presidential elections.
General Motors rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 31 7/8 after Mr Jack Smith was
appointed chief executive of the car manufacturer at a special board meeting
in New York.
Citicorp edged Dollars  1/8 higher to Dollars 16 3/4 , possibly drawing
comfort from reports that the Federal National Mortgage Association had
agreed to buy Dollars 1bn of the bank's mortgages on a non-recourse basis,
an indication that credit quality at Citicorp's troubled mortgage unit may
be improving.
The Gap fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 32 5/8 in busy trading on reports that
analysts at Goldman Sachs had lowered their earnings estimates for the
clothing retailer.
US Surgical dropped Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 64 5/8 after Oppenheimer, the
broking house, had removed the stock from its recommended list and
downgraded it from 'buy' to 'market performer'.
On the Nasdaq market, after opening weaker on profit-taking some leading
stocks rallied strongly, including Microsoft, up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 89
5/8 , and Intel, Dollars  1/4 firmer at Dollars 67 3/4 . Apple, off Dollars
 1/4 at Dollars 52 1/4 , and Sun Microsystems, down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars
33 7/8 , remained under selling pressure all day.
Canada
TORONTO stocks were sharply higher after moderately active trading. The TSE
300 index finished 42.9 ahead at 3,379.0, while rises outnumbered declines
by 319 to 225. Volume came to 29.2m shares.
Nova Corporation, up CDollars  1/4 at CDollars 9, reported third-quarter net
of 11 cents a share, against a net from continuing operations of 1 cent a
year earlier.

FT  03 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei closes at day's
high in futures-related rally

SHARE prices closed moderately higher after a futures-related rally, but
overall activity remained dull ahead of today's public holiday and the US
presidential election, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average ended 85.96 ahead at the day's peak of 16,853.36, rising
for the first time in four consecutive trading days. The index fell to the
day's low of 16,616.75 in the morning session on arbitrage unwinding but
subsequently rose on index-linked buying by investment trusts.
Volume dropped to 140m shares from 203m, although a UK broker was active in
the morning. In spite of the rise in the Nikkei index, declines led advances
by 573 to 353, with 157 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks put on 1.53 to 1,280.44 but, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50
index eased 2.62 to 1,029.84.
Arbitrageurs and investment trusts were notable participants, small-lot
trading by dealers accounting for activity in speculative theme stocks.
Green Cross, the most active issue of the day, fell Y30 to Y1,400 on
profit-taking. Meiji Milk Products, another Aids-related stock, slipped Y4
to Y922. However, dealers picked up Sumitomo Chemical, which firmed Y6 to
Y475 on the Interferon theme.
Nippon Housing Loan, the largest housing loan company, weakened Y21 to Y212.
Companies in this sector are currently restructuring due to a rise in bad
real estate loans. Market participants had hoped that the land buying
organisation being set up by the banks would help the sector, but plans
outlined last week failed to mention the purchase of land held as housing
loan company collateral.
Airline issues were depressed by last week's poor results. Japan Airlines
fell Y20 to Y564. The company made a Y4.4bn pre-tax loss for the six months
to September due to falling business demand for international travel and low
growth in tourist travel.
Condominium builders lost ground on prospects of poor sales and increasing
inventories, Towa Real Estate Development dropping Y35 to Y343 and Daikyo,
the leading condominium developer, retreating Y37 to Y678.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 51.54 to 18,349.79 in volume of 5.7m
shares. Construction and pharmaceutical issues receded on profit-taking.
Roundup
The US presidential election caused some nervousness during a generally
active day's trading in the Pacific Basin. Manila was closed for the All
Souls Day holiday.
KUALA LUMPUR rose further on strong buying of special situation and
index-linked stocks, with the composite index closing 7.75 stronger at a new
high of 649.06, in volume of 205.7m shares after Friday's record 237.6m.
Brokers said buying was inspired by a favourable 1993 Malaysian budget
unveiled last Friday, but profit-taking was evident as retail investors
unloaded some of their positions after last week's rally.
SINGAPORE closed more than 2 per cent higher on strong across-the-board
buying led by institutional investors. The Straits Times Industrial index
finished 30.54, or 2.2 per cent, higher at 1,417.54 in volume of 133.6m
shares against Friday's 133.3m.
DBS Foreign rose 70 cents to SDollars 12.50, while SIA Foreign and Singapore
Press Foreign rose 60 cents each to SDollars 15.60 and SDollars 14.40
respectively.
HONG KONG ended firmer after light trading, but with steep initial advances
having been trimmed by profit-taking. The Hang Seng index gained a net 40.48
at 6,231.17 after an intraday peak of 6,277.22. Turnover fell to HKDollars
2.57bn from HKDollars 4.17bn.
Blue chip heavyweights such as HSBC Holdings again led the market higher,
with the bank appreciating HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 63.50. Second-liners
with exposure to China also outperformed, Tung Wing Steel climbing 43 cents
to HKDollars 3.32 and Far East Aluminium adding 22 cents at HKDollars 1.65.
BANGKOK recorded its highest close in almost 27 months, as small and
medium-sized banks, finance and securities houses and building materials
companies gained strongly. The SET index rose 9.88, or 1.1 per cent, to
950.23, the highest since August 8, 1990. Turnover was an active Bt14.97bn.
SEOUL advanced for the seventh consecutive session, although profit-taking
put a dent in the rise. The composite index added 6.39 at 621.97 on a
turnover of Won678.6bn, compared to Saturday's half-day Won539.74bn. The
heavily weighted Kepco went limit-up, gaining Won800 at Won19,200.
TAIWAN extended opening losses to close broadly lower. The weighted index
shed 72.22, or 2 per cent, to 3,559.51 in thin turnover of TDollars 7.65bn,
after Friday's TDollars 7.23bn. The market was closed on Saturday for a
holiday.
AUSTRALIA closed sharply weaker, worried by a fall in local building
approvals and the continued weakness in the local dollar. The All Ordinaries
index lost 15.6 to 1,410.2 after an opening rally evaporated on news of a
1.2 per cent fall in building approvals in September. Turnover was ADollars
180.4m.
BHP lost the ground it picked up last week and fell 26 cents to a 19-month
low of ADollars 10.82. News Corp continued its record-setting rise,
advancing 20 cents to ADollars 26.10 ahead of its quarterly results.
NEW ZEALAND closed marginally higher in light trading. The NZSE-40 capital
index rose 5.2 to 1,372.01 in turnover of NZDollars 14m. Lion Nathan
remained under pressure, falling another 10 cents to NZDollars 3.70, on
profit worries. The brewer is due to report its annual results tomorrow.
JAKARTA's bank shares surged on the first day they were allowed to be bought
by foreigners, raising hopes of a general revival of the market. But the
composite index dipped 1.375 to 306.202.
Bank Bali and Bank Internasional Indonesia rose Rp25 and Rp165 to Rp3,275
and Rp3,225 respectively.

FT  03 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Finland and Italy lead the field
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEAKNESS in Japan was balanced by a gain in the US, and with Europe broadly
neutral the FT-Actuaries World Index came out 0.1 per cent higher last week.
However, among individual markets there was more movement in Europe than
elsewhere, Finland and Italy leading the week's winners with gains of 7.8,
and 6.3 per cent respectively.
Both markets have seen their domestic currencies devalued this year; Finland
also went through the devaluation process in 1991. Foreign shareholders have
paid the price, with Finland, in 1992, showing a 1.5 per cent gain in local
currency terms but a loss of 13.7 per cent via the US dollar; and in Italy,
the loss on 1992 expands from 9.3 to 21.0 per cent.
Ms Deborah Boys, technical analyst at James Capel, notes that before its
latest upswing the Hex index of the Helsinki stock exchange had fallen from
around the 2,000 mark registered in 1989 to a low of 541 in early September
this year, a drop of 73 per cent.
The recent recovery has been exaggerated by the tightness of the market, and
by the sheer depth of its earlier decline. Ms Boys says the gains have
coincided with improving liquidity, and in higher volume; but the Hex has
not yet broken through the current resistance level around the 730 mark, and
a correction could be expected.
Italy, too, was looking healthy last week. Market turnover at around L200bn
a day was virtually double that of its recent average, says Mr Michele
Pacitti of County NatWest.
Since the new Milan stock exchange acount started, says Mr Pacitti, the
government has suspended capital gains tax indefinitely and cut interest
rates. Last week, domestic investors were moved by the subsequent fall in
bond yields, and excited by privatisation speculation - specifically about
Sme, the food company, but moving on to other privatisation stocks.

FT  03 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt left out of the
continental upswing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN equities were left out of the firmer continental trend. Paris was
shut for a holiday, but French stocks traded in London were lifted by
another cut in interest rates, with the French segment of the Eurotrack 100
adding 1.4 per cent, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT extended its downturn to a fifth consecutive trading day as
another forecast from Bayer illustrated the weakening trend of the German
economy.
Bayer, which once expected maintained earnings in 1992 - and only recently
forecast a slight fall - said yesterday that its profits would be 'clearly
below' those of 1991. The shares fell DM8.50 or 3.2 per cent to DM254.50.
Turnover stayed quiet after Friday's DM3.2bn. Other big cyclicals took their
cue from Bayer, with BMW down DM11.50 to DM473.50 and Volkswagen DM5.90
lower at DM264.10, and the DAX index dropped another 19.75, or 1.3 per cent
to 1,472.57.
Mr Tony Cox of Kleinwort Benson, who had indicated a 10 per cent profit drop
for Bayer last week and had hoped for a maintained dividend, thought it
wiser now to pencil in another DM2 drop in earnings to DM23.50 a share, from
DM28 in 1991, and perhaps a dividend cut from DM13 to DM12 a share. But he
was still inclined to believe that German chemicals will enjoy their usual
seasonal upturn in the next few months, in advance of the annual dividend
season.
In engineering, where profit margins are also threatened by the higher
D-Mark, Linde lost DM18.50 to DM661, a two-day loss of DM32.50, while MAN
dropped DM7.50 to DM243. MAN holds its annual press conference tomorrow,
while Linde is due to report nine-month sales and orders soon.
MILAN was quiet for the first half-hour but then resumed its upward trend on
buy orders from domestic funds and from the banks. However, dealers warned
that the rally might slow in the next few days on profit-taking or selling
linked to the forthcoming call options expiry.
The Comit index rose 7.22 to 446.25 in turnover estimated at slightly less
than Friday's high L313.9bn. Financials and telecoms led the market higher.
Fondiaria rose L1,350 or 5.1 per cent to L27,700 while Stet added L28 to
L1,480.
AMSTERDAM was lifted by a firmer dollar in the second half of the session.
The CBS Tendency index closed 0.3 higher at 102.1.
The stronger dollar helped DSM to recover Fl 2.60 to Fl 79.80 after its
recent weakness while Akzo gained Fl 2.50 to Fl 127.80 ahead of its
third-quarter results, due today.
Elsevier added another 60 cents to Fl 112.60 following Friday's news of
revised merger terms with Reed of the UK.
ZURICH, sometimes accused of slavishly following Frankfurt, continued to
assert the independence it has shown this year with a firmer dollar
improving sentiment in the industrial segment of the market while banks and
insurers were neglected.
The SMI index added 10.5 to 1,921.6 as Roche certificates, SFr50 higher at
SFr3,730, topped the active list. Ciba-Geigy registered, SFr4 higher at
SFr597, were second.
MADRID closed weak, with the general index 0.69 lower at 197.78. Turnover
totalled 7.67 billion pesetas of which the oil blue-chip, Repsol, made up a
third.
STOCKHOLM saw strong demand from abroad for Astra. Its A shares were up SKr8
at SKr576, while the B shares rose SKr10 to SKr558. The Affarsvarlden
general index rose 6.3 to 713.2 in turnover of SKr454m after Friday's
SKr338m.
HELSINKI resumed its rise with the Hex index climbing 6.9 to 758.2 in
turnover up from FM58.0m on Friday to FM289.0m. Industrials rose 0.6 per
cent and service shares by 2.0 per cent.
ISTANBUL dropped 7.2 per cent on its return from a three-day national
holiday, the market index closing 261.92 lower at 3,380.78 on heavy sales
after a deposit rate increase by Ziraat Bank, Turkey's largest state-owned
bank.
Monthly inflation jumped to a seven-month high of 7.4 pct in September.
October figures will be released on Wednesday.
VIENNA's ATX index eased 3.89 to 794.59 in quiet trading. Creditanstalt
preferred fell Sch4 to Sch435, unmoved by news the government wants to sell
a 20 per cent stake in the company to General Electric of the US; but the
ordinaries rose Sch10 to Sch470.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Money Markets: France cuts rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CASH RATES in the French franc money market eased sharply yesterday after
the Bank of France cut its intervention rate for the first time since
December 1991, writes James Blitz.
Elsewhere in Europe, cash and futures trading was a good deal quieter. In
Britain, money market dealers are waiting for tomorrow's vote in the House
of Commons on the paving bill for the Maastricht treaty.
The Bank of France's decision to cut its money market intervention rate to
9.35 per cent from 9.60 per cent was the clearest sign yet that France has
won the battle to save the franc.
It was accompanied by a cut in the five to 10-day rate from 10.5 per cent to
10.25 per cent, and a comment from Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance
minister, that France has recovered all the reserves spent during the recent
currency crisis.
The three-month offered rate for francs fell to 9 3/4 per cent from the 9
15/16 per cent of Friday night, although French franc futures were mostly
unchanged because much of the derivatives market was shut.
One London trader suggested that the cash rates could fall further, as
French three-month rates remain some 80 basis points above Germany's.
In the sterling markets, fears that the UK government could be defeated in
the Maastricht bill on Wednesday caused new nervousness. A rejection of the
treaty would probably trigger sharp falls at the front end of the futures
market.
However, the market was undecided yesterday on how to act. The pound's fall
on the foreign exchanges injected some bearishness into the futures. But
this was relieved by easier liquidity in the sterling cash market which
reduced the short-dated rates.
Most of the Pounds 850m shortage forecast by the Bank of England at the
start of trading was removed in the early round via a repurchase agreement.
One-month money declined to 8 3/16 per cent offered, from the 8 3/8 per cent
registered on Friday night. The three-month offered rate was  1/8 lower at 7
5/8 per cent.
In the German money market, conditions remained tight following the
end-of-month liquidity problems seen on Friday. Call money was quoted
slightly higher at between 8.95 and 9 per cent.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar breaks crucial barrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR broke through the crucial barrier of DM1.56 against the D-Mark
yesterday, the highest it has reached since plummeting to a historic low
against the German currency two months ago, writes James Blitz.
A dollar rally was expected in the aftermath of today's US presidential
election. Many dealers believe that Mr Bill Clinton's likely victory as
President will lift US interest rates because of his commitment to increased
fiscal spending.
But the fact that the US currency rallied on the eve of the election was
interpreted yesterday as another indication that the dollar is on the verge
of a long term move upwards.
A leading UK-based fund manager said technical analysts were particularly
excited that the dollar had broken through DM1.56, a key chart point which
marks the average close of the dollar in the last 200 days. He added that
this was the sort of technical breakthrough which tends to encourage longer
term investors, who change their positions every six months or so, to buy
the currency. 'We ourselves have shifted our portfolios to reflect a long
term upturn in the dollar,' he said.
Two specific factors helped to push the currency to a high of DM1.5695 in
Europe and a close of DM1.5690 (in New York the dollar subsequently eased
back to end at DM1.5645).
First was the release of September's industrial production figures in
Germany, showing a 2 per cent fall, and increasing speculation that the
Bundesbank will cut market rates more quickly than anticipated.
Compounding the bullishness was the October report of the National
Association of Purchasing Managers in the US, which rose to 50.6 per cent
from the previous month's level of 49 per cent. A reading above 50 per cent
tends to indicate that the manufacturing sector is expanding.
Some dissonant voices still believe that the dollar will falter after the
election. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corporation in
London, believes that most of the operators who want to buy dollars in
anticipation of a Clinton victory have already bought them  - and that there
will not necessarily be a follow-through if he is elected.
Providing additional uplift for the dollar was sterling's intrinsic
weakness, the product of the political uncertainty engulfing the UK. Dealers
are nervous that Mr John Major's government will lose a crucial debate on
the Maastricht ratification bill in parliament on Wednesday night.
The pound yesterday fell to a three-year low against the dollar of Dollars
1.5300 before closing at Dollars 1.5320. Against the D-Mark it finished
nearly a pfennig down at DM2.4030. A vote against the Maastricht treaty
tomorrow would probably push sterling lower. Mr O'Neill says that, in this
event, DM2.30 would be a likely short term target.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Surveys arouse oil surplus
fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE SURVEYS published yesterday estimated oil production by the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries at more than 25.1m b/d in
October, arousing fears that production may outstrip demand this quarter.
However, the news had little impact on a market which had already seen oil
prices fall almost Dollars 1.50 in 10 days. Brent crude for December
delivery ended yesterday at Dollars 19.42 1/2 a barrel, up 12.5 cents from
Friday, but well off the Dollars 20.80 it reached in mid-October.
Petroleum Argus magazine estimated Opec production at 25.18m barrels a day,
Platt's Week at 25.21m b/d, and Paris-based Petrostrategies magazine at
25.3m b/d.
Nervousness about the possibility of excess production had already taken
hold of the market last week. Traders said no single factor seemed to be
depressing prices, but rather a combination of rumours and suspicions.
Reports circulated that Kuwait was pushing for rapid expansion of its crude
capacity towards 2m b/d. Kuwait is at present producing about 1.3m b/d,
while Iran announced a one-week increase in production last month from about
3.5m b/d to 4m barrels a day to test new production capacity.
There was further speculation about the possible return of Iraq to the
export market. Iraq was banned by the United Nations from exporting oil
after it invaded Kuwait in 1990. Recent remarks by the head of the UN
commission on Iraq, together with the possibility of victory for Mr Bill
Clinton in the US election, aroused fears that Iraq might return sooner than
expected.
On Friday, rumours hit the market that Saudi Arabia planned to raise its
output to 8.8m b/d this month - rumours which the kingdom was quick to
squash.
Analysts had previously been forecasting a tight market this winter. This
had pushed Brent crude close to Dollars 21 a barrel in October, with
predictions that it might reach Dollars 22 during the winter. With some
forecasters predicting a colder-than-normal winter, and world oil stocks at
a four-year low, the weather was seen as the factor most likely to affect
prices.
The recent slide has damaged that confidence. But analysts insist that the
fundamentals are still strong.
'I must emphasise I think supply and demand are nowhere near as
out-of-kilter as this price would suggest,' said Mr Mehdi Varzi, analyst at
Kleinwort Benson, the London brokers.
Mr Varzi believed the underlying reason for the price fall might be lack of
direction from Opec. Many traders were nervous when the communique at Opec's
last meeting referred to agreement on a 'market share' rather than the more
usual 'production ceiling'.
'People hate cartels, but in most commodity markets there is someone who
guides the price. The last Opec meeting did not give a clear signal,' Mr
Varzi said.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chicago grain trade ignores
Gatt worries as futures rally
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHILL WINDS over the North American plains and the first snows in Minnesota
helped lift the prices of Chicago maize and soyabeans futures yesterday, as
the foul weather briefly delayed the bumper harvest.
Grain traders, focused squarely on the progress of the crop and the outcome
of Tuesday's national elections in the US, were all but oblivious to the
international trade talks going on at a hotel only blocks from the soyabean
pits at the Chicago Board of Trade.
The talks, billed as the last in the six-year-long negotiating marathon
known as the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
were seen as an 'insignificant' feature in the morning grains rally.
'Political events are harder to predict than the weather,' said Mr Daniel
Basse, senior analyst for the Illinois-based firm, AgResources. 'At least
with the weather, we can get a 10-day forecast.'
With 38.5 per cent, or about 270m bushels, of this year's US soyabean crop
scheduled to be exported to the European Community this marketing year, the
failure of Gatt and an ensuing trade war could push the price of Chicago
soyabean futures down to Dollars 5 a bushel 'fairly quickly', Mr Basse said.
Soyabean futures for January delivery closed at Dollars 5.52 3/4 a bushel on
Friday, and had rallied another 3 1/4 cents in late trading yesterday.
The Monday rally, Mr Basse said, reflected the traders' unwillingness to
come to grips with the importance of Gatt. 'I don't really think the traders
understand the implications (of a failure of Gatt). It has been an ongoing
development, over several years and most of these guys don't have any
experience with a trade war. They don't think it can happen.'
Mr Richard Feltes, research director for the big Chicago-based brokerage
firm, Refco, suggested, however, that the market had already written a
failure of Gatt into market prices. 'I think the majority of people who
watch this closely believe that Gatt's not going to happen,' he said. He
added that those same people did not believe that a Gatt failure would spark
a trade war, which explained the indifference of the grain markets.
'Traders don't think (US President) Bush has got the guts to throw Dollars
1bn in sanctions on the EC,' Mr Feltes said. 'They just don't think he will
pull the trigger on a trade war. World leaders in the '90s don't start trade
wars, especially over soyabeans.'
A report on US exports sales released last Thursday showing that fully half
of this year's projected soyabean exports, or about 339m bushels, had
already been placed, was central to the two-day soyabean rally, traders
said. That volume of sales only six weeks into the new marketing year was
something of a benchmark for the US, they said.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Western uranium output falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
URANIUM PRODUCTION outside the former eastern bloc countries last year was
only 26,900 tonnes, the lowest since 1976, but enough to take cumulative
western world output past the 1m tonnes mark, according to the UK-based
Uranium Institute.
Western production in 1991 covered only 57 per cent of utilities' reactor
requirements - uranium has only one use, to produce nuclear energy - and the
rest was covered by the drawdown of stocks and deliveries from the
Commonwealth of Independent States, eastern Europe and China.
In its latest market study, the institute estimates that western uranium
stocks are about 78,000 tonnes but suggests not all of this is available. In
any case, 'given the shortfall of about 20,000 tonnes in 1991 between
western production and requirements and a 1991 mine capacity utilisation
rate of 62.1 per cent, these available stocks could be consumed within a
relatively short time,' it adds.
In most countries in eastern Europe, uranium output has fallen to a level
where it just satisfies domestic requirements, the report indicates.
However, in the CIS production last year was 10,500 tonnes - substantially
higher than had been previously estimated.
Estimates of uranium resources in eastern Europe, the CIS and China have
been updated and are substantially lower than previously believed. At a
recoverable cost of up to USDollars 80 a kilogram, resources in eastern
Europe at the end of 1990 were estimated to be 61,000 tonnes, those in the
CIS at 355,000 tonnes and those in China at 50,000 tonnes.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brunei still sits cosily in its
Shell - A longstanding relationship that suits both parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY THIS century two intrepid British geologists were cycling along a path
near the coast in Brunei, on the west of the island of Borneo. They paused
for a rest. Then one uttered the magic words: 'I smell oil'.
Brunei has never looked back. The economy of the tiny sultanate is a
relatively simple affair. At present it produces 182,000 barrels of oil a
day. Exports of crude in 1990, the last year for which official figures are
available, were worth Brunei Dollars 2.02bn (Dollars 1.27bn). Liquefied
natural gas exports were worth a similar amount.
Vast savings have accumulated over the years. The secretive Brunei
Investment Agency is believed to control a Dollars 35bn portfolio of
international investments, the income from which is now estimated to
contribute more to the government's coffers than revenues from oil and gas
combined.
Brunei's 270,000 people have one of the highest per capita incomes in the
world. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, now celebrating 25 years of absolute rule,
is generally regarded as the world's richest individual, with a personal
fortune estimated at Dollars 37bn.
The Sultan and the Royal Dutch/Shell group, in Brunei since early this
century, are the two main focuses of attention in Brunei. Shell has a
monopoly on Brunei's oil and gas exports. There is very little other
industry in the country. The Shell group is by far the country's biggest
employer - apart from the government, which employs about 50 per cent of the
labour force.
Shell is reluctant to discuss amounts of revenue from its local operations.
But Singapore-based oil industry analysts estimate that Brunei contributes
about 10 per cent of the Shell group's overall world-wide profits.
The company now has seven offshore oil fields in Brunei and two onshore. It
 -and Brunei - have been fortunate that oil discoveries have tended to
coincide with the oil price rise shocks of the last 20 years.
Oil analysts say that exploration technology now being used in Brunei is
among the most advanced in the world: using three dimensional seismic
exploration techniques finds have been made under existing oil fields. In
recent years the Brunei government has been stressing the need to conserve
resources.
'This year Shell has successfully pressed the Brunei government for an
increase in oil production so as to recoup the recent investments it has
made in high technology exploration,' says an industry analyst. 'Next year
production will probably fall back to 150,000-160,000 b/d and at that rate
Brunei has about 25 years' reserves of oil and about 40 years' reserves of
gas.'
Gas has been Brunei's big success story. Twenty years ago, Shell built in
Brunei what was then the world's biggest LNG processing plant. Gas is piped
from fields more than 30 km (18 miles) offshore and cooled at the plant
until it liquefies. It is then loaded on to LNG carriers and transported to
Japan.
The Brunei plant has produced more than 90m tonnes of LNG over the past 20
years. Apart from domestic consumption, all LNG is purchased by three
Japanese companies: Tokyo Electric (the world's biggest private electricity
utility), Tokyo Gas and Osaka Gas.
LNG exports to Japan have been made under a 20-year contract that runs out
at the end of March next year. Another 20-year contract is being negotiated,
but there have been considerable problems. The seven LNG ships that
transport the gas to Japan are owned jointly by Shell and the Brunei
government. At one stage the Japanese wanted a whole fleet of new tankers -
no small request with each ship costing around Dollars 300m.
The prices of LNG exports to Japan are determined by a complex formula based
on average prices of Japanese imported crude and referred to in the trade as
'The Japan Crude Cocktail'.
There continues to be arguments over price. Shell says talks are at a
crucial stage with no clear sign of when agreement can be reached. Industry
analysts say Brunei has the upper hand: the country has established itself
as a reliable, long-term supplier and about 14 per cent of Japan's total LNG
imports come from the sultanate. Japan wants to import more - if the
Japanese do not buy then Korea is a ready market.
All Shell's operations in Brunei have a 50 per cent government shareholding.
Mitsubishi, the Japanese conglomerate, has 25 per cent stakes in LNG
processing and transport operations.
Most industry analysts see the Brunei/Shell relationship continuing. But
others are eager to enter. Elf Aquitaine has formed a partnership with a
local company believed to be controlled by Prince Jufri, the Sultan's
younger brother and minister of finance. Elf has found oil but it is
believed to be in fields that either stretch into Malaysian waters or into
adjacent Shell areas.
The present sultan and his advisers have pressed for a greater share of
profits from the Shell operations. Analysts feel the government has been
clever in its handling of the oil giant: it has not threatened to
nationalise but by taking a 50 per cent stake in all operations, it has been
able to exert a large degree of control.
For its part Shell is very careful to obey various government edicts.
Official requirements on employing large numbers of Brunei Malay people
rather than Chinese or others have led to serious staff shortage
difficulties. For all its economic clout, Shell makes sure it is not seen to
be interfering in any of Brunei's internal affairs.
'No one outside really knows the exact terms of the contract between Brunei
and Shell,' says an industry analyst. 'But one thing is certain - it's very
good for Shell and good for Brunei as well.'

<TEXT>
INDIAN ALUMINIUM (Indal) has teamed up with Tata Industries to build a
1m-tonne alumina (aluminium oxide) plant at an estimated cost of Rs2bn
(Pounds 35m). Alcan of Canada, which holds nearly 40 per cent of the equity
in Indal, is also participating in the project.
According to Mr Tapan Mitra, managing director of Indal, the proposed
refinery, will be drawing bauxite (aluminium ore) from the Baphalimali
deposit in the Koraput district of Orissa. The bauxite reserves at
Baphalimali are estimated at 200m tonnes.
The project will be drawing technology from either Pechiney, Alusuisse or
Alcan.
The Indal-Tata joint venture is likely to attract overseas equity
participation and pre-purchase financing by prospective foreign buyers of
alumina.
Mr Mitra says the alumina refinery will be commissioned in six years. Indal
will also be promoting a new company to undertake the job of recycling
aluminium scrap. Initially, the plant be able to recycle 30,000 tonnes of
scrap. Later, plant capacity will be doubled, according to Mr Mitra.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Investors on sidelines as politics
dominate trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH US Treasury market investors kept their attention fixed primarily
on today's presidential election, bond prices eased across the board
yesterday in the wake of some unexpectedly strong economic news and
uncertainty about the next refunding operation.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/8 at 95
7/32 , yielding 7.653 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down  5/32
at 99 19/32 , yielding 4.449 per cent. Turnover was reported to be light.
Politics dominated the day's trading, with many investors remaining on the
sidelines ahead of today's polling. The latest polls, showing a slight
widening in Governor Clinton's lead over President Bush, had a slight
dampening effect on sentiment, adding to the downward pressure on prices.
The market, however, has already discounted the impact of a Democratic
victory, so the declines were limited.
The day's economic news was also mostly ignored, although there was some
selling after the National Association of Purchasing Management reported its
index of manufacturing activity rose to 50.6 per cent in October, up from
49.0 per cent the month before. Analysts had been expecting a smaller rise
in the index.
Prices were also slightly depressed by concern over the size of the
Treasurys' November refunding programme, which some investors fear may be
bigger than anticipated.
UK government bonds tumbled by more than a point at the long end as
political uncertainty and concern over the level of public spending took
their toll in London.
Dealers said the gilt market fell early in the day on fears that the Public
Sector Borrowing Requirement would be larger than expected following reports
that some Cabinet members are pushing for increased public spending to meet
the rising cost of unemployment, increasing welfare benefits and cost of the
incoming council tax. 'There is concern about the level of public spending
and the fear is that part of the resolution could be a higher PSBR' said Mr
John Shepperd, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities.
Adding to the poor market sentiment were worries about tomorrow's vote on
the Maastricht Bill in the House of Commons which paves the way for
ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European union. The result is
expected to be close, given the Conservative Euro-sceptics' threat to wipe
out the government's majority in Parliament.
The gilt yield curve showed a marked steepening yesterday as long-dated
issues fell by a point or more, while shorter-dated issues ended either
unchanged or slightly higher.
The 9 per cent gilt due 2008 traded at 102 13/32 by late afternoon, down
15/16 from late Friday. Among short-dated gilts, the 10 per cent gilt due
1996 traded at 109 27/32 late in the day, up  3/32 . The Liffe gilt futures
contract traded below its Friday closing level of 101.00, ending at 100.11
in relatively low volume.
GERMAN government bonds ended the day slightly firmer, but activity in the
market was subdued due to public holidays in much of Europe.
Dealers said investor interest was focused mainly on five-year issues, with
the DTB medium-dated bund futures contract showing a wider trading range
than Liffe's long bund rival. The DTB contract rose from Friday's level of
95.54 to end at 95.70 yesterday.
Although the bund market rose on Friday on news that Bonn would not launch
any more Federal bunds this year, dealers said the market had not ruled out
further issues by agencies such as the Treuhand and Unity Fund. Treuhand,
the privatisation agency, is expected to issue another 10-year bond by the
end of the year.
Elsewhere in Europe, the Bank of France cut its two key interest rates by a
quarter of a point, but trading activity was light due to the All Saints Day
holiday. Although the Matif futures exchange was closed, cash bonds were
quoted higher after the rate cuts with the 10-year OAT yielding 8.17 per
cent against 8.21 per cent on Friday.
JAPANESE government bonds ended firmer, but activity in the market was
lacklustre ahead of a national holiday in Japan and US presidential election
today.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 opened at 4.715 per cent, corresponding to
the low price of the day, and moved to 4.69 per cent, but the bond later
slipped to yield 4.695 per cent. In the futures market, the December
contract reached a high of 107.59, but fell to end at 107.57, up from its
close of 107.49 on Friday.
Short-term money market rates eased slightly with the overnight call money
rate dipping below 4 per cent again, to trade mostly at 3 31/32 per cent.

FT  03 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: BIS highlights shift in
nature of risks run by banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS' dealings with each other through wholesale financial markets used to
be relatively straightforward. They deposited money with each other or
undertook foreign exchange transactions in a way that was easy for banks and
their regulators to measure and control - even if sometimes those controls
went awry.
Not any more. The extent of the transformation in wholesale financial
markets, and the difficulties thrown up for the control of risks, is
highlighted in a report* published this week by the Bank for International
Settlements, the central bankers' club which has its headquarters in Basle,
Switzerland.
The scale of the transformation is illustrated by the chart. The traditional
interbank deposit market, which grew at a compound average rate of more than
13 per cent through the mid and late-1980s, went into reverse in 1991.
Concerns about the credit quality of other banks was one reason, the need to
use capital more efficiently following the Basle capital adequacy accord
another. Equally significant, however, has been the development of financial
instruments that offer a more efficient way for banks to hedge their risks
or take positions in markets. As the chart shows, banks' exposure to each
other through interest rate swap contracts has continued to climb.
According to the BIS paper, written after interviews with 63 of the most
active participants in wholesale financial markets, the nature of the risks
run by banks has shifted markedly. Market risk has shrunk as ever more
sophisticated ways have been developed for limiting exposure to general
market movements. But three other types of risk have become more acute:
Liquidity risk - the danger of not being able to deal without moving market
prices significantly - has grown due to a number of factors, the BIS says.
There is less capital devoted to market-making relative to the total capital
at risk in wholesale financial markets, for instance, meaning market-makers
can be swamped by one-way market movements.
This has been accentuated by the concentration of market share, which has
seen a small number of institutions with high credit ratings become the
biggest participants in each of the markets. Problems with any one of them
could spread across a number of markets simultaneously.
Growth in trading volumes has increased settlement risk. Some banks have
responded by spreading their dealings across a number of exchanges to reduce
their exposure to failure by a single clearing house, but the BIS concludes:
'There are limits to what individual participants can do to limit settlement
risk.'
Credit risks have become more difficult to assess thanks to 'deficiencies in
information regarding counterparties' off-balance sheet exposures and the
inseparability in many OTC derivative instruments of the size of potential
credit exposure and price developments.'
The report calls for better international netting systems and greater
financial disclosure to help reduce the risks, as well as greater attention
among banks and regulators to the exposures being created.

International Settlements, Basle.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALLING interest rates and an increasing emphasis on economic growth helped
to boost UK government bond prices last month, making the gilt-edged
securities market the top-performing government bond market in local
currency terms in October.
Gilts gained 5.59 per cent last month, and have risen by 17.27 per cent in
the year to date, according to figures compiled by J. P. Morgan.
The gilt market rallied on the combination of hopes of lower interest rates
following sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism,
the release of poor economic data, and the government's determination to
implement a strategy for growth. The base rate was cut from 10 per cent to 9
per cent on September 22, and by a further percentage point to 8 per cent on
October 16.
Spain, Denmark and the Ecu were the next best performing bond markets in
local currency terms, with gains of 5.12 per cent, 4.35 per cent and 4.16
per cent respectively.

FT  03 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Ireland makes SFr150m private placement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republic of Ireland's continuing foreign currency borrowing programme
provided the highlight of yesterday's international bonds activity.
Ireland made what should be its last appearance of the year in the Swiss
franc market with a SFr150m eight-year private placement through Swiss Bank
Corp, which says the 6 1/2 per cent coupon is broadly in line with the
republic's two other recent transactions in that market. These were for a
total of SFr250m over 10 years.
While Ireland's foreign currency reserves are thought to have survived the
recent currency dramas in better shape than those of many of its European
neighbours, the republic has also recently issued two 10-year bonds, raising
a total of DM500m over 10 years.
Two minor capped and collared deals dominated what US dollar activity there
was. Lehman Brothers announced a Dollars 100m 10-year floating rate note for
Credit Local de France, to take advantage of what it described as the demand
for discounted FRNs from top quality credits.
The interest rate will be set at 25 basis points below six-month Libor, with
a collar of 5 per cent and cap of 8 1/4 per cent. Credit Suisse First Boston
reopened a cap and collar 10-year FRN for Banque Nationale de Paris, issuing
a further Dollars 75m tranche. It was priced at 99.75, compared with par for
the original Dollars 150m in late September.
The spate of issues by Mexican borrowers continues with a Dollars 150m
five-year bond issue from Consorcio Grupo Dina, Mexico's largest truck
manufacturer. Salomon Brothers will price the issue today at a spread of
450-475 basis points over comparable US Treasury bonds and target the issue
at high yield accounts in Europe and the Far East.
While there is some criticism of this sector centring on the recent volume
of supply, bankers involved are arguing that institutional demand is growing
to reflect the broader Mexican corporate supply.
The growth in supply means that spreads are widening and that the buyers can
afford to be more discriminating, they say.

FT  03 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Bankers and brokers breach
crumbling walls - The link in the US between NationsBank and Dean Witter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST week's announcement that NationsBank and Dean Witter are joining forces
to run a securities brokerage firm is further evidence that the walls which
have divided the US banking and securities businesses for more than half a
century are crumbling.
Although by law the two industries are meant to be kept strictly apart, the
reality is quite different.
A handful of the country's most securely-capitalised banks, notably JP
Morgan and Bankers Trust, are allowed to underwrite and trade stocks and
bonds just like any Wall Street securities firm. Some of the biggest broking
houses and fund groups, such as Merrill Lynch and Fidelity, provide
individual investors with a variety of services that mirror those available
in banks. And many commercial banks offer mutual funds and other investment
products to their customers.
The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which enshrined the separateness of the
banking and securities businesses, is looking more and more redundant as
regulators, under pressure to promote competition in the financial services
industry, gradually allow banks and broking firms into each other's
territories.
NationsBank and Dean Witter have stepped into this evolving business
environment with gusto. NationsBank is one of the largest banks in the US,
and under the leadership of its ambitious chairman, Mr Hugh McColl, has
earned a reputation for bold and innovative expansion.
Dean Witter is also well respected within its industry. A large Wall Street
securities house with a strong presence in retail stockbroking and a highly
profitable credit card operation, Dean Witter is currently owned by the
nationwide retail group, Sears, Roebuck. Next year, however, it is due to be
sold to Sears' shareholders. The link with NationsBank can be seen in the
context of a company looking to develop new businesses in advance of its
independence. It was Dean Witter, after all, which approached NationsBank
with the idea in the first place.
The result of their union is Nations Securities, a firm that will be unlike
anything else seen in the US securities or banking industries. The new
operation's 400-strong army of brokers - half provided by NationsBank and
half by Dean Witter - will not be manning telephones from a smart new
headquarters in New York, or hustling stocks to individual investors through
a network of broking offices.
Instead, Nations Securities' brokers will be spread around hundreds of
NationsBank branches across the southern and south-western states, selling a
wide range of securities and investment products to regular bank customers.
There are plans ultimately to syndicate services to other banks in the US.
Like their counterparts in the securities industry, banks have been eager to
build fee income from asset management to act as a counterweight to the more
volatile earnings they make on their traditional business.
Banks, however, have another incentive. In the past two years they have
endured the sight of customers, unhappy with low yields on their bank
products, moving their cash into stocks, bonds and funds in search of higher
returns.
This outflow of funds has been caused by extremely low US interest rates,
and while at some stage in the medium term rates will doubtless come back
up, longer-term demographic trends spell further trouble for banks.
As a way round the problem the US banks have been trying to build up their
asset management business, selling their own families of mutual funds
through small securities subsidiaries. The strategy has had only a limited
success.
A key difficulty for banks has been a lack of experience in handling and
selling investment products. Ms Nancy Bush, analyst with Brown Brothers
Harriman in New York, says: 'It's very difficult to develop an
investment-oriented culture within a commercial bank.'
The link-up with Dean Witter should help solve that problem. The new
operation will be run outside the bank structure, which should make it
easier to create an environment suited to selling securities. There will
also be a lot of new products to sell to customers, including fixed-income
securities, municipal bonds, and individual stocks, as well as the large
family of funds managed by Dean Witter.
NationsBank has chosen in Dean Witter a firm with an extensive retail
network, a strong sales culture and well-established asset management
business. When asked what the bank gets from its new partner, Mr Dick
Stilley, director of corporate communications at NationsBank, says: 'We gain
more brokers, an infrastructure, a training programme and people who've been
in this business a very long time.'
NationsBank's chairman, Mr Hugh McColl, has already said he expects the
venture to move the bank forward about 10 or 20 years in the asset
management and securities broking business.
The main attraction for Dean Witter is the access it will have to
NationsBank's extensive customer base. Studies show that 80 per cent of bank
customers in the US do not own investment products, so there is plenty of
room for new growth.
This is not the first time Dean Witter has attempted to sell securities
products in an alien environment. The first, which involved the firm's
brokers manning kiosks in Sears, Roebuck stores, failed. The setting of a
bank branch, however, is much more conducive to the promotion of investment
products.
NationsBank has high hopes for the new venture. It expects the firm to break
even in 1993, and within five years it should be contributing Dollars 50m to
Dollars 60m to the bank's profits, which last year totalled Dollars 480m.
The bank's existing small securities subsidiary, NationsBank Securities,
will be merged into the new joint venture, which will be run by Mr Vincent
Walls, a senior vice-president from Dean Witter.
Analysts are sceptical that the link-up between NationsBank and Dean Witter
will lead to a rash of similar ventures between banks and broking houses.
The new company's first year will be watched closely by both banks and
securities firms, says Ms Bush. 'I think people are willing to let
NationsBank be something of a test case.'

FT  03 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Elkem rescue package planned
by Norway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S Industry Ministry hopes this week to unveil final details of a
proposed NKr1bn (Dollars 159m) rescue package for Elkem, the troubled light
metals group.
Elkem recently reported a 60 per cent increase in nine-month pre-tax losses,
after extraordinary items, to NKr307m and said its equity to debt ratio had
sunk to below 20 per cent from 22 per cent since January.
Elkem is in discussions with its two biggest shareholders, Saga Petroleum
and the Orkla foods group, and Den norske Bank and Fokus Bank to create a
package comprised of fresh equity capital, new loans and the postponement of
old debt.
Elkem is also expected to announce a rights issue to raise up to NKr500m of
which an estimated NKr135m would be guaranteed by the state and the balance
guaranteed by Saga and Orkla.
If the state is forced to supply NKr135m in fresh capital to Elkem, it would
then own an estimated 30 per cent stake in group.
Elkem is also expected to be allowed to postpone repayment of a NKr270m
state loan, due next year, which the group used to acquire a 45 per cent
stake in former state-owned Norsk Jern Holding.
Discussions centre on the possibility of writing down the value of Elkem's
shares by 50 per cent. In addition, Den norske Bank and Fokus Bank have been
asked to provide the group with a long-term loan of up to NKr500m, which
would cover Elkem's debt due next year.

BANCA Commerciale Italiana (BCI), one of Italy's leading banks, is launching
a Certificate of Deposit programme worth up to Dollars 1bn on the US market
in a further widening of its borrowing options.
The CDs, issued by BCI's New York branch, will be in either 'senior' or
'subordinated' form and can be in a variety of currencies.
Maturities on the paper, to be issued in either fixed or floating-rate form,
will be up to 30 years.
The latest deal resembles the highly flexible Dollars 750m Euro-depositary
receipt programme the bank inaugurated in March, which involved maturities
of between three months and 30 years and a variety of currencies.
The new transaction, organised by Merrill Lynch, has four leading US
investment banks as agents.

FT  03 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: NatWest buys Chicago broker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank has bought the Chicago-based futures and option
broker, Burns Fry Futures, after receiving approval from the US Federal
Reserve Board.
The move demonstrates the bank's 'commitment to the establishment of an
international futures and options clearing, execution, and broking service,'
said Mr Martin Owen, chief executive of NatWest Markets.
NatWest announced its intention to acquire Burns Fry Futures in July 1991.
Burns Fry, the Canadian securities firm, will retain a nominal interest in
the operation.
Burns Fry Futures, which was formerly owned by Security Pacific, will be
integrated into NatWest Futures.
The firm has a presence on the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. NatWest Financial Futures previously had no activities
in the US futures markets, but is active on a number of European and
Japanese exchanges.
'This is the first stage of a broad review of our futures strategy,' said Ms
Victoria Ward, who was hired from the London International Financial Futures
and Options Exchange at the start of the year with the brief of creating a
global strategy for NatWest's futures business.

FT  03 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Russia to copy UK regulatory
structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Andrei Kashevarov, head of the Commission for Russian Exchanges, has
decided to create a regulatory system based on the structure of the UK's
Securities and Investments Board.
A bill placing the development and control of all Russian exchanges under
the commission, responsible directly to the president, will be developed by
Financial Research Associates, an emerging markets consultancy, which is
helping the Russians build up their financial framework under a UK
government Know-how Fund programme.
The move was urgently needed 'to halt the slide of financial deregulation
towards organised crime on one hand and . . . to establish responsible
exchanges on the other,' said Mr Tim Lewin, managing director of FRA.
The draft bill is expected to go before the Russian parliament before the
end of the year.
There are currently 300 exchanges in Russia, but most will evolve into
markets for goods, while only a few will become commodity or financial
exchanges, according to Mr Lewin.
The decision to follow the British model was reached after a series of
meetings with the UK authorities during the International Organisation of
Securities Commissions' annual meeting in London last week. Mr Kashevarov
was accompanied by Mr Vitali Kulakovatras, a member of the Russian
parliament's committee for economic reform.
The regulatory structure 'will provide broad international standards of
regulation and a clear chain of command,' said Mr Kashevarov.
Spanish stockbroking firms' profits slumped in the first nine months of the
year, Reuter reports from Madrid. The Madrid stock exchange's 50 members
made a profit of Pta2.14bn (Dollars 19.5m) up to the end of September, down
82 per cent on the same period last year.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Personal View: The moment of truth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFFREY HOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister has made the situation clear. Wednesday is the time for
Britain to decide, clearly and unequivocally, whether it intends to ratify
the Maastricht treaty. He is right to put the question, on a substantive
motion, squarely before the House of Commons.
At some point this moment of truth had to be faced. There is now no point in
delay  - unless the objective is to scupper Maastricht. If the intention is
to ratify the treaty, rather than find a pretext to bury it, the time to act
is now. The longer the decision of principle was left, the more the
government's opponents would scent blood. They would view deferral as
victory in disguise.
Both the Labour opposition and the Tory dissidents have claimed until now
that it 'makes sense' to wait for Denmark to make its decision on the
treaty. Their argument has been that (as indeed the government came
perilously close to conceding over the summer) Copenhagen's intentions
should be settled before the Commons resumes work on a bill which might be
unnecessary. Why have a Tory punch-up today over a treaty which could sink
under its own weight into the Baltic Sea tomorrow?
These arguments have always been specious. What the 'after you' school of
Euro-diplomacy is really saying is that it would be very happy to see
Maastricht die.
For anyone to claim that there is no link between early UK ratification and
Maastricht's chances of coming into effect is in fact to engage either in
self-delusion or deception, or both. What incentive have the Danes to do a
deal unless they see that all other member states will ratify?
UK inertia distorts their choice. In Labour's case, cloudy logic is
motivated by the pursuit of unprincipled party advantage. In the case of the
Tory Euro-phobes, the refusal to admit the link is much more calculated. It
is a cynical deception designed to disable the government and impose a
minority view. Thank goodness the government has seen the dangers of that
route.
The same disingenuousness now reappears; so the claim that a deal on
subsidiarity must be settled before the Maastricht bill can proceed. How
could the British presidency of the European Community act as honest broker
in Edinburgh on this or any other issue if the Commons declined to discuss
the treaty, let alone if it voted against it?
Letting things slide might help the government in the short term, but it
would leave Britain as the one clearly seen to have pulled the plug on
further progress. That would deliver another big blow, after the ERM
retreat, to British credibility and influence in Europe. The government
clearly understands the risk and is not prepared to run it.
The case for an early Yes vote by the Commons thus comes back to the
treaty's substance. Why do we want Maastricht at all? The answer is we want
it for positive and negative reasons which the public debate so far has
scarcely addressed, distracted by the media obsession with party and
parliamentary tactics.
Positively, Britain knows that its standing in the world is greatly enhanced
by effective membership of a strong European Community. It wants a common
foreign and security policy, on the right kind of terms set out in the
Maastricht treaty. It believes in closer co-operation in justice and home
affairs. It favours more democratic legitimacy and better control of EC
administrative structures.
Britain also likes the flexibility offered by more moves towards
intergovernmental decision-making, but accepts the rationale for binding law
decided by majority vote in respect of the single market. As any continental
politician will testify, the final treaty design owes much to the UK. We
have nothing about which to be ashamed or defensive.
More negatively, we have much to fear from Maastricht's demise. The treaty
keeps firmly alive the notion of the EC developing 'as 12'. It makes less,
not more, likely a fast-track, inner-core move by Germany and France to form
their own monetary and political union, with Benelux in tow. For Denmark,
too, it should be seen as a last chance to save the power of the smaller
countries in a system which, almost by chance, gives them disproportionate
influence.
Few people in Britain seem to have caught up with the speed with which the
anti-Maastricht forces have retreated in France since September 20. While
the French government may be boxed in by its farmers on the Gatt talks,
Paris is now proceeding on all other mainstream European issues as if
nothing had happened. France stared into the abyss and realised the absolute
necessity of re-cementing the Franco-German axis as the working motor of
Europe. That process is already back on track. In Bonn, similar conclusions
were drawn.
Britain's Euro-phobes need to understand the reality that follows from this.
Failure to ratify might mean the 'death' of Maastricht in a technical sense.
But it would certainly not kill the concept of closer - much closer  -
partnership between 10 (or five) of the other member states. Whatever the
technical difficulties, they would find a way of going ahead without us. And
that would be the real defeat.
The economic consequences for Britain would be disastrous. Last year,
Japan's then prime minister, Mr Toshi Kaifu, told me that he regarded the
country's link with Britain as 'the keystone of the arch of their
relationship with Europe'. However, last week a Japanese businessman bluntly
put to me a very different point of view: 'We are beginning to wonder
whether we were right to regard Britain as the gateway to Europe after all.'
It is not only Japan. In my native Wales, for example, 50 German companies
have chosen to invest. By 1995, Bosch alone will be employing 1,200 people.
How long would this kind of investment continue if Britain were to repudiate
a treaty that had been so precisely tailored to our needs?
Those Conservative MPs (and others) who dub Maastricht as a distraction from
the economic debate really must cast aside such inward-looking myopia.
Economic recovery and European policy are two sides of the same coin.
Failure to ratify Maastricht would be a truly massive economic as well as
political calamity  - for Britain, for Europe, and indeed the rest of the
world.
The Thatcherite dream of Britain miraculously evolving as a kind of north
European Switzerland convinces nobody beyond our shores. They would see us
wrapping ourselves in the Union Jack, in preparation for burial at sea.
John Major is right to regard the ratification of the treaty as an issue of
historic proportions. He knows that the case for sticking to his gun is
overwhelming. Any government which, having been ejected from the ERM, then
presided over Britain's wilful destruction of Maastricht (and that is how it
would be seen), could have no place at the heart of Europe. Mr Major knows
that Maastricht simply must be ratified  - for his sake, for the
government's sake, for our country's sake, for all our sakes. The time to
settle the question is now.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Letter: Energy policy must avoid being hostage to changing
fortune
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN POWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader 'In search of an energy policy' (October 29) is aptly
titled. It gets to the heart of the matter in its assertion that privatised
energy is preferable to a nationalised version provided it is linked to
effective, even permanent, regulation. Unfortunately there is, for
government, always a political risk in declaring policies which may become
hostages to fortune when circumstances alter.
The best we can hope for is some energy objectives that will stand fast in
the face of change. Maybe these should simply aim to achieve:
competitive energy prices, for UK industry and commerce, and affordable
warmth and comfort for people;
security, safety and diversity of sustainable energy supply; we must not
empty the earth's larder of natural resources nor damage our environment in
the process.
While energy objectives are entrusted to three independent regulators (OFT,
Offer, Ofgas) and to two government departments (of trade and industry and
of the environment), there is a worry that their separate actions will not
always harmonise. Energy inquiries now under way should consider the case
for more centralised and open scrutiny of the market forces on which energy
policy seems at present to be based.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Letter: An astonishingly antiquated view of the personnel
function
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PHILIP SADLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals company, has scrapped personnel as a
board-level post, and has made it a less senior position, according the the
October issue of Personnel Today. The departing personnel director, Peter
Hobbs, is reported as saying that the move is 'part of a general
down-grading of the personnel function'.
Mr Hobbs lays part of the blame for this on the influence of City analysts,
suggesting that, in the eyes of stockbrokers, the profile of a successful
company does not necessarily include a personnel director. His view was
partly confirmed by Hoare Govett pharmaceuticals analyst, Nigel Barnes, who
said that 'happy employees are important but personnel was not of primary
importance'.
It is astonishing in this day and age that an investment analyst in such a
reputable firm is still holding on to the antiquated idea that the personnel
function is concerned with happiness. What he (and the Wellcome board) needs
to understand is that in a knowledge-intensive industry such as
pharmaceuticals the personnel or human resource strategy is central to the
business strategy.
The task of the HR function is to contribute to the achievement of a
sustainable competitive advantage by means of superiority in such fields as
recruitment, selection, training and development, performance management,
motivation, organisation design and, above all, the development of a
corporate culture which nurtures talent and encourages creativity.
This fact is recognised very clearly by such overseas competitors of
Wellcome as Merck, which has a very strong HR function. Barnes says that
'when we are assessing the value of the company, the most important thing is
the products'. He fails to perceive that in a pharmaceutical or other
knowledge intensive industry the people are the product. Where does he think
new drugs come from if not from highly committed, highly creative people?
Incidentally, the same issue of Personnel Today comments that 'some of the
500 employees who committed themselves to achieving Investors in People
status at its launch a year ago are making little progress towards the
award'. I am not surprised.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'One cheer for the chancellor' (October 30), affirms the
chancellor's right to insist on the maintenance of economically valuable
capital spending in a recession. However, not all capital projects currently
vying for support fall into this category. One notable example is London's
Jubilee line, which has a negative return measured on a cost benefit basis.
The credibility of the government's economic policy is to be judged by its
willingness to reject such cases despite impassioned lobbying.

Sir, I am obliged to Mr John Richards for his enlightenment as to the
enormous cost of bank cashiers (Letters, October 31). As an experiment I
switched on a timer unit and asked my wife to hand me a Pounds 10 note over
my desk. I opened a desk drawer, counted out Pounds 10 in coins and handed
them to her.
This operation took 15 seconds; so allow five seconds wasted time per

FT  03 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Around the UK houses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF AN ENGLISHMAN'S home is his castle, then an ever increasing number of
British citizens have found their castles are built on sandy foundations.
The downward spiral in house prices helps explain why confidence remains
depressed and economic recovery elusive. Yet the government must not bow to
the clamour from mortgage lenders and the construction industry by adopting
one of the schemes intended to bail out indebted consumers. Government
action should be more selective.
The building societies and banks have rarely been slow to offer advice. In
the mid- and late 1980s they advised many young first-time buyers to take
advantage of the government's misguided tax breaks to buy houses with hefty
mortgages. In so doing they helped raise the proportion of owner-occupying
households to high levels by international standards, while pushing house
prices and consumer debts to high levels by historical standards.
The housing bubble has since burst. Average house prices have fallen by 27
per cent in real terms since July 1989 and by an unprecedented 12 per cent
in nominal terms. A million or more homeowners have found themselves owing
more in mortgage debt than the depleted value of their homes; almost 200,000
homes have been repossessed; the building societies have quadrupled their
bad debt provisions over the past four years; and housing market
transactions have dried up.
Clear interest
The building societies and banks are now offering yet more advice. Abolish
stamp duty on housing market transactions and raise mortgage tax relief
either for first-time buyers or all mortgage holders, cry some; offer a tax
credit of up to Pounds 10,000 to people selling their homes to cover any
loss of value, say others. Their interest is clear: while, in the early
stages of the property collapse, the losses were borne by the insurance
industry, prices have now fallen so far that this cover for their mistakes
has run out.
The government should be wary of these schemes. They are invariably designed
to ease the pressure on indebted consumers by preventing house prices from
falling further. The aim is to minimise negative equity and keep bad debts
off the banks and building society books. Yet the UK does not need a
recovery now which is bought at the price of economic distortion in the
future. The rise in UK home ownership over the past decade represents just
such a distortion. It resulted in a less mobile and more debt-ridden
society. The thrust of UK housing policy in recent years has rightly been to
reduce the tax incentives for house purchase, while increasing the
incentives for the rental sector to expand.
Sensible step
The government is right to search for ways to revive housing market activity
in order to encourage mobility. Its recent decision to increase the amount
of unsecured borrowing that borrowers with negative equity can take on was a
sensible step. It should also try to remove the remaining obstacles to sales
of repossessed homes by banks and building societies to housing associations
for rental purposes.
Yet first-time buyers will only return to the market in quantities when
house prices are seen to be really cheap. That may well require further
declines. Relative to average earnings, house prices remain quite high by
historical standards. But a further fall in house prices risks deepening the
fears of indebted homeowners, while raising the burden of bad debts on
balance sheets.
The government can ease the burden of servicing those debts through a
further reduction in interest rates. If the balance sheet problems of the
lenders remain a serious constraint on new business lending, then the
government may, as a last resort, need to investigate ways in which their
balance sheets can be cleansed of bad debts.
The government should not bail out indebted consumers, either via inflation
or tax hand-outs. Schemes which offer more tax relief to indebted homeowners
will only increase the incentive to invest in housing while encouraging the
myth that a housing investment is a one-way bet. A balanced recovery would
enable indebted consumers to repay their debts the hard way.

FT  03 NOV 92 / High cost of a cleaner Europe: Environment policy is facing
funding constraints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Europe's environment policy, one of Brussels's most popular achievements, is
coming under fire from many directions. Britain's water companies have
criticised stringent and expensive directives on the standard of water;
several governments complain that the Commission is failing to enforce the
same standards throughout the Community; farmers in south-west France are
furious about a Brussels threat to ban even the shooting of crows.
The criticisms come against a background of national unease about Brussels's
influence on Europe's day-to-day life. They threaten to undermine the EC's
ability to tackle environmental problems and, by creating unequal
environmental costs, to undermine the workings of the single market.
The present difficulties follow a period of unprecedented environmental
regulation. In the past two decades the Commission's environmental
directorate, known as DG-11, has issued some 200 directives on everything
from filtering factory smoke and protecting wild birds to muffling
lawnmowers.
The case for a strong European environmental policy has won support from
both the public and governments. In areas such as water quality, people have
not trusted their governments to set adequate standards. In other areas,
such as acid rain, governments have turned to Brussels to bring each other
into line. 'It is a bit like disarmament inspections - where countries have
little confidence in each other's role, the Commission has a legitimate
role,' says Mr Ken Collins, member of the European Parliament and chairman
of its environment committee.
But while the need for a European environmental policy is broadly accepted,
time is running out if Brussels wants to be taken seriously. The Commission
and the EC member countries are jeopardising the most valuable parts of
their huge legislative effort by over-enthusiasm, and by their failure to
enforce the rules, or even to discover that they are being broken. The
charge against EC policy by governments, industry and some rival Brussels
directorates  - is that it has been naive and over-ambitious, backing many
rules that should not have been passed, which many EC members now cannot
afford to meet.
Criticism of Brussels's record has increased as part of the debate about
subsidiarity  - the extent to which decisions should be taken at a local
level rather than by the EC. Moreover, the full costs of meeting some of the
directives are only just becoming clear, and have stimulated complaints.
Governments, faced with footing large clean-up bills during economic
recession, have noticed that some of their neighbours have not complied with
the rules, and are asking: 'Why should we?'
Several charges against EC policy are well-founded  - the 1980 drinking
water standards directives could head the list. Though they have performed a
service by ruling that lead, pesticides, nitrates and bacteria are
undesirable in drinking water, they insist that every trace of most of these
elements is removed, even though health risks from tiny concentrations are
unproven. The rules have been coupled with others which improve water colour
but do not affect its safety. Water companies have protested that, while the
cost of 'the last few steps towards perfection' is huge, the benefits are
far from clear.
Mr Karel van Miert, EC environmental commissioner, acknowledges that
environmental policy has not been determined by scrutiny of costs and
benefits. 'We have certainly saved lives and prevented sickness but I am not
tempted to try and guess how much.'
Mr Grant Lawrence, an adviser to Mr van Miert, argues too that not all
environmental issues lend themselves to cost-benefit analysis. 'It is very
hard to calculate the benefit side of the equation. One can point to tourism
revenue and to reduced healthcare costs but in the end you can't put a price
on a clean beach.'
The result of the EC's hectic activity is a hefty bill for member countries,
much of it still to be paid. According to the Commission's latest figures,
annual environmental spending, apart from on the nuclear power industry and
water, has grown to about Ecu45bn (Pounds 38bn). The Commission has no firm
estimates of the cost of the water directives, but they could raise
considerably the total bill, judging by the UK water companies' Pounds 45bn
investment programme, nearly half of it needed to meet EC rules.
Some Mediterranean countries are saying, in effect: 'We would comply but we
can't afford to.' Mr van Miert acknowledges that 'it would be irresponsible
not to accept that there are difficulties with financing'.
Although he concedes that 'perhaps we have been over-ambitious', he points
out that ultimate responsibility for meeting the cost of the directives lies
with national governments, and that all but three were passed unanimously by
the 12 EC member countries.
The high cost of some early directives can partly be attributed to the
enthusiasm and political ambition of national environment ministers  - there
are few votes in negotiating looser standards. In part, too, it follows from
the optimism of the poorer EC countries that the richer ones would help them
foot the bill. In the case of the 1975 bathing water directive, according to
Mr Lawrence, 'there was a lack of attention to costs because countries had
10 years to comply'.
Lack of money is one reason why present compliance is so patchy. The highest
standards are usually found in Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany, while
the bottom band includes poorer countries such as Greece, Spain, Portugal
and sometimes Italy.
But the Commission's biggest handicap in enforcing its rules is ignorance.
Although environmentalists are fond of accusing countries of being 'the
dirty man of Europe', there are no figures to substantiate the accusation.
The Commission claims that countries have 'transposed' 85 per cent of its
directives into national law, although it says: 'The delays in Italy
(transposition of only 59 per cent) and Greece (76 per cent) continue to
give cause for concern.' But it has no comprehensive figures on whether
countries then enforce the laws. It believes that the two laws which are
infringed most frequently are the requirement to investigate the
environmental impact of building projects and to designate special
protection areas for wildlife.
The Commission has at some point started legal action against all EC member
countries for failure to curb water pollution. In the past five years 67
cases  - many of them concerning water standards  - have been referred to
the European Court of Justice. In all but a few cases the Court has found in
the Commission's favour. But such action can only follow complaints from the
public, and it tends to reflect public awareness rather than the number of
infringements.
There is no easy solution to the problem of compliance, but repealing
directives and leaving environmental standards to national discretion is
unlikely to be the answer. In response to the mounting criticism from EC
countries, Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, suggested ripping up
nearly two dozen EC directives in the name of subsidiarity, including those
on bathing and drinking water.
Since then, Mr Delors appears to have backtracked on this view and Mr van
Miert, who is adamant that standards should not be lowered, argues that 'it
would be politically impossible'. He says: 'The member states that complied
a long time ago such as the Dutch and the Danes would object.'
Instead, the answer to enforcing EC standards almost certainly means
bringing the question of costs into the open. Northern European countries
will have to decide whether to accept the burden of helping southern ones
meet the rules, and if not, to force discussion on which directives should
have priority.
None of these debates can start without better information on compliance. Mr
van Miert says: 'Most countries simply won't buy the idea of green
policemen'  - a UK proposal for a European inspectorate which would send its
own officials to monitor pollution. But EC members have reached a broad
consensus for a European Environment Agency which would have the right to
demand information from national regulatory authorities.
However, the creation of the agency has been delayed by a dispute about its
location, itself part of a wider tussle over the future location of EC
organisations.
Despite the problems of cost and enforcement the outlook for the EC's
environmental policy is not uniformly grim. Some change is already under
way, with a more realistic breed of bureaucrat replacing the environmental
missionaries. This trend is exemplified by the succession of Mr van Miert in
July to the colourful Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, described by one official as
an 'irritant' to Mr Delors.
The directorate has also begun speaking the language of economics and of the
other Brussels directorates  - adopting 'cost-benefit analysis' as a new
buzzword. It is looking at financial instruments such as taxes rather than
regulation as a way of achieving policy objectives.
Mr Ranieri di Carpegna, director of financial instruments and international
affairs at DG-11 and one of the new breed of realists, says: 'The advantage
of a tax is that the costs are transparent, although that makes it
politically unpopular. There is also no problem with enforcing it. The
regulatory approach is costly, too, but no one is aware of that at the
time.'
Mr di Carpegna is one of the architects of EC proposals for taxes on energy,
carbon emissions and on vehicles to help reduce the risk of global warming,
arguably more important than some of the issues championed in the past. The
costs are undeniably great: in its November 1991 report DG-11 estimated that
the proposed energy tax would cut 0.25 per cent off EC real GDP growth in
the second and third years after introduction, and 0.07 per cent over the
first 13 years. But realism at this stage increases the likelihood that if
countries adopt a tax they will adhere to their commitment.
Such commitments and the fact that EC countries made environmental policies
an important part of both the Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty
show that they take it seriously. The next few years will show whether they
take it seriously enough to enforce it and pay for it.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Leading Article: The devil they know
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS make-up-your-mind time for the American people. They are finding it
difficult. A small minority will avoid the issue by plumping for Mr Ross
Perot, who has no chance of winning. For most voters, however, the hard
choice lies between President George Bush, the devil they know, and the
still relatively unknown Governor Bill Clinton. Four more years of the
former would differ from the past four years only if Mr Bush achieves
effectiveness in domestic affairs. The outstanding characteristic of Mr
Clinton is that no one can be certain of how he would behave in the White
House.
The principal distinguishing feature of a Clinton presidency is that it
would be activist. The notion that government in general and the US federal
government in particular should get itself involved in the revitalisation of
the US has been predominant in the challenger's campaign. This is a promise
 - some might say a threat  - that Mr Clinton would be well-placed to make
good. If he becomes president he will be supported by a Democratic Congress.
He will be able to get bills through. There would be an end to the
'gridlock' that has so stymied the efforts of the Republican President Bush.
This has made it difficult for Mr Bush to get a fiscally prudent budget
agreed, but the disadvantage is not all one way. The president is by
inclination a minimalist; he wishes to reduce the role of the federal
government. He has vetoed damaging interventionist bills originating in
Congress. The danger is that a Clinton administration would do too much, and
veto too little.
Budget deficit
Neither contender has a convincing programme for reducing the budget
deficit. President Bush has once again taken the pledge against increased
taxation. To renege twice would be careless. His proposals to cap social
spending, such as on healthcare, are unconvincing. Governor Clinton's health
reforms and reconstruction plans for the city centres can only be expensive.
He would increase taxes on higher incomes, but that alone would be
insufficient to reduce the overall deficit. Yet his underlying message is
not that of a 'tax-and-spend liberal'. His proposed welfare reforms and his
attack on the health industry's earnings sound tough. He has exercised tight
control of the Arkansas administration.
There is a clear choice on the environment. President Bush has led his
government in a crusade against global green policies, as shown by the US
stance at the Rio conference. Mr Clinton speaks of a more positive approach,
and the enthusiasm of his running-mate, Senator Al Gore, is well-known. It
may be assumed that under a Clinton presidency the US would become a
positively inclined leader of international efforts to reduce future global
warming. As to domestic pollution, US voters have to decide whether to vote
for or against more extensive environmental regulation.
Trade and security
On matters of trade and security the differences are finely drawn, but not
insignificant. President Bush rightly promoted the North American Free Trade
Area and has tried to salvage the Uruguay Round. Some of Mr Clinton's
advisers have protectionist instincts; the Democratic challenger has
prevaricated over Nafta. The spirit of aggressive mercantilism stalks the
Democratic party. It would be one of Mr Clinton's most important, most
difficult and most unpopular battles to keep it at bay.
The populist side of Governor Clinton also proposes to increase taxation of
foreign-owned companies, although it is difficult to see how this squares
with his experience of encouraging inward investment in Arkansas. Foreigners
do not vote, except with their feet.
In foreign affairs, there is usually a strong line of continuity in
Washington but, compared with the president, Mr Clinton is pro-Israeli,
overtly tougher on human rights in China, more supportive of Russian reform,
and likely to cut US forces in western Europe more sharply, and sooner.
From the outside world's point of view neither candidate seems like a
potential Roosevelt, Truman or Eisenhower. The choice is between two
professional politicians, neither with a wholly coherent programme. Clinton
offers vigour, Bush continuity. It may not be an exciting choice, but nor is
it a dangerous one.

The leader of Britain's Labour party, Mr John Smith, would do well to study
the presidential campaign conducted by Governor Bill Clinton, rather than
play silly buffers over the Maastricht vote tomorrow night. Even if there is
an upset today and President Bush wins a second term, there is much that
Labour can learn from the Democrats.
It will be objected that the two countries are so different that there is no
great value in comparative studies. Anyhow, it might be said, let Mr Clinton
win first, and then ask how he did it - if he does. The first lesson for
Labour is the opposite. Mr Smith will be haunted if Mr Clinton loses. If a
failure to topple the Tories in mid-recession in April is followed by a
failure to dislodge Mr Bush at a time of high unemployment in November then
parties of the democratic left will have to ask themselves whether any
formula can bring them victory.
Such questioning would be less painful on the other side of the Atlantic
than over here. The presidency is merely the most prominent of the many
political posts open to the Democrats. They tend to win more than their fair
share of the rest, including both houses of Congress, a majority of state
governorships, places in state assemblies, and city mayoralties.
Labour may sigh over this. Politics would be richer if the UK were a
federation and if the Conservatives had not set out to bury local
government. But they have to operate in the world as it is. In that world -
the real one - there is only one British prize worth having. Mr Smith either
becomes prime minister in, say, 1996, or he hardly becomes a footnote in
history.
He should therefore be devoting all his energies, and his intellect, to a
study of how to get his hands on the keys to Number 10 Downing Street. What
he should not be doing is compromising his personal reputation for
consistency by opposing the government on a vote to proceed with debate on
the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty - and then wrapping up the decision
in specious excuses about its being a vote of confidence. Mr Clinton could
tell him a thing or two about blurring a track record for straight dealing.
The temptation for Labour is to see the government's present embarrassment
as a chance to score points. This distracts it from what should be a
single-minded pursuit of eventual office. Some in the party fantasise about
bringing the government down now. Such an absurd proposition is not worth
pursuing. Others think it would be good fun to overthrow the prime minister.
The most likely result of that would be the election of Mr Kenneth Clarke,
who after a year or two would be the beneficiary of the end of the recession
and thus a probable contender for the honour of scoring the fifth successive
Tory election victory in a row.
Labour will stand the best chance if it plays a long game. That is what the
Clinton Democrats have done, partly through the Democratic Leadership
Conference, a right-inclined grouping of southern governors and other
elected representatives. The conference has captured the party. It has
worked through sympathetic think-tanks to position it more towards the
centre of US politics. It has abandoned the unteachable left.
Under Mr Neil Kinnock Labour did half of much the same thing, even down to
promoting the establishment of the Institute for Public Policy Research. Mr
Kinnock's efforts did not bear fruit. Labour was still seen in April as its
old self, the Woolworths of political choices in a country increasingly
aspiring to buying its goods at Marks and Spencer. His changes did not reach
into the soul of his party. Voters understood that. Mistrust of Labour's
true motives defeated it.
Mr Clinton, a proponent of workfare, has deliberately pitched both his
politics and his rhetoric to the Reagan Democrats (for which read Britain's
famous Thatcherite skilled working classes). He has sought votes among the
middle classes and in the suburbs, territory that is still largely alien to
Labour. The governor has employed a southern strategy; Labour's only hope of
real progress in the south of England is an agreement with the Liberal
Democrats. Mr Clinton has focused his proposals to increase income taxes on
families with incomes greater than Dollars 200,000, far above the level
proposed by Labour in April. Labour's April image was subliminally to the
left of its slick packaging; Mr Clinton makes you feel that his
administration might be a workable alternative management of a capitalist
system in which Democrats truly believe.
The former Labour leader understood that this was what had to be done, but
he was unable to make more than superficial progress. The task for Mr Smith
is to reconstruct his party, and its way of thinking, from the guts
outwards. Nothing he has done as leader so far suggests that he is doing
this. If the consequence is a Labour party that never returns to office,
that will be what it deserves.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Arts: The best and worst sides of a sophisticated artist /
Review of the work of Bill Jacklin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commanding the long principle axis at Marlborough Fine Art and the visitor's
immediate attention is a new painting by Bill Jacklin, some 8 feet by 6.5,
of an American mounted policeman on a rearing horse. It is a standard image
in the long and splendid tradition of the grand equestrian portrait that, in
painting, goes back through Goya and Velasquez to Titian and the high
Renaissance and in sculpture, right back to the roots of Western art in
ancient Greece. The noble beast rears and frets: the rider holds hard to
keep control. All is contained, sprung, expressive energy - or should be.
Here we must hold hard ourselves, for this is not only a serious attempt at
a serious subject, but as seriously bad in the result as it is possible for
a painting to be. It is no bad thing for an artist to take on such a subject
in the grand manner and, here, the idea to bring the convention up to date
and take the policeman as our modern condottiere, is rather good. But if the
ambition is admirable, the dangers are obvious. To invite the comparison
with the great masters is, well, to invite the comparison.
The trouble is that Jacklin all too evidently does not know what the horse
is - how it moves, how it is ridden, what it looks like. Certainly he has
not worked to find out by any careful study and exact observation. Rather it
is as though the idea itself were enough and the expressive reference all
that were needed. And what is not known by the artist is, quite simply, left
out. The near-fore protrudes arbitrarily from a mysterious dark-brown void
in the animal's side: the hind legs are fused and lost together in a brown
mist: the rider, dwarfed by his mount yet immensely long in his lower leg,
sits impossibly deep in the pit of its back.
It is too easy to find specific fault, and I have no wish to dwell on the
single work. But, given such manifest inadequacy in the description and
realisation of what this particular work proposes, it is natural to visit
the rest of the work, at Oxford as in London, with more exacting a scrutiny
than might otherwise have been the case. And here an important distinction
must be drawn, for it now becomes clear that Jacklin's work, in this his
American phase, falls into two camps, not opposed exactly, but markedly
different.
He is now nearly 50 and has lived and worked in New York since 1985. There
he has found his subject-matter, not just in the obvious imagery of
Manhattan which forms the generalised back-drop to his work, but in the
street life of the city and, latterly, the beach life of Coney Island. In
particular he has made the crowd itself his subject, seen on the one hand at
a distance and often from a great height - the street parade, the
demonstration, the riot, the ant-like swarm of commuters, bathers, skaters:
on the other, the closer view of the constant human traffic of the sidewalk,
round the cafe table or the chess-board in the open air.
Within this broad scope, either he settles upon an image of flux and
movement, often generalised and simplified to a point of near-abstraction,
or attempts the grandiose and monumental, the figures local and individual,
the scene clearly set and characterised. And it is always with this second
sort that he gets into difficulties. That rearing horse, pace Verocchio's
Colleoni, aspires nevertheless to the condition of the monumental. The vast
painting at Oxford, of the summer crowds sitting on the grass in Central
Park, looks to Seurat's 'Baignade' and 'la Grande Jatte', so simple and
statuesque in the sunshine.
But where Seurat resolves even the simplest of his figures to a convincing
sculptural presence, securely placed and registered within the worked space
and perspectives of the pictorial convention, Jacklin, in this mode, leaves
only questions. His figures are but shadows, mere ciphers on the painted
surface, and when he seeks more close a description, the drawing is crude
and weak, the detail fudged, the anatomy highly improbable. In short, in
working the figure in this way, singly and collectively, he cannot sustain
what he sets out to achieve - and he sets out to achieve so much.
The irony is that, in his other mode, in attempting less and being so much
less self-conscious in the doing, he achieves so much more. The skaters
whizzing round the rink, or the bathers running into the sea, are shadows
still, but more freely worked and positively abstracted. It is not so much
that the expectation of them is less, but that their formal function, active
elements within the broader activity of the painting and the monoprint, is
so very different. With them, the unself-conscious commitment to the
expressive image and gesture is all, and it is their salvation.
These two exhibitions present us, therefore, with something of a mystery,
for they show us a sophisticated, prolific and dedicated artist at his best
and worst together. The mystery is that he himself does not see the
difference, which lies not in the expressive scope, or scale, or pictorial
ambition of the work, let alone its particular content, but in something
more fundamental. There, on the one hand, is the naive assumption that the
self-conscious importance of the attempt is of itself the guarantee of
success. On the other there is the proper modesty of the artist losing
himself in the practical engagement with his work and the ideas that grow
out of it. Wherever Jacklin begins to forget himself, intrigued by the
abstracted movement of a mass of people, or in the close drawing of a girl's
head, the work is transformed. The Coney Island monoprints, free,
adventurous and unself-conscious, are as good as anything he has done.

Miles Davis is now a trademark owned by the estate of Miles Davis. Since the
trumpet player's death a year ago the tributes have poured forth. This one,
touring for the last five months, faithfully revisits one of his most
synergic small groups.
The 1963 quintet of Herbie Hancock (piano), Ron Carter (bass), Tony Williams
(drums) and Wayne Shorter (saxes) combined the liberated talents of young
men heading for freer ground with an older leader distilling the essence of
ballads and standards. Even then Davis said he knew they were on to
something different: 'Tony was the fire, the creative spark; Wayne was the
idea person, the conceptualiser . . . and Ron and Herbie were the anchors. I
was just the leader who put us all together.'
Last week at the Royal Albert Hall, with Dave Holland standing in for Ron
Carter, they brought it all back - from buoyant takes of 'Footprints' and
'So What?' via the poignant melancholy of 'Kind of Blue' to a dismembered
version of 'Straight, No Chaser'. The old sound came together around Tony
Williams' focus of thick rhythm and Hancock's anchoring chords, Shorter
stepping up to exchange flurries with young Wallace Roney, Davis's shadow.
The re-united quintet of the 1970s employed Freddie Hubbard to handle
Davis's parts.
Curiously though, the band is less about Roney or Davis than the interaction
of the others in this famous setting. Showers of silvery chords from Hancock
were tied to the rolling thunder of Williams' complex time work. Britisher
Dave Holland swung easily into Carter's shoes, resonant solos emerging from
strict accompaniment.
Some song and soul temporarily dispersed the economic gloom of Canary Wharf
over the weekend in the shape of the sixth Docklands Jazz Festival. The
Cabot Hall's stage with a shiny expanse of illuminated office glass for a
backdrop, is a curious setting for the rural tones of South African pianist
Abdullah Ibrahim. But Ibrahim somehow fitted. Buttoned up head to toe in
black, he walked across the cityscape to the grand carrying an attache case
in one hand and a burning joss stick in the other.
In the first of two extended pieces, Ibrahim set a wistful and sombre tone
with a lyric which invoked images of Namibia and later summoned the memory
of John Coltrane. But the half spoken words detracted from the message of
otherwise evocative projection and put me in mind of a more worldly Peter
Skellern.
It didn't last though and Ibrahim was soon painting a bigger canvas. African
tinged melodies rolled out of moody bass lines and were dismantled for more
Western ideas and a final return to the Namibia refrain. As his joss stick
burnt low, melancholy voices gave way to a more optimistic sound and a
stirring hymnal close.

Is it really 15 years since Robert Lindsay gave his best television
performance as Wolfie in Citizen Smith? It really is. BBC1 is repeating the
series (8.00) in which Lindsay plays the Che Guevara of Sarf London,
complete with beret. In today's episode the Spanish comrades offer to bring
their guns and help Wolfie overwhelm Tooting.
This year's winner of The Turner Prize will be announced in three weeks.
Today's Without Walls (9.00 C4) provides profiles of the four artists on the
shortlist: Grenville Davey, David Tremlett, Alison Wilding and Damien Hirst.
BBC1 begins a further run of Kinsey (9.30) with Leigh Lawson playing the
charming lawyer with a chaotic private life. It sounds as though Jack
Rosenthal is back in his strongest suit with Bye Bye Baby (10.00 C4). At a
naval base in the mid-1950s a young Jewish man is celebrating the final
night of his national service, listening for the call sign of a Russian ship
and day-dreaming about Marilyn Monroe ...
At First Tuesday they thought that what we really needed most was another
programme about the prison service (10.40 ITV).

FT  03 NOV 92 / Arts: Blood Wedding - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Much effort, practically purposeful and precise, has gone into the premiere
production of Blood Wedding, a Lorca opera by Nicola LeFanu and her
librettist Deborah Levy. It was commissioned by the Women's Playhouse Trust,
whose director, Jules Wright, is also the opera's producer. A good deal of
determined money-gathering preceded the event - one admires the canny sense
of priorities, all the more since it has enabled the opera to be staged with
a lavishness unthinkable in most similar cases.
The choice of theatre for the two-week run is also imaginative: the Jacob
Street Studios, adjacent to to Tower Bridge, and normally a film studio
whose vast arena has been transformed into an opera theatre. Fotini Dimou
and the fashion designer Nicole Farhi are responsible for sets and costumes
of, again, extraordinary sophistication for a new opera - at times Lorca's
village appears to have been taken over by fashion-freaks from South Moulton
Street, but the glam effect is certainly a contrast to the familiar fringe
scratch-and-scrabble. A good small orchestra is conducted by Anne Manson;
the capable cast, though light on voices of pleasing tone (apart from
Quentin Hayes's rich-grained baritone as Leonardo), is led by Lynne Davies,
Annemarie Sand, Cynthia Buchan and the countertenor Nicholas Clapton.
The work itself has been offered a better-than-usual chance of arguing its
merits. So if those merits fails to come across, if Blood Wedding
establishes itself instead - as it did to me - as musically bloodless and
utterly devoid of genuine dramatic imagination, it seems fair not to lay
blame on the executants for this depressing state of affairs.
The issues that post hoc one wants to raise are rather different ones: who
on earth thought Blood Wedding - a play already so complete, and so
'musical', in its language and imagery - a good choice for operatic
adaptation in the first place? (I don't know Andras Szollosy's Lorca opera,
a big success at its 1964 Budapest premiere.) Did anyone test Levy's
libretto to see whether it could function as simple, easily explicable
narrative? (Without advance knowledge of the play I don't believe the
audience can have the faintest notion of the pre-curtain-rise blood-letting
or the actual method and moment of Leonardo's death.)
Did anyone warn LeFanu that the length of her two acts, and in particular
the agonisingly slow and unvaried pace of her second, would risk killing any
build-up of momentum? (The recourse to endless arty refrains and repeated
catchphrases gravely increases the risk.) Did anyone consider that some of
the 'effective' devices of the wedding scene, in particular the alternation
of pit sounds and those emitted by a wind-up gramophone, might lose their
savour when drawn out at such length? Did anyone suggest to the producer
that blank faces and demeanour are no help to dramatic involvement, and that
word-audibility in opera is not something to take for granted?
The pity is that there is a decent level of musicianly craftsmanship on
which it reposes (identifying instrumental lines plausibly assorted to
character and situation even if often modishly dated and secondhand, vocal
ranges and timbres knowledgeably deployed) - yet this accrues no theatrical
energy, because the craftsmanship itself seems so unrelated to the
germination of an original theatrical vision.
The musical language is the giveaway: melodramatic gesturing delivered in an
all-purpose 1960s music-theatre bang-crash, love scenes of synthetic lyrical
outpouring, and nothing in between to create any kind of fusion, cohesion or
dramatic framework for the events heard and seen. One wishes all new operas
well; one longs for them to succeed; but nothing is gained for the medium by
soft-soaping one's conviction that, for all its glossy trappings, this Blood
Wedding is anything other than a hopeless non-starter.
Jacob Street Studios, Mill Street, London SE1; performances until November 7

FT  03 NOV 92 / Arts: Two 'Mayerling's - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tragic circumstances surrounding the revival of Mayerling at Covent
Garden inevitably make us more conscious of this ballet's merits. In 1978,
freed from time-consuming duties as Director of the Royal Ballet, Kenneth
MacMillan celebrated his release with a work of larger scale and deeper
concerns than ever before. Seven years earlier, the full-length Anastasia
looked at the collapse of the Romanov dynasty through the eyes of the young
Grand Duchess, and focussed upon the matter of identity. In Mayerling we are
shown a corruption of the Archduke Rudolf's identity that helped destroy the
Hapsburg empire. And in doing this MacMillan brought off an astonishing
feat, by surrounding his central characterisation - the most densely wrought
and detailed male role created in this century's dance - with a series of
female portraits no less psychologically apt.
For MacMillan, Rudolf's womanising is a key to his tragedy, sprung from his
tormented relationship with his mother, exemplified by his brutality to his
wife, and illuminated by his ambiguous relationship with Larisch, a
mistress/procuress who is the only woman to comprehend his suffering. That
she is the agent to bring Mary Vetsera to him is the final, fatal touch to
their liaison. The fantasies central to Rudolf's psyche - love in death;
sado-masochistic passion - find their terrible reality at Mayerling. Yet
detailed as these female characters seem, they never over-balance the
ballet's central concern with Rudolf. We see how complex was the social and
emotional fabric of the tragedy, and how superbly MacMillan has given its
theatrical essence.
In the Royal Ballet performances this season, as in the past, we also see
the grand sensitivity of the troupe to the roles he gave them. Most of the
artists are making debuts, but the style and the power of playing by the
entire troupe is magnificent. In Thursday's revival, Irek Mukhamedov was a
Rudolf of entire truth. He understands the central anguish of the character,
and he has mastered the physical outlines and the searing movement that must
tell of that anguish. The reading was dark, tight in focus, everywhere
convincing, and some slight embellishments of steps are the choreographer's
tribute to Mukhamedov's technique. From Viviana Durante an excellently
judged Mary, conveying the sensuality just below the surface of social
manners, and from Lesley Collier a perfect Larisch - worldly, watchful, and
suddenly and touchingly gripped by her passion for Rudolf. Jane Burn, a
young dancer new to us, was Stephanie, Rudolf's hapless bride. Her reading
was delicate, urgently stated, if understandably careful as yet, but Sir
Kenneth admired her abilities and she will grow with further performance.
On Saturday afternoon, another new cast was headed by Michael Nunn's Rudolf.
Nunn - fine in The Judas Tree as the innocent young man - gave a performance
which combined physical elegance (beautiful line; lucid gesture) with an
ideal sensitivity. He played the crucial 'closet scene' with the Empress
Elizabeth superbly: kneeling, with her hands pressed to his head, he said
everything about the Rudolf who would behave with such frenzy as he goes to
his bride. A nervous impetuosity informs this reading - rightly so - and it
augurs brave things for the future.
In Gillian Revie, Nunn found a sensually vivid Mary: the dance was luscious,
emotion exactly judged between sexual opportunism and fantasy. There was
also a notably good Larisch from Genesia Rosato, and a completely understood
Stephanie from Natalie McCann - showing us every nuance of incomprehension,
distaste, and more than a hint of stuffiness. Company performance was
excellent: I admired Matthew Hart's buoyant, musical account of Bratfisch,
and Anthony Bourne's sensitivity in the same role; and also the bravura view
of Mitzi Caspar from both Darcey Bussell and Leanne Benjamin. In Mayerling
(as in so much of the MacMillan repertory) the Royal Ballet is seen as an
ensemble of expressive dancers without peer. It is a message worth
proclaiming.
Mayerling continues in repertory at Covent Garden.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Technology: Up in arms over downsizing - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER SLAVID
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Downsizing may have become the computer buzzword of the early 1990s, but
those corporate IT users who followed the trend could find they have made an
expensive mistake.
Downsizing implies the replacement of large and expensive mainframe systems
with networks of inexpensive personal computers driven by servers -
essentially powerful microcomputers.
Many were tempted away from the traditional mainframe by the new power of
the personal computer, and often for the wrong reasons. In the next few
years they may come to realise that centralised systems cost less in the
long run.
By 2000 there will be a strong trend towards upsizing, both because it will
be cheaper and because of the greater value that can be obtained from
centrally managed data.
Any downsized organisation looking for cost-effective solutions will
undoubtedly have to extract data from expensive PCs and Unix systems, and
dump it on to a parallel database server where it can be managed efficiently
and cheaply.
I would challenge anyone to dispute this point. It is a brave man who
assumes that because a solution is best or cheapest today it will still be
so in three years' time.
There are right and wrong reasons for downsizing. Restructuring your
business applications because it suits your business strategy is a sensible
thing to do. It will often prove to be more expensive to downsize, but that
should not deter people because if it meets the business need effectively it
will be worthwhile.
Unfortunately, the reality is often the other way round. People start to
downsize even though it does not fit their business strategy because they
believe it will be cheaper. In practice, it works out to be both more
expensive and disruptive to the business - the worst possible scenario.
Recent evidence reveals that this is true today for organisations with more
than 200 users. But in the longer term it will be true for all companies.
How can downsizing be more expensive? First, there is the long-term cost of
supporting distributed systems. These can be difficult to calculate, and too
easy to ignore. The time taken by secretaries doing systems administration
or PC housekeeping is rarely counted as part of the business case.
Second, there will be the need to run existing systems alongside the new
ones. Typically this is for two to three years, often longer.
Finally, there are costs imposed if you have forced a downsized solution on
to an inappropriate organisation structure. The costs of splitting databases
and redesigning systems are not trivial.
So after three years of redesign and restructuring - and three years of
paying double cost - you end up with a redesigned system that does not fit
your organisation structure.
That's when the industry announces new 'open corporate systems' at a price
performance that makes it cheaper to centralise. Already companies are
working on 'parallel' systems that will build big central systems out of
many cheap processor chips.
Unfortunately, the world is still full of misguided devotees of downsizing
who have sliced up their databases into illogical chunks in order to make it
work in a downsized environment. They are yet to discover the consequences.
Independent studies indicate that many big IT users still see downsizing as
the way forward. Five years ago 85 per cent of applications in management
information systems were performed on mainframes, compared with 67 per cent
today, according to the US periodical Service News. By 1995, the figure is
expected to fall to 50 per cent.
Downsizing may be cheaper this year, but it is just as likely to be more
expensive next year. So go back to basics - treat IT as a business issue,
not a technology issue.
The author is corporate systems business manager at ICL.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Technology: Hot under the collar - Andrew Baxter describes
how the wonders of the microwave oven are moving into the laundry room
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You only have to glance round a big supermarket to realise how microwave
ovens have transformed the convenience food industry over the past decade,
with whole ranges of tempting dishes created specially for heating in a few
minutes.
Until now, microwaves in the home have been restricted to ovens, but that
could be changing. The advent of microwave clothes-driers could spur similar
changes in the drying of clothes at home and in launderettes, in
dry-cleaning - and in clothes themselves.
In the past few weeks, the California-based Electric Power Research
Institute (Epri) has unveiled a prototype microwave clothes-drier that
promises to bring the benefits of microwave technology to the laundry room -
shorter drying times, improved energy efficiency and much reduced damage to
delicate fabrics.
It is early days yet, and one important techical problem remains unresolved,
but John Kesselring, senior project manager at Epri, sees 'exciting
possibilities' when microwave driers are launched on the domestic appliance
market. That could be by 1996, he says.
The availability of microwave driers, he says, could affect the clothing
market in ways that increase the driers' usefulness, as has happened with
microwave ovens. Clothes of delicate or woollen material that are now
dry-cleaned could be specially designed and marketed as suitable for
home-drying.
Long-term, this could have implications for the dry-cleaning industry, but
in the shorter term the developments at Epri are being watched most closely
by domestic appliance producers, which do not want to miss the boat on a
potential new product in a mature market.
'We have been very pro-active in looking at all types of energy,' says Fred
Stave, Whirlpool's director of technology development and application.
'Previously we've been very cautious about microwave driers, but technology
is marching on, and we must look at the possible applications very
carefully.'
Epri has been investigating the potential for microwave clothes-drying since
1990, picking up on earlier work in the appliance industry. The aim from the
outset was to find an entirely new approach which would eliminate some of
the inherent disadvantages of conventional tumble-driers, whether powered by
electricity or - as is common in the US - natural gas.
In standard driers, air is heated as hot as 3500F and blown into the drum,
which tumbles the clothes in arcs. The heat is transferred from the air to
the surface of the wet clothing. That evaporates the water and reduces the
air temperature in the drum, which then rises again during drying from 1100F
to 1600F.
Capillary action moves embedded water out to the fabric surfaces and
eventually heat must be conducted into the fabrics so that water can be
removed as steam. The result is that the fabrics are heated to about 1600F,
damaging the molecular structure of woollens and delicate fabrics, and
causing shrinkage.
The microwave drier uses the same magnetron tubes fitted in ovens to produce
beams of microwaves that heat up water molecules in wet clothing, causing
them to align and then reverse alignment as rapidly as 2.5bn times per
second.
This heat drives off the water. The fabric stays relatively cool, because
its molecular structure gives it a much lower dielectric loss coefficient -
a measure of how readily the material is heated by microwaves - than that of
water.
For delicate fabrics, Epri has been blowing cooling air into the microwave
drier, where temperatures have not generally exceeded 1100F - appropriate
for delicate fabrics. For normal loads, the shortest drying time could be
achieved by combining heated air with microwaves.
Since the middle of last year, Epri has been testing an experimental unit
built by two Californian companies, Thermo Energy and JG Microwave. Equipped
with eight 0.85kW magnetrons, the unit can supply 6.8kW of microwave power,
enough to dry a seven-pound load in about half the time required by a
conventional electric drier.
Overall the savings on time and energy are impressive, but are complicated
by the probability that any production machine would be a hybrid of
microwave and conventional drying. The reduction in drying times could range
from 25 to 60 per cent, says Kesselring, with the biggest gains in
coin-operated laundry equipment where users just want to 'finish and get
out'.
Energy efficiency could be increased by 25 per cent in residential driers,
and more in commercial equipment, he says. The cost of the drier would be
higher, not only because of the need for two technologies but because a
microwave clothes drier would require a shield to prevent microwave leakage.
Epri is now making 10 microwave driers for field-testing, but one problem
remains: as the moisture in clothes decreases through drying, the electrical
charge inside the drier rises, which can cause metal objects to heat up,
potentially scorching clothes or even causing a fire.
The hazard has been narrowed down to small, thin pieces of metal such as
pins and bin-liner or bread-wrapper ties and does not effect zippers or
large objects which take much longer to heat up.
Kesselring is confident that Epri has a solution, for which a patent is
pending. He admits, however, that this will 'make or break' the microwave
drier's ultimate commercial appeal. 'A lot of people have been looking at
ways to put different types of energy into domestic appliances,' Stave says.
'This one is clearly the closest to being viable.'

FT  03 NOV 92 / Technology: Printed circuit pioneer - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Paul Eisler, who died last week aged 85, was a prolific inventor whose major
technological innovation - the printed circuit - accelerated the development
of modern electronics. That he amassed neither great wealth nor fame as a
consequence of his ingenuity seems to have been a product both of his times
and of his somewhat nave and remote personality.
Financial reward was rarely at the forefront of his thoughts; he thought of
printed circuits primarily as his contribution to Britain's war effort. A
Viennese Jew, Eisler left Austria in 1936 ahead of the rising Nazi tide and
settled in England where he was to remain for the rest of his life.
His career, while busy and eventful, was also dogged by disappointment and
rejection although he betrayed few signs of bitterness in his 1989
autobiography.
Eisler's genius was both theoretical and practical; not only did he see that
the tangled mass of wires which characterised electrical circuits in the
first half of the century could be replaced by metallic tracks bonded to an
insulating layer, his experience in printing technology led him to develop a
manufacturing method, foil etching, which is still in use today. His work
led to miniaturisation, to the integrated circuit or silicon chip and, most
important, to the low-cost mass production of electronic circuitry.
He remembers showing a radio he constructed using one of the first printed
circuits to Plessey in 1936. The company rejected it on the grounds that it
would replace women on the production line.
Eisler reserved his animosity for bureaucrats who got in the way of
invention, harbouring special disgust for the National Research Development
Corporation, founded by the Labour government in 1949 to commercialise the
products of publicly funded research.
'The treatment which my inventions received from the NRDC has made me wonder
again and again why this organisation has been so grossly inefficient in
doing the job for which Parliament had created it,' he wrote, concluding
that political games sapped the energies of its officers so they could not
deal sensibly with inventors and inventions.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Regulating the Markets (Views from the UK and US): America's
power to protect - The SEC chief really runs the show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The strength and breadth of influence of the US Securities and Exchange
Commission far exceed the Securities and Investments Board's in the UK. 'We
have extraordinarily broad powers,' said Mr Richard Breeden, the
hard-hitting SEC chairman. 'There is no question about who is the regulator
and who is the regulatee in the American system.'
The SEC, which is being closely studied in the review of the UK investments
regulatory system, polices 6,000 broker-dealer firms and oversees
4,000-5,000 public offerings every year, as well as keeping an eye on the
US's 3,800 mutual funds (unit trusts) holding Dollars 1,500bn of assets.
It has authority in two areas outside the brief of the SIB: it vets all
listings of securities, and is the main prosecutor for fraud and market
manipulation.
Its role as a prosecutor lies at the root of its effectiveness, according to
Mr Breeden. 'If you don't have the power to prosecute, you are missing out
the key ingredient,' he argued. A year ago, he fined Salomon Bros Dollars
290m (Pounds 178m) for breaching US Treasury bond auction rules.
He commands an army of lawyers, analysts and examiners that is 2,600-strong
 - an increase of 700 since he took office three years ago. Although the SEC
cannot compete with the salaries paid by Wall Street law practices and
securities firms  - Mr Breeden himself earns a relatively meagre Dollars
119,000  - it has attracted ambitious lawyers and analysts who regard a
spell at the SEC as a good career move.
These human resources are perceived as the regime's greatest asset,
particularly in the enforcement division. 'Crooks don't put up a billboard
and say: 'Come get me, I'm breaking the law.' They work very hard to conceal
their activities,' said Mr Breeden.
He believes that there are efficiencies to be gained from integrating the
inspection, evaluation and prosecution functions. If inspectors discover a
trading irregularity at a securities firm, 'we can be across the street in
the courthouse in a single day', Mr Breeden boasted. 'No other agency has to
be briefed, evidence doesn't have to be boxed up, and doesn't have to be
copied for someone else.'
Although less dependent on self-regulation than the UK, the US system does
use self-regulatory organisations, such as the National Association of
Securities Dealers, which oversee the running of their own markets. But Mr
Breeden is not about to let anyone forget who runs the show. 'They cannot
enact any rule binding on their members without our approval. Even on the
question of what time the stock exchange opens and closes, we have the final
say.'
One important strength of the SEC, said Mr Breeden, is that it is relatively
independent of market practitioners and is therefore less open to
arm-twisting by the securities industry.
Predictably, market participants complain that the SEC regime is excessively
stringent and places US securities firms at a competitive disadvantage. They
also charge it with being too bureaucratic. There are suggestions that its
resources are sometimes misused or misdirected: for example, the rechecking
of inspection visits by SROs is widely viewed as unnecessary.
Mr Breeden, whose term ends in June, is also accused of being politically
ambitious. He is probably closer to the White House than previous incumbents
and counts President George Bush as a friend. Some market participants argue
that his aggressive stance on some issues, such as capital requirements, is
motivated by the desire to avoid the political embarrassment of a securities
firm collapse.
But Mr Breeden insists that his focus is the investor, not political
approbation. 'Our prime objective is investor protection,' he said. 'The
amount of money that can be gained from financial fraud in today's market is
almost limitless. And the losses that can be imposed on the public are
similarly great.'

FT  03 NOV 92 / People: Bond to run HSBC from London
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HSBC Holdings, the parent of Hongkong Bank and Midland, yesterday announced
the appointment of John Bond, the bank's head of operations in the US, as
group chief executive officer, as from January 1.
Bond, who is 51, will take over the reins from William Purves, 60, who will
stay on as chairman of the group. Bond will be the first chief executive to
run the bank from London, rather than Hong Kong where it was founded in the
1840s. Purves is expected to move to London next autumn.
Bond joined Hongkong and Shanghai Bank in 1961. He has had a copybook
career, serving extensively throughout south east Asia and Hong Kong, but
his career as a senior executive of the bank has been one of troubleshooter.
In 1983 he was brought in to head Wardley, the bank's merchant banking arm,
which was recovering from scandal surrounding the collapse of the Carrian
property group in the early 1980s.
When Purves was deputy chairman of the bank, he had been responsible for a
review of management and standards and is thought to have recommended Bond
for the job.
In June 1991, he was appointed president and chief executive officer of
Marine Midland Banks, based in Buffalo, New York state. Until his arrival,
Marine suffered chronic losses and required frequent capital injections from
its Hong Kong parent. It had been hit particularly hard by the Latin
American debt crisis of the early 1980s and the collapse in the US property
market in the late 1980s.
Bond conducted a review of the bank's operations which led to deep staff
cuts, and the quitting of unprofitable lines of business. The result is that
Marine - once a leading money centre bank - has been redefined as an
up-state New York lender to small and medium-sized business; it made a
Dollars 73.5m profit in the first nine months of this year compared with a
Dollars 166.2m loss in the same period of 1991.
HSBC also announced that John Gray, who was appointed chief executive of
Hongkong Bank at the beginning of this year, will become chairman and chief
executive of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation at the beginning of
next year. James Cleave is to become president and chief executive officer
of Marine Midland.

Hawtal Whiting, the Essex-headquartered vehicle design and engineering
consultancy which now derives more than half its turnover from outside the
UK, has achieved a minor coup.
Coming on board as a non-executive director is Bill Hayden, the crusty
former Ford of Europe manufacturing director whose final task, for the two
years before retiring in April, was starting to sort out the manufacturing
problems it had acquired when it bought Jaguar, as its chairman and chief
executive.
It was Hayden who on his arrival described manufacturing conditions at
Jaguar as worse than in any plant he had seen outside a few Russian
factories in Gorky.
Never the world's best pr man - the 'Gorky' remarks did not work wonders for
the morale of either its workers or Jaguar's new owners - Hayden, 62,
nevertheless brings to Hawtal a wealth of manufacturing/engineering
experience acquired with Ford since 1960. His manufacturing knowledge is of
rapidly growing importance because vehicle design is becoming much more
integrated with the manufacturing process through 'simultaneous'
engineering.

rides into town - SIB chairman Andrew Large talks to Robert Peston
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Andrew Large is intent on proving that a rabbit can tend the City of
London's lettuce. This former banker, who as chairman of the Securities and
Investments Board is the top regulator of the UK investments industry, plans
to establish an 'enforcement culture' within the system.
He believes that 'enforcement procedures are too complex'; that the
monitoring and prosecuting system is 'too fragmented'; and that 'punishments
(of City wrongdoers) have not been enough'.
Mr Large has an ideal opportunity to secure improvements. Appointed SIB
chairman on June 1, he was almost immediately asked by Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, to conduct a thorough review of the SIB's responsibilities under
the 1986 Financial Services Act, the legislation underlying the regulation
of investment businesses. The review was prompted by the failure of City
regulators to prevent Mr Robert Maxwell from looting the pension funds of
his companies.
In his first interview since he began work on the review, Mr Large said his
priority was to ensure the SIB had the authority and the resources to do its
job properly. This is partly a question of assessing whether the SIB needs
new powers and more staff, which he said was 'tremendously stretched'.
He said it was equally important to assess whether responsibilities are
divided sensibly between the SIB and other officially recognised bodies.
These consist of the Self-Regulatory Organisations (or SROs), responsible
for ensuring that financial firms are acting prudently and honestly, and the
Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs), such as the Stock Exchange, which
run financial markets.
The SIB's prime role is as a regulator of regulators, to monitor whether the
SROs and RIEs are carrying out their responsibilities effectively. But it
also monitors a limited number of financial firms itself, notably the big UK
banks' investment businesses.
Mr Large is starting from the assumption that the Financial Services Act is
likely to need amendments, rather than a complete overhaul. IHowever, that
does not mean that his proposals - which will be put to the chancellor at
the end of March - will not be radical. This was made clear by Mr Large's
decision that the review should start with first principles. A small team,
headed by Mr Philip Thorpe, who has been seconded by the Securities and
Futures Authority, an SRO, will ask consumers, investors, financial
practitioners, other regulators and politicians what they expect of the SIB
and the other recognised bodies.
It will then establish if there is a consensus about the aims and priorities
of the SIB and the recognised bodies. Finally it will evaluate whether
regulators are failing to meet legitimate public expectations and what can
be done to improve their performance.
Even before the inquiry is completed, Mr Large is convinced that regulators'
priority should no longer be the writing of rules but making sure that
'firms obey them'.
'We need enforcers with a spirit of inquiry,' he said. He wants to attract
high-flying young lawyers and accountants to work for the SIB and the SROs,
in much the same way as the US Securities and Exchange Commission employs
such professionals as supervisors and investigators. In this way, the City's
cherished principle of self-regulation - regulation by practitioners for
practitioners - would be eroded. However, Mr Large insisted that 'it's a
question of getting the balance right . . . We still want some people who
have industry experience.'
But he is also considering a reform which would strike a stronger blow
against self-regulation. Under review is the question of whether financial
firms should retain their cherished right to be able to choose which SRO
regulates them. The SIB's inability to force any firm to join any particular
SRO is contentious at the moment because of an attempt by two regulators -
Lautro for unit trust and life companies, and Fimbra for financial
intermediaries - to merge and create a super-regulator for retail financial
businesses, called the Personal Investment Authority.
However, the big UK banks are reluctant to join the PIA, prompting life
companies to threaten a boycott. If both groups were absent, the new
regulator would be virtually identical to Fimbra, making the merger
irrelevant.
Mr Large said there are strong 'public interest reasons' for the PIA to
succeed. He wants to persuade the banks to join it. But if they refuse, he
may attempt to acquire the powers to force them to do so.
The PIA problem is illustrative of a wider issue. Mr Large believes the
regulatory system contains 'overlaps and underlaps'. He is, for example,
concerned that responsibility for preventing the failure of a recognised
market to operate properly is not adequately defined in law. The SIB's role
in ensuring that investors do not lose money through a market malfunction is
not clear, he said, though he is certain the SIB would be blamed if a market
did fail.
He feels that may be a regulatory 'underlap'. On the other hand, the SIB's
direct responsibility for regulating the investment business of banks and
certain other financial concerns is an example of regulatory overlap with
the SROs.
Mr Large said he had 'sympathy with the argument', made by some SROs, that
this overlap is unnecessary and that the SIB should withdraw from direct
supervision of financial firms and concentrate on its role of regulating the
regulators.
The way to end these overlaps and underlaps, according to the influential
chairman of a big UK bank, is to abolish the SROs and have their functions
absorbed into newly created divisions of the SIB. But Mr Large is
unconvinced.
He believes that the separation of the SIB and the SROs can generate a
'creative tension', with each questioning the other and thereby keeping
standards high. However, he said in practice this tension has sometimes been
'destructive' as SROs have complained that they were being second-guessed by
the SIB. Mr Large said the solution might be a 'halfway house'. This would
involve giving the SIB power to 'prescribe the scope of the SROs' or choose
their membership.
The SIB would then have to decide how many SROs there should be. Mr Large is
not certain that reducing them to two - the PIA for the retail market, with
a detailed prescriptive rulebook, the other a more laissez-faire regulator
for market professionals - is altogether sensible, though some City firms
have argued for such a rationalisation.
A merger of the SFA and Imro, regulator of fund managers, would be needed to
create the professionals' super-regulator. But Imro's members are market
professionals who manage money on behalf of individuals such as pensioners
of Mr Robert Maxwell's companies. So Imro's members may need tighter
regulation than the SFAs. Indeed, Mr Large also believes there is probably
too much regulation of market professionals, and said there is a case for
simplifying the SFA's rulebook. So he is not convinced that marrying Imro
and the SFA would be felicitous.
Mr Large identified a separate inadequacy of the regulatory system as its
'perceived failure' to deliver sufficiently severe punishments to
wrongdoers. He said the problem was partly one of public perception. But he
accepted that fines levied by SROs on miscreant firms should probably be
raised: 'A Pounds 50,000 fine does not mean much.' He is investigating
whether the SROs can increase their fines without any change in the law.
He is also looking at whether the current process of prosecuting certain
City offences through the criminal courts is too slow and ineffective. He
said: 'The American model seems better.' In the US, the SEC has the power to
prosecute alleged insider dealers and market manipulators - those who use
unfair methods to profit from share price movements - under civil law. In
civil cases the burden of proof for a successful prosecution is less than in
a criminal process and the process is normally quicker.
The SEC believes it has two other clear advantages over UK regulators in
such cases. It has responsibility for tracking suspected insider dealing
cases and for assessing whether issues of new shares and other securities in
public companies conform with agreed standards.
This means that a large amount of financial and investigative expertise is
concentrated in the authority responsible for prosecuting insider dealers
and other financial fraudsters. In the UK, however, the identification of
possible insider dealers and the share-listing functions are carried out by
the Stock Exchange. Mr Large is looking at the possible transfer of these
responsibilities to the SIB but he stressed that this is a sensitive issue
and no decision had been taken.
Indeed, whenever a delicate issue such as this one is broached, he becomes
somewhat equivocal. In part, this is because of his preference for change to
take place by consensus. But he rejected the charge that he was a City
insider incapable of providing proper protection for consumers. He is
uncomfortable with the phrase 'self-regulation' as used to describe the UK
system.
'I would be very happy if the word 'self' were to be abolished from the
Financial Services Act,' he said. 'It does not reflect the reality. If
people want to find a new word, then what about 'regulation'?'

<TEXT>
Gardiner Group, the UK-based distributor of security and surveillance
products, faces further boardroom changes following Tom Buffett's decision
to retire as non-executive chairman in order to concentrate on his
commitments as chairman of Automated Security (Holdings), the electronic
security group.
Yashar Turgut, chief executive, will temporarily assume additional
responsibilities pending the appointment of a new non-executive chairman.
Earlier this year Gardiner was forced to replace Ian Nellist, its former
finance director who resigned by mutual consent after the group reported
pre-tax profits well below City expectations. Subsequently, Harvey Samson
was named group finance director in July.
Yesterday the company also announced the appointment of Jeff Caplan to the
board as director with responsibility for directing and developing the
group's CCTV businesses. Caplan is currently managing director of
Multi-Video Distribution, Gardiner's specialist CCTV operation which was
acquired in 1991.
Peter Blenkinsop, 48, has been appointed a non-executive director; he has
been involved in the security industry for more than 20 years and was
managing director of Scantronic Holdings which included responsibility for
Alarm Parts, subsequently bought by Gardiner.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Europe aims to seize
initiative / A look at the effectiveness of schemes which support small and
medium-size enterprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How will Europe's small and medium-sized businesses fare over the next few
years as the single market becomes established and if the provisions of the
Maastricht Treaty come into force?
Ultimately the fortunes of business depend on the ability of entrepreneurs
and managers to respond to change but governments and the European Community
have an important role to play. The 12 community member governments operate
no fewer than 420 national initiatives for their smaller businesses while
the European Commission has a further 70 EC-wide programmes, according to a
new study* by the Dutch Research Institute for Small and Medium-sized
Businesses.
Just how well attuned these programmes are to the needs of smaller firms and
how effective they are in achieving their objectives was revealed at a
two-day conference, Gateways to Growth, in Birmingham last week as part of
the British presidency of the EC.
That special attention needs to be paid to the interests of the small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) - businesses employing up to 500 people -
seems in little doubt. Of the 11.6m enterprises in the EC, 92 per cent
employ fewer than 10 people (and of these, 52 per cent employ no-one but the
owner) while a further 7.8 per cent have between 10 and 500 employees.
Apart from their sheer numbers, smaller firms deserve support because they
are far more important than large ones in creating employment - they already
account for 71 per cent of jobs.
Despite the importance of their SMEs, governments in the EC have not all
established clear policies and have not made sure that small firms' policies
fit in with their broader social and economic policies, Joop Vianen of the
Dutch small business institute told the conference.
This failure means that policies often do not achieve the desired results.
Other government ministries involved in areas such as physical planning,
education and finance are unable to take the specific needs of SMEs into
account.
While national governments, particularly in the less prosperous EC
countries, are ready to intervene directly by providing loans, loan
guarantees or grants, the Community takes a less interventionist approach.
It concentrates on helping in areas such as information, counselling and
cross-border co-operation.
Much of the EC small firms policy is carried out by its directorate general
for enterprise, DG23. Small business groups throughout Europe have become
concerned in recent months that DG23 may lose its independence and its
activities will be absorbed by the directorate general for industry, DG3, as
part of a streamlining of the Commission.
Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, commissioner in charge of enterprise policies,
announced plans for a four-year extension of the enterprise programme when
the current programme expires in December 1993. Cardoso e Cunha also
promised an independent annual review of the state of small businesses in
the Community.
Whether future SME programmes are run by an independent DG23 or by DG3,
small firms policies need to be given a tougher edge. They should give small
businesses greater access to existing large-scale EC programmes. These were
among the conclusions of the the first detailed study of the effectiveness
of the Community's small firms activities, carried out by Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu, consultants.
DG23 sometimes found it difficult to obtain the co-operation of other
directorates because they regarded DG23's activities as constraining their
own freedom of action, the consultants reported. DG23's response was to
avoid conflicts and adapt its ambitions so as not to damage its links with
the other directorates.
'This pragmatic position may be effective but it tends to introduce a gap
between the expectations of SMEs and the reality of policy represented by
DG23,' the report said.
In a detailed study of existing small firms programmes, the consultants
called for a review of DG23's network of Euro-Info Centres, which absorb 40
per cent of its budget. The centres should stop providing general
information on the EC and hand over detailed advice activities to the
private sector so that they can concentrate on practical information on
individual markets and the single market as a whole, the consultants said.
One of DG23's most controversial activities is its assessment of the impact
of new legislation on small businesses. This often causes friction with
other directorates but has been criticised by small business groups as being
ineffective.
The Commission will later this month ask EC industry ministers to approve
plans to publish at the start of each year a list of measures which will be
assessed. This will allow small business organisations to object or to
suggest additions to the list. The Commission also wants the impact
assessments to be published in the EC's official journal, alongside details
of the proposed legislation to which it relates.
Many of these changes have long been sought by small business lobbyists. But
small business organisations themselves must become better organised if they
are to make their voice heard. With the Brussels bureaucracy heavily staffed
by technical experts, specialist trade organisations representing industry
sectors such as chemicals or packaging have often proved more effective
lobbyists than the more broadly-based small business organisations.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Management (The Growing Business): How to get the best out
of your local MP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Businesses should not underestimate the ability of their local Member of
Parliament to influence legislation or to take action on their behalf,
writes Charles Batchelor.
Even if he or she is not a minister or a member of one of the influential
standing or select committees, the MP will be able to raise questions and
put points directly to ministers.
'It is worth remembering that your company is a creator of wealth and
employment within a constituency and the well-being of your company is
therefore of importance to your MP,' a handbook* to lobbying Westminster by
the London Chamber of Commerce points out.
If you have a concern to raise with your MP, the best way to make initial
contact is by letter to the House of Commons (London SW1A 0AA). If you want
to express your views on a particular piece of legislation, try to do so as
early as possible in the parliamentary process. The best time is when the
government issues a Green Paper or consultation document.
Give your MP as much information as possible. If you fear a new law would
cause job losses or extra expense for your company, spell out how many jobs
might go and the extent of any extra costs. If you do not want your MP to
mention your company's name, say so.
If your concerns have a European dimension, you may wish to contact your
MEP. He or she may be less familiar to you but you can get addresses and
details of special committees from the European Parliament Information
Office, 2 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1H 9AA. (Tel 071 222 0411.)
Your MEP will be able to put down a written or oral question, drawing the
attention of the European Commission or the Council of Ministers to your
concerns. The booklet suggests a number of simple rules when writing to your
MP:
Identify the subject you are interested in clearly at the start of your
letter.
Describe the background to your company - the length of time it has been
based in the constituency and the number of people employed.
Keep the letter as short as possible. MPs have a heavy postbag.
End by asking your MP's position on the matter. If possible, suggest a
solution to the issue you have raised.
Above all, adopt a friendly tone. However angry you may be about a
particular issue, it is pointless blaming or insulting your MP.
The title of the booklet, Working with Westminster and Whitehall, is
somewhat misleading since it does not actually look at how to lobby civil
servants.
It does, however, include useful lists of the membership of select
committees and the names, policy priorities and points of contact for the
different government departments. Some of the information, on, for example,
London MEPs is probably only of value to London-based companies but the
general advice is applicable to all businesses.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Drive for accounts to be made clearer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACCOUNTING Standards Board, the UK standard-setter for financial
reporting, is to consider ways to make accounts more understandable to
private investors.
Mr David Tweedie, the board's chairman, said he was considering ways to
introduce more narrative statements, explanations of terms and discussions
of corporate performance that those without financial skills could use.
'We are going to have to do something for the layman,' he said. 'Most do not
understand accounts or the basic terms such as assets or reserves.'
Any formal standard or set of guidelines is likely to be several years away
because the board is heavily committed to a lengthy programme of revising
other standards, many of which will prove highly controversial.
A start has been made, though, with proposals for an operating and financial
review text to accompany every set of accounts, along the lines of the
management discussion and analysis contained in US corporate reports.
Future guidance may take the form of advice for companies compiling employee
reports or information for private shareholders, but Mr Tweedie said 'it is
not on the agenda yet'.
Academic research  - including some conducted by Mr Tweedie while he was a
professor of accounting  - has consistently shown that few users of accounts
understand them or read beyond the basic profit-and-loss account.
Even analysts and other more financially sophisticated users often say the
annual report is much less important than other sources of information on a
company, such as personal briefings with senior executives.
Mr Tweedie is highly critical of the government's regulations on summary
accounts, the abbreviated financial information that shareholders can opt to
receive in place of full annual accounts. He called them 'hopeless'.
Many shareholders in privatisation issues have opted for the summary
statements, which include the basic financial statements but exclude most
detail such as the notes to the accounts.
Last week the board announced FRS 3, its latest standard, which
fundamentally changes the structure of the profit-and-loss account.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Accountants escape criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO AUDITORS to any of the companies reprimanded so far by the Financial
Reporting Review Panel, the new UK watchdog on company accounts, is likely
to be criticised by their professional regulatory body, it has emerged.
But tougher regulations introduced last October mean that the audit of
accounts covering year-ends since that time are expected to be treated more
strictly in future.
The investigations committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales has decided not to take action against Pannell Kerr
Forster, auditor to Williams Holdings, the first company criticised by the
review panel.
Pannell gave Williams an unqualified audit report on the 1991 accounts,
although the company was criticised by the review panel for breaching SSAP
6, the standard on extraordinary items.
Although the review panel has the power to take action against companies,
discipline of their auditors is left to the accountancy professional bodies.
Firms providing unqualified audit reports are automatically referred when
there is a critical review panel finding.
In a recent letter to Pannell, the institute said there had been a 'prima
facie' technical breach of accounting standards in Williams' accounts, but
added that the figures were not misleading and it would therefore take no
action against the firm for not qualifying the accounts.
A senior institute official said there had been no scope to do anything more
under the regulations at the time the accounts were approved.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Grant-aided project calls in receiver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 20M PROJECT described in 1989 as the largest direct manufacturing
investment in Europe by Hong Kong has gone into receivership.
The Hartlepool videotape plant set up by Swilynn (HK) was expected to create
500 jobs in a high-unemployment area and was offered Pounds 5m in regional
selective assistance from the Department of Trade and Industry.
In July last year Swilynn Magnetic Industries, a subsidiary of Swilynn UK
which is turn controlled by Swilynn (HK), announced that it was making
redundant 215 of the 385 people it then employed at Hartlepool because of
the increased automation necessary to compete with Far East manufacturers'
prices.
It said that the Pounds 2m investment in automation underlined its long-term
commitment. But European demand proved lower than expected and plans to make
videotape boxes at Hartlepool faltered when it proved cheaper to import
them.
Receiver Cork Gully, the insolvency arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, has been
called into Swilynn UK and, while manufacturing of video cassettes has
ceased at the Hartlepool plant, sub-contract injection moulding work is
continuing. A total of 42 employees remain, plus a skeleton staff at the
sales office at West Drayton in London. The assets are likely to be sold in
sections.
Swilynn (HK) is currently the subject of a rescue package after trading in
its shares was suspended.
The group's ultimate parent, Bermuda-based Swilynn International, continues
to trade.
The DTI said that in such cases it invoiced the receiver to try to recover
grant paid. Swilynn is understood not to have received the full Pounds 5m
offered, as it did not achieve its target of 500 jobs. Mr Miles Middleton,
the receiver, said he had yet to hear from the DTI.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Auditors receive writ over Clowes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPICER &amp; PEGLER, the accountancy firm that is now part of Touche Ross, has
been issued with a writ concerning its audit of Barlow Clowes, the fund
management company closed by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1988.
The writ was issued by the Treasury and partners in Cork Gully, liquidators
of Barlow Clowes.
Touche, with which Spicer merged in 1990, confirmed that a protective writ
had been issued but not served. It had not received a statement of claim
quantifying the damages sought.
The collapse of Barlow Clowes led to compensation payments totalling Pounds
150m by the government to 18,000 investors.
Touche said last night: 'An exhaustive and detailed study by the ombudsman
showed that the major responsibility lay with the DTI and we agree with the
ombudsman's findings.'
In February this year Mr Peter Clowes, the company's founder, was jailed for
10 years for theft and fraud.
The joint disciplinary scheme operated by the accountancy professional
bodies reopened its investigation into the involvement of Spicer &amp; Pegler
and Touche Ross - which took over the audit from Spicer &amp; Pegler - with
Barlow Clowes shortly after the close of the trial.
A DTI inspectors' investigation is also under way.

THE NUMBER of jobs generated by the Port of Liverpool has remained steady
over the past 16 years even though the number of dockers has fallen from
7,000 to about 600, according to an independent study.
In 1976 the port generated between 52,000 and 107,000 local jobs and 129,000
to 304,000 in the UK as a whole. Using the same criteria, the 1992 figures
give ranges of 49,000 to 105,000 locally and 125,000 to 311,000 nationally.
The study was carried out for the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company by Mr
Peter Stoney of Liverpool University's macroeconomic research unit, who also
carried out the 1976 work.
The wide range of job numbers is because those among shippers cannot be
entirely attributed to Liverpool's existence. 'We cannot say they would all
go if Liverpool ceased operating,' Mr Stoney said. 'Many might transfer
elsewhere.'
Mr Stoney says the loss of dockers' jobs has been made good by growth among
tenant companies in the Mersey docklands. Moreover, Liverpool's trade and
profitability trends are now positive, while they were negative in 1976.
Cargo is twice the 1980 level, industrial relations are good, Liverpool has
developed as a national hub for west coast traffic, and its freeport has
been successful and is being extended.
Mr Stoney predicts that during 1992-98, new facilities and port-based
trading estates will generate Pounds 230m extra income and 4,500 local jobs
during construction work. They will bring in Pounds 83m of operating income
to the port, plus 3,000 permanent jobs, when complete. He says the figures
are pessimistic. 'The estimated impact on jobs of capital spending takes no
account of any resulting increases in trade passing through the port.'

FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: MAS embarks on extensive
expansion - Prospects of the airline launching Malaysia's biggest rights
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIRE last month which destroyed the control tower at Kuala Lumpur airport,
severely disrupting international and domestic flights for more than two
weeks, could not have come at a worse time for Malaysia Airlines (MAS), the
country's national carrier.
For today, MAS launches Malaysia's biggest rights issue, raising MDollars
1.75bn (USDollars 700m) in a one-for-one share offering.
Since the Malaysian government still controls more than 50 per cent of MAS,
it is unlikely to let the issue fail, though many analysts see turbulent
times ahead.
The cash to be raised will be used partly to fund one of the world airline
industry's most ambitious expansion programmes. In the course of its present
five-year plan - 1991-92 to 1996-97 - MAS has orders for 72 aircraft costing
a total MDollars 10.6bn.
The aircraft are needed to meet what MAS foresees as a substantial increase
in domestic and international travel in the coming years. Old aircraft have
to be replaced, while expensive leased aircraft, which now make up more than
half the total fleet, will be phased out. Overall, MAS plans to increase its
fleet from 74 aircraft to about 100 over the next five years.
MAS started life as Malayan Airlines in the years before the Second World
War. In the 1960s, it was known as Malaysia-Singapore Airlines. In the early
1970s, a split occurred, giving birth to MAS and Singapore Airlines. Over
the years, MAS has tended to be overshadowed by the success of SIA, even
though in terms of passengers carried it is substantially bigger than its
southern neighbour and competitor.
MAS is now determined to establish itself as a leading international and
regional carrier. 'We want to turn Malaysia Airlines into one of the super
excellent airlines in the world in terms of schedules and services,' says Mr
Kamaruddin Ahmad, managing director.
The airline is encouraged by continued strong economic growth at home and
forecasts of rapidly increasing regional passenger traffic, particularly in
south-east Asia.
MAS plans to increase overall capacity by between 10 and 15 per cent in each
of the next five years. New routes are being opened, most recently to
Johannesburg and Mexico City.
Infrastructural investments of nearly MDollars 1.5bn are also planned. These
include MDollars 700m towards the cost of a new international airport
outside Kuala Lumpur, scheduled to be completed before the Commonwealth
Games in the city in 1998, and nearly MDollars 200m for a local maintenance
centre.
MAS, partially privatised in 1985, is 42 per cent owned by Bank Negara, the
Malaysian central bank, and 5 per cent each by the state governments in the
east Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak. The Brunei government holds
another 10 per cent.
Mr S. Suppiah, director of finance at MAS, has no doubts about the rights
issue but admits funding the airline's expansion programme is not an easy
task.
'There will be an inevitable pressure on our cash-flow,' says Mr Suppiah.
'We've had to go in for some short to medium-term loans. So far we have been
able to raise financing at good rates. But things will be tough in the years
ahead.'
One problem is that Japanese banks and investment houses, the main source of
aerospace funds in the Asia region, are becoming more cautious about
lending. While the Malaysian banks are sitting on substantial funds,
interest rates are high.
The MAS balance sheet is another problem. MAS registered pre-tax profits
MDollars 120m in 1991-92 and MDollars 206m in 1990-91. But these figures
included funds raised from aircraft sales. Take these out and there was an
operating loss of MDollars 169m in 1991 and only a small operating profit of
MDollars 38m in 1992.
What concerned analysts most about the 1991-92 figures was a 3 per cent drop
in the airline's overall load factor - representing the utilisation of
aircraft - to 65.9 per cent, the lowest level since the early 1980s.
Another area of concern was a rise of more than 19 per cent in staff costs.
'They seem to have exaggerated aircraft demand and they have not been
careful enough about controlling labour costs,' said one aviation analyst.
'MAS is still seen as overly bureaucratic and government, rather than
market, orientated.'
MAS has forecast a substantial increase in pre-tax profits for 1992-93 to
MDollars 372m. The estimated value of aircraft sales within that figure has
not been made clear.
On the plus side, the government earlier this year approved a 20 per cent
increase in domestic air fares - the first such increase for a decade.
However, domestic routes are unlikely to break even for some years.
It is believed passenger traffic on both domestic and international routes
grew substantially in the first half of the year. But nearly 80 per cent of
total revenues come from international routes and the recent appreciation of
the Malaysian dollar against most currencies is likely to have eaten into
profits.
'The basic problem is planning,' says a regional aviation analyst. 'MAS
should really have started its aircraft renewal and expansion programme much
earlier and phased it over a longer period. It should be teaming up with
other airlines and not trying to go it alone.
'In the long term, with the potential for substantial tourism growth in
Malaysia and the growth in regional passenger traffic, prospects are good.
But in the short term MAS is in for a rough ride.'

HABIB Credit and Exchange Bank, the revamped subsidiary of the former Bank
of Credit and Commerce International in Pakistan, will float 49 per cent of
its shares to the general public next month, Reuter reports from Karachi.
The Habib Credit and Exchange Bank (HCEBL) was formed from the three
Pakistan branches of BCCI, which were merged with the government-owned Habib
Bank following an agreement with BCCI's liquidators in February. HBL now
owns 100 per cent of HCEBL.
HBL will retain 51 per cent of shares in the new bank, which was formally
launched in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi on Sunday, Mr Saleem Akhtar,
chief executive said.
Mr Akhtar said HCEBL would offer 29 per cent of its shares to the public, 10
per cent to former BCCI employees and 10 per cent to the state's National
Investment Trust. The shares are to be offered in December.
HBL took over the three BCCI branches in March and resumed operations in
April.

FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Fannie Mae buys Dollars 1bn of
mortgages from Citicorp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Federal National Mortgage Association has agreed to buy Dollars 1bn of
new mortgages from Citicorp on a non-recourse basis, an indication that
credit standards at the bank's troubled mortgage unit may be improving.
Although Fannie Mae has bought non-recourse mortgages in the past from many
other US banks, the deal is the first between the company and Citicorp.
Buying mortgages on a non-recourse basis means that if some of the loans
should sour, Fannie Mae cannot return them to Citicorp.
It also means that the bank does not have to set aside capital against the
sold mortgages, as would be required with normal transactions.
Citicorp said the deal would save the bank about Dollars 25m in capital
costs.
Industry analysts said that the deal was a sign that market confidence in
the quality of Citicorp's mortgage portfolio may be growing.
For years, financial institutions have only bought mortgages from Citicorp
that could be returned to the bank in the event of default.
Only a few months ago, a government examiner's report on Citicorp was highly
critical of its mortgage unit, a report that underlined the credit problems
at the bank.
It is believed that Fannie Mae agreed to buy the Dollars 1bn of mortgages
because they were originated recently.
In the past year, Citicorp has dropped its old strategy of trying to build
volume by originating loans with a minimum of documentation about the
borrower, and has significantly raised its standards for mortgage seekers.
Citicorp originates about Dollars 8bn of new mortgages every year, and most
of them have been sold in the secondary market on a recourse basis.
However, some institutions continue to boycott Citicorp mortgages.
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Fannie Mae's main competitor,
refuses to resume any kind of mortgage deals with the bank until Citicorp
has addressed 'control and management issues' at its mortgage unit.

FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: TRW to collaborate with Fiat
subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRW, the US automotive, space, defence and information technology group, and
Magneti Marelli, Fiat's motor components subsidiary, have signed an
agreement to collaborate on the development and sale of advanced control
systems for vehicles.
Florida-based TRW Active Control Systems will provide computer-controlled
'active' rear steering and suspension components and technology for Magneti
to integrate into full working systems.
Active rear wheel steering and suspension systems are potentially two market
growth areas for component suppliers. In the former, a system of sensors
monitors factors such as speed, driver steering input and side forces.
At high speeds on motorways, an active rear steering system could
automatically compensate for sudden severe side winds or the vehicle being
blown off course while passing a truck.
Active suspension is expected to allow sensors to read an uneven road and
compensate for it by controlling movements of the suspension - a system seen
on some grand prix racing cars.
Although Magneti is 61 per cent owned by Fiat, Italy's largest industrial
group, only 36 per cent of its sales are made to Fiat. It will be looking to
sell the systems to vehicle makers throughout Europe. Currently its biggest
single customer outside of Fiat is Renault of France.
The venture involves collaboration between existing entities within both
partners. There are no plans to form a joint venture company and TRW will
pursue the North American market for such systems on its own.
Magneti, headquartered near Milan but with subsidiaries throughout the
world, designs, develops and manufactures a broad range of components and
vehicle systems involving advanced electronics, instrumentation, lighting
and air conditioning.

TELEGLOBE, Canada's international telecommunications group which has a
minority held by BCE, the Canadian conglomerate, doubled profits to CDollars
15m (Dollars 12m), or 27 cents a share, in the third quarter, compared with
CDollars 7.1m, or 13 cents, last time. The increase was achieved on revenues
of CDollars 126m, against CDollars 105m.
Telecommunications activities accounted for the strength, while
communications products and insurance systems showed a small loss.
Teleglobe has begun carrying all international traffic between Canada and
Mexico formerly handled by Canadian telephone companies via US networks. It
also has formed an international consortium to lay the CDollars 400m
Cantat-3 fibre optic cable between North America and Europe, and will
upgrade an earth station in the Ukraine.
For the first nine months, the group reported a loss of CDollars 68.6m, or
CDollars 1.56 a share, after special charges totalling CDollars 91m, against
net profit of CDollars 13.7 or 28 cents a share. Revenues advanced to
CDollars 245m from CDollars 203m.
Power Corp of Canada has sold its 50 per cent share of the Celgar softwood
pulp mill on the British Columbia coast to Venezolana de Pulpa of Venezuela.
Power said the book value of the investment was CDollars 22.5m, and a small
gain was made.

THE TURKISH Government is offering to sell its 20 per cent share in Netas,
the local subsidiary of Northern Telecom of Canada, plus stakes in four
other companies in an attempt to revive its flagging privatisation
programme.
The five companies are expected to raise TL641bn (Dollars 85.3m). Bids have
to be submitted by December 1.
The Public Participation Administration, which handles the sale of state
assets to the public, plans to make sales worth TL5,500 in 1992, including
the sale of 11 state cement companies. Bids for these are closed.
Netas, listed on the Istanbul stock exchange, is Turkey's second-largest
telecommunications manufacturer and has recently concluded a deal to supply
digital switches to Azerbaijan.
The company said yesterday Northern Telcom, which owns 51 per cent, was
expected to make an offer for the government stake. A balancing 29 per cent
stake owned by the PPA is to be sold by public offering to local investors
before the new year.
PPA's 18 per cent stake in Teletas, another telecommunications manufacturer,
is to go on sale this month, after talks with Alcatel, its French majority
partner broke down.

270m item for lay-offs

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN Pacific has taken a CDollars 270m charge in its third quarter to
cover the cost of laying off one-third of the train crews in its core
railway business.
The charge, combined with higher losses from truck operations and sharply
reduced income from coal mining, quadrupled the Montreal-based
conglomerate's third-quarter loss to CDollars 205.6m (Dollars 165.8m), or 64
cents a share, from CDollars 51.8m, or 16 cents, a year earlier.
The special CP Rail charge will cover severance costs resulting from new
labour agreements with unions in the US and Canada, under which the size of
each train's crew will be cut from three to two. A total of 1,600 workers
out of CP Rail's workforce of 27,400 people will lose their jobs.
CP is trying to improve its competitiveness, not only in its core transport
operations but also in its forestry, real estate and coal mining
subsidiaries. The company said yesterday that further job cuts and asset
sales were in the wings.
CP's third-quarter operating loss was CDollars 165.9m, compared with
earnings of CDollars 144.2m a year earlier. The trucking division's losses
soared to CDollars 14m from CDollars 1.8m, reflecting declining traffic and
increasingly stiff price competition. Third-quarter revenues dipped to
CDollars 2bn from CDollars 2.5bn.
A five-month strike at Fording Coal and the difficulties of other coal mines
in south-east British Columbia contributed to a CDollars 51m slump in the
rail division's revenues. CP Rail was also hit by lower iron and steel,
energy and container traffic.
CP's share of losses suffered by CP Forest, its forest products subsidiary,
dropped by CDollars 21m to CDollars 52.4m. The company said newsprint demand
in the US had improved in recent months. The US pulp market also picked up,
but was offset by lower demand from Europe and Japan. Demand for white paper
has weakened.
PanCanadian Petroleum's operating earnings improved in the third quarter,
due mainly to a 25 per cent rise in crude oil output and a 46 per cent jump
in natural gas production. This was partially offset by lower prices.
For the nine months, including unusual items, the loss amounted to CDollars
224.3m, or 70 cents, compared with a loss of CDollars 26.2m, or 8 cents,
last year.

LUSCAR, a privately-owned Alberta coal producer, has agreed to buy two mines
in south-east British Columbia formerly owned by Westar Mining, which was
Canada's biggest coal exporter until it was put into bankruptcy earlier this
year.
Terms for the purchase of the Balmer and Greenhills mines were not
disclosed. The sale is expected to close by mid-November.
The Westar deal, which is another milestone in the shake-out of the
financially stretched Canadian coal industry, will make Luscar one of the
country's biggest coal producers. The company, based in Edmonton, operates
seven mines in Alberta and Saskatchewan.
The Balmer mine, which produced 5.4m tonnes in 1991, has been idle since a
labour dispute halted operations last May.
Members of the United Mine Workers of America union at Balmer have accepted
proposals for a new contract.
Cominco, the Canadian base metals and fertiliser producer, returned to the
black in the third quarter due to higher zinc and copper prices and improved
costs at its smelter at Trail, British Columbia.
Third-quarter earnings were CDollars 10.1m (USDollars 8.1m), or 12 cents a
share, before extraordinary items, compared with a loss of CDollars 23.2, or
30 cents, a year earlier.

MR RUPERT MURDOCH'S Twentieth Century Fox suffered its second high-level
executive departure of the year when Mr Joe Roth, chairman of the Hollywood
studio, said he would resign on January 1 1993 to form his own film
production company at The Walt Disney Studios.
Last February, Mr Murdoch assumed direct management responsibility for the
Hollywood studio and the Fox television network following the resignation of
Mr Barry Diller, who had been chairman and chief executive since 1984.
Mr Roth's resignation, like that of Mr Diller, caught the US entertainment
industry by surprise. It also kindled speculation Mr Roth might have been
concerned at the increasingly hands-on management role played by Mr Murdoch.
Neither Mr Roth nor Mr Murdoch could be reached for comment last night.
Mr Roth, who joined Fox in 1989, was responsible for several films that
generated hefty revenues.
Among the most profitable films he helped to make was Home Alone, last
year's blockbuster.
Under the agreement with Disney, Mr Roth will produce at least 25 films that
will be distributed by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, under Disney
studio banners including Touchstone and Walt Disney Pictures.
Mr Michael Eisner, chairman of Disney, said the studio was pleased to be Mr
Roth's 'financial partner' and praised his 'proven track record'.
Mr Roth said he had known both Mr Eisner and Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, the
Disney studio head, for the past 10 years.

WBK is one of the nine banks created in 1989 out of the commercial
operations of NBP, the central bank. The sale is being handled by Schroders
of the UK.
Mr Slawomir Sikora, the official at the Finance Ministry responsible for the
operation, says he expected it to be completed by the summer of 1993. WBK
was originally identified for privatisation by the government.
Mr Sikora said: 'It is the government's intention to sell all nine banks in
three or four years' time.'
The Allied Irish Bank is providing management advice to the WBK under a
three-year contract.

<TEXT>
CIMENTS Francais, the French cement company embroiled in a scandal over its
off-balance sheet share dealings, has been asked by the Spanish stock market
authorities for details of its dealings in Spain by the end of this week.
The bulk of Ciments Francais off-balance sheet transactions  - FFr890m
(Dollars 170m) out of FFr1.05bn  - were conducted in Spain.
It is thought that the dealings could have involved Cementos Molins, a
Spanish cement maker, in which the French company already holds a minority
stake.
This may mean that Ciments Francais is compelled to make a formal offer for
more shares.
Under Spanish takeover regulations, if an investor holding more than 25 per
cent of a company buys another 6 per cent within a year, it is required to
bid for a further 10 per cent.
Ciments Francais already owns 25.3 per cent of Cementos Molins as a result
of a transaction in 1986.
Ciments Francais declined to comment on whether it had raised its stake in
Cementos Molins. However, it said that, if its stake had been raised by more
than 6 per cent in a year, it would explore 'other solutions' apart from an
outright bid.
Mr Bernard Laplace, who last month succeeded Mr Pierre Conso as chairman of
Ciments Francais after the latter's dismissal, held discussions last Friday
with the Spanish stock market authorities.
Ciments Francais, which last week announced substantial interim losses, is
under intense financial pressure over the off-balance sheet losses. As a
result, both the Spanish authorities and Cementos Molins are expected to
support a compromise solution rather than insisting on a formal bid.

FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Top Dutch merchant banks plan to
merge
</HEADLINE>

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TOP two Dutch merchant banks, Pierson Heldring &amp; Pierson and Bank Mees &amp;
Hope, said yesterday that they planned to merge, slightly more than two
years after their former parent banks combined to create ABN Amro, the
biggest bank in the Netherlands.
The merger of ABN Amro's two merchant bank subsidiaries will produce a bank
with a balance sheet total of Fl 35bn (Dollars 20bn), a strong position in
several market segments in the Netherlands, and a network of smaller offices
in 17 countries.
The new bank, to be called Mees Pierson, aims to consolidate its position at
home and then to expand to become a 'European merchant bank' which will be
able to compete with Anglo-Saxon merchant banks such as Goldman Sachs,
according to Mr Han Kleiterp, chairman of Pierson.
'The new bank will operate entirely independent of the parent bank,' he
added.
Pierson's former parent, Amro Bank, and Mees' parent, ABN Bank, merged in
1990, sparking speculation that one of the two merchant banks would
eventually be sold off or that the two would be combined. However, ABN Amro
repeatedly insisted that the two banks would remain separate, independent
entities within the group.
The decision to merge the two merchant banks after all was taken to respond
to the increased international nature of banking and to enable the new bank
to grow faster abroad. The narrowing of margins in areas such as stock
market trading also spurred the two merchant banks to explore a merger.
Cost savings are expected by creating single information technology systems
in such areas as treasury management and securities.
Officials said the merger would lead to job losses. The banks have a
combined workforce of 3,800.

FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Airlines to renew talks on
alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CANADIAN Airlines International is to renew talks later this week for a
far-reaching alliance with American Airlines amid signs that plans for a
merger between Canadian and Air Canada have run into difficulty.
PWA Corp, Canadian's Calgary-based parent, said yesterday the talks
scheduled with American officials in Dallas would be 'preliminary'.
American and Canadian were at an advanced stage of negotiations last summer
for an alliance which would have included American buying a 25 per cent
equity stake. Canadian would have meshed its marketing and reservations
systems with American.
Canadian was unable, however, to fulfil all American's conditions, notably a
requirement to raise new equity.
American Airlines declined to comment yesterday on the resumption of
discussions, but is understood to have retained its interest in its original
proposal.
A deal would be attractive to American because of the opportunity to expand
its Sabre reservations system and other 'back-office' facilities, as well as
giving access to Canadian's valuable landing slots in Japan and other Asian
airports.
In the wake of the collapse of the talks with American, Canadian was forced
to turn to its arch-rival, Air Canada. But the two domestic carriers have so
far been unable to agree on details of their proposed merger, such as the
composition of the combined fleet and the restructuring of their massive
debt, estimated at CDollars 7.7bn (USDollars 6.2bn).
Canadian and Air Canada last week asked the National Transportation Agency
to delay public hearings on the proposed merger, which were due to start in
Ottawa next Monday.
Both the Canadian carriers are suffering heavy losses. According to a leaked
document published in the local press last week, the merged airline would
post a 1993 loss of CDollars 666m.
Besides staunching the red ink, both airlines are also anxious to find a
partner which would make them more attractive as part of one of the emerging
international airline alliances.
PWA said the renewed negotiations with American stemmed from a request by
Ottawa's bureau for competition policy that PWA 'shop around' for an
alternative to the Air Canada merger.
An employee group has put forward a buy-out plan which would include an
investment by American.

A SKr500m (Dollars 86m) agreement that would have given Fyffes, the
Dublin-based fruit and vegetable distributor, 50 per cent of the Swedish
wholesale distributor Saba Trading has collapsed, write Christopher
Brown-Humes in Stockholm and Tim Coone in Dublin.
Axel Johnson, Saba's parent, said both parties decided to pull out of the
deal following the recent drop in European fruit and vegetable prices and
the deterioration in the Swedish economy.
Mr Carl McCann, finance director of Fyffes, said the problems facing the
Swedish economy, which had emerged since the deal was first agreed in the
summer, had 'substantially increased the risks'. He said these included a
currency devaluation risk and projected falls in consumer spending.
However, analysts suggest that a separate deal between Axel Johnson and KF,
the Swedish co-operative group, was the fundamental reason for the
breakdown.

FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Profits warning at Bayer
reflects struggle in sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS at Bayer, one of Germany's big three chemicals companies, will be
considerably down this year, the company's chief executive has warned.
Mr Manfred Schneider, Bayer's chief executive since April, said that the
recent appreciation of the D-Mark had had a noticeable impact on the
company's business.
The strengthening of the D-Mark had damaged the competitiveness of the
entire, export orientated German chemicals sector, he said, exacerbating the
problems caused by intense pressure on prices and a downturn in the world
chemicals industry.
Conditions have deteriorated sharply over a matter of months. When in August
Bayer reported half-year profits down nearly 10 per cent, it predicted that
the full year result would be 'satisfactory'.
This was defined as being marginally down on the pre-tax profit of DM3.2bn
(Dollars 2bn) reported for 1991, a fall of 5 per cent on the previous year.
Mr Schneider said the company has to battle with a 'strong and growing
headwind'.
Bayer plans to shed 4,000 employees by the end of the current year, some 2.5
per cent of the 140,000 workforce worldwide. He hinted that further
reductions would be necessary next year too.
His comments provide a graphic illustration of the impact of the D-Mark's
appreciation on German industry. The currency has risen by 8 per cent
against all currencies since the beginning of the year, but by far more
against sterling and the lira.
They come several weeks before Bayer, together with its large German rivals
Hoechst and BASF, report their figures for the first nine months of the
year, providing an indication of the bad news to come from the German
chemicals sector as a whole.
Bayer's shares - which have outperformed the German market by 7 per cent in
the last three months - dropped yesterday from DM263 to DM254.5, a fall of
more than 3 per cent.
The areas most severely affected by the worldwide slowdown were its
industrial, organic and polymers chemicals businesses, Mr Schneider said.
These products are used by construction, automobile, textile and other
sectors currently feeling the brunt of the world recession.
Mr Schneider said that the conditions in the pharmaceuticals sector - which
accounts for a larger share of business than at the other two large German
chemicals companies - were considerably better than in chemicals. But he
qualified his optimism to say that the environment here had also become
rougher, reflecting hard international competition, high research and
development costs as well as governmental interference in the drug industry.

FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Decision time for water company investors -
Prospects for the sector which has been one of the best performers this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATER shares rose yesterday as investors looked forward to the half-year
results season, which kicks off today with figures from Thames Water.
This is the sixth results season since the 10 water and sewerage companies
were privatised in 1989, and like the others, it raises questions about
whether they are balancing the interests of customers and shareholders, and
about the benefits of privatisation.
Ofwat, the industry regulator, will consider those questions formally in
1994 when it conducts its periodic review of the companies' K numbers, the
amount by which they are allowed to raise prices above the rate of
inflation.
However, in the past year the short-term attractions of the shares have
prevailed over the threat of tighter regulation in 1994. Water companies
have been one of 1992's best performing sectors, rising by nearly 40 per
cent and outperforming the stock market by about 30 per cent. Investors have
reached for the security of water companies' high yields and low risk while
recovery in the wider economy remains elusive.
The decision facing investors at this time is whether that performance can
continue.
The most encouraging news is likely to be dividends - the main reason for
the sector's rise yesterday. Brokers are expecting increases of about 9 per
cent in the half-year payment, compared to some 10 per cent on average last
year, and about 3 per cent last year for the market overall. Dividend cover
for most companies should also be around the past figure of three times.
Mr Andrew Stone, analyst at Daiwa Investment Research, said: 'Until we see
some hard news such as a cut in interest rates, you cannot get much safer
dividends.'
There are also unlikely to have been surprises in the results from the
companies' core or regulated water and sewerage businesses as revenues will
have risen in line with prices, although lower demand from businesses may
have held back revenues in the south. Average water charges, which rose 15.5
per cent in the year to March 1992, are set to increase by only 9.7 per cent
overall in the current year.
Immediate regulatory uncertainty has diminished following Ofwat's ruling
last month on next year's price increases. Most companies have struck a
two-year deal, in which prices will still rise by between 6 per cent and 7
per cent, nearly double the rate of inflation.
However, there are several areas of concern, which could tip the balance for
investors deciding whether to hold on to the shares. Companies are heading
into their period of highest capital expenditure, and most will move soon
from having net cash to net debt. Gearing is expected to peak within the
next four years, with interest cover falling to around two times for some.
Investors will want reassurance that the capital spending plans are still on
target. Water companies, including the 23 smaller water supply companies
still in private hands, are in the middle of a 16-year investment programme
that could eventually cost more than Pounds 45bn, sharply higher than the
government estimates of Pounds 28bn at privatisation.
The programme could cost billions more if the National Rivers Authority, the
water quality watchdog, favours a harsh interpretation of the EC Municipal
Waste Water Directive, which covers treatment of sewage, and if it chooses
to bring in strict new UK statutory water quality standards.
Ofwat, concerned about the sharp rises in customers bills to pay for the
capital spending, has emphasised that standards should not be set
unnecessarily high. It has asked companies to consult customers this winter
on the desired level of service.
But as water companies have little room for discretion on capital spending
once the rules are set, several managing directors have interpreted this as
a backdoor way for Ofwat to remind the NRA of the expensive consequences of
its regulatory enthusiasm.
The results will also give a chance to scrutinise companies'
diversification, much of which has been disappointing. The companies intend
the non-core businesses to shield them against tightening regulation of the
core services. They are not allowed to cross-finance the diversifications by
revenue from the core activities, but Ofwat's precise views on how this
'ring fence' operates will remain uncertain for several years and a source
of risk in the shares.
Brokers are divided in their judgment of whether the short-term attractions
of the sector outweigh the long term risks. Mr Peter Hyde, analyst at
Kleinwort Benson Securities, says: 'The sector may well do well over the
next month, but I expect it to be left behind when the economy eventually
recovers'.

FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: British Assets value declines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the 12 months to September 30 net asset value at British Assets Trust,
which has an international portfolio of over Pounds 500m, fell 5.1 per cent,
from 94.72p to 89.85p.
Earnings per share fell from 4.11p to 4.02p, reflecting a combination of
falling interest rates, a lower value of dollar receipts because of the
declining US exchange rate, and a decrease in dividend payments by quoted UK
companies.
However, the final quarterly dividend is 1.07p to make a total of 4.19p for
the year, against 4.04p. Barring unforeseen circumstances, a minimum
distribution of 4.28p is indicated for the current year.
Investors Capital Trust, 67.5 per cent owned by British Assets, saw net
asset value decline from 116.7p to 111.8p over the year.
Earnings per share worked through at 4.97p (5.12p) and the dividend is
lifted to 5.1p (5.05p) with a final quarterly payment of 1.275p.

AFTER redundancy costs of Pounds 138,000, William Sindall incurred a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 417,000 in the opening half of 1992.
That compared with a profit of Pounds 432,000, and with a loss of Pounds
4.19m for the full year after exceptional charges of Pounds 5m.
Turnover of the group, which is engaged in building and civil engineering,
declined from Pounds 33.9m to Pounds 22m.
A month ago judgment was given in favour of the group in an action for
rescission of a contract made in 1988 under which land was purchased for
Pounds 5.08m from the Cambridgeshire County Council. Since then, the council
had achieved a mandatory stay of execution by paying into court Pounds 8m.
The accounts take in nothing from the judgment and the costs of the action

Losses per share were 7.55p (earnings 2.65p). There is no interim dividend
(1.5p).

FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: County NatWest highlights new income
measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTY NATWEST, the securities house, is to give prominence to two new
measures of earnings in its client circulars, following changes to the
format and structure of the profit and loss account.
In an equity briefing issued by the firm, it warns that Financial Reporting
Standard 3, launched last week by the Accounting Standards Board (ASB), will
cause 'considerable confusion' among unwary users.
FRS 3, which replaced Fred 1, the earlier consultation draft on the profit
and loss account, virtually abolishes the extraordinary item and
incorporates all remaining unusual gains or losses in the earnings figure.
County intends to stress what it calls 'normalised' earnings - the new
earnings figure stripped of extraordinary items - and 'maintainable'
earnings, or those attributable to continuing business operations.
It warns that the ASB's recast earnings figure will be 'highly volatile,
potentially misleading and the least useful for any valuation purposes'.
This is part of the ASB's stated intention, which is attempting to divert
the attention of users of accounts away from what it believes is excessive
concentration on the single earnings figure.
But the new standard has caused considerable concern among analysts and
other stock market observers, who will be forced to make their own
calculations of earnings and determine the basis on which p/e ratios are
calculated in the future.
The Institute for Investment Management and Research said last week that it
was creating a working party to derive a maintainable earnings figure, which
it hoped might become an industry standard. It expects to reach a conclusion
within about six months.
County said it is developing a system that will provide aggregated earnings
and p/e ratios using any specified definition and expects to publish further
details shortly.
Its maintainable earnings figure will take the headline ASB figure, add
notional interest on disposal proceeds and earnings on acquisitions, and
subtract earnings from discontinued operations and notional interest on
acquisition costs.
Its normalised earnings will comprise the headline earnings figure, with the
removal of material, non-recurring exceptional items.

PROPERTY CLAIMED by Polly Peck International, the collapsed fruit and
electronics group, has been taken over by the government of northern Cyprus
dealing a further blow to administrators trying to recover assets on the
island.
Officials confirmed that the Kyrenia View Hotel and eight apartment blocks
owned through a local subsidiary of PPI have been taken over in settlement
of a TL12bn (Pounds 955,000) debt owed to the government-run social security
pension fund by the companies of Mr Asil Nadir, the former PPI chairman.
Mr Richard Stone, the administrator appointed in October 1990, has so far
been frustrated in efforts to gain access to the PPI assets by three
injunctions taken out by Mr Mentes Aziz, the personal lawyer of Mr Nadir. Mr
Mentes confirmed he was in negotiations with the administrators. However,
the latest move will be seen as a further obstacle in claiming the assets.
The freehold properties are owned by Pearl Construction, one of several PPI
companies owned through an intermediary company on the Isle of Man. PPI owns
two other hotels in Cyprus, a fruit exporting company and a packaging
company in Famagusta.

FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome bids to make clarity a virtue -
Andrew Jack explains why the company's report has had a facelift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN shareholders receive the latest annual report from Wellcome later this
month, they should find it easier to read, thanks to an unusual
collaboration between the pharmaceutical company and three academics.
A number of significant changes to the report's writing, format and design
have been made as a result of research into the widely varying patterns of
how different readers use - and understand - the document.
Professor Roger Hussey, David Bence and Catherine Wilkie of the University
of the West of England in Bristol were commissioned by Wellcome to analyse
the responses of 1,124 private shareholders, analysts and institutional
investors to its 1991 report.
Changes that have emerged and will be reflected in the 1992 edition include:
an alternative presentation of cash flow in addition to the format required
by accounting standards, to show it in the form used in internal management
reports;
a detailed, clearly written joint statement from the chairman and chief
executive, describing the company's performance in a format similar to the
management discussion required in US accounts;
more emphasis on clear graphics, diagrams and other illustrations to
highlight financial performance.
Mr John Precious, finance director, says: 'We think these accounts are
fairly radically different and give more information to the average and the
new reader. We believe the accounts are a serious means of communicating
with our shareholders.'
He stresses that work on improving the presentation, content and style of
the Wellcome accounts has been underway for the past several years.
At the heart of the academics' findings lies a paradox. Private shareholders
seem reluctant to read - or have difficulty understanding  - the more
technical parts of accounts. Yet analysts, who ought to be better versed to
take on that task, do not give the reports much attention.
Analysts ranked accounts only the fifth most important source of information
on a company, after preliminary and interim statements, company
presentations and personal interviews.
Private shareholders, by contrast, ranked the accounts second, after press
articles, and just above information gleaned from financial advisers, radio
and television programmes.
Only 10 per cent said they read all the company's report thoroughly,
although 40 per cent read parts thoroughly. But those portions read most
conscientiously were the chairman's statement and the financial highlights.
Few either read or considered very important the notes to the accounts or
the auditors' report.
Only institutional investors - arguably with both the money and the
long-term perspective to consider the information presented in detail -
ranked the annual report most important, jointly with personal interviews.
Their other primary sources were presentations, visits and preliminary
statements.
The institutions were also the only one of the three groups to consider the
notes most important, followed by the balance sheet, profit and loss
account, cash-flow statement and review of products sold.
'We are moving towards a two-tier system,' says Prof Hussey. 'The accounts
are becoming a more complex document used mainly by institutions for
reference purposes, and are over the heads of the great majority.'
He says there is a tension between the 'public relations' text at the front
of the report, and the financial statements controlled by the accountants at
the rear. He stresses the need to make more connections between the two
parts.
All three groups said the main purpose of the company in issuing the annual
report was to comply with legal requirements. They believed that providing
information for investment decisions was less in Wellcome's mind than
presenting a good image and giving an indication of the value of the
company.
They all agreed that the new cash-flow statement was one of the most
difficult part of the accounts to understand - one reason Mr Precious has
provided additional information this year.

FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Sotheby's changes pricing policy as losses
escalate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT and PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOTHEBY'S HOLDINGS is to increase the premium it receives from buyers at its
auctions.
From January 1 1993 the auction house, which is controlled by the
Detroit-based Taubman family and is quoted in London and New York, will
charge 15 per cent on lots sold for Pounds 30,000 or less.
On lots which sell for more than Pounds 30,000 the 15 per cent will be
charged up to that level and 10 per cent on the balance of the price. Until
now Sotheby's had earned its revenue by charging both buyers and sellers 10
per cent of the hammer price on all lots sold.
Christies International, the rival auctioneer, said it had no plans to
increase its buyers' premium from 10 per cent.
The change follows the announcement yesterday that Sotheby's incurred a net
loss of Dollars 7.7m (Pounds 4.72m) for the nine months to September 30,
against a deficit of Dollars 5.4m. Losses per share were 15 cents (11
cents).
However, Mr Michael Ainslie, president and chief executive, said he was
pleased that auction sales for the first nine months had improved - from
Dollars 610m to Dollars 656.4m.
Acquavella, the modern art retail joint venture in New York, while remaining
profitable, contributed less than last time, he said, and this downturn had
more than accounted for the increase in the group's nine-month losses.
Moreover, he added that consignment levels overall were lower than expected
and that full-year profits were likely to be below the Dollars 21.5m level
of last year.
Mr Ainslie said that annual operating costs had been reduced by about
Dollars 45m, or 20 per cent, since 1990. The deficit in the traditionally
loss-making third quarter emerged at Dollars 13.2m (Dollars 11m) or losses
per share of 25 cents (22 cents).
Mr Ainslie said that factors behind the increased losses included
unfavourable exchange rates, the implementation in Europe of the group's
worldwide computer system and the effect of the recently acquired Edmund
Peel &amp; Asociados, the Spanish auction company.
Auction sales in the three months rose to Dollars 88.7m (Dollars 73.1m) and
the third-quarter dividend was held at 15 cents.

FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: New chief at Alexander Proudfoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alexander Proudfoot, the US-based but UK-quoted management consultant which
has been overshadowed this year by sharp falls in profits and its share
price, yesterday appointed a new group chief executive.
Mr John Prosser, formerly managing director for Europe, will fill a role
left vacant since the resignation in July of Mr Thomas Huhn. Since then, the
company has been managed by a management committee, reporting to Lord
Stevens, the chairman.
Yesterday's appointment, which returns the company to a traditional
management structure, partly reflects the poor reception among Proudfoot's
institutional shareholders of management by committee.
Meanwhile Mr Alan Steelman, chief operating officer under the committee, has
resigned.
Proudfoot's shares have fallen from 400p to 75p this year on uncertainty
about the company's trading outlook, embarrassing provisions to cover unpaid
tax bills, and confusion about the company's leadership.
Mr Prosser said Lord Stevens would stay on as chairman, despite the sale
earlier this year by Invesco MIM of its remaining stake in Proudfoot. 'Lord
Stevens is a very effective chairman,' Mr Prosser said.

FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Institutions oppose RHM 'war' - Richard
Gourlay and Roland Rudd find institutional investors less interested in who
finally wins Ranks Hovis McDougall than in what price is paid for the
breadmaker.
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL investors overwhelmingly believe Hanson should not get
involved in a bidding war with Tomkins, which last week trumped the rival
conglomerate's bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall with a higher offer.
Most, however, did not believe that Lord Hanson, the UK's best exponent of
the takeover game, would increase his Pounds 790m cash bid for the UK
milling, baking and grocery products group.
Shareholders appeared less interested in whether Tomkins or Hanson would
better manage RHM and were rather more concerned about the price being paid.
As one opined: 'If Hanson offered 220p a share first time around it would
look odd, to say the least, if it increased its offer by another 30 per cent
or so in order to outbid Tomkins.'
Another said 'I think Hanson had a higher price in mind but not as high as
Tomkins has bid.'
Most investors expressed confidence that the two conglomerates would not get
carried away in a bidding war. 'Both Tomkins and Hanson are very sensitive
to whether this deal dilutes shareholders' value,' said one large
institutional holder of shares in both conglomerates and RHM.
A significant group of shareholders believe Tomkins should be given the
benefit of the doubt over what one called its 'change of direction from
low-tech engineering to bread making'.
Mr Greg Hutchings, Tomkins chief executive, has begun trying to convince
shareholders that acquiring a food company was not a radical departure for
the group. After Tomkins launched its Pounds 935m recommended bid for RHM,
Mr Hutchings began calling institutions to reassure them the deal would not
dilute earnings, even without the sale of some of RHM's grocery brands.
The suspicion of institutions, however, is that Tomkins would be unwilling
over the long term to own and run RHM's grocery brands.
For the first time in Tomkins' 10-year history Mr Hutchings would begin to
operate more like his mentor, Lord Hanson, rapidly selling some of the
assets he hopes to buy.
'My best guess is that after one year and a half the brands will be sold or
about to be sold - particularly to foreign companies like BSN or Philip
Morris which want to get involved in the UK but do not want a hostile
takeover battle,' one investor said.
Most investors did not think it unusual that one of Tomkins' top
institutional investors - Gartmore, which owns 4.4 per cent - should have
chosen not to support the rights issue. But Mr Hutchings still has an uphill
struggle to convince institutions that he has not overpaid.
'Tomkins' rating is going to take a long time to recover from this,' said
one institutional shareholder. 'Instead of being at a premium to the market
I think Tomkins' rating is going to be in line or even below the market
average.'
Pessimism about Tomkins' rating is shared by other shareholders. 'The price
that Tomkins is offering for RHM is more surprising than the change in the
conglomerate's direction,' said one.
'On balance, its offer should be accepted. But I think Tomkins will have to
prove itself quite quickly if it's going to have any chance of returning to
its premium rating of 10 per cent plus to the market.'
Another investor supported this relatively relaxed view about the company's
change of direction. 'Most of what Tomkins has kept fits into the
engineering and capital goods operations,' one institutional investor said.
'Tomkins is still a small company and if he (Hutchings) wants it to be
another Hanson it will have to diversify.'

FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Recovery continues at Holmes Protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLMES PROTECTION, the US security group quoted in the UK, reported
continued progress in its recovery following its recently completed debt
restructuring.
Pre-tax profits in the three months to September 30 totalled Dollars 3.29m
(Pounds 2m) on turnover of Dollars 13.8m, but included a Dollars 2.77m
exceptional gain resulting from the reversal of an acquisition reserve
created in prior years. Earnings per share were 7.8 cents.
In the same period last year there was a Dollars 2.33m pre-tax loss on
turnover of Dollars 14.4m. The group cautioned that the latest results were
not comparable because of changes in accounting policies and the significant
adjustments, which required a Dollars 1.24m exceptional charge to cover
severance pay and the cost of a proxy fight.
The latest results underpin the group's return to profitability in the first
half and lift nine month pre-tax profits to Dollars 4.76m (Dollars 3.73m) on
turnover of Dollars 42.1m (Dollars 44m). Earnings per share came out at 11.2
cents.
Sir Ian MacGregor, chairman, said the recovery was continuing 'despite the
difficult economic environment that persists in the US'. He added that the
group's objective remained to improve profitability by reducing costs,
generating new sales, acquiring subscriber contacts from third parties and
by developing the Dictograph franchise.
He noted that the number of employees had been reduced from 762 last year to
676, and the company had recently acquired subscriber contracts with
recurring revenues of Dollars 168,000 per year.
Sir Ian also said that during September the group bought 100,000 of its
shares in the market at an average price of 45 1/2 p. Holmes' shares were
unchanged last night at 45p.

The company said the division was 'not part of its core businesses'.
Turnover of the division in 1991 was about Pounds 10m. Only the ground
equipment for the company's Orion communications satellite project will
remain associated with BAe through a joint venture with Kingston
Communications, the telecommunications infrastructure operator for the city
of Hull.
Business Television and Services to Broadcasters, which broadcasts to

Turnover dipped from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 13.4m and losses per share were

The company said the reduction of group debt by the Pounds 2.78m raised in
September's placing would improve the balance sheet.

FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Tie Rack back in the black with Pounds
301,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIE RACK, the speciality tie retailer, bounced back into the black at the
half-way stage recording pre-tax profits of Pounds 301,000 compared with a
loss of Pounds 972,000 last time.
The company experienced a healthy improvement in sales, which rose 18 per
cent to Pounds 25.4m in the 28 weeks to August 16, with business-style ties
and Disney products selling particularly strongly.
Existing stores accounted for 11 percentage points of this increase with
five new stores contributing the remainder.
Tie Rack also benefited from a reduction in its cost base and stricter
control of working capital. This led to an operational cash inflow of Pounds
5m yielding Pounds 161,000 in interest income compared with Pounds 490,000
paid out last year.
The company again passed its interim dividend and said it would not be
resumed in the 'foreseeable future'. However, Tie Rack affirmed its
intention to pay a final dividend. Earnings per share came to 0.38p against
losses of 1.75p last time.
The company said it remained 'cautiously confident' about trading prospects.
Mr Nigel McGinley, chief executive, said: 'Trade started off well in August
but we saw quite a marked softening in the middle of September coinciding
with Black Wednesday and the stream of poor economic news.'
However, the company reported that sales had again picked up last week and
it was expecting further increases over the crucial Christmas period.
At the end of the half year, the company traded from 141 stores in the UK
and 121 overseas. Fourteen more stores will have been added by Christmas.
Tie Rack continued to incur losses in the US, although it said the business
was on an improving trend.
Its first franchised store in the Far East opened in Hong Kong during the
period.

FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Pru takes lead on 'accruals accounting'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRUDENTIAL Corporation, Britain's largest life assurance company, yesterday
restated its 1991 earnings under the new 'accruals accounting' rules,
showing for the first time shareholders' interest in the life funds, valued
at Pounds 2.4bn.
Under the new method, pre-tax profits for 1991 were restated to Pounds 620m,
or 20.3p per share, against the previously declared profit of Pounds 267m,
or 7.5p per share.
Mr Mike Lawrence, Prudential's group finance director, said the
accruals-based earnings were not intended to substitute for the company's
cash accounting, but would supplement it.
Prudential's share price fell 8p before recovering to close just 2 1/2 lower
at 276p, with analysts saying that the Pounds 2.4bn stake attributed to
shareholders was at the low end of what they had expected.
Analysts said that the value of the new accounting would increase as more
companies shifted to its use. Several other companies, including Britannia
Life and BAT, are said to be preparing similar accounting reports.
Mr Lawrence said that the restated earnings would not result in higher
dividends. However, it could bolster the Pru's share price if it encouraged
greater understanding of the company's true value.
Although the stake is attributable to shareholders, it is not available to
them because of regulatory restrictions. However, the new accruals-based
system of accounting allows shareholders to see the size of their stake -
something they cannot do under present accounting rules.
However, insurance industry analysts awarded Prudential high marks for the
exercise, the first to be completed by a British insurer since the
Association of British Insurers recommended experimenting with accruals
accounting.
The procedure is currently voluntary although the ABI will consider whether
it should become the industry standard after a three-year experiment.
For the first time, analysts are able to see the profitability of key
portions of Prudential's business. For instance, it recorded a Pounds 15m
profit on sales of Pounds 300m single-premium with-profits bonds in 1991,
the new figures show.
Under accruals accounting, life companies may recognise profits as they
occur instead of the current system which does not recognise any product's
profitability until it matures.

FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Teredo directors under threat from
dissidents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISSIDENT shareholders in Teredo Petroleum, the USM-quoted oil and gas
producer, are seeking an extraordinary meeting to consider ousting three of
the four directors. The proposal is to replace them with three former
executives of Sovereign Oil and Gas, acquired by Neste of Finland.
Mr David Biggins, chairman of Europa Oils, the trio's investment vehicle
which owns 4.6 per cent of Teredo, said their experience at Sovereign would
enable them to strengthen the board.
He claimed that money raised in rights issues had been 'frittered away' over
the past few years, while the market value had fallen from more than Pounds
20m to about Pounds 4m. He suggested that the company should be
recapitalised and become more international.
The directors that he and his colleagues, Mr Peter Tory and Mr Peter Smith,
plan to replace are Mr Peter Simonis, chairman, Mr Ray Godson, managing
director, and his predecessor Mr Michael Seymour.
Mr Godson said the company had recently decided to concentrate on low-risk
development of its existing fields, which are onshore in the UK and Spain.
Although its Pounds 10.5m long-term debt meant gearing was very high, Pounds
5m of that was low-interest loan stock, one of the issues on which the
rebels would like to take action.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Nissan falls into Y14.24bn half-year loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN Motor, Japan's second largest carmaker, yesterday reported heavy
losses and suspended its dividend for the first time, because of weak car
markets and loss of market share in Japan.
The parent company reported a slide into Y14.24bn (Pounds 75m) pre-tax
losses for the six months to September from profits of Y41.46bn a year
earlier. Sales fell 8.5 per cent during the period to Y1,910.8bn, from
Y2,090bn, with unit sales off by 12.5 per cent to 1m, reflecting a sharp
recent decline in Japan's domestic vehicle market.
'The main reason (for the decline) was the simultaneous depression in the
three main markets for cars: Europe, North America and Japan,' said Mr
Atsushi Muramatsu, executive vice-president.
However, Nissan has been losing sales in Japan rapidly. Unit sales were down
20 per cent to 546,778 units, with market share in the first half of the
fiscal year off 1.2 percentage points to 22.2 per cent.
Mr Muramatsu attributed the loss of market share to Nissan's poor offerings
of recreational vehicles, which are popular in Japan.
He also said a company policy to seek higher margins rather than market
share had been carried out too rigidly, and hinted that Nissan would attempt
to sell more vehicles by means of greater discounting.
Although Nissan did not report consolidated results, Mr Muramatsu said these
would likely be worse than those of the parent company, as many of Nissan's
sales subsidiaries were in loss.
Mr Muramatsu said Nissan expected to break even in the second half of the
year and return to profitability next fiscal year, on the assumption that
the market would stay flat. Analysts however regard this outlook as highly
optimistic given the recent heavy decline in Nissan sales.
Mr Kanemitsu Anraku, general manager, said Nissan had gained Y21bn by
cost-cutting and productivity increases. However, these gains were more than
offset by Y45bn of sales losses, Y5bn in net foreign exchanges losses, and
Y10bn in net higher labour costs and depreciation.
Net profits from securities sales were down to Y1.2bn from Y9bn. Appraisal
losses on securities stemming from the decline of the Tokyo stock market
rose from Y0.6bn to Y3.9bn.
On a net after-tax basis, Nissan lost Y21.99bn compared with a profit of
Y24.3bn last year.
Nissan announced no new measures to cope with the fall in the business. Mr
Muramatsu said the company would seek to reduce costs by gradually extending
the model life of cars.
The company also sought to lift labour productivity by 10 per cent a year
for the next three years. Overtime work was being eliminated, the
organisation was being streamlined, and more company personnel were being
assigned to the sales force. Nissan's basic strategy, however, remained to
cut costs and wait for the market to improve.
Nissan, whose credit rating has recently been lowered by the main credit
agencies, will face heavy refinancing requirements during the next year,
with Dollars 500m in bonds coming due in February, and Y1.5bn in warrant
bonds maturing next year.
Nissan projected a Y20bn net loss for the year on sales of Y4,050bn. The
company expected to pay a final dividend of Y7 per share, half of last
year's full payout.

FT  03 NOV 92 / GM board chooses chief executive: Decision to appoint
non-executive chairman breaks company tradition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jack Smith, who turned around General Motors' European operations in the
1980s, was yesterday appointed chief executive of the struggling US company
in a sweeping management shake-up. GM also halved its quarterly dividend.
Mr Smith, aged 54 and group president for the past seven months, replaces Mr
Robert Stempel, who resigned last week as chairman and chief executive under
pressure from GM's non-executive directors. They argued that he was not
moving with sufficient urgency to stem losses in the company's North
American vehicle operations.
Mr John Smale, leader of the outside directors' revolt, was elected
non-executive chairman at a board meeting in New York which also shook up
the ranks of GM's senior management.
Three prominent executives closely associated with the old GM regime have
taken early retirement along with Mr Stempel, apparently following board
pressure; and the company's management committee, which sets strategy, has
been reconstituted as a much younger, five-man team led by Mr Smith.
GM yesterday stressed that Mr Smale, 65 and a former chairman of Procter &amp;
Gamble, the consumer products group, will not be an officer of the company
or run it.
The division of power between a non-executive chairman and chief executive
breaks with a long tradition, at both GM and US companies generally, of
combining the two offices. It will give a fillip to the US movement for
better corporate governance  - how businesses are run - which has long
advocated such a split.
The board also cut GM's quarterly dividend from 40 cents to 20 cents, saying
that market conditions in the US and Europe were highly uncertain and it was
critically important the company continued its capital investment in new
vehicles.
The move had been widely expected on Wall Street and GM's shares closed at
Dollars 31 7/8 , up Dollars 1 1/8 , in a positive reaction to the management
changes.
Yesterday's action caps a meteoric rise for Mr Smith, who was head of GM's
international operations until last April. That was when a non-executive
board coup led to his appointment as president and head of the troubled
North American operations, with a mandate to turn them around quickly.
Mr Smith will now be responsible for all operations worldwide, including its
non-automotive defence, financial services and information services
businesses.
Another beneficiary of the shake-up is Mr William Hoglund, 58, previously
the chief financial officer, who has been elected to the GM board and is to
head a new corporate affairs and staff support group. He will assist Mr
Smith in managing the troubled north American auto operations.
The three executives who have taken early retirement are Mr Robert Schultz,
62, group vice-chairman; Mr Lloyd Reuss, 56, who was in charge of north
American automotive operations until Mr Smith replaced him in April; and Mr
F. Alan Smith, 61, an executive vice-president in charge of the corporate
support group.
However, Mr Roger Smith, chairman of GM until 1990 and a man blamed by
critics for many of GM's problems, remains on the group's board, contrary to
rumours that fellow directors might pressure him to step down.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Hanson bid hinges on RHM response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON's advisers said yesterday the Anglo-US conglomerate was unlikely to
enter a bidding war with Tomkins for Ranks Hovis McDougall unless
information from the baking and grocery products group is deemed to be new.
Morgan Grenfell, RHM's adviser, replied yesterday to an eight-page letter
from Hanson's adviser, NM Rothschild, asking questions about RHM's business.
Under Takeover Panel rules, RHM is obliged to pass on information given to
Tomkins which is specifically asked for by Hanson.
Hanson said it would study Morgan Grenfell's reply before deciding whether
to increase its bid or walk away. The Anglo-US conglomerate last week saw
its hostile Pounds 790m bid trumped by Tomkins' agreed bid.
With Tomkins shares closing 11 1/2 p up at 223 1/2 p, its share offer values
each RHM share at 258p. There is a cash alternative of 260p which values the
ordinary shares at Pounds 935m, including Pounds 10m for the preference
shares.
Hanson said its offer of 220p for each RHM share was fair based on
information it had at the time.
Unless RHM has disclosed new financial material made available to Tomkins,
which Hanson believes justifies Tomkins' higher bid, Hanson is expected to
walk away.
Hanson wants RHM both for financial and strategic reasons. The latter being
its desire to create a core business centred around UK food products.
However, a Hanson adviser underlined the conglomerate's determination not to
'overpay' if it decided RHM had not disclosed new information. According to
an RHM adviser the reply to Hanson's request did not contain much new
information.
Meanwhile, Tomkins has revamped its presentation to institutional
shareholders to try to answer reservations about its apparent change of
direction into the food sector.
Mr Greg Hutchings, Tomkins chief executive, said: 'Some people have been
concerned that we we will be re-rated as a food company. This is not true.
We are a management company of mature businesses.'
He said the new presentation provided more clues as to what Tomkins would do
with RHM.

FT  03 NOV 92 / GE may buy 20% stake in large Austrian bank

THE AUSTRIAN finance ministry has confirmed that it is interested in selling
a 20 per cent stake in Creditanstalt, the country's second largest bank, to
General Electric of the US.
Mr Ferdinand Lacina, a spokesman for the ministry, said the finance minister
had been approached by GE management during the annual meetings of the
International Monetary Fund in Washington in September.
GE said it was not its policy to comment on rumours or reports of this kind.
The Austrian government holds 49 per cent of Creditanstalt's equity, but is
committed to further share sales as part of its privatisation policy.
A Creditanstalt spokesman confirmed that GE had expressed a 'basic interest'
in buying a share stake.
Financial analysts in Vienna speculated that GE's interest related to
Creditanstalt's contacts in eastern Europe. These date from before the first
world war, when the bank was the largest in the former Austro-Hungarian
empire.
The bank has worked hard to revive its bases in eastern Europe in the past
three years, opening subsidiaries in Budapest, Prague, Warsaw and Ljubljana
and setting up investment banking operations.
It has also played a pivotal role in the privatisation process in
Czechoslovakia, setting up large investment trusts with citizens'
privatisation vouchers.
The Creditanstalt group also has large industrial holdings, including
majority stakes in Wienerberger Baustoffindustrie, the fast growing building
materials group and Steyr-Daimler-Puch, the engineering group.
The Austrian government reduced its stake in Creditanstalt from 60 per cent
to 49 per cent a few years ago, but still holds a majority of the voting
shares. It has been committed to selling more of its shares, and
Creditanstalt directors have been actively negotiating with potential
strategic partners, which have not until recently included GE. However, with
the slump in the Austrian stock market, the government has not been pressing
the pace to sell its shares, and the finance ministry spokesman said
yesterday that a sale to GE was not imminent.
The bank had total assets of Sch514.2bn (Pounds 30.4bn) at the end of June.

FT  03 NOV 92 / AB Foods declines 11% to Pounds 297m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASSOCIATED British Foods, owner of the UK's largest baker, and British
Sugar, yesterday reported an 11 per cent drop in profits and its first fall
in earnings per share since 1978, mainly because of lower investment income
and price cutting in the wholesale bread market.
Mr Garry Weston, chairman, said: 'It's not too happy, but it's been a very
tough year.'
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 332m to Pounds 297m in the year to
September 12, in line with market expectations. Earnings per share fell from
49p to 43.7p.
Turnover increased 12.7 per cent to Pounds 3.95bn, helped by the first full
contribution from British Sugar.
British Sugar, acquired in January last year for Pounds 880m from Berisford
International, reported trading profits of Pounds 139m on sales of Pounds
699m. This helped lift European profits 15.5 per cent to Pounds 238m. Mr
Weston said ABF had spent more than Pounds 70m improving British Sugar's
cost structure, including the closure of two plants. Benefits would begin to
show this year, he said.
Net investment income fell from Pounds 89m to Pounds 26m, partly reflecting
a full year of acquisition costs for British Sugar and lower interest rates.
However, net cash was almost unchanged at Pounds 409m because of strong cash
generation.
ABF was forced to cut bread prices for the second year running, by 2 per
cent to 3 per cent because of overcapacity and the buying power of large
retailers. 'The situation has not stabilised going into the new year,' Mr
Weston said.
Rationalisation costs of Pounds 15m in baking were taken above the line.
Property profits fell Pounds 6m to Pounds 1m and adverse currency movements
cost a further Pounds 7m.
Non-baking European operations, which include Twinings tea and Ryvita,
performed well. Retailing, which includes two supermarket chains in Ireland,
was affected by price cutting by competitors. Trading profits were unchanged
at Pounds 45m helped by currency factors.
At the interim stage, ABF reported a 5.4 per cent fall in profits to Pounds
175.2m.
The company made extraordinary charges of Pounds 30m (Pounds 112m) to cover
further write-downs on its 19.7 per cent stake in Berisford and 1.2 per cent
stake in Hillsdown Holdings.
A second interim dividend of 5.5p (4.5p) is declared to give a total of 14p
(13p), a 7.7 per cent increase. ABF shares were unchanged at 443p.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Fear of new IRA mainland campaign
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RUC CHIEF Constable Sir Hugh Annesley yesterday warned of a heightened IRA
terror campaign on the British mainland with more and bigger bombs.
The latest outbreak of violence in London, he said, was only a foretaste of
what might happen. It was clear that militarists now held sway within the
republican movement.
Sir Hugh told the BBC Northern Ireland programme Inside Ulster that lives
had been saved and damage prevented because of interruptions to IRA attacks
in London.
But he warned: 'It would be nave to think the Provisional IRA are not
planning a major attack on the British mainland.'
The provisionals, he said, were well armed and determined to keep going,
even though a debate was in progress within the republican movement.
'Those who are intent on pursuing violence are perhaps holding the majority
sway now within the IRA army council,' Sir Hugh said.
He said loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland posed a 'significant
threat' in the Irish Republic.
Meanwhile, the Association of Chief Police Officers defended the present
structure of police ranks, saying the way the structure was used was more
pertinent than any debate about 'losing ranks'.
Its comments were in response to the Sheehy inquiry into police rewards and
duties.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Cabinet resolved to keep spending
inside limit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's determination to stick to the Pounds 244.5bn planning total
for next year was underlined by Downing Street as the cabinet met yesterday
afternoon and evening in the first of an intensive series of meetings this
week to try to thrash out an agreement.
At the end of the 4 1/2 -hour discussion, Downing Street said that 'good
progress was made' in this, the first time the cabinet had looked at
individual departments' spending programmes, rather than the overall total
and strategy.
The final deal is expected to be reached at Thursday's cabinet meeting. Mr
John Major has not ruled out holding bilateral discussions with individual
spending ministers before then in an effort to break through the
difficulties.
In spite of what is admitted to be the 'political flak' of cutting back on
some programmes, senior officials emphasised that the basis of the
discussions was allocating the total that had been agreed by the cabinet in
the summer. 'They are not working on any options that breach Pounds
244.5bn,' one said yesterday.
Thursday's cabinet meeting is likely to discuss ways of bringing
private-sector investment to projects. That was signalled by Mr Major to
backbenchers last week, among measures to accompany the Autumn Statement.
At present the rules are still being discussed within the Treasury, but will
go to the cabinet because they have a bearing on what public spending may be
agreed.
For example, the decision on how the Jubilee Line extension to London's
Docklands counts in the public-expenditure calculations may critically
affect what other programmes can be afforded.
Other options being looked at by the Treasury include operating leases for
British Rail services; and joint ventures between public and private sector
such as in the building of sports facilities.
Further meetings of EDX, the cabinet committee on public spending which is
chaired by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, are scheduled for tomorrow and
Thursday, to work on the details of whatever is agreed in the further
cabinet meetings, which continue this morning.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday warned Mr Major to draw
back from making cuts in public services, and challenged the prime minister
'to stand by promises made during the election when he said that cutting
public spending would not be 'an economically sensible thing to do''.
As ministers got to grips with the difficulty of keeping to the agreed
total, there were fresh opposition protests at the prospect that social
security benefits, which have been identified as a likely casualty of the
spending round, might not be uprated to match inflation.
In the Commons, Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow social security secretary, said
there would be 'a sense of outrage' if those on benefit were 'put in the
firing line' to help Mr Lamont.
But Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, refused to confirm that
the government's public-spending plans would not undermine manifesto
commitments to uprate child benefit and the basic state pension according in
line with inflation.

   THE BIG four brewers
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bass, Allied-Lyons, Courage and Whitbread  - have undertaken to supply
yearly details of the size and composition of their pub estates to the
Office of Fair Trading.
The information will enable the OFT to monitor compliance with the
government's orders requiring the national brewers to dispose of 12,000
pubs, about a third of their estates, by last weekend.
As a result of the orders, national brewers own 31.6 per cent of the
country's pubs, compared with 43 per cent in 1986.
The weakening of the brewers' grip  - initiated by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission report on the industry in 1989  - was intended to
'increase competition in brewing, wholesaling and retailing . . . reduce
prices and widen consumer choice'. A report is expected from the OFT next
year on the extent to which those aims have been achieved.
The results, so far, have fallen well short of the targets. The disposal of
the national brewers' pubs has opened the retail market to many new,
independent pub companies and enabled the regional brewers to strengthen
their pub estates.
But the restructuring has cost the nationals an estimated Pounds 500m, and
in the resulting turmoil many tenants have lost their livelihoods and up to
2,000 pubs have closed.
The dispersal of pub ownership has been matched by increased consolidation
of beer production. Several companies have quit brewing to concentrate on
their more profitable retailing operations. Grand Metropolitan sold its
breweries to Courage; Boddington, Devenish, and Greenalls closed their
regional breweries.
In 1989, the six largest brewers controlled 77 per cent of production; when
the proposed merger of Allied's brewing operations with those of Carlsberg
is completed, 82 per cent of production will be in the hands of five
companies.
Competition between national brewers to supply the enlarged 'free' market
has increased; but each has maintained beer supplies to most of the pubs it
has sold or leased by negotiating long-term contracts with the new owners.
Consumer choice has been only marginally improved.
Bar prices, far from falling, have increased by 17 per cent above inflation
during the past three years.

losing inward investment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH EC Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan warned yesterday that Britain was
in danger of losing inward investment if it failed to ratify the Maastricht
Treaty.
'A number of important business ventures are being delayed, are holding
fire, because people in Japan or the United States are asking themselves the
question: is Britain going to be really going ahead with its partners or is
Britain going to be holding back?'
If Britain failed to ratify the treaty, he said, 'the damaging effect would
be on the whole country'.
Sir Leon, above (right) with Tory MP Hugh Dykes, said this scenario had been
the nightmare of all politicians for a generation.

He said the government was considering what assistance it could provide to

Mr Clarke faced a barrage of protests from Labour MPs when he sought to

removal from Britain of bogus applicants for political asylum.
The bill was given a second reading by a government majority of 45
(321-276).

FT  03 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour seeks to woo rebel Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday sought to woo Tory Euro-sceptics with an amendment for
tomorrow's debate on Europe which would simply delay consideration of the
Maastricht bill until after the Edinburgh summit, Alison Smith writes.
Even as Labour courted potential Tory rebels, however, they continued also
to stiffen the resolve of opposition MPs by emphasising that the government
itself was treating the motion as one of confidence.
The amendment argues that the conditions set out for continuing with the
bill which Mr John Major set out in the Commons' emergency debate in
September  - that the position of the Danes had been clarified and the
question of subsidiarity, or minimum interference, had been settled  - have
not been fulfilled, and cannot be met until the Edinburgh EC council at the
earliest.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, is confident that, despite accusations
from the government and from the Liberal Democrats of Labour U-turns over
Europe, the party can still convincingly claim to be pro-European.
A Labour conference this weekend on Europe will be the opportunity for Mr
Smith to underline the party's commitment to the Maastricht treaty as agreed
by the other 11 EC member states, without the 'opt-outs' on economic and
monetary union and on the social chapter that were negotiated by Mr Major
last year.
The party's Euro-credentials will be reinforced by the presence at the
conference of leading European socialists, including Mr Paul Rasmussen, the
leader of the Danish social democrats.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems rally to support of
government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBERAL Democrats, enjoying a rare taste of real political influence, found
themselves yesterday set apart from other opposition parties after rallying
behind a pledge to back the government motion in tomorrow's Maastricht
debate.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, has badly bruised relations between Liberal
Democrat and Labour MPs by insisting that his attachment to European union
is paramount.
Of the party's 20 MPs, 19 are expected to vote with the government. Talk of
a possible 'anti-Tory' alliance that emerged immediately after the general
election has all but disappeared.
One Liberal Democrat official, perhaps scuppering hopes of anything but the
loosest of pacts before the next general election, said that any new
alternative to the Conservatives had to be pro-Europe. 'We will have done
everyone a favour by setting that out very clearly,' he said.
Party managers were trying to counter Labour's assertion that the issue at
stake was the government's handling of Maastricht, ridiculing suggestions
that a defeat would lead Mr John Major to call a general election. The
party's MPs said that only if the prime minister was explicit in turning the
debate into an issue of confidence would the Liberal Democrat position
change.
One rebel is Mr Nick Harvey, the Liberal Democrat MP for Devon north and
party transport spokesman. He is expected to defy the party leadership and
vote against the government.
He appeared last night, however, to be the only exception. Ms Liz Lynne, the
Liberal Democrat MP for Rochdale, who Labour and Tory party managers had
privately suggested might rebel, confirmed that she would be voting for the
government motion.
She said: 'It is the line that the Liberals and that the Liberal Democrats
have always taken on Europe. I don't see it as a confidence vote.'
Liberal Democrats are becoming increasingly isolated among the opposition
parties. Scottish and Welsh nationalist have urged them to reconsider.
Mr Alex Salmond, Scottish Nationalist Party leader, said: 'Surely the
Liberal Democrats realise that the natural place for them is to be in the
lobby with the rest of the opposition and not in the lobby with a foundering
Tory government.'

FT  03 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht machinations turn to
maths
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, DAVID OWEN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WAR of words over the Maastricht debate succumbed to
back-of-the-envelope mathematics yesterday as the whispering in the Commons
lobbies turned to claims and counter-claims over the relative strengths of
the government and its opponents.
The Tory rebels 'officially' claimed last night that at least 40
Conservative backbenchers were 'rock hard' in their determination to oppose
the government in the Maastricht debate tomorrow night.
That optimistic figure was swiftly undermined by the rider that many rebels
will take their final decision at a key meeting on tactics to be held in the
Commons tonight.
Sobering independent calculations put the likely number prepared to vote
against the government at slightly under 30, with several more moving
towards the abstentionist camp. But the outlook was further confused by the
range of options facing the dissidents.
At their strategy meeting, the Euro-sceptics must choose between outright
opposition by voting against the government motion, abstention, or
supporting the Labour amendment. There are no guarantees that they will all
choose the same.
From the government's perspective, leaving aside the Conservative party,
their support is crucially boosted by 20 votes  - 19 Liberal Democrats and
one Ulster Popular Unionist.
Ranged against them are 268 Labour votes (one MP may abstain or vote with
the government) and 15 more comprising seven Scottish and Welsh
nationalists, three Democratic Unionists, four Social and Democratic Labour
party MPs and one Liberal Democrat. The nine Ulster Unionists are also
expected to oppose, but full attendance cannot be guaranteed. Nor have they
ruled out deciding at their meeting tomorrow that they would abstain if it
looked as though a defeat for the government might force an election which
Labour was well-placed to win. That creates a potential opposition of 292.
With its 20 allies, the government's total notional support (providing it
can count on all its 334 MPs) would be 354  - a 62-vote majority. That
means, technically at least, the Tory rebellion must equal 32 votes to
overturn the government.
Wednesday's figures might prove quite different from that theoretical
exercise. It may be that fewer than 32 vote against. The rebels might still
win if there are more abstentions than expected among MPs considered
loyalists.
Experienced Commons vote counters, however, say history shows rebellions
almost always fail to achieve the lofty claims made by their leaders.
An experienced Labour parliamentarian last night predicted that the
government would not possibly be defeated.
'At the very best, we will give them a good scare,' he said, 'and badly
weaken John Major into the bargain.'

FT  03 NOV 92 / European Court to hear pension case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of 78 female employees challenging their employer's right to raise
their retirement age to 65 have had their case referred to the European
Court of Justice by an industrial tribunal.
The women, whose case has been taken up by the Equal Opportunities
Commission, are employees of Avdel Systems, an engineering company based in
Welwyn Garden City, Herts.
In July 1991 Avdel raised its retirement age to 65 from 60, in line with
that of male employees, following a decision by the European Court that
employers may not offer different pension benefits to men and women.
If they still retired at 60, the commission said, 'This means they would
have to take up to a 20 per cent cut in their pension payments.'
The women complained to the industrial tribunal that their employer was
acting unfairly by unilaterally changing the age at which they were eligible
for a full pension.
In 1991 the European Court, in the landmark case Barber v Guardian Royal
Exchange, ruled that companies which required men to work until the age of
65 before receiving full pension benefits while requiring women to work only
until 60 were discriminating against men.
In response, many British companies moved to equalise pension ages, mostly
by raising the normal retirement age for women to 65.
In the case of the female employees, Avdel agreed the case should be
referred to the European Court for judgment because employers needed to know
their legal position, the commission said.
The court is scheduled to hear arguments in January by representatives of
the Coloroll Pension Scheme intended to settle some of the questions about
the equalisation of pensions.
Ms Vereena Jones, a lawyer for the commission, which is representing the
Avdel female workers, said, 'There are a number of pensions cases waiting to
be heard in Europe. The commission feels sure that the European Court would
not want employers in Britain to implement the Barber judgment by depriving
women of their own pension rights.'

He said the government was considering what assistance it could provide to
local authorities around London airport and other points of entry whose

Mr Clarke faced a barrage of protests from Labour MPs when he sought to

He also came under attack over the provisions in the Asylum and Immigration
Appeals bill removing the current right of appeal available to relatives of
British residents refused entry into Britain for visits of up to six months'
duration.
Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, said the bill was 'profoundly
flawed' in spite of improvements made since an earlier version was
jettisoned to make way for last April's general election.
Mr Clarke accused Mr Blair of acting like a 'barrack-room lawyer' in a
series of clashes over the implications of a provision designed to limit to
48 hours the time available for appeals by those whose applications for
political asylum had been ruled to be unfounded by immigration officials at
the ports.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Council union attacks tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 60 council workers have lost their jobs after Brent Council in
north London introduced 'competency' tests as part of its redundancy
selection process.
The council is shedding jobs ahead of the introduction of the council tax
and 200 staff sat the three-hour written tests and attended interviews.
The introduction of appraisals is consistent with action by many employers
who have moved away from traditional last-in-first-out methods of selecting
staff for redundancy. Employers are increasingly concerned about losing
efficient and highly qualified staff.
The Nalgo local-government union said: 'We are concerned the tests may be
used as an excuse for the council to get rid of staff on grounds of race,
sex or anything else it likes.'
Brent Council said the tests were compiled by the British Psychological
Society, approved by the Equal Opportunities Commission, and results would
be 'checked and double-checked' by managers.
Meanwhile, at Islington Council, more than 700 workers yesterday defied
warnings that they would lose enhanced severance agreements and the
opportunity of redeployment by continuing with strike action over up to 300
job losses. The council wants to select staff for redundancies on the basis
of performance and length of service.
Workers have been on strike since September 4 over the council's refusal to
guarantee that no staff will be made compulsorily redundant after the
introduction of cuts of Pounds 16m over two years.
Nalgo said fewer than 30 staff reported for work yesterday

Although the majority of yesterday's group were young MPs with serious

Mr Major used the hour-long meeting to allow backbenchers ask about aspects
of Maastricht that particularly concerned them.
One newly elected MP who will vote with the government on Wednesday

FT  03 NOV 92 / TUC delegation will meet Lamont today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, will meet trade union representatives
today to discuss ideas for promoting economic growth.
It will be the first meeting between the Trades Union Congress and the
chancellor since the early 1980s.
The trade union delegation will be headed by Mr Norman Willis, the TUC's
general secretary, and other leading officials from the TUC's executive
council and emergency energy committee, representing thousands of employees
in the public and private sectors.
The TUC requested a meeting with Mr Lamont last month, when the chancellor
said he would be listening to the views of industry ahead of the Autumn
Statement next week.
A TUC official said yesterday: 'We are glad that he is seeing us as part of
that process.'
The TUC plans to restate the main points of its recent economic policy
statement, A Call for Action, which emphasises the need for growth. It also
wants a public investment programme and a long-term recovery plan based on
specific industrial sectors.
After 1983, when Mr Nigel Lawson became chancellor, communication between
the Treasury and the TUC was channelled through the National Economic
Development Office. Nedo is being wound down and will be abolished at the
end of the year.
The Treasury said that in spite of the demise of Nedo 'it would be useful to
have an exchange of views'.
Public-sector pay is likely to feature heavily in the discussions. There has
been much speculation in the press that Mr Lamont will announce limits - or
even a freeze - on public-sector pay increases, even though that would
involve considerable technical and political difficulties.
One TUC official said: 'If the government is going to have a public-sector
pay policy we want to know what they are going to do. Are they going to
scrap indexation arrangements or are they going to scrap the review bodies?'
TUC officials see themselves as representing a broad-based coalition of
political protest against recent government decisions.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey warns on funds for training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS in a survey published by the Industrial Society have warned the
government strongly not to cut publicly funded training programmes and
initiatives.
Most managers, according to the survey, believed that possible cuts in
funding for Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs), which administer
publicly funded training, would damage training. Nearly a quarter said such
a move would be 'very damaging'.
Tecs, with growing numbers of unemployed, particularly the long-term
unemployed, have asked that no cuts be made to their budget of Pounds 2.4bn
a year. According to the survey of 528 companies, there has been a dip over
the past six months in training spending by companies.
Many trade unions would like to negotiate on training, but the survey said
that only 6 per cent of managers in the survey treated training as a matter
for negotiation with unions and only a further 2 per cent were considering
it.
Nearly two thirds of the companies surveyed described their companies as
largely 'traditional' at present in terms of industrial relations, but 52
per cent expected their companies to cut management layers and move towards
'empowering' individuals.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Dilemma at the pits as payout time ticks away: Miners are
taking sides over whether to apply for redundancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, CHRIS TIGHE and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINERS at the 10 pits where British Coal has given 90-day statutory notice
of closure face a dilemma. Should they take redundancy now, thereby
improving their chances of getting a new job before their pit is formally
closed, or hope to strengthen the union campaign against closure by staying
put?
Neither choice in itself guarantees a stable future, but already miners are
taking sides. Of the 7,350 employed at the 10 pits, more than 1,000 have
applied for voluntary redundancy. The majority, encouraged by the wave of
popular support, have closed ranks behind their union officials, pledging to
dig in above ground if not below.
Many miners at the 10 remain fearful that by opting to stay put on basic pay
for 90 days, pending a final decision, they might diminish their redundancy
pay, as pay-offs are partly based on their last 12 weeks' wages including
overtime and bonuses.
British Coal has assured miners that redundancy pay will be based on the
last 12 weeks of full work, whenever closure comes, but many remain
unconvinced. 'You can't trust anything Heseltine says, nor any of them,'
said power loader Mr Terry Greener as he left Vane Tempest colliery in
County Durham after the last coal-producing shift on Friday.
The National Union of Mineworkers fears that a surge in the numbers of
miners already volunteering to leave the pits may jeopardise the chance of a
reprieve for any of the 10 and is seeking written confirmation of the
redundancy assurance. 'We're facing a flight of men from the colliery,' said
Mr Tony Mitchell, NUM assistant secretary at Vane Tempest.
What is the financial outlook for miners who take redundancy either now or
later if, after the 90-day review, their pit is closed?
Redundancy pay accounts for about three quarters of the original Pounds 1bn
earmarked to cushion the closure blow, but the sums available are far less
generous than those available until March 1987, when the maximum pay-out was
about Pounds 80,000.
Under the present programme, total redundancy payments (made up of statutory
minimum redundancy and British Coal redundancy) range from Pounds 3,760
(19-year-old miner with three years of service and average weekly earnings
of Pounds 140) to Pounds 37,000 (57-year-old miner with 41 years of service
and average weekly earnings of Pounds 300).
British Coal says that while the maximum amount payable to employees is
Pounds 37,000, the average pay-out will be nearer Pounds 28,000. That is
because the older mineworkers have long since left the industry, leaving an
industry with an average age profile of 36 to 37 years.
British Coal refuses to make available detailed figures on the number of
miners that will fall into specific categories within the programme.
The NUM argues that in practice the programme will disadvantage many young
miners, who will be paid much less that the average that British Coal
claims.
If the miners were to go on strike, they might lose their lump sum
supplements and the British Coal redundancy payment (the bulk of the
package), although they would still be entitled to a minimum statutory
redundancy. The NUM believes it would be most unusual to withdraw redundancy
pay in such circumstances and that it might be able to challenge it in the
courts.
Minimum statutory payments are as follows: age 18 to 21 years, half a week's
wages for every year of service; 22 to 54, a week's wage; 55 years and over,
1 1/2 weeks' wages.
The following examples give an indication of what miners might stand to lose
in the event of a strike: based on average weekly earnings of Pounds 205, a
50-year-old miner with 20 years' service would be left with Pounds 5,022,
while a 23-year-old with seven years' service would end up with as little as
Pounds 615. The government's Pounds 1bn fund to ease the closures is also
intended to be used on pension enhancement, which will allow miners to begin
drawing payments from age 50 rather than 60, the present minimum.
Those in the Mineworkers Pension Scheme who choose to remain in it will have
their deferred pensions increased annually. On the government-guaranteed
portion  - worth about 20 per cent of each pension  - increases will be
equal to those of national average earnings. The remainder will be increased
with the retail prices index, which is typically up to 2 percentage points
lower.
Miners will be entitled to a 60th of their final salary for every year of
membership in the scheme. Thus a 35-year-old miner with 15 years of service
will be entitled to only a quarter of the pension he would have had at 60
had he stayed long enough to collect it.
Meanwhile, miners are free to extract their pensions in a single lump sum
and purchase a personal pension  - a move that will produce less attractive
returns because, among other things, the pension payments will not rise with
inflation.
Mr Paul Trickett, secretary to the Mineworkers Pension Scheme, notes that
personal pensions do not offer death benefits or widows' pensions. 'We've
had several men who have been killed on the job who had bought personal
pensions. Their wives got no insurance benefits,' he said. In one instance,
the National Union of Mineworkers was able to extract an Pounds 11,000
insurance payment for one widow, but had been less successful in other
cases, he said.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Smith visits Vane Tempest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR LEADER John Smith, accompanied by Durham miners general secretary
David Hopper, yesterday visited the threatened County Durham colliery of
Vane Tempest, Chris Tighe writes.
Mr Smith urged the public to keep up the pressure on the government to
reverse the 'foolish' decision to close 31 collieries.
In the first of a series of visits by senior opposition politicians to every
coalfield in Britain, Mr Smith challenged the prime minister to go to see at
first hand the impact of the proposed closures on Britain's energy reserves
and on mining communities. He said coal was one of Britain's important
energy resources but the government had 'rigged' the market after
electricity privatisation.
'It's a deliberate result of the electricity privatisation and the dash for
gas,' he said. 'It's folly from the national interest point of view, and
it's the government we look to to protect our national interest.'
Mr Smith, wearing a Coal Not Dole sticker, said he had come to the Durham
coalfield to show that Labour was standing fully behind the miners and their
communities in their campaign.
After a brief meeting with Mr Tony Gray, Vane Tempest colliery manager, he
met miners from Westoe and Wearmouth collieries in Tyne and Wear, among the
21 pits whose future will be decided by the government's review, and from
Vane Tempest, which has slim prospects beyond the present 90-day
consultation period. In nearby Easington he met miners' families and
community and church leaders.
British Coal says 215 of Vane Tempest's 870 miners have taken voluntary
redundancy in the past three weeks and another 12 have transferred jobs.

LONDON BRICK, Britain's biggest brickmaker, is to make another 340 workers
redundant by the end of the year because of a continuing fall in demand from
the construction industry.
The redundancies, some of which may be compulsory, are at the company's
Stewartby and Kempston works in Bedfordshire.
London Brick is owned by Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate. It has cut its
workforce from about 4,000 in 1989 to 1,750 and blamed the latest cut

FT  03 NOV 92 / World TV starts Canadian service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC WORLD Service Television launched its first North American operation
yesterday with the start of services on CBC's 24-hour Newsworld channel,
giving access to 6.5m homes in Canada.
The move into North America brings closer to reality the promise made this
year by Sir Michael Checkland, director-general of the BBC, that World
Service Television would be available worldwide by the end of next year.
WSTV, a wholly owned, self-funding subsidiary of the BBC, is available on
satellite throughout Asia and Africa. Negotiations are proceeding to make it
available in the US, Australia and the Pacific.
After a deal with Nissho Iwai, the Japanese trading house, a 24-hour news
and information service for Japan awaits final regulatory approval. The
service will be mainly in English, with segments in Japanese.
Eighteen months after its launch, no one knows precisely how big WSTV's
audience is. Mr Jonathan Birchall, the BBC's Singapore correspondent, says
that, after a long trek across mountains to film Karen tribesmen fighting
the Burmese government, he found the rebel leaders watching the news from
London on WSTV. Government ministers and officials in Vietnam are said to be
keen viewers.
Unofficial estimates say WSTV's audience may already be as high as 20m. In
Asia, where it is part of the five-channel Star TV, it can be seen from
Taiwan to Turkey and from Siberia to Sumatra.
Mr Christopher Irwin, chief executive of WSTV, says: 'A vast increase is
taking place in India. The number of viewers is growing by 200 per cent
every three months.'
A study of 38,000 households in 24 urban centres in India found that the BBC
service was available in 20 per cent of the highest-earning, social group A
households.
Regional partnerships have helped the service develop. The company behind
Star TV is part of the Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, and in
Africa the BBC's partners are M-Net, which operates South Africa's
subscription television service.
The BBC has full editorial control and the service originates from a London
studio. This month Mr Irwin signed a deal with Yorkshire Television for 150
hours of programmes a year  - including the award-winning documentary series
First Tuesday.
As WSTV starts to challenge the US broadcaster CNN, Mr Irwin says any
surpluses will, for the time being, go towards enhancing the service.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Officials 'defeatist' on Rosyth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Scottish Office was accused yesterday of taking a defeatist attitude to
the possible closure of the Rosyth naval dockyard when it emerged that
Scottish Enterprise, the development body, is drawing up contingency plans
for alternative uses of the facility.
Scottish Enterprise and the local enterprise companies have been considering
alternative uses for the Rosyth dockyard site, including a business park and
an industrial estate.
A plan for building a roll-on roll-off ferry terminal on land next to the
naval base and adjoining the dockyard is also being examined, although that
could be set up even if the dockyard stays open.
The government should decide shortly whether work on maintaining the new
Trident submarines should go to Rosyth, operated by the Babcock-Thorn
consortium, or to the larger naval dockyard at Devonport in Plymouth. Some
Pounds 120m has already been spent preparing Rosyth as a repair facility for
the submarines.
It is thought that whichever yard loses the Trident work would have to
close. In Rosyth's case, that would involve the loss of 4,000 jobs.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor and Labour MP for Dunfermline East which
includes Rosyth, said the Scottish Office should step up its fight to
persuade the Ministry of Defence to keep Rosyth open, rather than plan for
the aftermath of closure. It was doing things in the wrong order.
He also rejected as unacceptable suggestions in the Scottish press that if
Rosyth closed as a dockyard it could still be used for the dismantling of
the navy's nuclear-powered submarines. Three decommissioned hunter-killer
submarines and one Polaris submarine are already moored in the dockyard.
For Rosyth both to lose its dockyard and become a 'nuclear graveyard' was
unacceptable to Scotland, he said.
Scottish Enterprise said contingency planning for 'a variety of
eventualities' was sensible in the light of 'recent press speculation'.

FT  03 NOV 92 / ICI blames closures on cost of power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, DAVID LASCELLES and DAVID GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI YESTERDAY blamed the cost of electricity for the closure of two chlorine
plants at Hillhouse, near Fleetwood, Lancashire, with the loss of about 100
jobs.
Mr Mike Brogden, chief executive of ICI Chemicals and Polymers, warned of a
long-term threat to more jobs if electricity prices were not brought down to
German levels at least.
He said UK electricity cost ICI Pounds 31 a megawatt hour now, against
Pounds 25 for similar supplies in Germany. US manufacturers of
chlorine-based chemicals pay less than Pounds 20  - the price ICI was
charged before privatisation.
Electricity accounts for about 70 per cent of variable costs, compared with
about 60 per cent before privatisation. The company says it has lost Pounds
30m in sales and Pounds 20m in profits this year because it cannot afford to
run chlorine plants for long enough to meet export demand.
Chlorine production will now be concentrated on ICI's three plants at
Runcorn, one at Wilton, Teesside, and one at Northwich, Cheshire.
Most of the British plastics industry depends on ICI's chlorine production,
but ICI says managers have less than 24 hours' notice of the next day's
electricity price, making sensible planning and budgeting impossible.
Mr Brogden said that ICI had approached the generators, the supply
companies, the regulator, the Department of Trade and Industry, and
ministers including the prime minister. 'We have had tea and sympathy, but
that's all.
'For all of us in manufacturing, the transition of the electricity industry
into a duopoly simply was not adequate to achieve the government's intention
of moving to a true market-based electricity industry in the UK.'
ICI has to buy its electricity at pool prices. Suppliers will not negotiate
long-term contracts at lower levels than can be achieved through the pool.
Electricity for Runcorn's operations, which consume 1 per cent of national
electricity supplies, cost Pounds 26 a megawatt hour last year and rose to
an average Pounds 29 in the first nine months of this year.
As prices rise, ICI will cut production further, eventually creating a
shortage of home-made chlor-chemicals in the UK, which foreign competitors
are likely to fill.
Meanwhile, Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen, called on the
government to 'kick out' the props supporting expensive power if it wants a
more competitive energy market with better prospects for coal.
Mr Wallis made clear that he was referring mainly to state-owned Nuclear
Electric, which operates the nuclear power stations in England and Wales and
receives more than Pounds 1bn a year from the nuclear levy.
He told the Coal Industry Society: 'Nuclear Electric would be insolvent
without the nuclear levy. But with the levy at its present level, Nuclear
Electric is, on paper, the country's most profitable generating company.'
By the middle of this decade, he said, Nuclear Electric would displace the
equivalent of 25m tonnes of coal a year.
'It is able to pre-empt the market by selling its product at whatever price
it likes, and with its new-found riches it is continuing to run beyond their
design life, at considerable expense, plant which the Central Electricity
Generat-ing Board had written off as uneconomic five years ago.'
Nuclear Electric has decided not to go ahead with a planning application for
the Sizewell C power station in Suffolk before the government carries out
its energy review in the wake of the colliery closure programme.
The company had been intending to submit the application early this month.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
KWIK SAVE, the supermarket chain, was fined more than Pounds 19,000
yesterday for offences ranging from selling rancid and mouldy meat to having
high bacteria counts in cheese.
The prosecution was brought by trading standards officers who discovered
food on sale after its 'use by' date at five stores in Knowsley Borough,
Merseyside.
The company pleaded guilty at Kirkby Magistrates Court to 15 charges,
including selling six packs of sausages containing fat that had gone rancid
and two packets of meat contaminated with mould.
It was also prosecuted for offering Danish Blue cheese that was unfit
because of its bacteria count, and having food on sale at temperatures of up
to 20 degrees when it should have been stored at no higher than 8 degrees.
The chain was fined Pounds 19,200 with Pounds 4,700 costs for the offences
under the Food Safety Act.
The company said it had undertaken internal investigations 'and we are
satisfied that this was a one-off case. We have spent considerable time and
effort to make sure this doesn't happen again'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH security was first told in May 1988 that Iraq was planning to build
a gun capable of firing large shells, it was claimed at the Old Bailey
yesterday.
Mr Mark Gutteridge, an employee of Matrix Churchill, the machine tool
manufacturer, told MI5 then about Iraqi plans to co-operate with SRC, the
company run by the late Mr Gerald Bull, to build a 210mm shell, Mr Geoffrey
Robertson QC told the court.
'This was the first inkling of the supergun, ' he said.
An MI5 officer, giving evidence anonymously, said Mr Gutteridge, his
contact, had talked to him about SRC but he could not now remember details
of the conversation.
Their relationship was typical of those between MI5 and businessmen, he said
 -a fine balance of asking for help for the best of reasons and the possible
commercial consequences.
Three former Matrix Churchill directors, Mr Paul Henderson, Mr Trevor
Abraham and Mr Peter Allen, all deny breaching export regulations by
pretending that machine tools exported to Iraq were for civil, not military,
use.
The trial continues today.

imminent' risks from the recession, according to a leading actuary and
consultant.
Mr Tim Gardener of Mercer Fraser, one of the UK's top three firms of pension
consultants, told a meeting of 150 senior investment managers last night:
'It is possible that the next big pension scandal will not be caused by
fraud but may instead be caused by the combined effect of optimistic
actuarial assumptions and an inappropriate asset strategy.
'The problems and dangers are now so acute that it is time for us to advise
our clients actively.'
If those views are accepted by pension funds, the equity market may suffer
badly. On the other hand, there may be positive implications for the
government, which will need to sell vast quantities of gilt-edged securities
over the next few years.
Mr Gardener said that traditional balanced management - investment in a
variety of assets such as equities, bonds and property at the managers'
discretion - was out of date. The average fund now has more than 85 per cent
of its assets in equities, failing to provide adequate diversification.
Pension funds, Mr Gardener said, were providing protection against long-term
inflation, but the real risk in the short term was the recession.
That affected the increasing number of mature schemes - those paying out
large amounts of current pensions.
Mr Gardener warned:
Pension fund surpluses were beginning to run out after two years of low
dividend growth.
Much of the surplus remaining is caused by actuaries writing up assets above
market value because of expectations of dividend growth.
Dividend growth has fallen below the commonly assumed 4 1/2 per cent to 5
per cent a year and there could be 'nasty surprises' as companies are forced
to raise their pension contributions.
As head of the asset planning services division of Mercer Fraser, Mr
Gardener suggested to investment managers that mature schemes should move
towards a better balance, with a higher proportion of bonds.
Only immature schemes with few early pension liabilities could safely follow
a higher-equity strategy, and in fact an all-equity benchmark might be
appropriate for them.
Mr Gardener concluded: 'Traditional balanced fund management is no longer
relevant. It is no longer balanced, it protects against the wrong risks, and
unless the UK and the rest of the world make a sharp recovery from recession
the risks are real and imminent.'

FT  03 NOV 92 / Lenders shun home rentals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS BY a building society to rent out repossessed properties on a large
scale are not expected to be followed by its rivals.
Bradford &amp; Bingley, the seventh-biggest building society in the UK, is to
put 400 of its 2,000 repossessed properties up for rent over the next 12
months. The scheme will provide income from homes that cannot be sold in the
depressed housing market to help maintain the properties.
Bradford &amp; Bingley said that homes left unoccupied quickly fall into
disrepair. But the scheme, which has been approved by the Building
Societies' Commission, does not appear to be attracting the interest of
other lenders.
Britain's two biggest building societies, Halifax and Nationwide, already
rent out repossessed properties but only in special circumstances.
Halifax prefers to sell repossessed properties to Housing Associations for
them to rent, rather than take on rentals itself, it said.
'Our main concern is keeping people in the properties to begin with,' the
building society added.
Nationwide rents out repossessed homes on a case-by-case basis as part of a
'range of ideas' to help the housing market.
Nationwide said: 'We have a duty to do what's best for the borrower. The
longer a property remains on the market, the bigger the interest payments
accrued.'
Mortgage lenders have 68,000 repossessed properties on their books and find
it difficult to find buyers while the market remains so weak.
However, the government's decision to make state payments of mortgage
interest for the unemployed direct to lenders, and a big increase in
counselling services and mortgage debt rescheduling, is cutting the number
of repossessions.
Other lenders have taken different initiatives. The moves include plans by
National &amp; Provincial and Bristol &amp; West societies to rent 200 repossessed
properties to the homeless at social rents, through a subsidiary company.

THERE is growing irritation with the distortion by which the richer and more
populous south of Brazil subsidises the poorer north and north-east, yet
receives less political representation.
This resentment is taking shape as the government of Rio Grande do Sul state
prepares a court action challenging Brazil's federal structure, demanding
greater political representation for the south to avert the spread of
separatism.
The south and south-east are the richest parts of Brazil, accounting for
75.9 per cent of national GDP and 85m of the total 146m population, yet they
are outweighed politically by the centre, north and north-east, which
provide just 17.9 per cent of GDP.
One reason is a constitution giving each state, no matter its size, at least
eight members in the House of Representatives in the federal Congress.
Southerners say, half in jest, that Brazil would be a very rich country if
it lopped off everything north of Rio de Janeiro. This sentiment is more
serious among the 9.2m people of Rio Grande do Sul. Local businessmen talk
bitterly about subsidising 'indolent north-easterners' who 'damage Brazil's
image'.
Their wrath is understandable. Rio Grande do Sul seems like another country
compared with the hungry north-east. The state, one of the richest regions
in Latin America, boasts social indicators worthy of the developed world,
with average life expectancy of 72 years and 89 per cent literacy. Some 81.3
per cent of households have telephones.
Porto Alegre, the state capital, with its modern architecture and tree-lined
roads, could fit easily into Europe. Telephones work, appointments are kept
on time and cars stop at traffic lights and crossings.
Such is the growing mood towards separatism in the region that four
movements have arisen. Mr Irton Marx, president of the Pampa Movement, says:
'Separatism is the only way for Brazil to shake off its backwardness.' The
movement runs a state-wide TV campaign: 'Enough of being ashamed abroad by
being thought swindlers, underdeveloped and primitive'.
Mr Marx claims to have 780,000 signatures for his proposed referendum on
separation of the three southernmost states  - Rio Grande do Sul, Santa
Catarina and Parana.
Southern feelings run very high now because of a fiscal reform before
Congress. Rio Grande do Sul is one of the highest contributors to federal
revenues, but a low recipient.
Mr Alceu Collares, state governor, says: 'We send 15.5 per cent of state GDP
to Braslia and only get back the equivalent of 9 per cent. If this, and the
political discrimination, is not altered we could face an unstoppable
separatist campaign.'

FT  03 NOV 92 / The Race for Congress: Incumbents to feel wrath of the
voters - Office-holders will not be helped by party links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR a short time this summer it seemed to many congressmen that the worst
might be over; that the wind of hostility to all incumbent office-holders,
whatever their party or distinction, might have blown itself out.
That hope has gone. The wind is now blowing as strongly as ever and
threatens to sweep dozens of incumbents out of office in today's polls.
Democrats, in particular, can no longer cling to the coat-tails of their
presidential nominee, Governor Bill Clinton, who had appeared at one point
to be cruising to a landslide victory. The anti-incumbent sentiment that has
fuelled the presidential candidacy of Mr Ross Perot, the independent Texas
billionaire, is sweeping all before it.
Only in the 89 open House seats and eight open Senate seats, where there is
no incumbent to feel the voters' wrath, are party links expected to make
much difference.
'The truth is there are no coat-tails for incumbents of either party this
year. And the evidence we've seen in recent polls tells us that Perot voters
clearly can't be counted as incumbent supporters,' says Mr Vic Fazio,
chairman of the Democratic congressional campaign committee, who is himself
facing a surprisingly tough challenge in California's third district.
Mr Guy Vander Jagt, his counterpart at the National Republican congressional
committee, believes there is a 20 to 30 percentage point drag on every
incumbent.
Mr Vander Jagt is well placed to know for he, along with well-entrenched
members of Congress like Senator Alan Dixon of Illinois and Congresswoman
Beverly Byron of Maryland, was eliminated in a party primary earlier this
year.
Roll Call, Congress's parish newspaper, suggested last week that House
Speaker Tom Foley of Washington state and Congressman Dan Rostenkowski of
Illinois, who holds the US government's purse strings through his
chairmanship of the House ways and means committee, might be at risk.
Even Mr Jamie Whitten of Mississippi, who if re-elected will start his 52nd
year of House service on Wednesday, is having to campaign seriously for the
first time in two decades.
Although many incumbents may face the guillotine, the party composition of
both chambers is unlikely to change dramatically.
Democrats say they expect to lose between 20 and 25 seats in the House, not
enough to dent their 101-seat majority.
Republican party managers officially come up with the same figure: a net
gain of 25 seats. But some Republicans, who once hoped for a net gain of 50
seats, now fear they could pick up as few as five seats.
In the 100-member Senate, where Republicans once believed they had a
realistic chance of winning a majority, the Democrats seem strongly
positioned to maintain their 57 to 43 edge, and could even take seats away
from the Republicans.
Despite the recession, spending on congressional races has risen
dramatically this year. The Federal Election Commission reports that
congressional candidates had spent a total of Dollars 380m (Pounds 233.1m)
by October 14, Dollars 75m more than in 1990 and Dollars 71m more than in
1988.
Some of this increase is because of the unusual double Senate election in
California  - the biggest state and hence the most expensive to campaign in.
Senators are usually elected for six years, with a third of the Senate up
for re-election every two years. A second election will decide who fills the
seat vacated by Mr Pete Wilson when he became governor of the state.
But spending on House elections, which take place every two years, is up by
38 per cent at Dollars 233m, led by Mr Michael Huffington, a Republican
millionaire who has spent Dollars 4.4m of his own money, and by Mr Richard
Gephardt, House Democratic leader, who has spent Dollars 2.7m on his
Missouri race.
The scandal over the House's private bank earlier this year has encapsulated
voters' irritation with their members. The bank provided informal and unpaid
overdraft facilities to members, and those who used the service are, in many
districts, having to battle opponents' charges of 'kiting', or cheque
bouncing.
If Mrs Mary Rose Oakar, a Democrat, loses her Ohio seat it will be almost
entirely due to her 213 overdrawn cheques; the same may be true for
Republican Bill Goodling in Pennsylvania, who had 430 overdrafts on the
House bank. Overdraft attacks have followed former House members like Ms
Barbara Boxer and Mr Les Aucoin into their Senate campaigns.
Some members have bigger problems than a few overdrafts.
Congressman Nick Mavroules of Massachusetts overdrew his account just once,
but he has been indicted on federal bribery charges, while Senator John
Glenn of Ohio is still suffering from his entanglement with Mr Charles
Keating, who ran the now-collapsed Lincoln Savings and Loan  - even though
the Senate ethics committee concluded he was guilty of nothing more than
poor judgment.
To be pure, however, it is not enough to be a non-incumbent. Ms Carol
Moseley Braun, the Democratic candidate for Illinois' Senate seat, has seen
her lead eroded by charges over her financial manoeuvring to keep her
elderly mother's eligibility for state Medicaid cover.
Even without the collapse in public esteem for Congress, many sitting
members faced hard re-election battles. US House districts are redrawn after
the census every 10 years. With population still moving from the north and
east towards the west and south, many sitting members have seen their
districts dwindle or disappear.
Montana used to have two congressional districts, one represented by
Democrat Pat Williams and the other by Republican Ron Marlenee. Today the
two men will face off in Montana's only congressional district.
Even in states which gained seats from the reapportionment, such as
California and Georgia, sitting members have often been squeezed into less
favourable districts.
The irrepressible Mr Newt Gingrich, the Republican whip in the House, lost
so much of his district that he chose to move to a more Republican district,
but is still struggling as he makes himself known to new constituents.
Democratic members in several states have lost areas they used to depend on
for support to create new districts with black or Latino majorities, in
compliance with the Voting Rights Act.
All told, Democratic campaign managers estimate that 34 of their party's
incumbents were adversely affected by redistricting, and a dozen
Republicans.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Purchasing Managers' Index moved back above 50 per cent last month,
indicating slightly improved prospects for manufacturing industry, but
remained far below the levels normal in a healthy recovery, writes Michael
Prowse in Washington.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said construction spending
rose 1.3 per cent in September, following a revised decline of 1.1 per cent
in August. Construction spending was up 5.5 per cent compared with the same
month last year.
The Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 50.6 per cent in October after a
sharp decline to 49 per cent a month earlier. The index is now just above
the 50 per cent threshold that indicates expansion of the manufacturing
industry, but still well below levels recorded earlier this year.
The improvement mainly reflected a rebound in the component of the index
measuring new orders, which rose from 49.6 per cent to 55 per cent. The
component measuring production rose from 52.6 per cent to 54.3 per cent.
But the index for jobs dropped from 45.2 to 44.8, indicating that employment
prospects remain dismal.
Mr Robert Bretz, for the National Association of Purchasing Management,
welcomed the overall improvement, but said the pace of growth remained
modest as the economy entered the fourth quarter.

<TEXT>
EARVIN 'Magic' Johnson, the basketball superstar who has the Aids virus,
announced yesterday he was giving up plans to resume his playing career.
A statement released by his Los Angeles Lakers team said he was retiring for
good because 'it has become obvious the various controversies surrounding my
return are taking away both from basketball as a sport and the larger issue
of living with HIV for me and the many people affected'.
His reference to 'various controversies' reflects growing opposition to his
playing by fellow professionals fearful of infection.
Johnson, one of the dominant players of his generation, first retired last
November after disclosing he had the HIV virus. He returned to play in the
US Olympics 'dream team' which won the gold medal in Barcelona and has
performed in most of the Lakers exhibition games before the regular season,
which begins later this week.
On his first retirement he was appointed to the presidential commission on
Aids but resigned two months ago, accusing the Bush administration of paying
insufficient attention to the problem.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LANCASTER, PENNSYLVANIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FERRANTI, the British defence electronics company, was involved in a 1986 US
helicopter-and-missile project that led to the indictment of a former top
executive at International Signal and Control (ISC), the Pennsylvania
company that was found to have defrauded Ferranti after it was acquired in
1987.
Ferranti's involvement is described in a series of company documents
obtained by the Financial Times.
Mr Thomas Jasin, the former president of ISC Technologies, will stand trial
in Philadelphia tomorrow. . He is accused of having illegally imported into
the US components for the Striker missile, a South African weapon that was
to have been fitted on to US helicopters made by the Sikorsky division of
United Technologies.
Mr Jasin is also charged with transferring technical data and goods to South
Africa in connection with the project. US law prohibited both the import of
South African military technology and the export of technology to South
Africa.
Neither Sikorsky nor Ferranti has been charged in the Striker case. Mr Jasin
claimed yesterday he was innocent of any wrongdoing as the project was
'above board' and involved discussions with Ferranti, Sikorsky and the US
Army.
The documents obtained by the FT show the prospective customers for the
project  - which was to have used the Striker anti-tank missile on
Sikorsky's Blackhawk or Eagle helicopters  - were both the US Army and the
People's Republic of China. The transactions were not completed.
However, a US official said yesterday the US Army eventually tested versions
of the Striker missile.
The documents also show that as long ago as 1985  - two years before it
acquired ISC  - Ferranti agreed to provide a helicopter siting (missile
guidance) system for the Striker programme. An April 1985 document from
Ferranti's electro-optics department in Edinburgh showed the company
prepared a technical proposal for ISC Technologies on the siting system.
An August 1986 letter written by Mr Jasin to Sir Derek Alun-Jones, then the
Ferranti chairman, also discussed a memorandum of agreement between Ferranti
and ISC on the Striker project.
Ferranti declined to comment on the project yesterday except to say it had
made information on the Striker available to US and British authorities,
which was 'instrumental' in leading to the indictment of Mr Jasin.
A former senior Ferranti director said, however, that he recalled Ferranti's
participation in the programme. The director said: 'This was long before we
merged with ISC. They must have approached us, probably in conjunction with
Sikorsky, about a proposed programme and seeking the supply of siting
systems.'
In Connecticut, a Sikorsky spokesman confirmed the company's participation
in the Striker/helicopter project, but noted it did not proceed with the
project after Mr Jasin informed the company in October 1986 that US laws
would have prevented testing the missile in the US.
'Sikorsky recognises the foreign policy implications of importing and
exporting technology,' the spokesman said.
Mr Gaar Steiner, the lawyer representing Mr Jasin, said the entire
transaction was 'totally above board'. Available documents 'establish beyond
question that Ferranti was involved in the programme, as was Sikorsky and
the US Army'.
Mr Steiner said he did not dispute that the Striker missile components were
brought to the US, but said it was a legal transaction.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Trying to head off a Brazilian breakaway: Christina Lamb
visits angry southern separatists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE flag of Brazil's southernmost state is inscribed with the name Republic
of the Rio Grande, recalling long ago days of independence.
Proudly displayed in the offices of the state's leading businessmen and
government officials, it symbolises a growing irritation with the distortion
by which the richer and more populous south of Brazil subsidises the poorer
north and north-east, yet receives less political representation.
This resentment is about to take shape as the government of Rio Grande do
Sul state puts the final touches to a court action challenging Brazil's
federal structure, demanding greater political representation for the south
to avert the spread of separatism.
Mr Sergio Porto, a lawyer and cabinet chief of the Rio Grande do Sul
government, explains: 'The extreme bias of political representation towards
the north and north-east completely contradicts the constitutional
principles of equality and proportional democracy'.
The south and south-east are the richest parts of Brazil, accounting for
75.9 per cent of national GDP and 85m of the total 146m population, yet they
are outweighed politically by the centre, north and north-east, which
provide just 17.9 per cent of GDP.
This is a result of the creation of less-populated northern states by the
military regime of 1964-85 and of a constitution which gives each state, no
matter its size, a minimum of eight members in the House of Representatives
in the federal Congress.
Southerners frequently comment, half in jest, that Brazil would be a very
rich country if it lopped off everything north of Rio de Janeiro. This
sentiment is more serious among the 9.2m people of Rio Grande do Sul, which
still commemorates its independence of 1835-45. Without prompting, local
businessmen talk bitterly about subsidising 'indolent north-easterners' who
'damage Brazil's image.'
Their wrath is understandable. Rio Grande do Sul seems like another country
compared with the hungry north-east. The state, one of the richest regions
in Latin America, boasts social indicators worthy of the developed world,
with average life expectancy of 72 years and 89 per cent literacy. Some 81.3
per cent of households have telephones.
Porto Alegre, the state capital, with its modern architecture and tree-lined
roads, could fit easily into Europe. Telephones work, appointments are kept
on time and cars stop at traffic lights and zebra crossings.
Such is the growing mood towards separatism in the region that four
movements have sprung up. Mr Irton Marx, president of the Pampa Movement,
says: 'Separatism is the only way for Brazil to shake off its backwardness'.
The movement recently started a state-wide TV campaign: 'Enough of being
ashamed abroad by being thought swindlers, underdeveloped and primitive'.
Mr Marx claims to have 780,000 signatures already for his proposed
referendum on separation of the three southernmost states - Rio Grande do
Sul, Santa Catarina and Parana.
Southern feelings run particularly high at present because of the fiscal
reform under discussion in Congress. Rio Grande do Sul is one of the highest
contributors to federal revenues, but is a low recipient thereof and wants
to stop its subsidising of the north.
Mr Alceu Collares, state governor, complains: 'We send 15.5 per cent of
state GDP to Braslia and only get back the equivalent of 9 per cent. If
this, and the political discrimination, is not altered we could face an
unstoppable separatist campaign.'

<TEXT>
TODAY, the citizens of the District of Columbia, the least enfranchised
people in the US, will not only be voting for a president and a fistful of
local offices. They will also be asked if they want the death penalty
restored for capital crimes.
DC does have a murder problem, about 370 so far this year. But it has not
executed anybody in its jurisdiction since 1957 and in 1981 the city council
formally repealed the death penalty statute. There has been no discernible
movement in what is the most rock-solid liberal Democratic constituency for
it to be restored.
The proposal is on the DC ballot because Congress, from which DC derives a
large chunk of its budget, ordered the council to put it there. It did so
after an aide to Senator Richard Shelby, Democrat from Alabama, was brutally
murdered earlier this year. Some outraged members of Congress wanted the
death penalty forced back in the nation's capital, but agreed in the end to
let the local citizens decide.
Most states voting today will also be passing judgment on over 60 issues not
apparently directly related to the choice of their national and local
leadership. Some initiatives have been placed on the ballot by the petition
process, some by special interests and some by governments themselves.
The greatest number of these are devoted to restricting the number of terms
elected representatives may serve, on the ballot in 14 states, and to state
and local finance, covering both tax increases and reductions.
If the term limit bandwagon is successful today - and in the current
anti-political mood more victories than defeats are anticipated - as many as
a third of state legislature members will know they can count on only
limited years in office.
Financial initiatives conform less easily to type. Nine state ballots
contain proposals to repeal or limit taxes and eight to increase them on
particular sectors, such as the wealthy, smokers and gamblers. Several state
and local authorities propose to introduce lotteries.
The governors of California, Colorado and Michigan have proposed initiatives
opposed by their own state legislatures. In Michigan, for example, Mr John
Engler, the Republican governor, has sponsored the move to cut property
taxes by 30 per cent over five years.
California's Republican Governor Pete Wilson is seeking voter permission,
not granted by his legislature, to cut welfare payments and assume greater
control over the budget. In Colorado, it is the Democratic governor, Mr Roy
Romer, who is seeking to bypass his Republican legislature by getting
approval for a rise in state sales tax.
But the most controversial proposals are in social policy. None is more
bitterly fought than the initiative in Oregon, sponsored by right-wing
Christian activists, to curb rights of homosexuals.
Nowhere is the initiative process stronger than in California, appropriately
for a state whose tax-cutting referendum in 1978, Proposition 13, gave
impetus to policies later practised nationally by the Reagan administration.
There are five state-wide referenda in California today, perhaps the most
hotly contested on allowing the terminally ill to order a physician to
practise euthanasia.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Little Rock setsits sights on a large future: Arkansans are
already relishing the benefits they expect a Clinton victory to bring
</HEADLINE>

   LITTLE ROCK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN LITTLE ROCK'S sprawling, graceless downtown area, a few jutting
skyscrapers attest to the ambition of the state of which it is capital,
Arkansas. Here the most ambitious Arkansan of them all, Governor Bill
Clinton, will sleep most of today to prepare for tonight's 10-party
celebration climaxing his race for the US presidency.
The state, one of the country's poorest, has seen nothing like today - or,
indeed, the past five months of the presidential campaign. Arkansas has
never had a presidential contender, although local historians have dredged
up the memory of one senator who adorned President Franklin D Roosevelt's
inner circle.
'Arkansas is ready, America.' This is the assertion inscribed on the press
kits - assembled for the 4,000 journalists expected here tonight  - complete
with maps, tour listings, brochures for local attractions, contact lists and
ideas for articles.
Campaign headquarters is also ready, functioning 'like a well-oiled
machine', according to Mr Marc Ginsberg, deputy press secretary. Elaborate
get-out-the-vote measures are under way, but last-minute nervousness about a
Bush surge has dissipated.
While Little Rock, capital of 'the Natural State', lacks the charm of the
Old South, it also lacks its torpor. The natives are feverishly preparing
for the gathering hordes of Clinton friends, media, and visiting
dignitaries. Among the latter is a delegation from the Argentine government,
come 'to show our support for Clinton'.
The city was the first in the US to fight Washington-imposed school
integration in the 1950s. Today, it has a governor who has vowed to heal the
racial hatreds his opponents have long exploited.
The Arkansas air is almost balmy this week; the pansies still bloom. At the
Excelsior Hotel (bought in a single day two years ago by a Japanese couple
who 'wrote a cheque') chefs are putting the finishing touches to a large ice
sculpture of the White House. Every hotel room is booked between Little Rock
and Hot Springs, 55 miles away. The Excelsior has even rented out its roof
for satellite dishes and cameras, and its 150 extra staff include local
teachers, lawyers and even investment bankers, all of whom want to be part
of tonight's parties.
At a long table in the media centre sit the state economic development
specialists and business boosters. These are the people responsible for the
19 per cent increase in manufacturing jobs over the past decade, an
achievement which Mr Clinton 'rang on' repeatedly in the campaign. Their
excitement is palpable. They have heard their state described as a pollution
haven by President George Bush, and as 'irrelevant' by independent candidate
Ross Perot, but they are looking more for 'opportunity' than revenge.
Among them are forward-thinking Arkansans planning to offer the Clintons
(who own no home) a vacation retreat in Hot Springs, where they also hope to
attract holidaymakers and pensioners. (Land here can still be bought for
Dollars 300-400 an acre.) Some are even poring over sites for a Clinton
presidential library, although it would not be built until after his time in
office.
In his acceptance speech at the Democratic convention back in July, Mr
Clinton said: 'There is no Arkansas miracle,' in a reference to the
'Massachusetts miracle' proclaimed by the last Democratic challenger, Mr
Michael Dukakis. But there is also unlikely to be an Arkansas collapse of
the kind endured by Massachusetts after the failure of their presidential
candidate. Growth has been steady over the decade or so Mr Clinton has been
here, and banks are so conservative that home building lags well behind
demand.
Like most state governors, Mr Clinton commands less awe at home than he does
away. A giant sign near Little Rock airport informs startled visitors 'This
is Bush country.' Outside the confines of state government, Mr Clinton's
education reforms and economic expansion schemes are almost grudgingly
praised; his sales taxes, levied to finance schools and development, are the
subject of bitter complaint. It is by no means forgotten that when he ran
for re-election two years ago, he promised to finish his four-year term.
Win or lose, there are few Arkansans today complaining about his
presidential run. It has pushed tourism to record highs. The number of
companies inquiring about moving to the state has risen 30 per cent.
The population may shrink a bit if all the governor's supporters get
Washington jobs. But Arkansas Business, a weekly newspaper, spells out the
possibilities of a boom in the state as a result of a Clinton presidency:
increased highway spending, development of the impoverished 'Delta Region',
new tax receipts from tourism, better airline services, promotion of rice
exports in Asian markets, more convention business and the prospect of
military installations.
Arkansans dream of a new prosperity and, as the candidate sleeps off a
gruelling campaign, his friends are adjusting to the fact that tomorrow he
may be preparing to take on the world's most powerful job.
His critics are also adjusting. One of the most severe, Mr Paul Greenberg of
the Arkansas Democrat Gazette, waxed philosophical in Sunday's column. 'Just
when the fabric of the old republic seems stretched to the breaking point,
its tattered threads will be rewoven,' he said of election eve. 'The
towering heroes and unregenerate villains who dominated the news the night
before will be unmasked as human beings with virtues and vices. And the
caricatures will have to be put aside for the next election.'

FT  03 NOV 92 / US gets ready to redraw its electoral map: Jurek Martin, US
Editor, in Washington, identifies some of the changes in the political
landscape exposed on the long road to the White House

EVEN before the votes are finally counted tonight, the analysts will be
dissecting the entrails of this election. Their purpose will be to draw up a
new national electoral map, not merely to identify where the winning
candidate put together his majority, but how and why.
The American electorate is a remarkable overlapping hodgepodge, in which
quite small shifts of allegiance can determine who inhabits the White House.
Its main constituent parts are obvious. Men and women, young, middle-aged
and old, middle class and working class, caucasian and minorities, town,
country and suburbs. Given the decline in the influence of the two main
political parties, each component part has been the target of the
candidates.
Women, for example, tend to vote now in greater numbers than men. But women
cannot be reduced to a simple bloc. They may well have a tendency to vote
more for 'peace' than 'war,' which helped President George Bush among
Republican women in his primary struggles against the more bellicose Mr Pat
Buchanan, but the election proper has not provided such a sharp contrast.
Pollsters, for example, detect marked differences between women in the
labour force and those who stay at home looking after families. Both are
concerned about economic issues, but both seem to display different
perceptions, because they receive different messages, about the nature of
the country's problems.
If Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate, does win today, the
post-election analysis is likely to show that he benefited from a gender
edge over Mr Bush and that it will probably be most pronounced among women
who work and who, therefore, may well be juggling employment and family
responsibilities.
The Republican appeal to traditional family values, so much a feature of the
Houston convention though played down later, may well be seen as
ill-conceived, perhaps even a fundamental mistake.
Both Mr Bush and Mr Ross Perot, the Texas independent, score more heavily
among men than, on balance, does Mr Clinton. In part this may reflect the
outwardly 'macho' nature of Mr Bush's campaign, conducted in attacking,
sometimes militaristic, terms. For the Bush-Perot generation, not to have
worn military uniform may well indeed be a sign of an insufficient manhood.
But it is also possible that this election will show as much of a generation
gap as a gender gap. This would be a complete reversal from the 1980s, when
a politically disengaged younger generation felt perfectly comfortable with
President Ronald Reagan, if it voted at all.
The shift may principally reflect a decline in employment prospects for the
more affluent college-educated young, the quintessential 'yuppies' of the
prosperous 1980s. But it may also be attributable to the appeal of the 'baby
boomer' generation embodied in the Clinton-Gore ticket.
A key element in the Clinton message has been the need to pick up again the
cause of government involvement in the nation's affairs that was so much a
feature of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations of the 1960s, when he and
Senator Gore came of political age.
The Bush counter has been to highlight what he sees as the risks inherent in
activist government, particularly its 'tax and spend' proclivities. Mr
Clinton, however, has continued to insist that the middle class will benefit
from tax cuts under his regime.
In effect, he has been trying to re-awaken a constituency which had repaired
to the suburbs and become politically less active during the Reagan years.
Four out of 10 Americans live in suburbs. As such they constitute the
largest, albeit amorphous, national group, and it is not for nothing in the
final days that Mr Clinton has been stressing his own middle class
credentials.
The skilled American working class, suburban or inner city, and often
ethnically strong, was also prime territory for the Republicans in the
1980s. It has also been among the most economically vulnerable in the
downturn of the past two years. It obviously no longer responds in a
reflexive political manner to the dictates of its union leadership.
Nowhere is disaffection with the established political parties more evident
than among skilled blue collar workers, especially in the 'rust belt'
states. This was where former Governor Jerry Brown did best in the
Democratic primaries and, apart from Texas and the independent-inclined
mountain states, is where Mr Perot carries most appeal today.
The engagement of minorities this year is very hard to predict, not least
because it has become so diversified. There is, for example, a substantial
difference between the inclinations of Hispanic Americans in Florida on the
one hand and in New York and Los Angeles on the other. Florida's Cubans have
tended to vote Republican, whereas New York's Puerto Ricans and California's
and Texas's Mexicans have tended to prefer Democrats, though not to the
point of heavy turn-out.
Black Americans are, of course, overwhelmingly Democratic and there are
polls suggesting that Mr Clinton commands the allegiance of upwards of 80
per cent of them. But again, the question is whether they vote in sufficient
numbers to make a difference.
Cutting across all the socio-economic divides must be the public's
assessment of the character of the candidates themselves. Mr Bush's campaign
had shrewdly worked out that if this was an election that became a
referendum on the state of the economy, it was unwinnable. It therefore
became necessary to discredit Mr Clinton as an individual - by whatever
available means.
Americans like fighting campaigns and have become pretty much accustomed to
seeing them waged ruthlessly. What is incalculable is the extent to which
they may sense that there are lines which should not be crossed. They
certainly seem to have proved tolerant of Mr Clinton's past, while not
resolving all their doubts about his suitability. They have repeatedly
emphasised their dislike of orchestrated smears, and their preference for
discussion of issues of substance.
The evidence is, however, also that they are still not over-enamoured with
the choices on offer. The New York Times this week summed up the public
perception: 'Mr Bush is out of touch, Mr Clinton is slick, Mr Perot is
flaky.' It is not the sort of national mood that is likely to give an
overwhelming popular mandate to any of them.

FT  03 NOV 92 / What to watch for tonight - and when
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The situation at 20.00 Eastern time (01.00 Wednesday GMT):
EASTERN  Polls in nearly half of the states here have been closed for
   up to 90 minutes, with the rest closing now, except for New          York
and Rhode Island, which do not shut their doors for          another hour
(02.00 GMT).  The first results should emerge          from Indiana, with
its earliest closing time in the nation.          If President George Bush
does not win in this Republican          stronghold, his prospects for
re-election are in trouble.          Key states to watch in the North-east,
where Governor Bill          Clinton, the Democratic Party challenger, has
been leading          in the opinion polls, are New Jersey and Conneticut.
Maine,          one of the best hopes for Independent Ross Perot, could
offer          pointers to his impact on the race.  To the west, Ohio and
       Michigan are critical battlegrounds.          In the South-east,
which has generally been Republican          territory in recent
presidential elections, Mr Clinton and his          vice-presidential
candidate Al Gore, both southerners, hope          for victory in North
Carolina and Georgia.  Mr Bush must win          Florida's 25 Electoral
College votes to keep his hopes truly          alive.
CENTRAL  It is an hour earlier here, but Texas and Illinois are already
     closing their polls, with all but two of the other states
closing within an hour (21.00 Eastern Time/0.200 GMT).          Watch for Mr
Perot's effect on the two main candidates in his          home state of
Texas.  Without this state's 32 electoral votes,          Bush campaign
officials say, the president cannot be          re-elected.  Mr Clinton is
counting on Illinois and its 22          electoral votes.  Other key
battlegrounds are the northern          states of Minnesota and Wisconsin.
MOUNTAIN More than half of the polls here do not close for another two
    hours (22.00 Eastern Time/03.00 GMT).  But results are          expected
rapidly in Arizona, Wyoming and Colorado, which offer          Mr Clinton's
best chance of winning in this time zone.          Mountain states like
Idaho have provided some of Mr Perot's          strongest support in the
opinion polls.
PACIFIC  People here are just leaving work, and virtually all the polls
     are open for another three hours (23.00 Eastern Time/04.00 GMT)
  In none of the candidates has secured overall victory by now,
California's 54 electoral college votes are likely to prove
decisive.  Party managers in California hope that the state's          votes
will still be needed: if the presidential election is          already over,
voters may decide not to turn out for          congressional races.
ALASKA   It is only mid-to-late afternoon in these time zones, with the 3
votes  polls remaining open for another four hours          midnight Eastern
Time/0.500 GMT).  Since becoming states in          1959, however, no
presidential contest has been close enough          for their electoral
votes to have changed the outcome.
HAWAII   While Hawaii remains a Democratic fortress, Alaska will be 4 votes
 watched closely for the outcome of its elections for Congress,          in
which a senator and the state's lone representative, both
Republicans, face strong competition.
THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE: 270 TO WIN
The US president is elected, not be national popular vote, but by a simple
majority of the 538 Electoral College votes apportioned to the 50 states and
the District of Columbia* on the basis of the number of their congressional
districts.  Each state has two US senators, and a number of representatives
in the House of Representatives based on population.
The small state of Rhode Island, for example, has its two senators plus two
representatives, giving four electoral votes; California, the most populous
state, has its two senators but also 52 representatives, giving it 54
electoral votes.
The presidential candidate who receives the majority of a state's popular
vote wins the state's entire electoral vote.**
For example, a candidate could be elected president by winning only the
seven most populous states plus a handful of medium-sized states, no matter
by how slim a margin.  In other words, the candidate could win in only about
a fifth of the states and still become president.
Indeed, the system tends to make elections seem more decisive than they are.
 In the past 50 years, the Electoral College victory has generally been
fairly wide, whereas the average margin in terms of the popular vote has
been less than 10 per cent.

ISRAEL'S Labour-led government yesterday faced the first industrial action
against its privatisation plans when workers at Bezeq, the state-owned
telecommunications monopoly, went on strike in protest at a proposal to
allow private-sector competition in mobile telephone networks and some
international communications.
Operator services and most repair and maintenance operations were closed
because of the action by 10,000 Bezeq employees, with cover only for
emergency breakdowns.
International links appeared to be functioning normally, however, and the
workers did not carry out a threat to shut state radio and television
services.
Israel's prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, and his government defeated a
vote of no-confidence yesterday ensuring continued support for his peace
policies, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. Parliament threw out no-confidence
motions from four opposition parties by 59 votes to 51 after Mr Rabin
resolved a bitter row between Jewish orthodox and secular coalition
partners.

THE LATEST United Nations agreement with Iraq was denounced yesterday as
'akin to Florence Nightingale making a pact with Adolf Hitler' by Miss Emma
Nicholson, a British Conservative MP, writes Edward Mortimer.
Miss Nicholson, launching an appeal to help Shia refugees from south-eastern
Iraq, complained that the memorandum of understanding, signed on October 22
by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, talked only about the
north.
It was, she added, a 'major rip-off' of the world's relief funds, 'so
incredible as to beggar belief,' since it left the Iraqi government
responsible for organising relief efforts for the southern marshlands, where
half a million people are being subjected to 'sustained military and
environmental terrorist attacks' by that same government. The memorandum
was, she said, 'contrary to all Security Council resolutions,' and she could
not understand how Mr Boutros Ghali had authority to sign it.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Ghana votes on Rawlings and reform: Economic programme is on
the ballot and in the balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GHANA goes to the polls today after eleven years of military rule.
The presidential elections, the first since Flight-Lt Jerry Rawlings seized
power in 1981, will be a critical test in Africa of the continent's fragile
transition to democracy and sustainable economic growth.
After nine years of economic growth, Ghanaian voters are faced with a
complex choice: should they stick with Flt Lt Rawlings, despite his
heavy-handed leadership and well charted human rights abuses, or should they
return to the mould of two traditional political parties with a less than
favourable track record on the economy since independence in 1957.
Concerns about the future of Ghana's economic reform programme in a
post-electoral democratic order are also shared by international donors who
have poured in about Dollars 650m a year (8 per cent of GDP) to support
Ghana's drive towards economic reform.
Many donors fear that austere economic reform in Africa could be jeopardised
by a wave of democratic populism.
They also believe that many of the unpopular reforms, undertaken in Ghana
and elsewhere in Africa throughout the 1980s were only possible under
authoritarian government.
In a recent internal World Bank document entitled 'Ghana  - 2000 and beyond'
the Bank says that if Ghana makes the leap to self-sustainable growth it
would have tremendous implications for other African countries, but it
warns: 'Authoritarianism often has been seen as a useful, if regrettable,
expedient for effective policymaking in the face of political instability.'
There is little fundamental economic policy difference between the five
presidential candidates in today's election. However, opponents of Flt Lt
Rawlings are more critical of the austerity programme without offering a
coherent alternative.
Western donors feel that at the very least a defeat of Flt Lt Rawlings would
cause a period of economic policy instability and that a democratically
elected president would be more inclined to pander to populist sentiments
and opinion.
The question Ghanaian voters will decide, in part, is whether the past nine
years of painful economic reform which has produced considerable benefits
will translate into support for Flt Lt Rawlings, particularly among the
rural farmers who have benefited most from better producer prices. 'To a
certain extent the election is a referendum on structural adjustment,' said
a western economist.
There are four contenders standing against Flt Lt Rawlings. The strongest
challenger is Prof Adu Boahen representing the conservative New Patriotic
Party.
He is expected to draw his support from Ghanaians who have suffered during
the past decade, particularly town dwellers and sacked civil servants, and
from the powerful Ashanti tribe.
However, the decision by Ghana's electorate on structural adjustment will be
considerably distorted by Flt Lt Rawlings' poor track record on human rights
and by the government's less than total commitment to the reform programme,
which many economists say could have yielded much better results.
Donors say Ghana's economic reform faltered in the face of government
reluctance to accept the critical second phase of adjustment which involves
stimulating investment by releasing economic control and ownership to
private foreign and local investors.
After nine years of austerity and often painful reform, many Ghanaians have
yet to see significant increases in living standards. The promise of short,
sharp, shock therapy for the economy quickly turning into high economic
growth rates has faded.
Measures which include devaluation, liberalisation of trade and foreign
exchange, a disciplined fiscal and monetary policy and retrenchment of
bloated bureaucracies have given Ghana some rewards. Inflation has fallen
from 123 per cent in 1983 to 18 per cent last year and the country has
managed an average growth rate of 5 per cent a year since 1984.
But with population growth at around 3 per cent real per capita incomes have
only grown about 2 per cent. When savings are deducted, real per capita
consumption is even less. If economic and population growth continues at
current levels, economists estimate it will take Ghanaians 40 to 50 years to
double their incomes, presently at a paltry Dollars 400 a year.
The critical question facing Ghana, as in many other adjusting countries in
Africa, is how to move to self-sustainable accelerated growth of 8-10 per
cent a year where private flows of capital and export growth replaces
aid-dependence.
To achieve this gross investment will have to increase significantly from
16.5 per cent of GDP in 1991 to 20-25 per cent over the next five years and
national savings will have to rise from 13.1 per cent to 20 per cent of GDP.
A private sector working group has made recommendations to government of
measures to be taken. The list includes speeding up divestiture of 330
state-owned companies including 17 classed as 'strategic', slashing
bureaucratic obstacles to foreign and local investment and reducing the role
of the Ghana Investment Centre from an overly-protective body to a
facilitatory and promotional one.
Many Ghanaians feel that Flt Lt Rawlings, with his distaste for private
profit enterprise, has been a big obstacle to the fundamental change in
attitudes which need to be taken towards foreign investors and businessmen
to achieve much higher growth.
However, any incoming elected president will face the same challenges and
tasks: deepening the reform programme and accelerating economic growth while
dealing with the new post-electoral democratic reality.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Iata warns of mounting airline losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
in Montreal
THE international airline industry is heading for another loss next year,
bringing total losses during the last
four years to nearly Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.1bn).
Mr Gunter Eser, director-general of the International Air Transport
Association (Iata), also warned yesterday that the continuing losses of the
industry would hit new commercial aircraft orders during the rest of this
decade.
Addressing the organisation's annual meeting in Montreal, Mr Eser described
the state of the industry as 'apocalyptic'.
'The four horsemen of the aviation apocalypse are traffic and yields which
are too low, capacity and unit costs which are too high,' he said. Mr Eser
said there was a fifth horseman, interest charges and airline debt which
have become unsustainable.
The dire financial state of the industry will accelerate the profound
changes now taking place in the airline business. Last year alone, the
industry shed 51,000 jobs or 3.4 per cent of its total workforce.
After it had lost Dollars 2.7bn in 1990 and Dollars 4bn last year, Mr Eser
said he expected the industry loss this year to total Dollars 2.6bn.
Although there has been a slow recovery in traffic, Iata is expecting
another industry loss of around Dollars 600m next year. This would bring
total losses for 1990-93 to Dollars 9.9bn.
However, Mr Eser said Iata was still optimistic about future growth,
forecasting an average worldwide passenger growth rate of 7.4 per cent a
year between 1991 and 1996 and a 6.9 per cent annual growth rate for freight
traffic during this period.
But this growth will be clipped unless about Dollars 350bn is spent to
improve and expand airports and air traffic infrastructure between now and
2010.
Mr Eser warned that Iata's 212 member airlines were unlikely to be able to
finance new aircraft purchases beyond those already on order even if they
quickly return to break-even.
He urged airlines to be much more cautious in ordering new aircraft than
they were during the boom years of the 1980s.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Vietnam looks for gains from US election: Economic hopes for
the lifting of Washington's aid embargo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S US election will be closely watched from Hanoi. It could determine
the pace at which Washington, which has ostracised Vietnam since the end of
the war in Indochina in 1975, allows it to resume international business.
Assistance from multilateral institutions and - except for small amounts -
from western governments has been prevented by a US embargo. Finance is
desperately needed to help rebuild the country's infrastructure and support
attempts to introduce free-market reforms.
The Bush administration has been under intense pressure both to maintain and
to lift the ban. US companies, barred by the embargo from doing business,
feel they are losing out to foreign competitors on a potential bonanza.
Businessmen from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong, as
well as from Europe and Australia, have been swarming to Vietnam, which is
seen as offering a cheap, enthusiastic and well-educated labour force as
well as a large domestic market. They have developed important contacts, but
as yet only limited actual business.
Vocal conservative and veterans' groups in the US are implacably opposed to
rehabilitating Vietnam while Americans lost in the war remain unaccounted
for. The depth of feeling still aroused by Vietnam is evident at any
Independence Day parade or similar event across America.
President Bush has made progress in winning co-operation from the communist
Hanoi government in the attempt to trace 2,265 servicemen listed as
unaccounted for in Indochina. He has involved senators who are outspoken on
the issue in the search - some have even knocked unannounced on the doors of
Vietnamese prisons.
Last year he set out a four-stage 'road map' to normalisation, under which
progress in accounting for missing servicemen and towards peace and
elections in neighbouring Cambodia - which had a government installed by
Vietnam - would lead to a phased lifting of the embargo.
US businessmen are allowed to visit Vietnam but not to sign contracts, and
telecommunications links have been restored so that American Telephone and
Telegraph (AT&amp;T) has been able to enter the market - though not yet to
pocket the revenue.
The (unpublished) road map foresaw lifting the trade embargo six months
after the September 1991 signing of the Cambodia peace agreement, but this
has not occurred. There are signs that Mr Bush could lift it later this year
or in January, whether or not he wins the election.
The effort to trace missing servicemen has been bipartisan. But for Mr Bill
Clinton - if he wins - lifting of the embargo might not be a priority early
in his presidency, since Vietnam is such an emotive issue. It seems unlikely
in the longer run that Mr Clinton's approach would differ markedly from that
of Mr Bush.
Pressure on either a Bush or Clinton administration would increase if, as
seems increasingly likely, Japan loses patience with Washington and, in
effect, lifts the embargo, which it has maintained out of deference to the
US. There are increasing indications that Japan will proceed with a Dollars
200m official aid programme in which Japanese companies would participate.
The Hanoi government's economic policies would almost certainly already
satisfy the International Monetary Fund. However the IMF cannot lend to
Vietnam until the US removes its veto from a French-led plan which would
enable Vietnam to repay its arrears to the Fund.
IMF lending, in turn, would trigger substantial loans from the World Bank
and Asian Development Bank as well as much larger bilateral aid from
governments and the granting of full insurance cover by official export
credit agencies.
Despite the degree of preparation and the sense of exciting potential, a
slower acceleration is more likely than a rapid take-off, for several
reasons.
First, Vietnam remains a very poor country with extremely inadequate
infrastructure: it needs new power stations, roads, bridges, railways,
aircraft, hotels, communications, and industrial and agricultural machinery.
The United Nations and the Vietnam government have identified projects worth
nearly Dollars 7bn. The need for technical expertise and management skills
is just as great.
Second, despite the government's open policy, there remain bureaucratic and
practical hurdles to setting up in Vietnam. Once permission is obtained,
office space is limited and staff must be obtained through the government at
considerable expense. Corruption and smuggling remain problems.
Third, foreign companies, including those that have already established a
presence, are likely to be cautious about signing contracts, especially if a
proposed joint venture is with one of the many inefficient, loss-making
state corporations.
Mr Martin Adams, managing director of the Vietnam Fund Management, who
manages from Hong Kong a Dollars 10m fund investing in Vietnamese joint
ventures, believes the first result of lifting the embargo will be a surge
in Vietnam's international trade.
Its rice surplus is currently exported, but not to the best markets, because
of poor quality, lack of milling facilities, and absence of credit
insurance. Textile exports could also rise sharply. The European Community
is discussing including Vietnam in its quota arrangements.
The broader potential is substantial. Companies such as Coca-Cola, Pepsico,
Citicorp, Bank of America, AT&amp;T, and Boeing are expected to try to tap large
markets in their respective businesses. So will the oil industry - Mobil had
an important presence in Vietnam - and construction equipment companies.
But competition will be intense. Korean conglomerates have been actively
wooing the Vietnamese, and Japanese companies have made considerable
investment in building their position.
The path to normalisation is not a straight one. The US could, for example,
continue its gradual lifting of restrictions: allowing US airlines to fly to
Vietnam, removing curbs on use of the dollar in transactions with Vietnam,
allowing US companies to open offices.
Even after the trade embargo is lifted, Hanoi and Washington will need to
agree on a means to resolve pre-1975 financial claims on each other. The
amount of US claims on Vietnam is unknown - a register remains open in
Washington. Vietnam has some Dollars 300m of deposits frozen in the US.
Since Washington would want to give US companies a chance to compete, the
ending of the block on multilateral lending is generally expected to be one
of the final steps of the process.
It will only be then that Vietnam can really begin to rebuild its economy.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Japanese car sales fall 14%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE continued weakness of Japanese consumer spending was heavily underlined
yesterday by a 14 per cent fall in new car sales last month compared with
October last year.
The resulting financial pressures which the continued fall in sales is
exerting on Japanese car manufacturers will be reflected in their
deteriorating financial results, which are due to be announced within the
next three weeks.
Nissan Motor announced yesterday that in the six months to September it had
made its first pre-tax loss since the second world war.
Large luxury cars were particularly hard hit, with a 21.9 per cent fall to
47,573 units compared with October 1991. Sales of smaller cars fell by 15.6
per cent to 233,292 units.
The smallest decline was in sales of small trucks, which fell by 5 per cent
to 128,960 units, while large truck sales fell by about 20 per cent to
10,618 vehicles.
The growth of new car sales reached a peak of 30 per cent a year in October
1989. Over the next year the growth of new car sales fell to zero and since
then have been contracting.
However, the decline in sales has not affected car manufacturers equally.
Honda, Toyota and Mitsubishi all managed to contain the damage, while Nissan
and Mazda each suffered falls of more than 20 per cent.
Toyota's sales fell to 183,296 in October, down 9.6 per cent from the year
before. Honda sales fell by 9.8 per cent to 35,003, while Mitsubishi's sales
were 3.3 per cent lower at 36,241.
In contrast Nissan's sales fell by 23 per cent to 84,618 and Mazda's sales
were 22 per cent down at 34,380.
Sales of imported cars also declined 3.4 per cent to a total of 14,509
vehicles. Japan's small businesses are being badly hit by the economic
downturn, with profitability at a 17-year low, according to a survey
published yesterday by the Japan Finance Corporation, a government agency
which provides small companies with low-interest loans, writes Charles
Leadbeater.
The survey suggests that small businesses, which are the bedrock of
employment in Japan despite the power of its large manufacturing groups, may
be suffering the first signs of the kind of squeeze which has hit small US
businesses over the past few years.
Japanese small companies, which are heavily dependent on bank lending for
their finance, may be particularly hit by a more cautious approach to
lending by the banks as they attempt to deal with their mounting bad loans.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN has warned the US that failure to approve British Airways' planned
purchase of a Dollars 750m (Pounds 460m) stake in USAir would 'strengthen
the hand of those in Europe opposed to further liberalisation' of air
transport, Daniel Green writes. Mr John MacGregor, UK transport secretary,
said approval would give 'new impetus to liberalisation'. If the deal were
stopped, 'repercussions would go beyond just the UK/US (bilateral air
services) agreement,' he told the American Chamber of Commerce in London.
Bilateral talks resume next week.

FT  03 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Textile exports become India's silver
lining - Economic reforms have provided an overdue fillip to marketing and
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF the Indian government is to achieve its aim of export-led growth, it must
depend on entrepreneurs like Mr Sudhir Dhingra.
Mr Dhingra runs a garment-making business on the outskirts of Delhi. Last
year he sold Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.1m) worth of clothes overseas; this year
he hopes for Dollars 19m and next year for Dollars 25m-Dollars 30m. Buyers
include Macy's and Liz Claiborne in the US, Spiegel, the Chicago-based
catalogue company, and Britain's Marks and Spencer.
'If you take account of the international recession, sales are picking up
very well,' says Mr Dhingra, the managing director of Orient Craft.
The same might be said for the Indian textiles industry as a whole. After a
decade of sluggish growth, textiles exports this year have soared. According
to government figures, textile exports in the first five months of the
financial year starting April were a record Dollars 2.37bn, up 17.1 per cent
over the same period in 1991. This included a 32.7 per cent increase in
ready-made garments, the fastest-growing business in the industry.
As textiles account for about one third of Indian exports, the industry's
export performance is a critical barometer of the government economic
reforms. Mr Dhingra believes that even though his sales were growing before
the introduction of reforms in mid-1991, the government's programme has
generated new interest from foreign buyers.
Textiles businessmen in Bombay, the centre of India's cotton industry, tell
a similar story. Foreign customers visit more frequently and test purchases
for 10,000 pieces are turning into orders for 100,000 and more. Liz
Claiborne has opened an office in India and Quelle, the German catalogue
retailer, plans to do the same. Mr Arvind Mafatlal, chairman of Arvind
Mafatlal, a textiles-based conglomerate, says: 'We are just beginning. By
1994 India will be a major force in the market.'
Companies are gearing up for growth with heavy investments. Orient Craft is
expanding into two new factories and increasing the workforce from 1,400 to
3,000. On a much larger scale, Arvind Mafatlal is ploughing Dollars 200m
into up-grading its textiles factories, including one producing shirts for
foreign buyers such as J C Penney, the US retailer.
In a sense, the industry, like the Indian economy, is trying to make up for
lost time. With abundant raw cotton, low labour costs and a long history of
textiles manufacturing, India could have taken advantage of international
markets long ago. But previous socialist-inclined economic policies
encouraged companies to concentrate on protected home markets and exports to
the Communist bloc. Moreover, the state intervened by repeatedly
nationalising old mills to save them from closure while simultaneously
subsidising small-scale workshops to save handloom weavers from poverty.
The result was a bloated, uncompetitive, inward-looking industry. By 1990,
India's share in the international textiles and clothing trade was just 3
per cent, little more than Pakistan's 2 per cent and far behind China's 7.5
per cent.
Even before the advent of Mr Narasimha Rao, the reformist prime minister,
better-managed companies were prodded into action by a collapse in sales to
former Communist states. But the new government's policies have encouraged
others to follow suit.
Exporters also took advantage of the sharp devaluation of the rupee, which
increased export competitiveness, coupled to the economic slowdown in
industrialised countries, which forced buyers to seek out cheaper sources of
supply. 'Business leaders saw this was our first and last chance to catch up
with other countries,' says Mr Sanjay Lalbhai, managing director of Arvind
Mills, a textiles group investing Dollars 200m in what will be one of the
world's largest factories for denim and cotton shirting.
But the industry will not transform itself overnight. As the chairman of one
Bombay mill company says: 'We are not competitive even with Indonesia, never
mind Pakistan or China. We have a long way to go.'
Economic liberalisation has barely begun to affect the industry's core.
While export incentives have been introduced with some dramatic results,
manufacturers' freedom is still curbed by import controls on cotton and
other raw materials and, especially by labour laws which make it all but
impossible for large companies to dismiss or redeploy workers.
Government-directed cheap finance for state-owned companies and for small
workshops drives up the cost of capital for other businesses. The real
interest rate in India (nominal rates minus inflation) is about 10 per cent.
Furthermore, years of protection have generated a business culture which
tolerates poor quality, little attention to cost control and frequent delays
in deliveries. Even export-oriented garment-makers, which are particularly
attuned to foreign requirements, can be hamstrung by their suppliers.
Indian textile makers cannot rely on the further devaluation to make them
competitive, because this would make it prohibitely expensive to buy the
imported equipment needed to meet foreign quality and design standards.
Also, the industry is heavily reliant on cotton for its success. A swing in
fashion in developed countries away from the current preference for natural
fibres could hurt Indian fabric makers. Finally, the rules of the Multi
Fibre Arrangement, under which developed countries restrict imports of
textiles, tend to treat India less favourably than longer-established
textiles exporters.
Nevertheless, Indian companies have some competitive advantages.
High-quality cotton is in good supply. With improvements in communications
and transport, companies will be increasingly able to use the great
diversity of Indian skills in spinning, weaving and dyeing.
With the help of reforms, there are enough opportunities in Indian textiles
for entrepreneurs to build large businesses over the next few years. But the
danger is that the legacy of India's past economic policies could limit the
extent to which the successes of the energetic few benefit the rest of the
industry, let alone the rest of the economy.

FT  03 NOV 92 / World Trade News: German-US air truce likely today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A TEMPORARY truce in the transatlantic German-US air war is expected to be
signed today or shortly, transport officials in Bonn say.
The deal, due to last a year, should dissuade Germany from unilaterally
abrogating its present air transport accord. Recent months have seen a
dramatic decline in Lufthansa's share of routes between Germany and the US,
in a price-cutting war with the big US carriers. The US transportation
department confirmed talks had made 'considerable progress', indicating
finalisation of a new agreement likely within a fortnight.
The temporary deal will freeze the present capacity of US carriers on
transatlantic air routes, and offer Lufthansa, the German state airline,
more destinations in the US, aviation industry officials say. But it falls
far short of the demand for a substantial cut in capacity of the US carriers
on routes to Germany, which is what Lufthansa and the German government are
seeking.
The existing bilateral pact goes back over four decades. Lufthansa was given
the right to serve 12 US cities. In 1978, with subsequent additions. The
agreement, meanwhile, gives US airlines fairly widespread access to German
airports.
Last year, Delta Air Lines, one of the big three US carriers, acquired the
former Pan Am assets in continental Europe, presenting Lufthansa with a
tougher competitor in its own backyard. Aviation relations seemed to
deteriorate in the spring, with the German authorities threatening to limit
capacity US carriers could provide between the two countries. Officials said
Chancellor Helmut Kohl had written to President George Bush recently,
warning that failure to reach agreement might force Germany to terminate the
existing pact.
The Germans say US carriers are exploiting transatlantic over-capacity to
slice their fares, to ensure passengers for their internal US services,
where European carriers cannot compete.

FT  03 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Salinas pledges war on 'unfair' imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO is expected to make greater use of anti-dumping laws and import rules
in an attempt to slow growth of its trade deficit, after President Carlos
Salinas pledged his government would 'mount an effective guard against
unfair trade practices'.
These measures, and new regulations for importers introduced in August, are
compatible with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the government
says, but officials concede the timing of their introduction was influenced
by their wish to keep down the deficit.
The measures, the officials say, should allow the current account deficit to
be kept below Dollars 20bn (Pounds 12.2bn) this year. The deficit on trade
for the first nine months stood at about Dollars 14.5bn (Pounds 8.8bn),
after sharp falls in August and September.
The government is examining imports of steel and textiles from the US, which
it suspects are being sold into Mexico at below average costs. It is also
considering action against Chinese textile imports, where anti-dumping laws
cannot be invoked because it is impossible to determine manufacturing costs.
Regulations introduced in August, including the requirement to translate
into Spanish labelling and official documents, have been causing long delays
at the US-Mexican border, through which 70 per cent of the country's imports
pass. This explains most of the rapid decline in the trade deficit that
month from over Dollars 2bn to around Dollars 1.5bn.
Mexico's health secretary has similarly required importers of consumer food
products to record the origin, production process and other details of their
imports. Such measures have been used to turn away Dollars 3m-worth of beef
from Northern Ireland which had passed all international health standards.
Mexico's current account deficit increased from Dollars 7.1bn in 1990, to
Dollars 13.3bn last year. This year, the deficit is likely to reach Dollars
20bn, Dollars 7bn more than originally forecast.

The Caribbean Community (Caricom) has agreed to reduce the top level of the
common external tariff from 45 per cent to 30-35 per cent, writes Canute
James in Port of Spain.
Caricom's 13 member states will introduce the lower tariff between January 1
and June 30 next year. The top rate will be further reduced to 25-30 per
cent by 1995, falling to 20-25 per cent by 1997.
The tariff cut, agreed in Trinidad, has angered regional businesses, which
want continued protection. The US has sought more substantial and immediate
cuts.
The new tariff structure is aimed at satisfying deep divisions among
community members over tariff levels.

SOME 29 countries led by Australia yesterday urged leaders of the seven main
industrialised countries to intervene to have the Uruguay Round trade talks
wound up by the end of this year, writes Frances Williams in Geneva.
The move, coinciding with further EC-US farm talks in Chicago yesterday,
reflects the frustration of many smaller Gatt members at the failure of the
two trading giants to settle their remaining differences. This has held up
the 108-nation Uruguay Round negotiations in Geneva since the end of last
year.
The statement, sent by Mr Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, on
behalf of the 29, urges the Group of Seven leaders to complete the round
this year.
'Without an urgent solution to outstanding differences this deadline will
not be met and a successful conclusion to the entire round will be put at
risk,' the statement says.
The signatories, including members of the Cairns group of farm exporters,
the Nordic countries, Austria, Poland and Czechoslovakia, and South Korea,
say the economic and trade interests at stake are not those of the G7 alone,
'but of the entire international community'.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Future of Panic hangs in balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE political future of Mr Milan Panic, the Yugoslav prime minister,
yesterday hung in the balance after deputies to the Socialist-dominated
parliament in Belgrade voted in favour of a no-confidence motion.
The move signalled Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's resolve to
dominate Yugoslavia even at the expense of provoking civil war. After a
fiery debate, deputies to the House of Citizens, the lower chamber, voted
against Mr Panic by 93 votes to 24. They accused the Belgrade-born
Californian pharmaceuticals magnate of serving foreign interests and
betraying Serbia.
However, the no-confidence vote requires a majority in both chambers to
pass. The upper chamber, the 60-member House of Republics which is divided
evenly between Serbian and Montenegrin representatives, is due to vote early
this afternoon.
Montenegro, the other member of the reconstituted Yugoslav federation, has
backed Mr Panic and Mr Dobrica Cosic, the president of Yugoslavia, in their
power struggle against Mr Milosevic. But Mr Oleg Golubovic, secretary
general of the Radical party which tabled the no-confidence motion along
with the Socialists (SPS), said he was confident of victory in the upper
house.
President Milosevic, head of the SPS, has orchestrated the move to oust Mr
Panic, who survived a no-confidence vote in September after the intervention
of Mr Cosic and with the support of Montenegro.
While Mr Panic has pledged to stop the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina, he wields
little influence over Bosnia's Serbian leaders, some of whom yesterday said
they were pulling out of the international peace talks in Geneva chaired by
Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance.
The Serbs were reported to be walking out until their 'basic demand' for an
ethnic division of Bosnia was met. Mr Vance and Lord Owen are opposed to
ethnic division and have presented a draft constitution that would divide
Bosnia into between seven and 10 units along economic rather than ethnic
lines, which the Bosnian Serbs say is unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Moslem and Croat refugees yesterday continued to pour out of the
central Bosnian town of Jajce, captured by the Serbs last Thursday, and
headed for the nearby Croat-held town of Travnik. United Nations relief
officials said at least 35,000 people had made the hazardous journey on foot
or in horse-drawn carts in the largest exodus of the war so far.
Elsewhere in Bosnia, Serb forces clashed with the mainly Moslem Bosnian
government troops in a broad belt of towns north of Sarajevo. The besieged
Bosnian capital, however, was relatively quiet after a weekend of ferocious
fighting that coincided with the start of a 'week of tranquillity' called by
the UN children's fund, Unicef.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Kohl may seek curbs on asylum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN Chancellor Helmut Kohl may introduce emergency laws to limit the
influx of asylum-seekers if the governing coalition and the opposition
Social Democratic party (SPD) fail to reach agreement on how to deal with
the problem, according to government officials.
SPD officials accused Mr Kohl of planning a coup from above, saying that any
new measures limiting the right to asylum would be unconstitutional and
would undermine the 1949 Basic Law which says the granting of asylum is a
basic right for those who are persecuted.
A change in the Basic Law requires a constitutional amendment, which must be
approved by a two-thirds majority in parliament, thus needing the support of
the SPD.
The SPD, which yesterday said it might support greater controls on the
borders, is becoming increasingly divided over the issue in the run-up to
its annual conference later this month.
Mr Bjorn Engholm, the party leader, supports an amendment to the
constitution, but grass-roots membersreject this on the grounds that it
amounts to supporting those in the ruling coalition who favour new curbs on
immigration and refugee status.
The measures proposed by the governing Christian Democrat-led coalition
would allow officials the right to reject immediately applicants who cannot
prove they are being repressed or persecuted.
Mr Kohl's proposals coincide with growing pressure on the SPD to take a
stand on the immigration issue, and with the publication of figures which
showed a record monthly influx of 48,985 foreigners seeking political asylum
last month.
The number of asylum-seekers fleeing to Germany swelled to 450,000 for the
first 10 months of this year, compared with 120,000 in the whole of 1990,
and 256,000 in 1991. The greatest number came from Poland and Romania.
Mr Kohl is under pressure from the right wing of the Christian Social Union
in the coalition, and from the nationalist Republican party, which want
greater curbs on those wishing to seek refuge in, or the right to emigrate
to, Germany, even though only 5 per cent of asylum applicants are granted
such status.

FT  03 NOV 92 / East German plant shelved by Mercedes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MERCEDES-Benz, the car and commercial vehicle subsidiary of Daimler-Benz,
announced yesterday that it was shelving plans for a DM1bn (Pounds 400m)
truck factory outside Berlin, in the most serious blow yet to hopes for new
investment in former East Germany.
The move provides graphic confirmation of the downturn in the west German
economy, and the wider European market. It coincided with the latest
industrial production figures for west Germany, showing a seasonally
adjusted 2 per cent fall in September from August, continuing the decline in
the western economy.
The Mercedes decision is the second serious setback for investment plans in
east Germany in recent days, following the news that Krupp is not going
ahead with the takeover of the Eko steel plant on the Polish border.
It underlines fears that the slowdown in the west of the country is likely
to undermine the inflow of urgently needed investment in the east, where
real unemployment is running at about 25 per cent.
Mr Werner Niefer, the chairman of Mercedes-Benz, said the decision to shelve
the plan for a truck plant at Ahrensdorf had been taken because of
'structural problems in the European commercial vehicle industry', which had
become clearly visible as a result of the economic downturn.
He said medium-term forecasts for the west European market had also been
revised downwards because of declining demand for both light and heavy
trucks, and there was also a clearly reduced potential for the development
of markets in eastern Europe  - a key reason for the east German plant.
'All these facts, as well as the current under-utilisation of capacity at
our existing plants . . . simply do not permit any decision to be taken on a
new site for the time being,' he said.
The state government of Brandenburg, where the planned plant was situated,
put a brave face on the decision, stressing that the decision was only
temporary. However, it confirms a worsening investment outlook throughout
the German economy.
The decline in west German industrial production was headed by a fall of 2.5
per cent in manufacturing industry output, whereas there was a slight
recovery in mining (by 1 per cent) and construction (up 2 per cent).
Comparing the combined production totals for August and September with the
same months of 1991, manufacturing industry has dropped by 2.8 per cent, and
overall industrial production by 2.1 per cent. Within the total for
manufacturing industry, consumer goods output was down by 4.9 per cent, and
investment goods output by 4.8 per cent.

THE Moslem fundamentalist Welfare party captured 28 per cent of the vote in
Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, in municipal elections on Sunday, according
to official returns announced yesterday, AP reports from Ankara.
The party, which calls for the establishment of an Islamic state in secular
Turkey, apparently capitalised on discontent among the city's poor.
The election was limited to new city council districts, involving about
800,000 of the city's 4.2m eligible voters, and 200,000 voters in other
provinces. The Welfare party's vote in Istanbul was up from 20 per cent a
year ago.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of France's ruling Socialist party are seeking constitutional
changes to make ministers more answerable to the law, in an attempt to
prevent the scandal over Aids-contaminated blood from tainting their party
in the run-up to next spring's elections.
Mr Laurent Fabius, secretary general of the Socialist party, has said he
wants to clear himself before 'an honorary jury' of allegations that
responsibility for the infection of some 1,200 haemophiliacs with
Aids-infected blood went to the very top of the government he headed in
1984-86.
The sentencing last month of three senior doctors to four-year prison terms
provoked an outcry, particularly among the blood transfusion victims and
French doctors, that ministers had escaped their responsibility. Mr Fabius,
and health ministers in his government, gave evidence in the trial, but
under the constitution the only sanction ministers face is impeachment by
parliament. Mr Fabius said he would table a constitutional reform scrapping
the rarely-used impeachment procedure, except in cases of treason, and
applying 'ordinary justice to everyone'. In the meantime, he was ready to
submit himself to the judgment of 'an honorary jury of independent
personalities'. Opposition politicians, who would prefer to impeach Mr
Fabius if only they could rally the support, described the 'honorary jury'
idea as a smokescreen.
Greece yesterday began an investigation to determine if Aids-tainted French
blood products were given to Greek haemophiliacs in late 1985, AP reports
from Athens. The investigation comes as several doctors said that nearly 40
per cent of Greece's 1,000 haemophiliacs were probably infected with the
Aids virus in 1985.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Russian airports to be joint-stock companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government plans to separate ownership of the country's airports
from airlines in a move to promote more efficiency without going as far as
privatising the sector.
The plan is to turn 70 airports into joint-stock companies which would
remain in state hands and attract some outside investors in the longer-term.
This will enable airlines, which will remain subdivisions of Aeroflot, to
concentrate on running commercial businesses and allow airports to raise
their own revenues and enforce separate regulations.
Mr Leonid Shcheglov, president of the Aeroport Association, which represents
the airports, was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying it proposed to
hand 30 per cent of shares in the airports to central state bodies, 30 per
cent to local authorities and 40 per cent to workers and other investors.
It was not immediately clear how the plan would affect two foreign airlines'
agreements to provide modern terminal facilities and set up joint airlines
with Russian partners.
Mr Bob Hughes, financial controller for Air Russia, a British Airways' joint
venture which hopes to start flights at Moscow's Domodedovo airport next
summer, said it was too early to comment on the implications. Lufthansa,
with a similar arrangement at Moscow's main Sheremetievo airport, was also
unable to comment.
However, Interfax news agency said that Sheremetievo would for three years
remain part of a joint-stock company called Aeroflot-Russian International
Airlines, which accounted for 90 per cent of Aeroflot's international
flights - suggesting that, in reality, little would change.
Mr Vladimir Khadannikov, general director of Avtovaz, which makes Lada cars,
was elected chairman of a council of industrialists which met yesterday for
the first time.

FT  03 NOV 92 / French weaponry secured win in battle for franc: William
Dawkins explains how France managed to defend its currency against heavy
speculation where Britain failed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government's decision to cut official interest rates for the
first time in just over a year signals that the six-week battle to save the
franc from devaluation has been won, Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister,
said yesterday.
If so, this invites the question of how France managed to save its currency
against the heaviest speculative selling for years, when Britain, faced with
the same plight, failed and had to devalue.
The answer is partly that the French economy is in less poor shape than
Britain's, partly that Germany lent France a hand and partly that French
monetary authorities have more tools at hand than their British neighbours.
The markets believed in France's ability to survive among the highest real
interest rates in Europe  - true even after yesterday's cut  - because its
economy is still strong enough to deliver growth expected at roughly 2 per
cent this year, and something around the same next. France's economic
resilience is the legacy of nearly a decade of budgetary and monetary
discipline practised by successive left- and right-wing governments, a
continuity that does not exist in Britain. Admittedly, that legacy can no
longer be taken for granted at a time when France has nearly 3m out of work,
which is one reason why the crisis happened in the first place.
The latest evidence of that is a recent newspaper article by influential
opposition Gaullist rebels Mr Philippe Seguin and Mr Charles Pasqua, urging
a revaluation of the D-Mark, which would amount to a franc devaluation.
Another sign of disquiet is a paper by the Economic and Social Council, a
cross-party think tank, suggesting that competitive disinflation, the aim of
all the economic rigour, is showing its limits.
Yesterday's rate cut will provide a small amount of relief to those who fear
that high interest rates are stifling the economy. However, the right-wing
leadership, likely to take power next March, remains wedded to much the same
budgetary and monetary toughness as the Socialists. 'If the dissent were to
be magnified, there would be a risk. But we don't see the right making any
major changes in economic policy,' says Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist
at Salomon Brothers in London.
Yesterday was the moment for the French government to move because the
Banque de France has just stopped having to sell francs to balance its books
in the wake of the crisis, so removing what had been a source of pressure on
the French currency.
The French central bank spent FFr160bn (Pounds 19bn) on buying francs to
keep the French currency within its EMS range since late September, with the
help of a FFr130bn to FFr140bn loan from the Bundesbank, according to
returns from both banks, disentangled by Paul Hammett, French economist at
Paribas Capital Markets in London. The rest, around FFr20bn, came from the
French central bank's own reserves, estimates Mr Hammett.
Since then, the Banque de France has sold around FFr160bn of francs into the
open market, for D-Marks, enabling it to repay the Bundesbank and rebuild
its own reserves, even turning a small profit  - of the order of FFr1.5bn
believes Paribas  - on the franc's appreciation in value during the process.
Help from the Germany came not so much from the Bundesbank loan, under
standard ERM rules, as from the joint statement by both countries' central
banks and finance ministries at the end of September that they saw no reason
to break the franc/D-Mark link. While this whipped up British resentment of
the special relationship between France and Germany, it did at least
convince the markets that the franc was going to be defended hard.
France's tactics in the battle for the franc differed from Britain's
actions. The French central bank tends to intervene earlier and harder than
the Bank of England.
Second, the French central bank has a lever at its disposal which has no
direct equivalent at the Bank of England, the five- to 10-day repurchase
rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow short-term money from the
central bank as a last resort, similar to the Bundesbank's Lombard rate.
The Banque de France increased its repurchase rate from 10.5 per cent to 13
per cent in late September, thereby pushing up money market rates  - at
which commercial banks lend to each other  - but without triggering an
increase in the commercial banks' base rates, at which they lend to
companies and individuals. In effect, this allows it to raise rates to
defend the franc without harming the economy. That tool was harder to use
this time because money market rates shot up unusually high, to more than 20
per cent at one stage, which meant that commercial banks were lending, at a
base rate of 9.85 per cent, at a big loss. Thanks to an unofficial
understanding between the government and the leading banks, French base
rates stayed unchanged through the crisis until yesterday, so most borrowers
have felt no pain. The commercial banks, of course, lost heavily.
Money market rates have fallen steadily over the past fortnight, to around
the same level as base rates, and the repurchase rate is nearly back down to
the same level as a year ago, so the pressure on the commercial banks is now
off. Economic analysts expected them to wait to recover some of their losses
before dropping commercial base rates but four leading banks went ahead
yesterday and cut their base lending rates from 9.85 per cent to 9.65 per
cent.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Coalition poised to collapse in Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE two sides in the Irish coalition row remained at loggerheads yesterday,
making it nearly inevitable that the government would collapse today.
The crisis began when Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, last week
accused Mr Des O'Malley, industry minister and leader of the Progressive
Democrats (PDs), the junior coalition partners, of being 'dishonest' during
a parliamentary inquiry into the country's beef industry.
The PDs said they would withdraw from the Fianna Fail-PD coalition unless Mr
Reynolds publicly retracted the accusation by this morning. The PD
parliamentary group will gather just before the weekly cabinet meeting.
Ms Mary Harney, a PD deputy and junior minister of state for environmental
protection, said yesterday: 'It is a serious charge. Nothing like that has
ever been made before by a head of the government and, unless it is removed,
I don't see any way that Mr O'Malley could participate in this government .
. . it is a matter for the Fianna Fail party and Taoiseach (prime minister),
if they want the government to continue. The ball is in their court.'
Although Mr Reynolds said at the weekend that his door was open to Mr
O'Malley for discussions, he gave no indication yesterday that he intended
backing down, in spite of signs of a backbench rebellion led by members of
the former cabinet ousted by him when he took over the reins of the Fianna
Fail party from Mr Charles Haughey earlier this year.
Mr Vincent Brady, a former chief whip of Fianna Fail and defence minister,
said: 'I believe a little bit more care and caution should have been
exercised (by Mr Reynolds). Nobody wants an election at this present time
and most of our backbenchers do not want an election either.'
Mr Brady expressed doubts that Fianna Fail could win an absolute majority in
a snap general election. At that point, Mr Reynolds' future as party leader
might be in doubt, he said.
He added that when Mr Reynolds took over the party leadership 'he committed
himself to (winning) an overall majority and I presume that if he fails to
deliver on that commitment his position must come up for questioning'.
Mr Peter Barry, the deputy leader of the main opposition party, Fine Gael,
said yesterday that his party was now on an election footing. He dismissed
claims by senior Fianna Fail officials that they could continue functioning
as a minority government. 'Once the PDs withdraw it wouldn't last for 24
hours,' he said.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Yeltsin imposes N Ossetia emergency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin, struggling to keep Russia free of the small wars
which have broken out just over its borders, yesterday declared a one-month
state of emergency in the region of North Ossetia in his first military
clampdown within the country.
Parliament, setting aside its usual antagonism towards the government, threw
its weight behind the president's decision to ban local political parties
which 'hinder a settlement', order rebels to surrender their weapons, and
censor local media. The decree is to be implemented by an emergency
administration appointed by Moscow and backed up by thousands of elite
troops and ordinary conscripts flown into North Ossetia at the weekend.
Full-scale fighting erupted last week when the Ingush ethnic minority began
an unofficial military campaign against the Ossetians to regain lands
confiscated from them by Stalin.
Authorities in Moscow said yesterday the situation was under control but
local Ossetian officials declared that heavy fighting was in full swing. At
least three Russian servicemen have already been killed and nine injured in
attempts to fend off the Ingush onslaught, with much higher casualties among
civilians.
Last autumn, parliament rescinded a presidential decree declaring emergency
rule in Chechnya, another section of the mainly Moslem northern Caucasus
region, which declared independence from Moscow.
But at a time of much greater political division, Russia's rulers are under
pressure to show they can maintain order. Some politicians would even like
Mr Yeltsin to impose similar emergency measures on the rest of Russia.
'Russia is not going to lose the Northern Caucasus. It is going to take
military and diplomatic steps to keep it,' said Mr Sergei Stepashin,
chairman of parliament's defence and security committee. 'We will do
everything to avoid a Nagorno-Karabakh type situation.'
Turning to strained relations with another Moslem enclave, Russian deputies
urged Tatarstan to refrain from adopting a constitution which implicitly
declares independence from Moscow until a bilateral treaty is concluded.
Uzbekistan, the largest central Asian republic, yesterday gave up claims on
Soviet assets in return for Russia taking on its share of the country's
foreign debt.
The decision marked a victory for Russia's campaign to take on sole
responsibility for the debt but it still has to strike a deal with Ukraine,
the second-most populous republic. Mr Peter Aven, the foreign economic
relations minister, said yesterday he still hoped to reach a full
rescheduling agreement with western creditors by the end of this year.

FT  03 NOV 92 / BA clear to acquire Dan-Air
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WAY was cleared yesterday for the rapid completion of British Airways'
takeover of Dan-Air, the UK's oldest independent airline, after the
government decided not to refer the deal to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
The acquisition, for a nominal Pounds 1, was waved through by Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, in spite of concerns about the
reduction in competition.
Protests had been made to the Office of Fair Trading by BA's smaller rivals
 - Virgin Atlantic Airways, British Midland and Air UK.
The decision was announced within hours of Dan-Air's last charter flight,
from Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, to Gatwick. On Friday, the European
Commission's competition authorities said they would not be investigating
the deal.
BA is taking on just 15, about half, of Dan-Air's scheduled routes. Services
on six will be stopped this week, including flights to Jersey, the airline's
first scheduled destination in 1956.
Mr Heseltine has followed the OFT's recommendation that the public interest
would be better served by avoiding an MMC referral. He was particularly
concerned about the adverse impact Dan-Air's closure could have on services
at Gatwick, where it is the largest operator with a fifth of the slots.
BA had made it clear that it would drop the deal, which involves it taking
on Pounds 35m of Dan-Air's liabilities, if the merger were referred to the
MMC or bound by conditions.
Mr David James, chairman of Davies &amp; Newman Holdings, Dan-Air's parent, had
stressed that the alternative was receivership.
BA's rivals continued to protest yesterday. Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of
British Midland, called the DTI decision 'astonishing', describing it as
'harmful to the consumer and the interests of the majority of Britain's
airlines'. Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin, called for an urgent
review of competition policy.
The DTI acknowledged the merger would allow BA to strengthen its position at
Gatwick and Heathrow. Nevertheless, it said it remained committed to
encouraging competition.
BA said the addition of Dan-Air's routes would take its share of Gatwick
slots from 11 to 21 per cent, but leave its 37 per cent share at Heathrow
largely unchanged.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Rising dollar and political woes unite to sink sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP rise in the US dollar and growing political uncertainty in Britain
yesterday pushed sterling to its lowest ever level on its trade weighted
index.
The index, which measures the value of sterling against the currencies of
Britain's main trading partners, touched 77.7 before closing at 77.9 amid
fears that Mr John Major may be defeated in tomorrow's Maastricht vote in
the House of Commons.
Sterling also fell sharply against the US dollar which rose on the strength
of the latest polls pointing to a victory for Mr Bill Clinton in today's US
presidential election.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 35.93 at
3,262.21, buoyed by good news on the economy.
The UK stock market ignored the pound's fall, believing that interest rate
cuts are still likely before the end of the year. The FT-SE 100 Index of
leading shares rose 29.5 points, to finish at 2,687.8.
The US currency's strong performance was aided by poor industrial production
figures in Germany, which increased speculation that the Bundesbank will
ease official short-term interest rates, reducing the premium received by
investors holding D-Marks.
But the dollar has mainly attracted investors who expect a Clinton victory
to bring more US government spending and higher interest rates that will
help push the dollar upwards.
Against the D-Mark, the dollar closed yesterday in London nearly three
pfennigs higher at DM1.568, a level last seen on June 22 this year. In New
York it fell back slightly to close at DM1.5645.
The pound closed more than 3 cents down on the day in London at Dollars
1.53, a level last seen in October 1989.
The pound in effect has been devalued by 24 per cent against the US currency
since it fetched Dollars 2.00 two months ago. In New York it closed at
Dollars 1.5345. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said recently that
increasing attention would be paid to the index in the formulation of
monetary policy.
Dealers believe there could be heavy selling of the pound if the government
loses tomorrow's Maastricht vote. One UK-based fund manager suggested
yesterday that sterling could fall to Dollars 1.40 and DM2.20 in the
near-term if the government was defeated.
Long-dated gilts fell sharply yesterday, ending a percentage point down on
the day.

FT  03 NOV 92 / PM warns Maastricht rebels: Cabinet battle over spending
cuts adds to pressure on government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR'S government yesterday delivered a stark warning that a vote
against the Maastricht treaty on European union in tomorrow's crucial
Commons debate could wreck the prospects for British economic recovery.
With the prime minister leading personally a frantic campaign to win back
Tory Euro-sceptics, there were signs last night that the arithmetic of the
vote was shifting slightly in his favour.
But amid claims and counter-claims from both sides the outcome still looked
perilously close. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, sought to maximise the
chances of a government defeat by tabling an amendment to tomorrow's motion
which would halt progress on ratification of Maastricht until after next
month's Edinburgh summit.
The threat that a defeat would provoke a renewed economic crisis was
reinforced by a sharp fall in the value of the pound on foreign exchange
markets. Dealers cited the political uncertainty as a central factor in
sterling's fall to a record low of 77.7 on its trade-weighted index against
a basket of currencies.
The precarious economic outlook dominated a four and a half hour cabinet
session last night called to share out the deep cuts in Whitehall spending
programmes needed to meet the Treasury's target for next week's Autumn
Statement. The cabinet will meet again this morning to continue the
discussion.
Ministers sought to lift some of the gloom by hinting again that the
statement would be accompanied by a cut in interest rates, and by promising
that important capital projects would be protected by combined private and
public sector money.
Downing Street officials said there was no question of the cabinet breaking
the Pounds 244.5bn ceiling imposed on spending next year. But there were
suggestions elsewhere in Whitehall that the Treasury might find ways to
'circumvent' the target with creative accounting.
There were also signs that the government was working on an emergency
package to help the housing market, including the release of the frozen
capital receipts held by local authorities.
But the special cabinet session confirmed that a fierce squeeze on public
sector pay, unpopular cuts in social security benefits, and deep reductions
in defence spending would be at the heart of the public spending package.
Despite the threat of a backbench Tory rebellion over the council tax, Mr
Michael Howard, environment secretary, seemed set to win only limited
resources to cushion the impact next year of the poll tax replacement.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, acknowledged that the coincidence of the
revolt on Maastricht with the cabinet battle over spending cuts meant a
critical week for the government.
The strongest warning of a slump in economic confidence if the Maastricht
vote was lost came from Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary.
He told BBC radio that Maastricht was 'at the centre of restoring confidence
to this country's trading economy'. He added ominously: 'If you vote against
the prime minister and against the government on Wednesday, on Thursday you
have got a policy vacuum at the centre of British decision-making of
incalculable destructiveness.'
Mr Major, whose personal authority would be gravely undermined by a defeat,
made the same point in a private meeting with about 20 Tory MPs in his
office at the Commons.
But as his opponents claimed that 40 Tories  - enough to defeat the
government  - were determined to vote against Maastricht, Mr Major found his
authority under attack from Lord Parkinson, a former Tory chairman.
Speaking on BBC television's Panorama programme, he suggested the government
had 'lost control', adding 'the buck stops at No 10'.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Clinton's confidence boosted by final polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton took the high road and President George Bush the lower
one on the last frenetic day of campaigning before today's US presidential
election.
The mood of the Arkansas governor reflected the growing perception that he
stands on the brink of becoming the first Democrat to win the White House in
16 years.
In early stops on a final, nine-state, 4,000-mile cross-country marathon
starting in Pennsylvania and ending in Colorado, Mr Clinton's message,
delivered with what remains of his voice, was that people should vote and do
so aggressively.
'Tomorrow, the great mystery of democracy will be played out . . . when your
vote counts just as much as mine or Mr Bush's or anybody else's and when you
have a chance to take your country back and reclaim your future,' he said.
The contrast with Mr Bush, whose own odyssey covered five states from
Pennsylvania to his native Texas, could not have been greater. Sounding
increasingly desperate, Mr Bush continued to insult Mr Clinton at every
opportunity. He was 'the slippery one', 'a bozo' totally devoid of foreign
policy experience, a man who would bring 'economic disaster' to the country.
'Watch your wallets,' he told a crowd in New Jersey. 'When Bill Clinton is
playing that tax-ophone, middle class Americans will be singing the blues.'
His campaign has been frantically trying to peddle to the media all sorts of
damaging information against his principal opponent. Among them are
unsubstantiated 'stories' that further attempts were made to tamper with Mr
Clinton's draft records in the 1970s and that films exist of Mr Clinton
burning an American flag during a London demonstration against the Vietnam
war in 1969.
Mr Bush insisted all was not lost. 'Put that victory parade on hold,
Governor Clinton, because I'm gonna win this election tomorrow,' was his
refrain. Mr Robert Teeter, his official campaign chairman, said on
television yesterday that 25-35 states were still 'very competitive'.
But the mood of his travelling staff was said to be one of resignation to
the inevitable. Mr Bush himself no longer looks at the latest polling data.
The final polls yesterday gave Mr Clinton national leads of 7-12 points. The
final CNN/USA Today poll of likely voters, which had pointed to a narrowing
race last week, distributed the undecided element and came up with the
figure of 49 per cent for Mr Clinton, 37 per cent for Mr Bush and 14 per
cent for Mr Ross Perot, the Texas independent.
An ABC News poll of 9,115 likely voters gave Mr Clinton 44 per cent, against
37 per cent for Mr Bush and 16 per cent for Mr Perot.
The only polling consolation for the president was a survey in Ohio which
found he had overtaken Mr Clinton for the first time. All other assessments
of the national electoral map assign to Mr Clinton almost enough or more
than enough of the 270 electoral college votes needed for victory.
The one wild card remains Mr Perot, who is still in double figures in all
the polls and who has taken to attacking Mr Clinton almost as strenuously as
he does Mr Bush.
Some pundits think Mr Perot has an outside chance of carrying states such as
Alaska and Maine, both with independent traditions.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Portugal (12): Time to catch up -
Telecommunications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTUGAL's first private telecom corporation began operations on October 18
when a Portuguese-US consortium launched a nationwide cellular telephone
network. The start-up follows the liberalisation of the telecommunications
sector in 1991.
The new company, Telecel-Comunicacoes Pessoais, involving the US company
Pactel-Pacific Telephone Systems and two Portuguese partners, will compete
with an existing state-owned competitor. Both use advanced GSM-Pan-European
Digital Mobile Phone technology.
'Private operators and the entry of private capital into existing companies
will help Portugal prepare for the increasing competition the country will
confront in international telecommunications sectors,' says Mr Joao Manuel
de Mello Franco, president of TLP-Telefones de Lisboa e Porto. 'Private
entrepreneurs will also help increase the flexibility of our companies and
improve our management to face future challenges.'
TLP is one of three state-owned companies operating public
telecommunications services in Portugal. It operates the public network in
greater Lisbon and greater Oporto. The area covers 37 per cent of the
population, 60 per cent of the nation's purchasing power and 80 per cent of
corporate headquarters.
More than half of the country's telephone traffic is generated by TLP
customers and a good 20 per cent of customers are corporate. Operations in
these two large metropolitan areas make TLP one of Portugal's top business
corporations, ranking fourth in terms of gross value added and net assets.
The public network in the rest of the country and for European connections
is operated by CTT-Correios e Telecomunicacoes de Portugal, which is shortly
to be split into separate postal and telecom services. CPRM-Companhia
Portuguesa de Radio Marconi, 51 per cent owned by the state, has a
concession to operate intercontinental services via submarine cable and
satellite.
To bring these three separate companies together, the Lisbon government has
created a holding company, CN-Comunicacoes Nacionais, to manage the entirety
of Portugal's telecommunications services as a single conglomerate.
'This will enable us better to co-ordinate company strategy, avoid
difficulties over frontier areas and invest all three companies with a
solidarity aimed at achieving the same objectives,' says Mr Joaquim Ferreira
do Amaral, the minister for public works, transport and communications.
More importantly, private capital will be admitted to the three
corporations. A limit of 49 per cent will initially be imposed on private
participation. But this will gradually be increased.
'If we completely privatised the companies very rapidly, only a few
international corporations would probably be in a position to mobilise the
large sums needed to invest,' says Mr Ferreira do Amaral. 'By deciding on a
gradual process of denationalisation we aim to allow more companies,
including Portuguese enterprises, to buy into Portugal's telecommunication
services.'
Besides privatisation of basic telecommunication services, Portugal is
rapidly opening up complementary services to private investors. In addition
to the private mobile telephone network, three private companies operating
paging services will be launched at the end of 1992, to compete with an
existing publicly-owned service.
Many other new value-added services, including audiotext, videotext,
electronic mail, electronic data interchange and videoconferencing, are
generating strong interest from entrepreneurs and potential consumers.
TLP and other operators are investing heavily in improving the basic
telecommunications network in Portugal, partly to facilitate the growth of
value-added services. Over the past five years, massive investment, which
has been increasing at a rate of 22 per cent a year in real terms, has
almost doubled the number of telephones in the country.
From only 19 phones per 100 inhabitants in 1985, Portugal will have 30 by
the end of 1992. This compares with a growth rate from 41 to 44 for Europe
as a whole. In its urban centres, Portugal is nearing the average European
rate of 40-45 telephones, with 38 telephones for every 100 people.
Mr Ferreira do Amaral describes Portugal's unparalleled spending on
telecommunications as 'a singular moment in our country's history,' needed
to keep pace with the rapid growth of the Portuguese economy.
Portugal's investment in telecommunications, estimated at Es130bn (Pounds
594m) this year alone, is already providing excellent opportunities for
international telecom corporations and suppliers. The field for business
will open even wider shortly with at least the partial privatisation of
three major state-owned telecom operators and the granting of concessions
for complementary services.
'No other country in the European Community is investing as much as we are
in telecommunications,' says Mr Mello Franco. 'By the end of 1992 we will
have converted 51 per cent of the network to digitalised local switching.
The number will reach 75 per cent in three years' time.'
Portugal is also increasing its fibre-optic networks to improve services and
meet the growing demand from banks and similar corporations for private
networks and to prepare for the advent of cable television.
By 1995 a multi-purpose high-capacity fibre-optic link will join Portugal to
Madrid, the Spanish capital, and to the rest of the European fibre-optic
network. At the same time it will connect the country's 500 biggest cities
and towns with each other.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Portugal (13): Plenty in the pipeline - Peter Wise
sees the infrastructure undergo a revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUCH IS the rate of motorway building in Portugal that no map gives an
accurate and up-to-date picture of the country's road network. That is the
proud boast of Mr Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral, who as minister for public
works, transport and communications is the man with responsibility for
redesigning the country's infrastructure.
After three decades of neglect and miserly investment, Portugal's
infrastructure has been undergoing a revolution in terms of expansion and
modernisation since entry to the European Community in 1986. A 15-year
programme is now roughly at the halfway mark and massive investments lie
ahead.
Private companies, eyeing future opportunities, calculate a total nearing
Es3,000bn (Pounds 13.5bn) will be invested in improving Portugal's basic
infrastructure in the coming years.
The projects abound. Pre-qualifying tenders for a new Es121bn bridge
stretching 11km over the Tagus river at Lisbon were sought last month. It
will be one of the largest bridges in Europe. The authorities are currently
studying road links with the Lisbon inner ring road and north-south
motorway.
A contract is being prepared with Sea Core International of the Netherlands
for a river-bed geological survey. Barclays de Zoete Wedd will be consulted
over project financing. In addition, a rail link will be added to the
existing Tagus bridge.
The EC Commission has approved Es18.7bn to finance a natural gas network in
Portugal. This will cover around 45 per cent of the estimated total cost
through to 1993. The main expenditure will be on a terminal in Setubal and a
Setubal-Braga pipeline. The Commission has also approved Es21.8bn to finance
regional distribution networks for natural gas.
Caminhos de Ferro Portugueses (CP), the state-owned railway company, will
invest Es300bn over the next seven years in an upgrading programme. CP hopes
to cut the rail travel time from Lisbon to Oporto to 2 hours 25 minutes,
which is more than 45 minutes faster than the equivalent motorway travel
time. Portugal has also announced that it will change some of its railway
lines to conform to European gauge standards and prepare for a high-speed
TGV rail link from Lisbon via Oporto to Madrid.
Over the next four years, state-owned Metropolitano de Lisboa will invest
Es120bn in expanding and modernising the underground network into the
backbone of the capital's public transport system. Expansion work, planned
to be completed by the second half of 1996, will transform the present
one-line system into three independent lines. The plan also involves
building five new stations and new workshop facilities.
A stretch of Lisbon's waterfront, linking the central Praca de Comercio to
the 16th-century Jeronimos Monastery and beyond, will be equipped with
ultra-modern, high-speed trams. Existing tracks will be renewed and
sub-stations modernised. International tenders will be sought for the
investment, which should reanimate and dramatically improve public transport
in a central part of the city. The new trams will be running by 1994.
The government considers the modernisation of ports another crucial area for
a country whose imports and exports, representing the equivalent of some 60
per cent of gross domestic product, are largely transported by sea.
Development will focus on improving and expanding installations, including
the construction of a new Es20bn port zone on the south side of the Tagus
estuary at Lisbon and improving port management to increase productivity,
reduce costs and provide better services. 'Efficient ports in Portugal will
provide Europe with another gateway to the world,' says Mr Ferreira do
Amaral.
Legislation reorganising the maritime sector and providing for greater
efficiency and improved linkage between shipping, harbours and fishing has
been put forward by the Sea Ministry. The aim is to improve resource use, to
end the overlapping of different authorities and to decentralise. The new
law will merge and place under direct ministerial control all port
administrations, the National Harbour Pilot Institute and the National
Stevedore Institute.
After completing Portugal's first north-south motorway linking Setubal,
Lisbon, Oporto and Braga in 1991, three years ahead of schedule, the
government has announced that the length of the national motorway network
will be almost doubled by 1996, from 436km to 753km, at a cost of Es260bn.
Further into the future, a decision will be taken on the site of a new
Lisbon airport. The government is also set to decide on a long-mooted major
dam at Alqueva in the southern Alentejo region. Local officials are lobbying
hard for the project, which they say could halt desertification and lessen
the impact of drought.
Most of the finance for the massive expansion of Portugal's infrastructure
comes from the government budget. EC funds have contributed about 15 per
cent of total spending to date. A further key source of finance is private
investment.
'Private investment will be the source of infrastructure finance that grows
most in the future,' says Mr Ferreira do Amaral. 'Because they are the ones
taking the risk, private entrepreneurs are experts in the analysis of
project feasibility. In many cases, private investment gives the guarantee
that justifies a project in political terms.'
In keeping with this philosophy the new Tagus bridge, the rail link over the
existing bridge and many other major projects will be contracted out to
private entrepreneurs on a build and operate basis.

FT  03 NOV 92 / US and EC in last-ditch talks to end farm trade deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO AND DAVID DODWELL, WORLD TRADE EDITOR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US AND European Community farm trade negotiators extended last-ditch
discussions in Chicago yesterday aimed at settling a long-standing dispute
over the EC's farm subsidy regime.
Neither side would indicate whether a breakthrough was in sight but, after
more than 10 hours of talks, which stretched into the night and forced US
officials to cancel electioneering plans, hopes rose that progress was being
made.
At the outset of the talks between Mr Ed Madigan, the US agriculture
secretary, and Mr Ray MacSharry, his EC counterpart, the EC reiterated that
any deal would have to protect the reform of the Common Agriculture Policy
(CAP) agreed in May.
Mr Roger Runningen, the US agriculture department spokesman, said the fact
that the talks had been extended was 'an indication that both sides are
willing to go on to try and strike an agreement'.
Although no substantially new proposals were put forward, both sides
continued to exchange new formulas designed to place enforceable limits on
the EC's subsidised oilseed production, which remains the thorniest issue
separating the two sides.
'It could evolve into a framework but I'm not going to go that far,' Mr
Runningen said. A senior EC negotiator said that, leaving aside agreement on
oilseeds, 'we could settle the Uruguay Round in five minutes'.
The farm trade impasse has for two years blocked progress towards agreement
on the ambitious Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation.
It has also threatened to boil over into outright trade war, with the US
calling for sanctions against the EC for its oilseeds subsidy regime, which
they say causes losses of Dollars 1bn a year for US oilseed farmers.
US trade officials confirmed yesterday that punitive tariffs  - mostly aimed
at France, Europe's leading farm exporter  - would be presented tomorrow at
a meeting in Geneva of the council of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt) if no settlement is found in Chicago.
met for more than three hours on Sunday, and had resumed on Monday morning.
Contrary to original plans, talks continued into dinner, with the two farm
representatives devoting almost all of that time to the controversial oil
seeds dispute.
The US has pressed the Europeans to reduce their subsidised oilseed output
from more than 12m tonnes to 9m or less. Soyabean farmers want a further
rollback to around 7.5m tonnes, and say the problem will remain so long as
EC farmers receive subsidies that are dependent on planting new crops. The
EC, which says its CAP reforms can cut output to 9.5m tonnes, insists that
the US should not call for any further reforms than those assured under the
CAP.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Compensation plan for pensions: Industry body backs role of
government in supervising funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S pension fund trade association yesterday called for a compulsory
industry-funded compensation scheme for pension funds which would for the
first time require government supervision of the industry.
Mr Brian McMahon, chairman of the executive council of the National
Association of Pension Funds, said: 'It is the NAPF's firm belief that the
members of pension schemes must be able to have absolute confidence in the
security and integrity of those schemes.
'Council has therefore come to the conclusion that there needs to be a
compulsory compensation scheme to cover all members of approved pension
schemes.'
Mr McMahon said he believed most NAPF members favoured the creation of a
compensation scheme, although he acknowledged there were concerns about the
expense.
The government's Pension Law Review Committee, chaired by Professor Roy
Goode, has been charged with examining the feasibility of a compensation
scheme, and NAPF will submit its plan to the Goode Committee for
consideration.
The plan would require the establishment of a government agency to oversee
and administer the compensation scheme, and all schemes would be forced to
join. It would pay the pensions of those members whose assets had
disappeared through fraud or mismanagement or for any other reason.
The new government body would be responsible for enforcing rules on pension
fund administration designed to minimise potential claims on the scheme.
Pension fund law is already under review by Professor Goode's committee and
the new body would have to monitor compliance with any changes brought in on
the basis of his recommendations.
These rules are those which the government is expected to lay down to
protect future pensioners against frauds such as that by the late Mr Robert
Maxwell.
The plan would be funded by 'risk-related' premiums assessed on each scheme
in which those schemes that followed industry best-practice would bear the
lowest relative cost.
Mr Ron Amy, a member of the NAPF council and pensions manager at Grand
Metropolitan, said that to reduce potential claims, the government would for
the first time have to prescribe key aspects of pension fund administration.
Those aspects could include rules requiring member representation on boards
of trustees and minimum solvency standards for schemes.
Mr McMahon said it was not realistic for the compensation scheme to be made
retrospective to cover payments to pensioners of companies controlled by the
late Mr Maxwell.

FT  03 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Bayer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market should hardly have been surprised to learn that Bayer's full year
profits will be lower than last year. Dreadful figures from ICI and DSM last
week underlined how bad conditions in bulk chemicals have become. On top of
the cyclical problem of over-capacity and weak prices, European companies
face the threat of cheap dollar imports. The foreign exchange markets have
been doubly unkind to Bayer; its US pharmaceuticals earnings will be weak
this year when translated into strong D-Marks.
There must be some doubt about how far pharmaceuticals can prop up the bulk
chemicals side. The company is not alone in facing the threat of a tougher
drugs pricing regime in the US, whoever wins today's presidential election.
Equally worrying is the prospect of enforced 5 per cent price cuts in
Bayer's home market, but it is encouraging to see the company determined to
keep the lid on costs. Third quarter figures due at the end of this month
will determine whether Bayer joins ICI, BASF and DSM on the list of
chemicals companies with doubtful dividends.

FT  03 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Prudential Corporation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market was expecting too much from Prudential's new method of accounting
for life insurance business. Admittedly, the new accruals method of
recognising profits results in a higher earnings figure. If investors are
less flummoxed by the way profits are generated from the life side, the
Pru's rating could also benefit. By recognising profits earlier in the term
of life policies, though, the Pru neither increases nor diminishes the hard
cash it has available to support the dividend.
Under the accruals method new business sales will be reflected in the profit
and loss account. True, this means the earnings figure will be more volatile
 -boosted by sales of Pounds 1bn from single-premium bonds this year, for
example. If better disclosure helps the market predict the dividend trend,
so much the better.
A further question is whether the new method will become an industry
standard. Non-financial groups such as BAT Industries will doubtless be
grateful for the opportunity to consolidate higher profits. Yet Legal &amp;
General has already pinned its colours to a different mast. The rest are
likely to remain sceptical until the impact on Prudential's share price is
clearer. There is a danger the market will be confronted with a
proliferation of accounting methods. Even if the in-dustry follows the Pru,
the sums turn crucially on management assumptions about investment returns,
policy surrenders and so on. This fact alone is reason enough to be
sceptical.

FT  03 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: AB Foods
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With bone-crunching competition in milling and baking, Mr Garry Weston,
Associated British Food's chairman, must be glad that his protracted fight
to buy British Sugar eventually succeeded. All the more so because the
full-year figures show how falling interest rates have eaten into ABF's
investment income. Profits of Pounds 139m from sugar this year fully justify
the Pounds 880m which the company paid for British Sugar, and while the best
of the rationalisation improvements must now be past, some further progress
can be expected. Which is more than can be said of the bread business.
Arguments rage about whether Ranks Hovis McDougall, ABF or the independent
bakers are stoking the price war. But the strong position of the supermarket
chains means that the flexible independents are moving to take over the
own-label cheap loaf market, while the large groups need that volume to keep
unit prices down.
So everyone has an incentive to keep the battle for market share going. The
woes of this commodity business are only increased by devaluation. If as
expected the 'green pound' is devalued within the EC this January, UK wheat
prices will rise, but bakers are unlikely to be able to pass on much of the
price increase. Thinly-sliced margins will thus be cut further.
Fortunately for ABF, its balance sheet is strong. While it too is cutting
capacity, it is likely ABF will emerge from the rationalisation process with
a higher market share than it went in, whoever wins RHM, But that trench war
and the longer-term uncertainties over EC policy in the sugar market make
earnings prospects dull. Investors have cut ABF's rating heavily in the last
two years. There is little reason for that to change.

FT  03 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Tarnished gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The composure shown by the gilts market since Black Wednesday's devaluation
seems finally to be cracking after yesterday's fall of more than a point at
the long end. The most obvious concern is the Autumn spending round, which
has set the market worrying about drift in fiscal as well as monetary
policy. Tomorrow's parliamentary vote on the Maastricht Treaty may, however,
ultimately prove to be more important.
Funding a PSBR which, on some estimates, could approach Pounds 50bn next
year is certainly a daunting task. It would be rash to assume the
authorities' only strategy is to allow gilt prices and the exchange rate to
fall far enough to attract foreign buyers back into the market. When
sterling was floating before, overseas investors bought gilts when they
thought the currency was cheap, but they did not necessarily hold on to
them. That suggests the need for substantial domestic support will continue.
Indeed the authorities might eventually be forced to relent on their refusal
to allow bank and building society purchases of gilts to count as funding.
The chancellor would have been foolish to play into the hands of spending
ministers by announcing this in last week's Mansion House speech while
budget discussions were still going on.
As for foreign investors, they would be more likely to buy and hold gilts if
they perceived a period of currency stability ahead. Perhaps sterling will
tend to rise against the D-Mark next year in the backwash of a higher dollar
and lower German interest rates. Foreign appetite for gilts would be
greater, though, if the market had by then started to believe sterling might
eventually rejoin the ERM. The credibility of that expectation has less to
do with the absolute level of sterling than with the government's ability to
overcome its internal divisions over Europe.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Bank of France cuts interest rates by 1/4 point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Banque de France yesterday cut its two benchmark interest rates by a
quarter of a percentage point and said it had recovered the reserves it used
to support the franc during the currency crisis in September.
The reductions, the first for just over a year, bring the intervention rate,
at which the central bank does most of its lending to the banking system, to
9.35 per cent and the five to 10 day repurchase rate, for borrowers of last
resort, to 10.25 per cent.
Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said the cuts marked victory in the
battle to defend the franc and would encourage consumption, investment and
economic activity.
The leading state-owned banks, Banque Nationale de Paris and Credit
Lyonnais, yesterday led a 20 basis-point cut in commercial base rates to
9.65 per cent. They were followed by the private sector Societe Generale and
Credit Commercial de France, much earlier than most economic analysts had
expected.
Commercial banks had lost heavily in recent weeks because they kept base
rates unchanged during a period when money market rates climbed steeply, and
were expected to recoup their losses before reducing base lending rates.
'This is obviously a political move,' said Mr Christopher Potts, senior
economist at Banque Indosuez. 'Their arms have been twisted by the treasury.
There is a very strong message here - that the government is worried about
the economy,' he said.
The move could help quell fears among some French businessmen and in some
parts of the right-wing opposition that the Socialist government's hard
franc policy was choking economic growth. Economic analysts believe the
French central bank could drop rates further by the end of the year if the
Bundesbank cuts its own rates.
At present French three-month money market rates are 57 basis points above
those in Germany. Paris is hesitant to push its rates unilaterally below
Germany's because the last time it did so, in October 1991, the resulting
pressure on the franc was so heavy the French government was forced to raise
interest rates a month later.
Barclays Bank yesterday launched an investment income paying cheque account
for French clients, to replace the interest paying cheque account banned by
the government last month. Interest paying cheque accounts are forbidden
under French law, to protect the tradition of not charging clients for
processing cheques and to hold down banks' cost of funds. The new account
automatically places a proportion of the balance in an investment fund,
units in which can only be sold on clients' written consent.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You have frequently reported on rising distrust of the Eurocrats in
Brussels among the citizens of EC countries.
The Swedish government might have a valuable contribution to make in the
efforts to improve the communication between the EC citizens and the EC
governing bodies.
In Sweden all government acts are made public unless specifically stamped
'secret'. And the label 'secret' may only be applied to specific sections of
a document, containing information regarding commercial secrets, defence
secrets and matters concerning personal integrity of individuals.
This, among other things, means that the Swedish public and Swedish
journalists can walk into any government agency and demand to see today's
mail or to look at any specific act kept in the agency.
This principle of public acts might seem shocking to many politicians and
bureaucrats who are used to the opposite principle  - that all public acts
are kept secret unless specifically made public. But I would point out that
the system has worked well for 200 years and has greatly contributed to
making Swedish government virtually free of corruption.

Bundesbank president Helmut Schlesinger, horrified at the notion that he
could ever have been trying to sabotage the pound, was yesterday
successfully pouring oil on troubled waters as he played host in Frankfurt
to visiting members of the House of Commons all-party Treasury select
committee.
However, what he is most unlikely to have explained is the existence of a
plain old mistake on the part of one of his aides in drafting the now
infamous memo, released to the press at the end of September, and which so
provoked the Treasury.
In the early version of Schlesinger's interview, given to the German daily
Handelsblatt and published on (Black) Wednesday September 16, the German
central banker specifically puts in a kindly word for sterling.
Sadly, as the author of the memo now shame-facedly admits, he himself had
quite overlooked this, and had cited instead the lengthy version of the
interview which appeared the following day, and which the Treasury
apoplectically then denounced as largely irrelevant on the grounds that the
damage to sterling had already been done.

Alexandra, aka Heidi, Sprungli is back. The new 44-year-old wife of the
72-year-old Swiss chocolate king Rudolph Sprungli was on Swiss television
last weekend to deny some of the more colourful allegations about her past.
The August marriage inspired the Swiss media subsequently to publish a
flurry of photographs and testimonials suggesting that the career of the new
Mrs Sprungli had ranged rather more broadly than merely waitressing,
inheriting a large sum of money after marrying an older man who died within
18 months of their wedding, and being a member of the obscure religious
sect, I AM.
Little had been heard from the happy couple themselves post the nuptials,
but now the chocolate pot has taken another stir. Looking like a sergeant in
the Salvation Army with virtually no make-up and her dark hair pulled
tightly back in a bun, Alexandra/Heidi nearly denied the allegations: 'If
you took all the things said about me and added them all up, only about 5
per cent is true.' The incriminating photographs of her in bra and suspender
belt were montages, she said, with her head on someone else's body.
Shareholders of Lindt &amp; Sprungli, who may have worried about reports that
the new Mrs Sprungli would take over management of the company can rest
reassured. 'My second wife will certainly not become president of the
company,' said her perfectly attentive new husband.

So how do these canny US hedge funds, which have been increasingly
recognised as a powerful force in the world's financial markets, devise
their trading strategies?
Well, from the current US edition of Penthouse for starters. One fund has
seized on the magazine's interview with Gennifer Flowers, the one-time
cabaret singer who has been alleging that she had a 12-year affair with US
presidential candidate Bill Clinton.
The funds' traders wanted to know what view they should take of the US bond
market in the event of a Clinton win. So they sent off to a professional
psychoanalyst the 16-page article, during the course of which Flowers goes
into fulsome detail about her alleged relationship.
It was returned with the seminal conclusion that the Democratic candidate
likes to be pushed around. And what does that mean for financial markets? A
sell for bonds and good news for the stock market, of course.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Observer: Economists' hall of fame
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
How should the Treasury go about picking the members of its new economic
panel to improve economic forecasting? The FT has just helpfully drawn up a
fame-ranking of economists in the UK which might help the Great George
Street mandarins. It is based on the number of articles in heavier, as
distinct from tabloid, newspapers, in which a particular dismal scientist is
mentioned. Each name is counted only once per article.
By that yardstick, Britain's best known economist over the 12 months to
mid-October is Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs, with 161 mentions.
The top 10 also includes Tim Congdon, Patrick Minford, Bill Martin and Peter
Warburton  - all members of the 'Liverpool Six' group who've long said the
Treasury was over-optimistic about predicting recovery  - plus another
vehement opponent of government policies in Neil Mackinnon of Citibank.
Three of the four remaining top-tenners are Roger Bootle of Greenwell
Montagu, Gerard Lyons of DKB and Peter Spencer of Kleinwort Benson. The
other is Adam Smith who's unlikely to be asked to join the panel committee
on account of having been dead for 202 years.
Fame, however, is not apparently a reliable gauge of quality. For, in
several cases, very few mentions were scored by people highly placed in last
week's FT ranking of economists for the accuracy of their projections.
The leader by that criterion, Paul Turnbull of Smith New Court, came only
37th in the fame league. And the third most accurate, Keith Wade of
Schroders, surely deserves better than 46th place in the celebrity list with
only a single mention.
But there is consolation for the Treasury's chief economic adviser Alan
Budd, who has the final say on membership of the panel. Even though his
forecasts have not been the best, he performs creditably in the latest test,
coming in at number 15.

FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Santos bid clears court hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE full bench of Australia's federal court yesterday refused to overturn an
earlier decision not to grant an interim injunction blocking a ADollars 560m
(USDollars 400m) hostile bid by Santos, the Australian energy group, for
Sagasco Holdings.
The ruling followed an application by Sagasco, a rival energy group, and the
Trade Practices Commission, which contended that the takeover would breach
competition regulations. The decision means that Santos can proceed with the
bid, but will still face a full court hearing of the substantive issues
raised by Sagasco and the TPC, probably in March.
The court accepted that Santos would be capable of divesting its proposed
holding in Sagasco if it was found at the substantive hearing to be in
breach of the Corporations Law.
The TPC argued that the acquisition would give Santos an unacceptable
monopoly over gas reserves in most of Australia. The TPC said the market
power which would accrue to Santos would be increased if a parallel bid by
Sagasco for Magellan Petroleum goes ahead.
Sagasco was offered for sale in mid-July when the South Australian state
government put its 57 per cent stake up for tender. Sagasco shares closed
four cents higher at ADollars 2.54 while Santos shares were 1 cent up at
ADollars 2.44.

SUMITOMO Metal Mining, the Japanese gold and copper producer, has reported a
38 per cent fall in first-half pre-tax profits to Y6.37bn (Dollars 52.2m),
from Y10.28bn a year earlier, as orders from Japanese industrial companies
slowed in tandem with the domestic economy.
Sales slipped 4.3 per cent to Y228.5bn, from Y238.68bn, with nickel sales
down 28.9 per cent, and smaller falls of 2.6 and 2.3 per cent for copper and
gold. Electronic equipment material sales slid 15 per cent, while those of
building materials rose 12.3 per cent, reflecting a mild increase in new
housing starts in recent months.
Mitsui Mining and Smelting, a member of the Mitsui group of companies,
blamed weak demand from carmakers and electrical equipment producers for a
64.3 per cent fall in first-half pre-tax profits to Y1.4bn on sales down 30
per cent at Y135.97bn.
Mitsui Mining plans to reduce capital spending this year from a targeted
Y10.5bn to Y9.1bn.
For the full year, Sumitomo Metal Mining is expecting a 27.8 per cent fall
in pre-tax profit to Y12bn on sales 7 per cent lower at Y440bn. Mitsui
Mining forecast a 28 per cent fall in sales to Y262bn and a pre-tax profit
of Y3.2bn, down 41 per cent.

FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Stanbic to acquire African
operations of ANZ Grindlays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD Bank Investment Corporation (Stanbic), South Africa's largest bank
by market capitalisation, will pay R166m (Dollars 37.8m) to acquire the
African operations of ANZ Grindlays Bank.
The deal, which follows protracted negotiations, represents an important
step towards re-establishing Stanbic as an important regional player.
Mr Eddie Theron, managing director, said yesterday that it was part of the
group's policy of controlled international expansion which has recently seen
the bank open a fully-fledged London office, purchase offshore interests in
Jersey and the Isle of Man, and set up in Botswana.
Stanbic will assume equity control of ANZ Grindlays banks in Zimbabwe,
Zambia, Kenya, Botswana, Uganda and Zaire, as well as significant minority
stakes in Nigeria and Ghana. It is acquiring a network of 25 branches and a
staff of about 1,400, all of whom will be kept on.
Stanbic will compete directly in all of these countries, except Zaire, with
Standard Chartered, its former parent company until it disinvested from
South Africa in the late 1980s.
Mr Theron said that, with the acquisition, the wheel had come full circle -
a reference to the fact that in 1910 Standard Bank was the largest bank in
sub-equatorial Africa before political developments forced it to shrink, by
1987, to a purely domestic operation.
The deal has been settled by the issue of 2.47m Stanbic shares to ANZ
Grindlays which has renounced them in favour of an unnamed local
institution. There will not be any impact on the financial rand, the
volatile investment currency for foreigners, as the necessary currency
transactions have already been concluded.
Mr Theron said the purchase price included a goodwill figure of about R3m.
The price represents only about 5 per cent of Stanbic's capital and the deal
will have a modest impact on profits in the short term.

FUKUTOKU Bank, a leading second-tier regional bank based in Osaka, western
Japan, has started implementing a rationalisation plan, Reuter reports from
Tokyo.
'The plan aims to strengthen the financial health of the bank,' it said. 'It
is not only smaller banks but also the big national banks that are hit by
the financial slump.'
Through the rationalisation, including a freeze in hiring professional
staff, Fukutoku plans to cut operating expenditure by 10 per cent or about
Y3bn (Dollars 24.6m) in 1993-94, starting April 1, from a year earlier, the
bank said.
Fukutoku declined to comment on a report in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun
newspaper that the bank's restructuring aims to boost its profits so it can
bail out Shimanouchi Tochi Tatemono, an affiliated non-bank financial
institution based in Osaka, that is suffering from bad property-related
loans.
In 1991-92, Fukutoku posted Y4.68bn in pre-tax profits, down sharply from
Y8.42bn a year earlier.
Under the one-and-a-half-year plan ending March 31 1994, Fukutoku will cut
by eight the number of its offices and freeze opening of new ones. It has
cut executive pay by 10 per cent from October.
Fukutoku has 142 offices in Japan, mainly in the Osaka region which, along
with Tokyo, was hardest hit by the slump in the property market. It also has
a branch office in New York and a representative office in Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S three biggest parcel carriers - TNT, Ansett Transport Industries
and Mayne Nickless - face legal action by the federal Trades Practices
Commission (TPC) for alleged breaches of competition law.
Documents filed by the TPC in the federal court allege that the three
companies operated a cartel to reduce price competition in the ADollars 1bn
(USDollars 700m) a year express freight market, which they jointly dominate.
The commission is seeking financial penalties against the three companies
and 19 named executives and former executives alleged to have participated
in operating the cartel.
There was no comment from TNT or Ansett, which is jointly owned by TNT and
News Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's media group. Mr Ian Webber, chairman
of Mayne Nickless said the group would 'vigorously contest' the allegations.
Mr Webber said Mayne Nickless had not received a copy of the documents filed
in the court. He said the company would make no further comment while the
case remained sub-judice.
The commission alleges that the companies agreed not to compete on prices
and rates; not to offer competitive quotes to each other's customers; and to
compensate each other if customers transferred their business.
Papers filed in the court include details of a number of alleged meetings
between executives from the companies, and case studies of the effect of the
alleged cartel on specific customers.
The performance of Ansett's aviation businesses is expected to improve this
year, Mr David Mortimer, TNT managing director, told analysts in New York.
Mr Mortimer, who recently replaced Sir Peter Abeles, said TNT was
'profoundly aware' that losses by TNT and its affiliated aviation companies
in the past two years had undermined shareholders' confidence.
He said the board was 'in the process of developing clear strategies and
definite plans to bring the TNT group back to solid profitability'.

Mr Peter Spaelti, chief executive, said at a press conference in Winterthur

with 14.2 per cent in 1991.
However, he warned that unstable stock and foreign exchange markets, as well
as large claims arising from natural disasters, could still have a
substantial impact on profits. In 1991, Winterthur had a consolidated net
profit of SFr262.9m (Dollars 190.7m).

<TEXT>
GERMAN Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel yesterday declared relations with China
normalised, ending three years of coolness that followed the bloody
crackdown on the Tiananmen Square democracy movement, AP reports from
Beijing.
Germany, like other western countries, imposed sanctions on China following
the army attack on the demonstrators in Beijing in June 1989. Aid and
ministerial visits were suspended.
The sanctions have largely been dropped, but only last March, German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl told Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Bonn
that a 'visible change in Chinese human rights policies' was necessary for a
full return to normal relations.
Mr Kinkel, holding a news conference as he neared the end of his three-day
visit to Beijing, refused to say why Germany had dropped that condition.
However, he emphasised China's economic dynamism and the size of its
domestic market, as well as Germany's desire to reverse its trade deficit
with China.
Since Mr Kohl's meeting with Qian, China has pushed its market reform
programme into high gear after a hiatus of four years, and promised to
reduce import barriers.
'After this visit has been concluded, we can take it that relations are
normal,' Mr Kinkel said. 'Both sides have the intention to look forward.'
Mr Kinkel said he discussed human rights with Qian and Prime Minister Li
Peng but refused to give any details of what was said. He said quiet
diplomacy was more effective than 'making a lot of noise about what one
does'.
Asked if he discussed political reform in China, he said, 'I don't think I
should be the person to interfere in the internal affairs of this country. I
am not an adviser to the Chinese government.'

FT  03 NOV 92 / Laotian project slashes drugs output: The UN is being urged
to adopt a new multi-agency approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The United Nations is to be asked to change radically its approach towards
the illicit drugs trade, in a renewed campaign to stamp out illegal
cultivation of opium, coca and cannabis around the world.
A pilot project in Laos, in the 'golden triangle' drug-growing region of
south-east Asia, is said to have cut annual opium production by at least 75
per cent in the area involved.
The new approach has been to build roads and foster general economic and
social development over a wide area, rather than just pay grants to
individual farmers to switch to legal cash crops, such as strawberries and
cabbage, in small localities.
The change has required planned, co-ordinated management of UN agencies,
funding bodies and international aid from developed countries, all of which
were poorly co-ordinated before. Mr Giorgio Giacomelli, executive director
of the UN's Vienna-based Drug Control Programme (DCP), will this month seek
General Assembly approval to extend the approach worldwide.
One of the first areas to benefit is likely to be the Bekaa Valley in
Lebanon, where the Syrian army has already eradicated drug production this
year.
UN policies have in the past been heavily weighted towards localised crop
substitution, coupled with tough law enforcement to deter farmers from
reverting to growing drugs. The policy was a fire-fighting one and failed
because many farmers have taken the money to grow new crops in one place
while shifting drug production elsewhere, usually involving other members of
their families or ethnic groups.
In spite of this, growing drugs has rarely raised families much above
subsistence level because cultivation is mostly a cottage industry. The
advantages offered by opium, however, have been high value-to-weight ratios,
easy storage and ready buyers to feed it into the international criminal
drug market. The big profits are made by refiners, distributors and dealers,
not the growers.
Moreover, a slash-and-burn approach to clearing land for growing has been
environmentally damaging, hindering long-term agricultural development.
The Laos pilot project has been operating for five years in the Muong Hom
district of Vientiane province.
The location of all poppy fields is known. The DCP says many growers,
predominantly members of the Lao Soung, an ethnic minority, were encouraged
to grow opium by military factions during various stages of recent
Indochinese wars.
Because of the resultant local dependence on opium growing and the need for
national integration of ethnic minorities in peacetime, the Laotian
government decided against simple eradication of poppy fields and rigid law
enforcement. It asked for help in trying wide-scale economic development
first.
Money has come from the International Fund for Agricultural Development
(IFAD), with a soft loan of Dollars 5.3m ,and Dollars 6m from the DCP. The
Japanese government has given farming equipment worth Dollars 800,000.
Road construction has been labour-based to help create work and develop
skills for more road-building later, while agricultural schemes have
involved livestock development, rural credit schemes, irrigation projects
and setting up advisory and supporting services. There has also been
investment in primary health care, basic education, community and self-help
activities, treatment of drug addictsand training planners.
The DCP's funders - mainly Italy, the US, Japan, Britain, Germany, France,
Sweden and other west European nations - are understood to be relieved about
the new approach. They had been increasingly concerned that the global war
on drugs was being lost partly because of unco-ordinated efforts and
inter-agency rivalry.
Mr Giacomelli says the DCP will co-ordinate and be a pump-primer, but will
not try to do everything itself. Working arrangements are being developed
with the World Bank, the Interamerican Development Bank, IFAD, and other UN
agencies, such as the World Health Organisation, Unesco, the UN Development
Programme and the International Labour Organisation.
Each will be encouraged to develop a 'drug dimension' to all economic
development projects in drug-producing countries of the third world.
Bilateral projects - where an individual western country puts in earmarked
money directly - will enable 'our larger and richer partners to intervene
with a multiplying effect', Mr Giacomelli says.
DCP officials acknowledge that trying to stamp out the problem at source
appears to have been recognised as futile on its own, especially if the
illicit drug trade accounts for 12 per cent of gross domestic product, as is
the case in at least one South American country.
Allied to this will be other worldwide programmes aimed at fighting drug
trafficking, making money laundering more difficult, and building solid
institutions in developing countries for law enforcement and administering
justice. Programmes are also being developed for reducing demand for drugs
in the market-place, so that traffickers will be squeezed from both ends as
well as in the middle.

PRESIDENT Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and Iran's President Hashemi
Rafsanjani yesterday signed oil, transport and finance agreements, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency said, AP reports from Nicosia.
Secular Turkey and fundamentalist Iran, both Moslem states, are locked in
fierce competition to gain political and economic influence in
Moslem-populated former Soviet republics.
The agency, monitored in Cyprus, quoted Mr Rafsanjani as saying speedy
progress in talks between the two countries showed their eagerness to work
together.
The agreements called for creation of a joint commission for co-operation in
the fields of economy, transport and culture. Letters of understanding also
were signed for oil, energy and banking collaboration. No further details
were given.
The Kazakh leader earlier met Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, who stressed that Iran 'supports the idea of the unity of Asian
countries', the agency said.
Mr Nazarbayev had been welcomed by Mr Rafsanjani when he arrived in Tehran
on Saturday from the Ankara summit of five former Soviet republics with
large Moslem populations and close ethnic and linguistic links to Turkey.
Mr Nazarbayev's visit to Tehran immediately after the Ankara meeting was
seen as an indication he did not want to be seen as favouring either Turkey
or Iran as they struggle for influence in the region.
Mr Rafsanjani was quoted as saying yesterday: 'The world should know that
co-operation among Moslem countries is not something for them to worry
about, because Islam is the religion of logic and reasoning and so does not
need to be offensive.'
The Iraq-based Mujahideen Khalq, the main Iranian opposition group, says
Kazakhstan has sold several nuclear warheads to Iran.
Iran and Kazakhstan, the only Central Asian republic known to possess
nuclear weapons, have denied the allegation.
US intelligence reports also have said there has been no evidence of such a
sale.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Turkmenistan gas pipeline deal
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US-Turkish consortium has signed an agreement with the government of
Turkmenistan which officials say paves the way for the group to build a
natural gas pipeline to Europe, a deal worth an estimated Dollars 4bn.
The consortium, led by Emron and Wing Merril of the US, together with the
local Turkish group Gama Guris, signed an accord with President Saparmurad
Niyazov during the summit of Turkic leaders in Ankara at the weekend.
The accord envisages a feasibility study of the six possible routes to
export the gas from the landlocked Central Asian republic. Officials said
Kidder Peabody, the US investment bank, was being approached to organise the
financing.
The deal ends months of anxiety that Turkmenistan would seek to export its
gas via Iran.
The consortium confirmed yesterday that Botas, Turkey's state-owned pipeline
company, would be asked to join. Botas has proposed the pipeline run under
the Caspian sea to Baku in Azerbaijan, and from there through the Caucasus
to Turkey, where it would pick up the existing gas pipeline to Europe.
For hydraulics and technical reasons, engineers at Botas have identified a
route passing along the Araz river on Armenia's southern border with Iran.
The consortium is understood to be in direct negotiations with Armenia,
though Turkey does not have full relations with Yerevan.
Turkmenistan produces about 86bn cubic metres of gas a year, of which 8bn is
consumed domestically. Reserves are estimated at around 13 trillion cu m of
gas in its Sovyetabad field. Botas says Uzbekistan might be able to feed its
own smaller production into the pipeline.
Turkey itself imports 5bn cu m of gas every year, much of it from Russia.
Construction is almost complete for a 2bn cu m capacity gas terminal near
Istanbul to receive Algerian gas. Negotiations are also under way to receive
Qatar and Libyan gas. But much of the Turkmen exports would be destined to
pass through Thrace to European markets.

   VIENTIANE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LAOS, which has been inching towards a market economy since Soviet aid dried
up, expects higher economic growth and lower inflation this year, and hopes
to clinch a new credit from the International Monetary Fund.
Ms Pany Yathotou, State Bank governor, said in an interview with Reuters
that Laos began talks in October with the IMF for an extended structural
adjustment facility for 1993-95.
The negotiations followed the successful review by an IMF mission of Laos'
economic performance under a Dollars 29m structural adjustment facility for
1991-92. 'They were quite satisfied with our performance,' she said.
Ms Yathotou forecast that inflation would fall to 7 per cent this year from
last year's 10 per cent. Gross domestic product is forecast to grow by 6.5
per cent in 1992 and 7 per cent in 1993, compared with 4 per cent in 1991,
according to government statistics.
Mr Khamsouk Sundara, director of the international department of the state
bank, said Laos was seeking about Dollars 60m for the extended facility, but
the IMF was proposing only Dollars 40m.
Laos has total external debt of Dollars 1.13bn, the state bank said. Of that
amount, Dollars 770m is owed to bilateral lenders, and the rest to
international agencies. The leading multilateral lender is the World Bank,
with Dollars 175m, followed by the Asian Development Bank with Dollars 147m
and the IMF with Dollars 28.5m.
Of the Dollars 770m owed bilaterally, only Dollars 28.6m is in hard
currency, and the remainder represents the value of goods such as oil,
machinery and equipment Laos imported from the former Soviet Union.
Officials said Laos' fragile economy, hobbled by drought and floods
recently, will post stronger growth this year and next but will need
continued foreign assistance to keep up the momentum.
'The government will continue with its open door policy to attract foreign
investors in order to attain higher growth,' Khamphoui Keoboualapha, deputy
prime minister and minister of finance, told foreign reporters.

A German border police spokesman said it was business as usual, since
deportations have taken place even before the pact took effect on Sunday.
It requires Romania to take back citizens who have incomplete identity

FT  03 NOV 92 / Political crisis stalls Bulgarian debt talks
</HEADLINE>

   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BULGARIA'S negotiations for a new three-year extended loan agreement with
the International Monetary fund have been put on hold, after the collapse
last week of the government led by Mr Filip Dimitrov.
The political crisis has also led to postponement of planned debt
re-negotiation talks with commercial bank creditors, who hold the bulk of
Bulgaria's Dollars 12bn gross foreign debt.
The government resigned last Wednesday night after the ruling Union of
Democratic Forces (UDF) coalition had failed to win a confidence vote in
parliament against the opposition of former communists and the party
representing the ethnic Turkish minority.
Mr Anoup Singh, head of an IMF mission to Bulgaria, was quoted in Sofia as
having said he hoped the talks on a three-year agreement would continue with
the new government.
But it could be several weeks before a new government can be formed.
The current stand-by arrangement with the IMF is to expire in March 1993. Mr
Singh said in September that he hoped a new three-year programme could be
established before the expiry.
Mr Ivan Kostov, finance minister in the outgoing government, said
negotiations with the advisory committee representing Bulgaria's commercial
bank creditors, which were due to start on November 4, had been postponed.
He declined to specify a date for the resumption of talks.
A spokesman for Deutsche Bank, which heads the committee representing the
commercial banks, said it would be up to Bulgaria to solve its governmental
problems - 'then we will begin to talk again'.
The head of an IMF mission to Poland said yesterday that he hoped to seal a
new deal on co-operation with Warsaw in the next 10 days. 'I expect my visit
to last about 10 days. I hope that, in that time, it will be possible to
conclude an agreement between Poland and the IMF,' said Mr Michael Deppler,
deputy director of the IMF's european department.

HAFSLUND NYCOMED, the Norwegian group which makes radiology products,
yesterday reported a 25 per cent increase in nine-month pre-tax profit to
NKr1.12bn (Dollars 195m).
Group operating revenue rose by NKr271m to NKr4.25bn, as operating profit -
before research and development expenses - increased by NKr181m to
NKr1.72bn.
Research and development expenses fell to NKr119m from NKr155m in the third
quarter, but Hafslund warned that for the fourth quarter they were likely to
be significantly higher.
Hafslund reported a fall in financial expenses to NKr138m for the nine
months from NKr257m a year ago as net interest expenses declined to NKr75m
from NKr179m.
However, the group was forced to write down the value of its bond portfolio
by NKr36m because of a third-quarter interest rate increase.

cocoa talks
</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COCOA PRODUCING and consuming countries yesterday began a third round of
talks to thrash out a new price-stabilisation commodity agreement, with both
sides still maintaining the same divergent positions on the main issues as
in July when the previous talks ended.
The two-week session, held here under the auspices of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development, will centre on the price to be defended
by the new agreement, the consumers' plan for withholding production from
the market, and how the agreement is to be financed.
The existing 1986 cocoa accord, which expires in September 1993, has failed
to prevent mounting stockpiles and a disastrous collapse of prices as
production has grown far more rapidly than consumption over the past 20
years. Buffer stock operations, intended to stabilise prices, were suspended
in 1988 after cocoa purchases reached the maximum allowed by the agreement.
Stockpiles currently stand at over 1.4m tonnes and prices are at their
lowest levels in real (inflation-adjusted) terms ever recorded.
Producers want the new accord to defend a price range with a mid-price of
SDR1,820 (Pounds 1,620 at the present conversion rate) a tonne, more than
double current market levels. Consumers are insisting on a mid-price of
SDR1,000 a tonne.
Producers have proposed 600,000 tonnes as the maximum that can be withheld
from the market under the new accord, twice the amount envisaged by
consumers, and want the accord financed equally by producers and consumers.
Consumers say money should first be raised by repayment of arrears and
controlled sales from the existing 240,000 tonne buffer stock.
However, there is consensus on the need to reduce cocoa output. Meeting in
Kuala Lumpur last month, the Cocoa Producers' Alliance agreed to set up a
production committee to co-ordinate measures by its 13 member countries,
which account for 85 per cent of world cocoa production.
Mr Alain Gauze, commodities minister for the Ivory Coast, the biggest
producer, said yesterday that his country's production would be cut by 15-20
per cent as a result of the new output policy instituted by the government.

FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: MAN's pace begins to slow down -
The German truck maker after the unification boom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, the German commercial vehicle maker, increased its
pre-tax profits by 29.7 per cent in the 12 months to the end of June, the
group's best financial performance.
The record profits of the past two years have been fuelled by the very high
level of domestic sales of trucks and buses generated mainly by German
unification. But the company warned that truck demand in Germany has begun
to weaken since the beginning of this year and MAN is now being forced to
cut output in line with falling sales.
It has reduced truck production by about 12 per cent. It plans to halt
output for one week this month and again in January. It is also cutting
overtime and not replacing temporary workers or those lost through natural
wastage.
Both profits and turnover are forecast to fall in the year. MAN has warned
that further short-time working could be imposed in coming months if orders
remain at a low level.
While the outlook for the coming year is deteriorating, MAN's record
financial performance in the 12 months to June contrasts starkly with the
losses being suffered by other European truck makers, such as DAF and Volvo.
In the period, MAN increased pre-tax profits by 29.7 per cent to DM506m
(Dollars 328m), while turnover rose 6.9 per cent to a record DM7.9bn. Sales
outside Germany were static at DM3.2bn, but domestic turnover jumped by 13
per cent to DM4.7bn.
MAN raised its production of trucks and buses by 8.4 per cent to a record
41,590, with its plants in Germany and Austria working at full capacity.
MAN truck and bus sales worldwide rose by 7 per cent to 40,815 in 1991-92
from 38,146. The increase was achieved despite a fall in the total west
European market for trucks to 277,000 in calendar 1991, from 287,000 a year
earlier.
MAN raised its west European truck market share to 12.4 per cent last year
from 10 per cent a year earlier, thanks to its strong presence in Germany.
Excluding Germany, the west European truck market fell by 22 per cent to
170,000 last year from 216,000 in 1990.
But falling new orders from the domestic German market, combined with
stagnant or declining demand from export markets, led to a 20.3 per cent
fall in the value of new orders booked by MAN in the 12 months to the end of
June. Orders totalled DM7.2bn. The value of new domestic orders fell by 28.1
per cent to DM4.1bn, while foreign orders fell by 6.5 per cent to DM3.1bn.
At the end of June, the group's order book had fallen by 22.7 per cent to
DM3.49bn from levels of a year earlier.
In the quarter to September this financial year, the value of new orders has
fallen again - by 27.8 per cent to DM1.3bn, compared to DM1.8bn in the same
period a year ago.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELEVISION South West, the west of England ITV company, is in talks with a
private West Country shoe manufacturer over the possibility of a reverse
takeover.
It is believed the company is the Bristol-based UK Safety Group, a medium
sized company with turnover of Pounds 33.4m in 1991. Its subsidiaries
include TUF, Safeco and GB Britton.
Asked about talks with TSW, which failed to win a new broadcasting licence
in last year's competitive tenders, Mr Colin Dunmore, chairman and chief
executive of UK Safety, said: 'I can't comment on that.'
He confirmed, however, that UK Safety was interested in obtaining a Stock
Exchange listing. He referred callers to 'Rothschilds.'
NM Rothschild, the merchant banker, is adviser to TSW.
If the plan goes ahead TSW would take over the shoe company which would then
get a listing. At a later stage the name would be changed. TSW has decided
that the reverse takeover route would be the way of realising maximum value
for its mainly institutional shareholders.
Because of TSW's size and location the company decided there was no way of
continuing as a broadcaster.
Indeed it has decided to donate its film and video archives to a new
charitable organisation to be set up in Plymouth. The archive would amount
to a video history of the West Country.
Another option for TSW would be liquidating its assets at the end of the
year when Westcountry Television takes over as the ITV broadcaster.
Sir Brian Bailey, TSW chairman, also declined to comment on the possibility
of a reverse takeover.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Rank Organisation is to sell London's Gloucester Hotel to a Singapore
property group for Pounds 67.5m in cash.
City Developments (UK), a subsidiary of the Singapore-based Hong Leong
group, said the 'rare opportunity' to buy the Gloucester was due to the
'prevailing weakness of sterling combined with declining UK interest rates'.
City Developments (CDL), listed in Singapore and Hong Kong, said the
purchase would be funded by internal resources and bank loans. The sale is
due to be completed before February next year.
Rank, whose interests include cinemas, film distribution and bingo, said
last April it was putting 22 hotels on the market, including five in London.
It is retaining more than 30 hotels linked to its Butlin's holiday camp
business and its Shearings coach holiday operation.
The sale of the 548-room Gloucester brings the number of hotels sold to
four. Rank built the Gloucester, which opened in 1973. The group announced
the sale of the Athenaeum in London and two Scottish hotels earlier this
year. The remaining London hotels up for sale are the Royal Garden, the
Royal Lancaster and the White House.
Mr Angus Crichton-Miller, managing director of Rank's hotels and holidays
division, said he could not say how long it would take to sell the remaining
hotels.
Rank had always thought each London hotel would attract a different buyer.
He expected other foreign buyers to be attracted by the prospect of
borrowing sterling cheaply in the UK or taking advantage of the weaker pound
to buy hotels using their own cash resources.
Mr Crichton-Miller said even with low UK interest rates, Rank would earn
more by banking the money from the sale of the Gloucester than from running
the hotel.
He said room occupancies in Rank's London hotels were above 80 per cent.
Although the provincial hotels had a difficult summer, business had picked
up in the past eight weeks. Room rates were, however, under pressure. Rank
has been allowing US and Australian visitors to convert the sterling room
price at a rate of one pound for one US or Australian dollar.

FT  03 NOV 92 / Counting on the only sure poll winner: There's money in
supplying voting equipment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is one safe bet in the US presidential election today, but his name
appears on no ballot paper. Mr PE 'Bill' Esping will be a winner, no matter
who wins the White House.
This Dallas businessman is chairman of Business Records Corporation
Holdings, the largest supplier of voting equipment and services in the US.
Others may be complaining about the weakness of the US economy but, for Mr
Esping, 1992 is a boom year.
'If anybody makes money out of this election, I will,' he says, while
acknowledging that the election business is 'very cyclical'.
About half of the millions of US citizens who go to the polls today will
cast their votes via equipment supplied by Business Records, Mr Esping
estimates. Only about 7 per cent of US voters still put a cross by the name
of their chosen candidate in the traditional way, according to the Federal
Elections Commission in Washington. The vast majority uses some form of
automated voting system.
This explains how votes are counted so rapidly. 'In the US we have been
driven to automation by the huge numbers of voters. There is no way that we
could count them all by hand,' says an FEC official. 'And, unlike other
countries, we announce results without delay or ceremony.'
Counting votes is a new venture for Mr Esping. In 1970 he founded First Data
Resources which grew to become the largest US processor of credit card
accounts before being acquired, in 1985, by American Express. Three years
later he invested Dollars 10m in Business Records, then called Cronus
Industries, when it was close to bankruptcy. This year, he says, the company
will record revenues of about Dollars 85m, its highest.
Yet the voting equipment used in some parts of the US is far from high-tech.
About one third of US voters, most of them in the south and mid-west, still
cast their votes on antiquated machines that date back to the 1950s, pulling
levers to register their choice. Speedometer-style dials keep running totals
of votes throughout polling day. But, if one of these machines breaks down
 -as several did at Durham, North Carolina, two years ago  - there is no way
to determine how many votes have been lost or miscounted.
If the voter turn-out today is unusually high, as has been predicted, there
may well be problems in regions that still use ageing systems. To replace
these mechanical monsters is bread and butter business to Business Records.
In San Mateo County, California, for example, today voters will vote
electronically for the first time, using optical scan equipment from the
Dallas company. Like close to 20 per cent of voters throughout the US, San
Mateo's electorate will receive ballots that look like multiple-choice exam
papers, with the instruction to pencil in the dot next to the candidates of
their choice.
Voters simply feed their completed ballots into an optical scan reader - one
per polling station  - to record their votes. The ballot papers provide an
audit trail in case of any hitches.
Votes are tallied throughout the day and recorded on a computer tape. When
the polls close the tapes are transported to a central computer facility
where they are totalled. San Mateo is, however, the last Californian county
to convert to computerised voting methods. Elsewhere in the state, and in
many other parts of the US, the most commonly used voting method is the
Votomatic computer punch card.
This was invented in 1962 by a political science professor at the University
of California at Berkeley. The Votomatic records votes by punching holes in
a computer card. The cards are then transported from polling stations to a
computer card reader for counting.
In the 1960s, punch cards were the standard method to record computer data.
They have long since been replaced by magnetic media and now few companies
can service the equipment or supply the computer cards. One of them, though,
is Business Records, which acquired the original Californian manufacturer of
the Votomatic machine.
Only about 3 per cent of US voters now use 'direct recording' computerised
voting systems, in which they press buttons to record votes electronically.
Fears that computer programmes might be rigged or that the computers might
malfunction have limited their use, despite manufacturers' claims that it is
easier to bribe an electoral official than to tamper with a computer.
The state of New Mexico, however, is experimenting with a 'vote by phone'
system, devised by Octel Communications, a Californian voice mail systems
manufacturer. Rather than travel to polling stations, voters can record
their votes by phone. Some see this as the future direction of voting
technology in the US.
Mr Esping maintains, however, that Business Records' optical scanning
systems represent the predominant trend in such technology for the next 10
years. There's another way he will be saying it's not 'time for a change'  -
Mr Esping's vote will go to President George Bush.

THE ANGOLAN government strengthened its hold on the capital Luanda yesterday
after further fighting in which a number of senior officials of the former
rebel Unita movement were feared dead or wounded.
The death toll from four days of fighting in the capital and five large
southern provincial cities rose to more than 1,000 yesterday, according to
Angolan state radio. Reports from Luanda said fighting, shelling and mortar
attacks continued in the city yesterday in contravention of a United
Nations-brokered ceasefire agreement.
A UN official said the accord 'does seem to have had a favourable effect. .
. hostilities are reduced to small pockets.'
Government forces appeared to have gained the upper hand by yesterday
afternoon, after soldiers and police had mopped up areas of violent
resistance from Unita forces. The fighting broke out a month after
multi-party elections in which Unita was defeated.
Diplomats in Luanda said the government renewed its offensive against Unita
positions in the capital early yesterday morning in the suburbs of Miramar
and Sao Paulo and had pounded the downtown Turismo and Tropico hotels, where
Unita officials were staying. Vigilantes, armed by the government, were
reported to have conducted manhunts for Unita supporters.
In Washington Mr Jardo Muekalia, a senior Unita official, accused the
government of going on 'an all-out offensive to cleanse Unita from the
cities'. He could not confirm the reported deaths of Mr Jeremias Chitunda,
vice president of Unita, and Mr Elias Salupeto Pena, a senior military
official, nor the reported wounding and capture of Mr Abel Chivukuvuku,
Unita's foreign affairs spokesman.
Mr Muekalia, who earlier spoke with the headquarters of Mr Jonas Savimbi,
Unita's leader, said the situation was extremely serious but was not beyond
a last-minute resolution aided by the international community. 'This could
be the beginning of the civil war or the end of the civil war,' he said. 'It
depends on how the international community acts now.'
Ambassadors of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council
convened a hasty meeting to discuss the crisis.

NWA, parent of Northwest Airlines, is seeking to raise Dollars 700m to
Dollars 900m in debt through bond financing and sale of assets, a source
familiar with the plans said, Reuter reports from Chicago.
The bulk of the funds, roughly Dollars 600m to Dollars 700m, would flow from
the sale of 27 wide-body jets to investors that would be leased back, the
source said. The aircraft are collateral for bank loans, and lenders would
have to agree to the sale.
A further Dollars 200m would come from bond financing.
The company's plans call for selling the jets to a special subsidiary that
would raise cash backed by debt secured by the aircraft.
The 27 aircraft tagged for sale have a market value of about Dollars 1bn.

The delayed flotation of 3i, Britain's largest venture capital group, is not
now expected to take place until the second half of 1993 at the earliest,
according to sources close to the company.
3i said yesterday: 'When we announced a further postponement of the

of the year. Since then we have not seen adequate signs of economic recovery
and we have decided to defer to 1993 any decision as to a possible date. We

3i had originally planned a flotation, then expected to have a market
capitalisation of up to Pounds 1.2bn, in early 1992.

FT  03 NOV 92 / The Week In Luxembourg: Discriminatory UK patent licence
rules overturned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court last week overturned UK rules on the granting of patent
lic-ences because they were discriminatory.
The case, which had been referred to Luxembourg by the English Court of
Appeal, concerned the granting of licences of right. UK rules distinguished
between the owner of a patent manufacturing the patented product in the UK
and manufacturing it elsewhere in the European Community.
Where the product was manufactured in the UK a licensee would be denied the
right to import the patented product from a third country. But where it was
manufactured elsewhere in the Community the licensee would be allowed to
import it.
The Court ruled that, although the restrictions applied to third-country
imports and were thus not per se covered by EC rules on free movement of
goods, the criteria by which the restrictions were applied affected trade
between EC states and therefore fell foul of EC rules.
The UK rules were discriminatory because they encouraged patent owners to
manufacture patented products in the UK rather than import them from other
EC countries.
The court also ruled on the validity of certain rules relating to the
accession to the Community of Spain and Portugal which restricted parallel
imports from those countries until 1995.
The Court said that national authorities in the other 10 member states were
entitled to restrict patent licensees from importing patented products from
Spain and Portugal as long as the EC derogating provisions were observed.
C-191/90 Generics (UK) Ltd and Harris Pharmaceuticals Ltd v Smith Kline and
French Laboratories Ltd, ECJ FC, October 27 1992.
Strict interpretation of milk quota rules
The European Court upheld a decision of the Irish authorities in refusing to
grant an Irish dairy farmer a milk quota on the basis that he was not
producing milk during the period when the quotas were set.
Under Community milk quota rules only those farmers producing milk during a
particular year were allocated quotas. The EC countries were allowed to
choose any year between 1981 and 1983 as a reference period. Ireland chose
1983.
The rules allow EC states to take into account exceptional circumstances,
but only to the extent that the producer could choose another year between
1981 and 1983.
The Irish farmer had been unable to work, through ill health, between 1980
and 1984 and therefore fell outside any of the available reference periods.
The court said the principle of legitimate expectation had not been
infringed. Reference periods had to be limited if the milk quota system were
to work.
C-85/90 William Dowling v Ireland, the Attorney General and the Minister for
Food and Agriculture, ECJ 3CH, October 22 1992.
German VAT rules for travel agents illegal
German rules on VAT exemptions for travel agents were held to be invalid by
the European Court because they went beyond measures set out in EC
legislation.
The German rules allowed no VAT to be charged on trips organised by German
travel agents but carried out by non-German tour operators when the trips
were either outside the Community or they involved air or sea transport
which was international or outside German tax territory.
Under Community VAT rules such third-party exemptions were only allowed if
the work was carried out outside the EC. The exemptions for air and sea
transport partly or wholly within the EC were therefore incompatible with EC
legislation.
C-74/91 Commission v Germany, ECJ FC, October 27 1992.
Community powers in agricultural aid schemes upheld
The Court upheld the Community's powers to impose a surcharge or exclude
farmers completely from certain agricultural aid schemes if they were found
to be guilty of irregularities when applying for aid.
Under EC rules, national authorities were obliged to exclude farmers for one
year from the relevant aid schemes and the Commission was entitled to levy a
surcharge.
The German government claimed the Community was not entitled to exclude
farmers from aid schemes and that only the Council of Ministers was entitled
to impose surcharges.
The Court said the exclusion powers fell within the aims of the Common
Agricultural Policy, the Community had the right to determine such measures
and they were justified because they discouraged irregularities in aid
applications. The Court also said the Council was entitled to delegate the
power to impose surcharges to the Commission.
C-240/90 Germany v Commission, ECJ FC, October 27 1992.
Wide interpretation given to EC definition of medicine
In a case involving South American herbal teas imported and sold in Holland
for their therapeutic qualities, the Court ruled that, even though such
products were not generally considered as medicines and their therapeutic
effect had not been proved scientifically, they were still medicines under
EC legislation and thus had to be registered with the public authorities.
C-219/91 Johannes Stephanus Wilhelmus ter Voort, ECJ 5CH, October 28 1992.
Stolen goods not susceptible to import levies
A consignment of sugar to be sold outside the EC which was stolen before it
could be exported from Belgium was not subject to import levies by Belgian
customs on the ground that it was technically of non-Community origin,
because no importation had actually taken place.

FT  03 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Uni Storebrand to
recapitalise after NKr1.36bn loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNI STOREBRAND, Norway's biggest insurance group which was taken over by
public administrators in August, yesterday disclosed losses of NKr1.36bn
(Dollars 216m) for the first eight months of this year and announced plans
for a recapitalisation.
The loss was reported by Uni Storebrand New, established after the collapse
of the old Uni holding company. Uni blamed the loss on a NKr2.8bn write-down
of its NKr4.7bn stake in Skandia Forsakring. Uni acquired the Skandia
shareholding last year, in the process running up borrowings of NKr4.5bn
which led to it being ruled technically insolvent.
Uni Storebrand New charged NKr1.45bn of the total Skandia write-down against
eight-month accounts. Mr Erik Keiserud, the chairman of Uni's
state-appointed administration board, said plans for the recapitalisation of
the group called for NKr3.4bn of fresh equity.
The plan is based on a valuation of the group estimated at between NKr700m
and NKr1.65bn by Credit Suisse First Boston and Oslo-based Elcon Securities.
The valuation is linked to the group remaining intact.
Mr Keiserud said the plan, discussed yesterday with UNI's creditors, called
for about 70 per cent of group debt, or an estimated NKr2.4bn, to be
converted into equity or some other form of core capital.
To meet capital adequacy requirements, Uni needs about NKr2.9bn but the
administration board is seeking to raise NKr500m as a safety buffer which
would give a capital ratio in excess of 5 per cent by the end of the year.
Uni's recapitalisation plan also calls for NKr1bn to be raised through a
share offering and for the remainder of the debt to be restructured with new
maturity and interest rates.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS ministerial-level farm trade reform talks between the US and the European
Community were starting in Chicago last night, the EC reiterated that any
deal would have to protect the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP), agreed in May.
The meeting - of Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, and Mr Ed
Madigan, his US counterpart - is seen on both sides as the last chance to
avert a trade war, and to salvage hopes for wide-ranging trade
liberalisation under the Uruguay Round, which has been stalled for two years
by the row over the EC's subsidised food export regime.
Top EC negotiators believe agreement can be reached with the US, but are
voicing no public optimism because Washington has left this meeting until
hours before Americans vote in presidential and Congressionalelections
tomorrow.
US trade officials also say there was little optimism that the new talks
would provide a breakthrough.
The EC's absolute and final determination to stay within the framework of
CAP reform has been clear to the US since early last Tuesday morning,
officials say.
After two weeks of intensive diplomacy, compromise agreements appear to have
been forged in all areas except that of trade in oilseeds.
A White House meeting last week agreed to announce sanctions against the EC
on oilseeds on Wednesday, if a settlement has not been reached by then. US
farmers have been complaining for five years that the EC's oilseed subsidy
regime has harmed them. Two dispute panels of the Geneva-based General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) have endorsed their claims.
A Gatt council meeting, planned for Wednesday, could be used to win
multilateral sanction for the US to impose punitive tariffs on EC farm
exports. France - Europe's main farm exporter - is said to be the main
target of the tariffs.
Senior officials in Brussels fear that Washington delayed the Chicago
meeting in the hope this would boost President George Bush's chances of
re-election.
Another fear is of an eve-of-poll ambush, in which the Community might be
blamed for having blocked the benefits to the world economy of a deal
through the Uruguay Round.
EC officials say the new CAP's cuts in subsidised farm prices and
production, passed into Community law at the beginning of July, can deliver
all but the tiniest wrinkles on a global Gatt agreement.
They are adamant about the need to stay within the framework of the reform,
arguing that, if they put one foot outside the CAP, they would be unable to
prevent opponents - principally in France - from unravelling the entire
package.
Mr MacSharry has so far built majorities inside the European Commission and
the member states to beat back France's attempts to scuttle a Gatt deal.
Yet, if no agreement is reached, a rapidly expanding trade war and
litigation through the Gatt could undo the new CAP anyway.
In addition to levying punitive tariffs on EC exports, the US would
certainly try to build on its two successive Gatt judgments against the EC's
oilseeds regime.
Further challenges to the EC farm regime would come from Australia, New
Zealand and Argentina, already preparing cases against the EC's subsidised
wheat and beef exports to put to Gatt adjudication.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Old boys' network still obstructs working women, survey
finds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OLD boys' network remains firmly entrenched as the single biggest
obstacle to female advancement in the workplace, according to the most
comprehensive UK survey of management attitudes to women.
Women rated the existence of 'men's clubs' at work - which men operate
behind the scenes to help each other gain the best jobs - as a greater
barrier to career development than no childcare provision or inflexible
working hours.
Forty-three per cent of women said they experienced the effects of male
networks, compared with just 9 per cent who had suffered because of lack of
childcare.
Researchers, who questioned nearly 1,500 women managers and 800 male
colleagues, said they uncovered 'widespread prejudice among male managers
against their women colleagues'.
They also found that the women who had battled against prejudice 'appear to
have done so at considerable personal cost'.
One third of the female managers were unmarried and only half had children.
This contrasted with 92 per cent of male managers who were married and 86
per cent who had children.
Many men surveyed had strong views on the role of female managers. One
commented: 'With massive unemployment we don't need to encourage women into
the workplace when they already have a role as a mother.'
Another said: 'In general women do not make good managers - although they
have much to offer in the workplace.'
A third said: 'Successful management requires commitment with no outside
worries. For women to succeed they must therefore be single or have adult
children.'
The survey was conducted by the British Institute of Management, which was
relaunched yesterday as the Institute of Management. This follows
amalgamation with the Institution of Industrial Managers. BhS, the retail
chain, which has an 85 per cent female workforce and mainly female
customers, sponsored the research.
Separate research by the institute has indicated that only about 3 per cent
of senior managers are female and about 9 per cent of managers overall are
women. The latest report says: 'The economic arguments for increasing those
proportions should not need rehearsing. Women now make up almost half of the
workforce and will account for 90 per cent of labour force growth over the
next 10 years.'
Mr Roger Young, IoM director-general, said: 'Men are the prime barrier to
women in management. Despite some progress, old-fashioned sexist attitudes
are still common and represent a real, not imagined barrier to the progress
of women.'

FT  02 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: European equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment strategies based on convergence of European bond yields have been
a well-trodden path for the past five years. But equity markets have been
staging a quiet convergence of their own. As the chart shows, European
equities have been moving in closer step since 1986. As with bond markets,
though, the question must now be whether closer correlation can survive the
threat of recession and strains within the exchange rate mechanism.
For stock markets whose currencies are out of the ERM, greater unison seems
a distant prospect. The FT-SE has outperformed the German market by 15 per
cent since sterling started floating freely again. Even within the core of
European countries still linked to the D-Mark, though, recession is likely
to result in a wider divergence in equity performance. For one thing,
governments will be seeking greater flexibility in fiscal policy. With the
future of the treaty already in doubt, the Maastricht criteria on government
borrowing will hardly be at the front of finance ministers' minds. That
said, so long as interest rates in the core ERM countries are effectively
set by the Bundesbank, bond yields should remain close to those of Germany.
To the extent that bond yields influence equity yields, equity markets will
find it hard to plough their own furrow for long.
If the core European equity markets do continue to march in step, investors
merely need to keep an eye on those getting ahead or falling behind. A
simple extension of convergence argument is that equity investors should
behave more like bond market investors - trading on the basis of the
relative valuations just as bond investors trade yield differentials.
Traditional research-led investors will doubtless see this as a heresy. But
if the differences between countries and currencies have become less
important they can always spend more time looking at the differences between
stock market sectors and specific stocks.

FT  02 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Polling stations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the outcome of the US presidential election so uncertain, many
investors have withdrawn to the sidelines. But some trends seem clear,
whoever wins tomorrow. The German and Japanese economies continue to slow,
so lower interest rates in the two other large economies are only a matter
of time. That should help bolster the dollar, even if the Federal Reserve
decides to cut interest rates another notch. Oddly enough, with Bill Clinton
seen as the candidate more likely to produce growth, and ultimately higher
short-term interest rates, the dollar may rally more strongly on a
Democratic victory than a Republican one.
Bond market reactions are likely to diverge more sharply. In recent weeks
long yields have moved up from 7 per cent to more than 7.6 per cent in
anticipation of the spending plans of a victorious President Clinton proving
more concrete than his revenue-raising measures. On current projections, Mr
Clinton's strategy might increase the budget deficit from about Dollars
300bn to Dollars 360bn: as a result, long bond yields could rise by a
further 0.5 to 0.75 per cent. However, it is always possible that the extra
spending could boost growth, and thus government revenues, more than
expected. If the market took that view, bond yields might stay under 8 per
cent. Should the unexpected happen and President Bush get back, long rates
might edge back towards 7 per cent.
As with the dollar, US equities may rally on either outcome if for no other
reason than prospects are poor elsewhere. International funds may be
attracted by relatively high economic growth of 2 to 3 per cent in 1993. But
the performance of stock market sectors is likely to vary. Pharmaceutical
profits are a well-known Clinton target and prices may already have
over-reacted. But capital goods and construction companies would benefit
from increased infrastructure spending and capital goods tax allowances.
Cyclical stocks would stand to gain from higher growth. It seems clear that
with consumers still heavily indebted, capital investment will have to
provide a large part of any initial US recovery. A Bush victory would be
less likely to produce that.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Angolan forces accept UN ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGOLAN government forces and troops of the rebel Unita movement accepted a
ceasefire agreement late last night, raising hopes that the country would
halt its slide into renewed civil war.
The ceasefire, due to come into effect at midnight, was arranged by the
United Nations between President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Mr Jonas
Savimbi, leader of Unita which disputes the results of elections in
September.
A statement from the office of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general, said the truce would cover the entire country and
provided for the release of foreigners by the combatants.
The agreement followed three days of fighting in the capital Luanda, where
government forces appeared yesterday to be gaining the upper hand, and
across the country.
The battles were the most bloody since the elections. They threatened the
UN-led efforts to bring Angola through a 17-month transition to peace and
democracy which started when a ceasefire was signed in May 1991, ending a
civil war that began at independence in 1975.
According to the Portuguese news agency Lusa, at least 300 people, including
two UN peacekeeping staff, had been killed in clashes in Luanda since
Thursday night, and corpses and abandoned weapons littered the city's
deserted streets.
Shortly before the ceasefire, Lusa reported that Unita's top military leader
in Luanda, Elias Salupeto Pena, and other high-ranking officials gave
themselves up to the Defence Ministry.
A Portuguese radio station said their surrender followed a government attack
on a Unita stronghold in Luanda's Maianga suburb during which three
Portuguese were killed.
Russian Mi-8 helicopter gunships circled the city yesterday and the
government put into force an all-day curfew and threw up road blocks around
the city. Foreign residents took shelter from the fighting in hotels and
private residences.
Fighting also raged for control of the key cities of Benguela, Lobito,
Huambo and Cuito in the Unita tribal strongholds of the central provinces.
Unita also seized several diamond-producing areas in the north and south of
the country.
Luanda airport was closed yesterday and commercial flights into the capital
have been cancelled. Britain, the US, Portugal, South Africa and Brazil were
attempting to evacuate their nationals.

   THE CITY of London's cherished principle of self-regulation

regulation by practitioners for practitioners - could be eroded, following a
review of the power and methods of the Securities and Investments Board, the
financial regulator.
Mr Andrew Large, the SIB's chairman, said that his investigation,
commissioned by the Treasury, is far more wide-ranging than is widely
believed. He said there would be a 'clear shift to a less self-regulatory
basis'.
He added that he may ask the government for sweeping new powers to mount
civil litigation against alleged City wrongdoers, along the lines of the
powers held by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Separately, Mr Large is examining whether it is appropriate for the Stock
Exchange to retain its regulatory responsibilities, for listing shares and
tracking suspected insider dealing, or whether these responsibilities should
be transferred to the SIB.
Transferring these roles could both boost the SIB's standing in the City and
also allow the exchange to concentrate on its prime role of maintaining an
efficient market. Mr Large stressed he was some way from making a
recommendation on this question.
In July, Mr Norman Lamont, the Chancellor, asked Mr Large to undertake a
review of how the SIB carries out its responsibilities under the Financial
Services Act. The review was, in part, prompted by the failure of City
regulators to prevent Mr Robert Maxwell from looting the pension funds of
his companies.
Mr Large, who plans to submit his report in March, said he was 'concerned
that the enforcement procedures are too complex and fragmented and that
punishments have not been enough'.
He believes the self-regulatory organisations (SROs), which have direct
responsibility below the SIB for supervising securities and investment
firms, should levy bigger fines on firms which break City rules. But he is
concerned that prosecuting alleged frauds through the courts is slow and the
outcome uncertain.
He said that in cases of market manipulation - either insider dealing or
other unfair methods of profiting from share price movements - the SIB
should perhaps have powers to mount civil prosecutions. Market manipulation
and insider trading are criminal offences, but the burden of proof required
for a successful prosecution in a civil case is far less than in a criminal
case.
Mr Large hopes to make the SIB and the SROs more aggressive in monitoring of
financial firms and the pursuit of fraud.
He said financial practitioners had played an important role in shaping
regulations in the four years since the Financial Services Act came into
force. He said a 'different sort of person' was necessary now that the
regulators' work was not to write rules but to ensure they are obeyed.
Two important issues under review are whether financial firms should lose
their right to choose which SRO should regulate them and whether the SIB
should give up direct regulation of firms and concentrate on being the
regulators' regulator.
Mr Large said the authority of the SIB may be diminished by its inability to
decide the membership, or scope, of an SRO. The question of whether
financial firms should be free to choose their SRO has become contentious
over the summer, because the big UK banks, currently supervised by the SIB,
are refusing to join an SRO, called the Personal Investment Authority, which
would streamline the regulation of retail financial services.
Interviews with Andrew Large, SIB chairman, and Richard Breeden, SEC
chairman, will appear tomorrow.
