Despite the trials and tribulations in their own domestic economy, Indians
are not only riveted by the current chaos in Britain, but relishing it.
Witness the Times of India's cartoon showing a civil servant giving a
minister last-minute advice before he meets a visiting British mission.
'Remember not to ask for any help from this high-powered economic delegation
from the UK, sir,' says the bureaucrat. 'It's here to seek aid from us.'

A catch question in future exams on the history of women's progress in the
workplace might well be: Which European Community ministers signed the EC's
recently adopted directive on pregnant workers?
The obvious answer, of course, is the social affairs ministers. In fact, the
signing was done by their colleagues in charge of fisheries.
It emerges that agreement on the directive was reached only just before the
deadline for signature a fortnight ago, and the social affairs supremos
could not be mustered in time to save the day. If the fisheries ministers
had not stepped into the breach, the directive would have been still born.

When it comes to finding new jobs, Maurice Strong seems to be something of a
masochist. The energetic Canadian who struggled to give focus to the over-
ambitious Earth Summit in Rio last June is now returning home to take the
reins of Ontario Hydro, one of North America's biggest (and most troubled)
power utilities.
His 20-year involvement with international environmental issues contrasts
with a chequered career in Canada. In the 1970s, he was close to ex-premier
Pierre Trudeau who made him the first chairman of the national energy
company, Petro-Canada. But a bid to enter national politics was aborted
after one of Strong's outside businesses ran into trouble.
His versatile experience should have forearmed him for the turbulence at
Ontario Hydro. The government-owned utility, one of North America's heaviest
offshore borrowers, has been stretched to the limit by cost overruns and
technical problems at its nuclear power stations. Its electricity rates have
been pushed up by almost 20 per cent in the past two years.
There's not much doubt which way Strong will be leaning when he has to
choose between the environment and the bottom line.

As perhaps befits a trustee of the Thatcher foundation, media don Norman
Stone was in robust form during his London lecture on the Balkan crisis and
the protection of minorities.
Arriving 40 minutes late, the Oxford professor of modern history began by
explaining he did not believe in minority rights. As a Scot, he had
prospered in England with 'no rights whatsoever'.
He then proceeded to advocate 'the Balkanisation of everybody', suggesting
en passant that Serbo-Croat was 'an invented language, slightly less
authentic than Hebrew'.
The Serbian problem, he went on, could be quickly solved 'if we recognised
evil when we saw it and dropped a bomb on it'. He concluded that Germany
should be urged to undertake this task since no other power was sufficiently
interested.
All of which somewhat threw his audience at the Institute of Jewish Affairs,
which had arranged the event. 'I feel sorry for his students, they must be
so confused,' was the kindest comment overheard as the listeners, many of
them old enough to remember the second world war, went incredulously away.

UK psychiatrists might do well to gear up for an influx of custom from the
National Westminster Bank.
Since NatWest Markets was set up earlier this year, from elements including
the Blue Arrow-bedevilled County NatWest investment bank, there have been
promises of a new corporate identity to which staff are being introduced
this morning.
It turns out that the specialist consultants hired for the job trawled
through every name that has been part of the bank's history in the past 300
years . . . then decided the outfit should go on being called NatWest
Markets.
But at least they've come up with a new logo: the monogram NWM against a
dark blue (yes, blue) background. The reason they didn't just settle for
sharing the NatWest Bank emblem is officially that the aim of the exercise
is to distinguish NWM's institutional client service from the high-street
banking operation. So don't go thinking that those prominent arrow-heads in
the clearer's logo have anything to do with it.
How do the staff feel about the 'contemporary and self-confident solution'?
Straight-talking Martin Owen, who took over as the new outfit's chief
executive in June, confesses: 'NatWest Markets is not a name I would have
wanted. I would have preferred something more descriptive of what we do -
'Markets' smacks of traders.' Oh dear.
Still, that perhaps explains why the identity is to undergo further
'reinforcing' by such means as sticking 'corporate and investment banking'
under the NWM monogram. And for anyone who doesn't find that confusing
enough in itself, the sad news is that worse confusion underlies it.
For example, the County NatWest name has not disappeared entirely. It is to
be retained for investment management operations and - wait for it - the
corporate finance department.
The consultants found that while NatWest staff as well as the media were
cynical about the County tag in the wake of Blue Arrow, the clients were
happy with it. 'That surprised us as well,' says Owen.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Letter: Decision on piggy-back freight ridiculous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN R TITCHENER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is ridiculous that there will be no upgrading of rail lines to take
'ro-ro' piggy-back lorries and freight from tho continent on British tracks
('Rail switch for channel ruled out', October 28).
This association was instrumental some years ago in putting forward evidence
to the government that it would be preferable to have a twin-bored tunnel
link with a sufficient bore to take such freight transport - and that this
would be better than the proposed BR 'mouse-hole' with a single tunnel
passenger train facility. This was in October 1980. Now, after 12 years, a
main raison d'etre of the tunnel has been taken away at a stoke.
There are reasons why lorry drivers may prefer ferries - mainly because it
provides a rest period on the tachograph. The knock-on effect, however, will
be to restrict benefits of the tunnel being expanded to areas of the country
away from the metropolis and from the south-east; particularly economic help
to the north-east, north-west, Tyneside, etc. Apart from unnecessary delays
in decisions and their implementation, this news must be the last straw for
many businesses which will now either move to north-east France or not move
to our development areas, as the case may be.
There are other reasons for transfer of freight to rail transport -
particularly environmental ones such as preservation of fossil fuels.
The tunnel links in all forms have been subject to short termism. We feel
that the authorities should now look ahead over 20 and 30 years and more and
look to a proper infrastructure. All this at a time when within two months
the first train will be run through the tunnel.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Letter: Bailing out mortgage holders short-sighted
expediency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From A DOYLE and M TURNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, One cannot help but agree with the general thrust of Samuel Brittan's
argument (Economic Viewpoint, October 29) that the relative stances of
monetary and fiscal policy in the UK need to be reversed. Cutting benefit
payments amounts to a tax on the poor - undesirable at any stage, but
especially so now.
New capital infrastructure such as the Jubilee Line extension is likely to
be built at least partly with public funds at some stage anyway, so it seems
eminently sensible to pay for it now at reduced prices rather than later
when capacity is stretched.
But to argue for the bailing out of mortgage holders through the
nationalisation of the bad debts of the banks and building societies is to
argue for nothing less than short-sighted expediency. Wiping away even part
of the current housing-related bad debts of the banks and building societies
would water down the prime factor likely to prevent a resumption of an
uncontrollable housing book, unlikely as this may seem in the current
depressed climate. This is especially so since the UK is (happily) no longer
within the constraints of the exchange rate mechanism. Likewise for greater
relief on mortgage interest for those with negative equity. This amounts
only to a subsidy to property owners, the vast majority of whom could well
do without any subsidy.
The direction of policy should rather be to remove this distortion
altogether, although not until a resumption of growth allows the
deflationary effects of such an abolition to be minimised.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Letter: No need for common environmental standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof ROLAND VAUBEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to your article, 'Brussels' green sprouts' (October 21),
it is not true that the single European market requires common environmental
standards. It has been shown that the demand for environmental protection
depends on income, the density of population and several other
characteristics.
The member countries differ widely in these respects. Environmental prices
ought to vary accordingly. This conclusion holds also for international
spill-overs. Ideally, each country should apply its domestic environmental
prices to pollution from abroad as well. The Community would merely
supervise the measurement of, and payments for, international pollution.
International differences among environmental standards or prices do not
distort trade. They are necessary to allow for differences in preferences
and factor endowments. Harmonisation is the distortion.

FT  02 NOV 92 / The costly image in the corner of the office: Michael
Cassell explains how the photocopier can become a source of losses for some
British companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It can come as a shock when the company secretary learns that the
photocopier in the corner is costing more to run than the managing
director's Jaguar.
But the modest piece of machinery, churning out images with the help of a
photo-sensitive drum, has reproduced a financial nightmare for many British
companies.
For some small businesses, its installation has proved ruinously expensive
and led to bankruptcy. Mrs Ann Orchardson shut her office services business
in Glasgow after succumbing to the 'sharp practice' of a copier salesman.
Other, larger organisations have made lengthy and costly efforts to have
their machines removed. One London company has been confronted with a demand
for nearly Pounds 500,000 after trying to hand back 30 machines. And Mr Paul
Winner, head of a London public relations company, was told it would cost
Pounds 135,000 to return two ageing photocopiers worth Pounds 7,000 each
when new. Chelsea Football Club, Guinness, British Airways and several
councils and health authorities are among those reported to have had
complaints.
The Confederation of British Industry says hundreds of companies and
organisations have been caught out by the photocopier 'scam'.
The problem lies not with the machines themselves but with the 'copy plan'
agreements. These amalgamate the capital cost of financing the equipment
with its running costs, to give a charge for each copy run off the machine.
Customers are freed from the business of choosing, operating and buying
machines by signing a contract for a specified number of photocopies each
month at a negotiated price per copy.
Mr Alan Kay, a Worcester-based accountant, rues the day his practice signed
a copy plan: 'The scheme is a licence to rip off businesses. A deal which is
sold in terms of pennies and invariably signed by someone with little
authority can end up costing a fortune.'
But the formula has proved attractive. Estimates suggest that there are up
to 250,000 copy plan agreements in force in the UK, representing a Pounds
1bn-plus market which has been growing rapidly.
Copy plans have been welcomed as a marketing ploy by some photocopier
manufacturers, dealers and leasing companies which finance the packages.
Some leasing companies are owned by large financial institutions. Their
parentage, however, has not prevented claims that some of their activities
are anti-competitive and highly questionable. One regional fraud squad,
along with the Inland Revenue, has been examining the activities of one
large leasing subsidiary.
Following an investigation last year by the Office of Fair Trading into the
selling practices of one photocopier distributor, the industry was thought
to have cleaned up its act.
But a renewed wave of protests from customers suggests that widespread
abuses remain. The Department of Trade and Industry will shortly raise the
issue with the OFT.
Customers complain that copy plan contracts involve the ultimate in 'small
print' deception, concealing enormously expensive obligations in the guise
of flexible business agreements. Among the most regular criticisms are:
contracts which run for seven or even nine years, several times longer than
the average life of the equipment;
hidden annual increases in copy costs;
any variations in the agreement can mean a completely new contract, of which
the customer is often unaware; the cost of settling old agreements is added
to the undisclosed capital value of new equipment; the total cost of a
contract is not disclosed.
The Finance &amp; Leasing Association claims most current complaints are the
legacy of old, unsatisfactory contracts. It says new forms of contract now
in use mean the problem has largely been overcome.
In January, the association issued guidance notes for members to ensure
leasing documentation is clear and concise, along with advice for customers.
It also says leasing deals should not extend beyond the reasonable working
life of the equipment.
Mr Neil Grant, director of the association, says it has received no
complaints since the new guidance notes were issued, and stresses that any
companies breaking the code will have membership withdrawn.
'There are 400,000 copier agreements in existence and the rate of complaints
involving copy plans has been around 1 per cent. There will always be sharks
out there. Customers must be sure they are fully aware of what they are
signing.'
The association, however, only represents about 80 per cent of the finance
and leasing sector, and some of the biggest operators in the photocopier
market are not members. One is Southern Business Group, the photocopier
supplier which, unlike most of its competitors, provides equipment and
necessary finance. The company has come under criticism in the past for some
of its contractual practices, but now offers copy plan contracts which it
says are retrospective and no longer hold any nasty surprises. SBG, however,
still expects its customers to sign up for nine years.
Mr David McErlain, SBG managing director, claims misrepresentation and even
fraud are still rife among some copy plan companies. 'The problem continues.
Even if contracts are cleaner, a lot is down to the tactics of the salesman.
The OFT has an awesome weapon at its disposal, the removal of consumer
credit licences. It must use it for the sake of the whole industry.'
Mr Marcus I'Anson, a director of UTAX (UK), which imports photocopier
machines, says copy plans continue to damage the copier industry and should
be strictly controlled. 'Copy plans remain an easy route to an awful lot of
money for the finance companies involved. The clandestine nature of these
contracts makes it ridiculous to claim caveat emptor.'
Growing unease about bad publicity has led Canon, the Japanese manufacturer,
to endorse copy plan contracts which it regards as fair. Rank Xerox has just
launched an improved code of conduct which it hopes other equipment
suppliers will emulate.
Pressure is also mounting for changes in the law to eradicate the copy plan
problem. The Campaign to Clean Up Copier Contracts is working with the
Association of Electronics, Telecommunications and Business Equipment
Industries on a code of good practice.
It also wants ministers to extend to companies and other organisations the
same level of protection available to private individuals under the Consumer
Credit Act. This would include a two-week 'cooling-off' period.
Critics of copy plan schemes emphasise that victims of unfair agreements
should not assume they are helpless. There is evidence that, when faced with
the threat of litigation, some suppliers walk away, even deserting their
equipment.
According to Mr Neil Aitken, a partner with McKenna, the solicitors,
customers must take advice on the terms of their contracts before giving in
to a copy company's demands. He says that grounds for challenging copy
company claims can include misrepresentation and defences under the Unfair
Contract Terms Act.
Some leasing companies appear reluctant to pursue a contract claim through
to judgment, however. Though they might win, their reputation could be
damaged. Further blots on the copier business would not be welcome.

Sir, On April 9 last year you published a letter from me alerting you to the
'de-linking' by the clearing banks of loan rates from base rate which
resulted in small businesses being asked to pay a real interest rate of 8.5
per cent over the then base rate of 12.5 per cent.
The situation has hardly improved: my bank (Lloyds) now quotes a monthly
rate for small businesses of 1.17 per cent (APR 14.98 per cent) plus an
arrangement fee of 1 per cent per annum - a total of nearly 8 per cent over
base rate. It may not be usury but perhaps it explains why many small
businesses are reluctant to invest or are even going to the wall?

FT  02 NOV 92 / Letter: Not the Dan Quayle version of competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALBERT R BRASHEAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Your story on George Fisher ('Voice of high-tech challenge', Monday
Interview, October 26) identifies him with Vice-President Dan Quayle's
Council on Competitiveness. Unfortunately, we in the US have competing
competitiveness councils of the same name, so the error in the article is
quite understandable.
Mr Fisher is actually chairman of the private-sector Council on
Competitiveness, a non-profit, non-partisan organisation of chief executives
from business, higher education and organised labour working to improve the
ability of American companies and workers to compete internationally. The
council focuses on competitiveness issues in areas such as science and
technology, investment, international economics and trade, and human
resources. Your article presents an excellent summary of the council's - and
Mr Fisher's - position on these issues.
Mr Quayle's council appears to be concerned primarily with the effects of
government regulation. For further information, you might check with the
vice-president.
We have also heard of a third organisation dedicated to the elimination of
five-syllable words, but as far as we know, that group hasn't come up with a
name.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Leading Article: A vote for Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS OF parliament from all of Britain's political parties should vote
for the government at the end of Wednesday's debate on the Maastricht
treaty.
The motion before the House sets out what has happened to date in
Parliament's consideration of the bill to ratify the treaty and proposes to
continue that process. But the emollient phraseology cannot disguise the
primary purpose of the debate. This is to establish, once again, that there
is a majority in the British parliament for proceeding in good faith with
arrangements made after difficult negotiations with the other 11 members of
the European Community.
Those who propose to vote against must disagree with this. The Labour party,
which has worked itself into a lather of unrealistic expectations of a
fruitful alliance between itself and Tory Europhobes, maintains that the
time to proceed is not now. Discuss ratification after Christmas, says
Labour, or after the Danish question has been finally resolved.
When that sophistry is exposed, Labour apologists, some of them rather
shamefaced, burble on about how it is their duty to vote against the
government on what, they insist, is patently a vote of confidence. If that
is so, why not put down a confidence motion? The opposition has the right to
do that, but Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, knows that it would be blown
out of the water.
Playing games
The truth is that the party is allowing itself to be diverted by the sight
of a government in disarray. If it is to have the slightest hope of forming
an administration once again it should be fixing its sights on 1996-97, when
it will fight another general election. It should be showing that it has
learned the lessons of its defeat in April.
Whatever the opinion polls say now, they are irrelevant to the next big
contest. The outcome of that will in large part depend upon whether Labour,
which has proved to be unelectable four times running, has by then shown
itself to be trustworthy. In playing games with Wednesday's vote, Mr Smith
is indicating a willingness to abandon his own long-held European
convictions. Has he forgotten the damage done to his predecessor by a
reputation for U-turns on matters of deep principle? Distracted by the
passing show, Mr Smith is revealing a lack of confidence that his own party
can indeed be led towards reform and unity.
No alternative
His allies on the Conservative benches stand for everything the Labour party
says it does not. Some are English nationalists, tending, in some cases, to
xenophobia. Some are unreconciled Thatcherites, unable to forgive Mr John
Major for not being the clone of the former prime minister that they thought
he was when they voted for him in November 1990. Others are merely
disgruntled ex-office holders.
What they have in common is an inability to answer the simple question - 'if
not Maastricht, if not Europe, what then?' Acolytes of a lady whose proud
motto was that there is no alternative, they now have no alternative to
offer.
Mr Paddy Ashdown will ask his Liberal Democrats to support the motion, even
at the cost of Labour taunts that he is keeping the government in office.
That is not what he is doing: the Conservatives would not abdicate if
Maastricht was scuppered. Mr Ashdown is simply sticking to principle and
emerging with more credit than the leaders of either of the larger parties.
If Britain allows itself again to be exposed as half-hearted about the
Community or even, as some Eurosceptics fantasise, as the principled wrecker
of a treaty too far, defeat for the government on Wednesday will be a
stunning setback in the country's tortuous progress in coming to terms with
its viable place in the world.
At odds with its EC partners, Britain would pay dearly in lost inward
investment, long-term economic growth foregone, higher unemployment and a
place in the counsels of Europe denied. Those who resist a positive vote on
Wednesday are declaring their willingness to pay this price.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Danish demands
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MEANWHILE, DENMARK. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission,
may be correct in his belief that the terms of the Danish demands would
involve a renegotiation of the treaty, which the 12 have already ruled out
as a matter of principle. But it was not prudent of him to say so in the way
he did last week.
On commonsense grounds, a compromise ought to be possible. Cumulatively, the
Danish demands undoubtedly represent a pretty comprehensive rejection of the
Maastricht vision of greater unity at the political and economic level. But
in detail each item on the Danish list can be dealt with. Indeed, most of
them seem based on a misapprehension of what the treaty could require of
Denmark. There is no provision for a compulsory common defence policy, and
no chance that such a policy could be imposed. Danish anxieties that the
Community could encroach on national sovereignty in the fields of
citizenship and law enforcement are equally overdone.
The most substantial demand is for a strengthened opt-out from the plan for
a single currency. Yet Denmark already has a protocol in the treaty allowing
it to secure exemption from monetary union, so an expansion of this let-out
would not be a major departure of principle.
The most difficult feature of the Danish package is not so much these issues
themselves as the form in which they have been wrapped.
If the Danish government continues to insist upon an instrument which is
legally binding and therefore involving directly or indirectly an effective
modification of the treaty and a new round of ratifications, the other
member states will be right to resist.
It may yet be that, faced with a treaty ratified by 11 members, the Danes
will be willing to settle for the kind of declaratory interpretation the 11
would certainly be willing to sign. What seems beyond doubt, is that an
accommodation will require negotiation and compromise at the political
level. This is not a task at this stage in which Mr Delors can play a
leading role.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Last clash in a war of weirdness: The US election will be
decided in about a dozen states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This 'deeply weird' election year, as President George Bush never stops
calling it, has come down to this final irony. The selection of the man to
lead the most mobile and changing society the industrialised world has yet
produced will probably be determined in the oldest and most stolid parts of
the nation, that swathe of yesterday's industrial heartland that stretches
from the awful refineries of New Jersey to the ethnic beer halls of
Milwaukee, with a few excursions to the even more ancient colonial south.
This weekend, the voters of about a dozen 'battleground' states will have
digested all they have learned this year about Mr Bush, Governor Bill
Clinton of Arkansas, and Mr Ross Perot, a billionaire from Texas. It is now
probably too late for 11th-hour smoking guns, bimbos and October surprises,
unless the unpredictable Mr Perot endorses one of the other two.
There will be no more economic statistics to muddy the waters. It has all
come down to final frantic efforts in non-stop six-state-a-day tours by
Messrs Bush and Clinton, the occasional foray in the flesh by Mr Perot, and
a barrage of commercial advertising by all three to wind up the most
expensive election there ever has been.
All that is now left before tomorrow are the final polls and a lot of
questions. Here are some of the more important:
Can Bush win?
The answer is yes, but luck will be needed. Though he has narrowed his
deficit in the national polls with Mr Clinton, he has not risen much above
35 per cent in any of them. The lowest winning percentages of the popular
vote this century have been Woodrow Wilson's 41.84 in 1912 and Richard
Nixon's 43.42 in 1968, which indicates Mr Bush still has a way to go. But
both those contests featured strong third-party candidates, a role Mr Perot,
vaingloriously, unwittingly and unwillingly, may yet play by spoiling Mr
Clinton's exclusive opposition patch.
But can Bush win the electoral college?
This is where everything must go right on election day, because the
president starts with a huge debit. He has already conceded California, New
York and Illinois, the first-, second- and sixth-largest states, together
worth 109 of the 270 college votes needed to win. He has visited none of
them for weeks and his campaign is paying for no prominent media advertising
in California and New York and only radio spots in Illinois. In 1988, he
took California and Illinois and cannot be unconscious of history which says
that no Republican this century has taken the White House without carrying
California.
In 1988, Mr Michael Dukakis won 11 states, including New York and the
District of Columbia. This year they are worth, excluding New York, 71
votes. None looks even remotely fragile for Mr Clinton, though Mr Bush chose
Wisconsin for a Saturday train tour. It must be assumed the Democratic
candidate will carry Arkansas, his state, and Tennessee, Senator Gore's,
worth another 17 votes.
By a conservative calculation, therefore, Mr Bush is up against an opponent
with 198 electors virtually in the bank, more than double Mr Dukakis's
total, nearly five times what President Carter got in 1980, more even than
Hubert Humphrey in 1968, who lost by only 500,000 popular votes.
This is not, by itself, an insuperable handicap for a man who four years ago
swept the south, cleaned up in all the big states except New York and ruled
supreme elsewhere except some north-eastern states, the Pacific north-west
and Hawaii. The problem this year is that Mr Clinton, a southerner, is very
competitive in his own backyard, especially in bigger states such as North
Carolina, Georgia and Louisiana, with their 36 electors, not to mention
Florida and Texas, the third- and fourth-largest states worth 57 votes.
What is the Bush strategy then?
His campaign claims, without being specific beyond the questionable
inclusion of Texas and Florida, that he leads in 14 or 15 states with about
140 electors and is 'competitive' in a like number. By this, Mr Fred
Steeper, his pollster, means states in which he now trails by one to six
points but which he would win in the event of a last-minute three- to
four-point swing in his favour. He concedes there is no margin for error.
If Indiana, Vice-President Dan Quayle's home and the first state to report
on Tuesday, looks sick, 'we can roll up the rug', though Connecticut and New
Jersey will be the best early tests. In the final days, Mr Bush is spending
all his time in the industrial heartland, before going home to Texas, and is
deploying former President Reagan in the south.
Can Clinton lose?
Again the answer is certainly yes, if Mr Bush's hopeful scenario comes true
and if Mr Clinton suffers some unexpected setbacks. There is another factor.
His whole election strategy was predicated first on breaking the Republican
monopoly on the south and its borders. Of the six elections held after the
impact of the 1964 Civil Rights Act was fully digested, the only Democratic
victory was achieved, in 1976, with a southerner on the ticket. Put another
way, the Republicans gained an inherent advantage in the south which meant
that any Democrat needed to carry about two-thirds of the remaining states
to have a chance of victory. If Mr Clinton does not make his southern
breakthrough, the old electoral mathematics prevail.
In any event, the industrial heartland battleground is crucial. This is a
part of the country which has increasingly split its preferences, voting for
Republican presidents and state governors and Democratic senators and
congressmen. Even in 1976, Jimmy Carter eked out only narrow victories in
Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin, losing elsewhere. Mr Bush took them all
except Wisconsin four years ago, though he trails in most of them today.
How will Perot do and whom will he hurt most?
There is no clear answer to either question, except that he will not win the
presidency and will not, barring a miracle, force the election into the next
House of Representatives. Nobody before has tried to buy an election
outright. John Connally's attempt in the Republican primaries of 1976, where
he spent the odd million to win one convention delegate, does not compare
with Mr Perot's personal outlays of well over Dollars 60m, almost all of it
on television advertising, more even than the other two.
Independent or third-party candidacies invariably flourish, flatten and
wither. Mr Perot's 'second coming' in the last month of the campaign may
conform to this pattern but it would require a big shrivelling now for him
to fall back to single-digit irrelevance. His support is drawn heavily from
those previously outside the political process. If they sense he cannot win,
they may stay at home as usual.
Most of them seem more conservative. Admiral Stockdale, his nominal running
mate, and Orson Swindle, his campaign director, are far more critical of Mr
Clinton than Mr Bush, but Mr Perot's particular venom is more directed at
the president.
The only half-safe rule of thumb, borne out by the latest polls, is that the
better Mr Perot does, the more he hurts Mr Clinton; the worse he does, the
more he hurts Mr Bush. At any level, he may spell the difference in Texas
and Florida, which would hurt Mr Bush, and in Michigan and Ohio, which would
more damage Mr Clinton. He will do best in the south-western and mountain
states, until now solid Republican territory, but Mr Steeper claims that
there is no state which Mr Perot can hand to either candidate.
Is there any chance that more Americans will vote this year and, if so, what
does that mean?
In 1988, barely 50 per cent of registered voters - and barely one-third of
those of voting age - cast a ballot, the culmination of a 30-year decline.
Partly because of enthusiasm generated by Mr Perot's drives to get on the
ballot, partly because of vigorous party registration drives and partly
because of the perception that this really may be an important election,
turn-out may reach and even exceed 55 per cent this year.
Low participation usually helps Republicans, less numerous than Democrats
but more likely to vote. This year the Democrats seem to have been signing
up more voters, but so has the Christian right. There does appear, mostly
from anecdotal evidence, to be much greater engagement by young people. This
segment, once fertile ground for Messrs Reagan and Bush but with problematic
current prospects for employment, is now more inclined towards Mr Clinton
and, to an extent, Mr Perot.
What about congressional coat-tails?
Republican hopes for big gains in the Senate and House, based on national
discontent with incumbents, have dissipated. The Democrats might get up to
60 seats in the Senate (they now control 57) which would be enough to stop
filibusters, while losing only 15 to 20 in the House, where they currently
hold a large 268-166 edge over the Republicans, with one independent. There
will be a huge turnover, however, with 120 to 150 new denizens on Capitol
Hill next January.
Trailing in the polls, Mr Bush was shunned by many Republican candidates,
whereas Mr Clinton had far closer identification with his party aspirants,
especially a new crop of women. In general, coat-tails  - from the
presidential candidates down to Congress and vice versa - are not expected
to be strong.
All right then, in the last analysis, what will decide this election? And
who will win it?
Mr Fred Malek, a Bush campaign director, concedes that if the election were
merely a referendum on the economy his man would already have lost. Mr
Clinton believes that is still the case and that the nation will pass its
own negative verdict on 'trickle-down' economics and a positive one on his
detailed plans for change.
Mr Malek now argues that the electorate is focusing on just two issues - who
has the better future plan for the economy and which man has the integrity
appropriate for the presidency. Regardless of whether the Bush attacks on Mr
Clinton have been fair or warranted - and many have not been - personalities
are critical in a presidential election. If Mr Bush wins, it will be because
he has undermined public confidence in Mr Clinton.
But elections are also about looking forward with hope to new changes and
challenges, and that clearly is the much younger and more articulate Mr
Clinton's forte. If Mr Clinton wins, it will be because he has exposed the
exhaustion of Republican policies after 12 years in power.
There are no safe bets in this game. The spread remains where it has been
for some time - between a comfortable Clinton victory and a narrow Bush one.
Either is possible and so is something in between, and there are a lot of
racetracks to visit from Michigan to Florida.

<TEXT>
Norman Lamont's Mansion House speech was a meatier document than usual. Most
of the new material was logically second level. That is, it did not contain
policy decisions but information on how decisions will be taken.
This, however, has its importance, especially in view of the widespread and
justified disquiet about how decisions relating to ERM membership and
departure were taken.
Far and away the most important announcement is that the governor of the
Bank of England is to provide a regular report in the Bank's Quarterly
Bulletin on progress towards the inflation target. It will be made by the
Bank rather than the Treasury in the hope that this will increase public
confidence in the objectivity of the analysis, although the chancellor and
his Treasury team will still see prepublished drafts.
A toenail is thus being put into the bowl marked 'independent central bank'.
The inspiration has clearly been New Zealand, where the Reserve Bank has a
contract with the government to pursue a given rate of inflation which it
can only override in carefully pre-stated circumstances.
In the UK, however, there is still to be neither contract nor independence
of action. To provide an incentive for improved policy, a specific person or
group, preferably at one stage removed from the political process, needs to
be personally accountable for monetary policy - and not for other subjects
such as financial regulation.
Indeed the move may turn out to be a retrograde one if it is treated as a
substitute for a new Bank of England Act, giving the Bank specific tasks. A
simple reshuffle of responsibilities among the team who gave us Black
Wednesday, with all decisions supposedly coming as acts of judgment fully
grown from the chancellor's head, like Athene from the head of Zeus, will
not meet the bill. The curse of the British establishment is that everyone
is jointly responsible for everything and no one is responsible for anything
in particular.
Another innovation, to which I can give only a tepid welcome, is the
proposed forecasting panel of between six and 12 outside experts which will
publish a report three or four times a year.
The idea goes back to a paper entitled Disarming the Treasury, written by
Alan Budd - now the Treasury's chief economic adviser - in the late 1970s.
But a big difference is that, in the original Budd paper, the Treasury would
cease to be a forecasting organisation, which would make a big difference to
its whole outlook and ethos.
I supported Budd's original proposal, not because I was enamoured of
forecasting but because, as the title suggested, it might reduce the role of
an official Treasury which then did not accept that inflation was a monetary
phenomenon and based its hopes on incomes policy. But the proposal in which
I had my heart was for a Council of Economic Advisers which would be
concerned primarily with policy analysis and which was proposed jointly by
Peter Jay and myself to a parliamentary committee in the early 1970s.
My fear about the new forecasting panel is that it will strengthen the
preoccupation with short-term forecasts, held even more by the Treasury's
critics as by the Treasury itself, and the profoundly misguided view that
making such forecasts is what economics is all about. Something might be
rescued from the idea if, contrary to present intentions, there were one or
two members of the panel who did not operate a forecasting model and made up
their minds on some other basis.
One such basis is suggested by Nigel Lawson in his forthcoming book, The
View from Number 11 (to be published on Thursday by Bantam Press at Pounds
20). It does not appear in the conclusions, but almost as throwaway remarks
in a chapter on the background to the 1988 Budget:
Repeal the 'absurd 1975 Industry Act requirement that the Treasury must
maintain a forecasting model'.
Meanwhile adopt a conventional assumption that the immediate future will be
a repetition of the immediate past - in the present instance that the
recession will continue to deepen.
Never forecast a turning point because it will probably not occur in the
year in question.
Efforts should concentrate on establishing what in fact has happened in the
recent past.
Decisions 'should be based as little as possible on short-term forecasts or
even on the suggested conventional assumption'.
These off-the-cuff ideas are fallible and imperfect. Improving them would
make a more useful task than poring over yet more sets of futuristic
numbers.
Best of all would be if all members of the proposed panel had to pass an
examination in Sir Karl Popper's Poverty of Historicism, from which they
would learn the difference between genuine social science and crystal-gazing
dressed up with numbers.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Leading Article: One-stop advice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORT FOR business in Britain is fragmented, under-funded and of variable
quality. Smaller companies, in particular, often do not know where to go for
advice or help with raising finance.
Mr Michael Heseltine thinks he has the answer. His officials at the
Department of Trade and Industry are working on plans to establish a
nationwide network of 200 'one-stop shops', advice centres which would bring
together various sources of business support.
The Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) are to be asked to co-ordinate
local partnerships to bid for the franchise to run the centres, which would
combine the efforts of chambers of commerce, enterprise agencies, local
authorities and others on a single site primarily to assist smaller,
established businesses. The centres are intended to provide a level of
service which matches that provided by the continental European chambers of
commerce but without the obligation for all local businesses to register or
become members.
In principle the plan is to be welcomed, but a number of issues need to be
tackled if the venture is to succeed.
Most obviously, the funding for the new network will have to be right, since
the rise in unemployment and related training is already placing a heavy
burden on the TECs' budgets.
Care is also needed to define the role of the institutions involved. Some
TECs are already directly providing business services in competition with
existing business support organisations instead of concentrating on
co-ordinating the delivery of services by others. The relationships between
TECs and other agencies is uneasy in many areas as a result.
Meanwhile, the chambers are halfway through a revamp of their own network
with a programme from which the DTI appears to have borrowed generously. The
chambers were wrong-footed by the creation of the TECs and they seem to have
been caught again by the latest proposals.
A careful, sustained effort by government to co-ordinate the efforts of
these agencies is badly needed. A superficial and poorly funded exercise,
strong on publicity, weak on organisation, would do a great deal of harm.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Arts: London Sinfonietta celebrates 25 years - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With its penchant for celebrating anniversaries, the London Sinfonietta is
spending this season feting its own twenty-fifth. Self-congratulatory, of
course, but pardonable: its proud list of past and present commissions in
the programme-book for 'Happy Returns', its current South Bank series, must
be unmatched by any other band. Most of the music in this series was,
indeed, commissioned or co-commissioned by the Sinfonietta and its fraternal
Voices, and on average the quality has been bracingly high.
Still, claiming 'to have defined the course of contemporary music over these
past 25 years' is a bit strong. During that time, and especially since the
end of the 1970s, the course of 'contemporary music' has branched into
rivulets going every which way. The Sinfonietta has managed to dip a
cautious toe into many of them, unlike more doctrinaire ensembles, but
mostly it is loyal to its own favourites. And a typical Sinfonietta
programme, like Saturday's at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, chiefly demonstrates
how disparate and incommensurable even those are.
The concert offered extremes of tough- and tender-mindedness, respectively
at the outer ends and in between. At the start Oliver Knussen conducted his
own Coursing (1979), potent and thrilling as ever; first a wild unison
tootling by everybody, gradually overlaid and underpinned by slower strands
which at last make a towering wall of sound. All that in just six minutes]
The evening concluded with Elliott Carter's 1981 song-cycle In Sleep, in
Thunder, which even in a superlative performance like this (the intrepid
soloist was Jon Garrison, a fine operatic tenor who could compete with
Carter's fierce band) strikes me as one of his toughest pieces to digest.
Six Robert Lowell poems are set to angular, high-flying vocal lines, no less
vehement than the ensemble with its minatory trumpet. The idea must be to
make explicit the dramatic implications of the verse: dark, troubled,
bitter; as word-setting, however, it seems a long way off Lowell's quietly
tense, gritted-teeth style.
In between, we had Robin Holloway's scrupulous, gentle Evening with Angels
(1972, but later shorn of its musical 'frame' and a whole song), and a
characteristic idyll by Takemitsu. His 1988 Tree Line evinces all the
qualities which have kept him laden with commissions from people wanting
listener-friendly 'new' music: tranquil and exceedingly pretty, with its
delicate sound-palette, in an idiom just a step beyond early Impressionist
Roussel or Florent Schmitt.
It has been curious to follow Takemitsu's progress, or regress, from music
of tiny, exquisite flourishes in an impeccably atonal postwar idiom to his
recent canvases, which glow so sweetly and sound so old and familiar. To be
fair, they are always shapely in ways which are his very own. A new piece by
the emigre Dmitri Smirnov, The River of Life ' inspired by a Blake
watercolour ' sounded equally sincere and out-of-its-time. Here, though, the
harking-back was to Skryabin: not to his exacerbated harmony (Smirnov uses
quasi-serial note-patterns, planned to afford plenty of major triads), but
to his tremulous ecstasies. As the vision developed, a soulful trumpet
sealed the resemblance. Skryabin himself, however, might have stopped short
of putting harp, celesta and glockenspiel in unison to make his celestial
effects.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Arts: A mission to find a place for reverence - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If a recession can be called a pause for thought, then there is one person
in Britain who has made very substantial use of the not so short
intermission. It is eight years since the Prince of Wales made his memorable
speech to the Royal Institute of British Architects on their 150th
anniversary, and in that time many of the Prince's thoughts about
architecture have been translated into action. While the slump in the
building industry has slowed the progress of both development and innovation
 -it has given time for some thoughtful changes in architectural theory and
education. Last week, the Prince of Wales inaugurated an entirely new school
of architecture in London and paid it a couple of visits to meet students
and sit in on a lecture.
Although two houses in Regent's Park and 31 Foundation Course students may
be only a modest acorn rather a giant oak, it is a remarkable beginning
achieved in an often pointlessly hostile critical climate. I thought that
there was a remarkable atmosphere at the opening event last week; one of
quiet and thoughtful determination among the staff and students. It is a
perfectly fair question to ask: why another school of architecture ? I think
that the Prince gave the answer; 'If there has been any single thing wrong
with the architectural profession in this country over the last century, it
has been that they have become cut off from people who are not architects,
from compatriots in the building process. I would like my Institute to make
the most of its independence, and its freedom from sectional interests, to
try and effect some reconciliation between these fragments. So, while it
will teach theory, it will be rooted in good building practice; while it
develops the aesthetic sensibilities of the builder and the architect, it
will not be at the expense of remembering that there is a 'builder' in each
one of us'.
The school is already something of a remarkable animal. It is the product of
endless work, much of it voluntary, from people who are committed to
architectural literacy without rigid dogma. It was a welcome sight to see
the President of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Mr Richard
MacCormac, present at the opening of the school. Bridge building is the
order of the day; recognition that there can be different standards of
excellence, and an understanding that architectural quality depends upon
shared roots.
The Prince is sometimes unfairly mocked for even daring to mention values
that exist beyond the merely material plane. Architecture is, at its best,
like any other fine art, concerned with the place of mankind in the world
and of the world in the universe. Architectural language deals with this
through a sense of order and proportion. That is not some mystical sixth
sense but something which can be learned and, once mastered, applied to the
art of creation. To quote the Prince's opening speech: 'In architecture, in
music, and in nature as a whole, there is, I believe, a fundamental order or
hierarchy, the recognition of which is essential both to appreciation and to
our own creativity.'
However, recognising this sense of order is only the beginning. There is
another area that is harder to define and is often ignored out of a kind of
Protestant embarrassment. This is what the Prince and others have called,
'reverence'; a mixture of humility and aspiration. Without this quality,
artistic creation has a rough ride through the jungles of egomania and self
promotion. An artist like Rembrandt is one of the clearest examples of the
demonstration of reverence; how can architects and architects in training be
taught to embody that sense of observed respect for humanity that Rembrandt
transforms into art ? That is the challenge which the Prince of Wales's
Institute of Architecture is beginning to be equipped to face.
Earlier this month in the northern Italian city of Bologna, the Prince of
Wales inaugurated an exhibition of architecture entitled 'A Vision of
Europe'. I hope that this exhibition will tour in Europe because the
curators, Liam O'Connor and Gabriele Tagliaventi, have assembled a
remarkable range of built and unbuilt projects that illustrate a continuing
urbanist and architectural tradition that nonetheless accommodates the
activities of the end of the twentieth century.
The European range that is fascinating and some particular architects who
are not especially well known stand out. I was impressed by the work of the
French architect Christian Langlois with his completion of the cathedral
square at Orleans and the buildings he designed in the 1970s for the French
Senate in the Rue Vaurigard in Paris. There is an impressive block of flats
in Olot, Barcelona, Spain which shows that there are new ways of using the
classical language to deal with modern problems. The architect is Ramon
Fortet and his work is far more sympathetic and humane than the fashionable
giantism of his compatriot Bofill. The range of work in this exhibition is
inspiring; I hope it will soon be seen in the UK.
There is a unique opportunity for lovers of European architecture and
culture to demonstrate their own sense of reverence in a practical way in
London on November 10. There are still seats available for the concert at
the Royal Festival Hall being given by the compelling pianist from the
former Yugoslavia, Ivo Pogorelich. The purpose of the concert is to raise
funds specifically for the International Monuments Trust Croatia Appeal,
with the proceeds being specifically earmarked for the City of Dubrovnik. It
is hard to think of a more worthwhile way of spending an evening, listening
to the works of Chopin, Ravel and Rachmaninov, knowing the funds raised are
going to help repair the mad and wanton damage recently inflicted upon the
'jewel of the Adriatic'. This international cultural appeal deserves support
and tickets can be obtained from the Royal Festival Hall. It is hard to
realise the extent of the damage recent fighting has inflicted upon our
common European heritage. There can be no other place at the moment where
reverence for European culture is more sorely needed.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Arts: The Wigmore Hall is flavour of the month - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Extracting sponsorship money from companies is proving disheartening in a
recession but there are alternative sources of revenue for arts groups to
explore. Trusts are committed to distributing largesse whatever the
financial climate and rich individuals often feel more charitable in hard
times.
On November 9 the Queen will open the Joseph H. Hotung Gallery at the
British Museum. It is devoted to Chinese and Indian works of art; at 360
feet it is the longest museum gallery in the UK; it is resplendently
finished in gold leaf; it displays almost 4,000 masterpieces; and its Pounds
2m cost was met by one man, Mr Hotung, a Hong Kong businessman.
There may be mercenary reasons why Mr Hotung has been so generous. He is
acquiring commercial properties in the UK. He will get a status-raising
exhibition of his own collection of Chinese jades in the gallery next year -
and his name will be neatly engraved into the structure. But they are
incidental to Mr Hotung's commitment as a collector.
He learnt much in the old Chinese gallery at the British Museum, but felt
his learning curve would have been greatly increased if the lighting there
had been better. He suggested to the Keeper, Jessica Rawson, that he provide
improved lighting. She nudged him towards a full scale renovation.
The National Gallery has also found four private patrons, including Lady
Kaye and Mrs Wrightsman (plus old friend, dealers Hazlett Gooden &amp; Fox to
club together the Pounds 1m needed to renovate its Lower Gallery, where it
keeps its reserve collection. It will re-open next spring.
The Tate Gallery gained an important work by Joseph Wright of Derby thanks
to the generosity of Mr John Ritblat, who gave Pounds 100,000, encouraged by
the Gift Aid provisions, while the cataloguing of Kenneth Clark's archive
was paid for by John and Olivia Hughes, also powered by Gift Aid.
In the main private patrons prefer to finance long lasting memorials to
their munificence, but when Ken Russell's production of Princess Ida opens
at the ENO next week it will be part paid for by Christine and Irwine
Laidlaw, American fans of the Coliseum.
                       *       *      *
Amazingly there are still sponsorship success stories. Here are two. The
Wigmore Hall re-opens for business on November 12 after an 18-month closure
for restoration. There has been no change to the gorgeous art nouveau
auditorium. All the work is back stage, and designed, almost incidentally,
to appeal to sponsors. For the first time there is a large bar area, ideal
for entertaining, plus an adjacent restaurant.
The Wigmore hardly touched the lives of sponsors in the past. It was
regarded as too cramped. But now it is flavour of the month, its popularity
among artists, audiences, and even critics, filtering through to sponsors.
For the first half of its 1992-93 season the Wigmore has attracted Pounds
80,000 in sponsoring income as against a target of Pounds 56,000. Apart from
the smart new premises, sponsoring a concert at the Wigmore starts at Pounds
3,000, a much less demanding proposition than a Pounds 20,000 blow out at
the Festival Hall.
The Wigmore must become more commercial. It still gets grants from the Arts
Council and Westminster City Council, which, with its landlord, the
Prudential, paid for the Pounds 2m refurbishment, but the nod is that it
should develop its own sources of income. National Power is sponsoring the
re-opening concert, which features 16 singers, including Margaret Price and
Felicity Palmer, and British Airways and Marks &amp; Spencer have joined the new
backers.
                       *       *      *
The Wigmore Hall is acting as an out station for the Scandinavian Festival,
the most ambitious of the themed arts binges put together by the Barbican.
This has also touched a nerve in sponsors. If the Wigmore offered novelty,
the Festival has sold itself on artistic over-drive. Its sponsorship target
was Pounds 200,000 (to match an equivalent sum from the City of London). In
the event it has brought in over Pounds 400,000, in cash and kind, two
thirds of it from Scandinavian companies.
Baroness O'Caithin, director of the Barbican, is seriously considering
giving back to the City the Pounds 200,000 surplus. It would demonstrate
good house-keeping. She might, however, wait until the financial balance
sheet on the Festival is complete before indulging in such a dramatic
gesture.
The Barbican set up a sponsorship committee headed by Sir Andrew Stark,
former British Ambassador to Denmark, to raise the cash and obvious names
like Carslberg, SAS, Finn Air, Statoil (the Norwegian state oil company) and
more rallied round, supplying, on top of cash, facilities like air tickets,
hotel accommodation and the paper to print the brochure.
                       *       *      *
Esso is a happy sponsor at the National Gallery. It was so pleased with the
response to its Art in the Making series of exhibitions that it has signed
up for a successor programme, Making and Meaning, which puts major NG works
in context. The first show is devoted to the recently restored Wilton
Triptych, and takes place next autumn. Then comes Michelangelo. Each will
cost Esso around Pounds 100,000.
The National Gallery has a new head of development in Bettina von Hase. She
inherited the Munch exhibition, which opens next week thanks to Pounds
250,000 from Norsk Hydro, but is seeking a backer with Pounds 200,000 to
support a show planned for April of paintings from the temporarily closed
art gallery in Lille. Also in the in-tray is the decorous search for six
more companies (14 are already signed up), prepared to pay Pounds 25,000 a
year to become a corporate benefactor and have after hours access to the
NG's collection.
In the longer term she must seek sponsors for a Pounds 10m renovation
package for the north wing of the National Gallery. It is only 20 years old
but needs repairs to its air conditioning as well as a more flexible hanging
space. The aim is to renovate all the NG's galleries in time for the
millennium.

Since the British are, as they never tire of confiding smugly to foreigners,
rather good at laughing at themselves, a series about the ghastliness of the
recession seemed a good idea. But it turns out, judging from the opening
episode, that Get Back (8.30 BBC1) is another sitcom devoted largely to
jokes about class and the horrors of living with your dreadful old dad,
subjects which you might have thought had been done to death in countless
previous series.
BBC2 launches a series billed by Radio Times as 'Vintner's Tales' which is
presumably called Vintners' Tales since it comprises six programmes about
different characters in the British wine trade. Presented by the likeably
enthusiastic Jancis Robinson, it begins (8.50) with Stephen Browett and
Lindsay Hamilton, who sell Pounds 7m worth of fine wine a year.
Channel 4's current affairs series Cutting Edge investigates Glasgow's loan
sharks and follows the Trading Standards Officers who try to keep tabs on
them (9.00).
A Fate Worse Than Death? (11.15 BBC1) gives a national screening to a
regional programme about the ethics of sustaining patients in 'a persistent
vegetative state'.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Arts: Le Baruffe Chiozzotte - European Arts Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Giorgio Strehler's Piccolo Teatro of Milan has not been seen in London for
over 25 years and is here all too briefly now as part of the much
under-publicised European Arts Festival. Strehler's direction of Carlo
Goldoni's Le Baruffe Chiozzotte is pure pleasure, tinged perhaps with a
slight tear at the final curtain.
Goldoni was the man who put an end to the improvised Commedia dell'arte in
the 18th century by insisting that performances should have texts, not just
a rough scenario. Le Baruffe is not one of his best-known pieces, though a
programme note tells us that it was singled out by Goethe as being the work
of a master when he saw it in Venice in 1786. British audiences will know
him most for The Servant of Two Masters, but his output ran to some 200
works, each taking on average about eight days to write.
The genius here seems to belong largely to Strehler and his team, including
the musicians and the designer (Luciano Damiani) as well as the cast. While
the piece is played in Italian, the title has been translated into The
Chioggian Quarrels. 'Squabbles' might be more appropriate, for these Italian
fights calm down as quickly as they flare up.
Chioggia is the fishing port near Venice: the women wait for the fishermen
to return and wonder about who will marry whom. When the boat comes in, the
fighting starts. All is resolved in the end, however, by referring the
disputes to the local assistant magistrate, Isidoro. The historical interest
is that this was the post in Chioggia held by Goldoni before his
play-writing took off. Isidoro (Luciano Roman) is a wonderfully detached
figure who just watches in solitude when the wedding party takes place: that
is the cause for the final tear, plus the fact that the performance has been
so perfect.
The joy lies in the depiction of the fishing village. Some times there is
ensemble playing, as when the women do their weaving and await the men. At
others an individual stands out, as when one of the men loses his temper.
Strehler has a marvellous way of producing caricatures who are not
stereotypes: for example, the magistrate's aged clerk who proceeds at his
own slow pace, regardless of events, or the old fisherman, Padron Toni, who
can hardly speak but to whom everyone tries to listen. An entire village is
here with a cast of little more than a dozen: note the emergence of the
children who initially are heard not seen.
There is magnificent use of the Lyttelton Theatre's space. Much of the stage
is bare, with the canal where the boat comes in in the background. That
leaves plenty of room for the squabbles. The two tall dark houses at the
sides have shutters which suddenly open to reveal the women. It is as if the
whole place had eyes. As Strehler has a passion for Shakespeare, it would be
a treat to see what this company would do with Romeo and Juliet.
I should add that there is a touch of Marxism: you can be forgiven for
thinking of Brecht, though Brecht at his best. Strehler is a socialist
director, stressing his feelings for the poor, and if one wanted to be
slightly unkind, one could say that is designer socialism par excellence. I
mean that as a compliment. The chief memory is of the sheer delight the
Italians take in their language and in every detail of the playing. This is
a spoken opera.
Lyttelton Theatre. (071) 928 2252. Ends today.

FT  02 NOV 92 / People: Evans reshuffles British Gas managers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Evans, British Gas chairman, has unveiled a wide-ranging shake-up of
the company's management, three months after he split the roles of chairman
and chief executive and appointed Cedric Brown to the latter position.
Evans says the changes were a natural consequence of Brown's move to chief
executive, and adds that they are aimed at introducing more effective and
up-to-date management structures.
'A clear separation of strategy and implementation is being introduced,
where the corporate centre provides the strategic direction of the company,
with responsibility for implementation being devolved as far down the line
as possible,' he says. BG explains that the changes would allow the central
bureaucracy to be reduced, with more responsibility passing to the heads of
individual business units.
Norman Blacker (left) moves from managing director of regional services to
become managing director, gas business, responsible for BG's gas business in
the UK. Ron Probert, the current managing director of gas supply and
strategy, becomes managing director, business development, responsible for
planning, construction, research and technology. He is also expected to keep
his responsibility for overseeing BG's response to the Monopolies and
Mergers Committee inquiry into the UK gas market. Probert announced his
intention to retire from BG's board in June 1993 when the MMC inquiry ends.
Russell Herbert (right), managing director, corporate services, is appointed
a BG director and becomes managing director of Global Gas, the international
gas supply and services division.
George Langshaw moves from his post at the head of Global Gas to become
managing director of UK regions.
Arthur Dove becomes managing director, regional services, while Dennis
Cottrell is appointed to the new post of director of corporate resources.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 100m motorway developments
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Construction giant TARMAC has been given a Pounds 100m boost by the
Department of Transport with a clutch of key motorway contracts.
The two largest contracts - worth almost Pounds 80m - call for the widening
of busy stretches of the M6 in Cheshire and London's M25. The Pounds 52.5m
contract on the M6 includes the construction of a viaduct - almost a mile in
length - alongside the Thelwall Viaduct, crossing the Manchester Ship Canal
and the River Mersey.
Six miles of the M6 will be widened from three to four lanes on the
approaches to the viaduct between the M56 and M62 interchanges. Nine bridges
will also be built over or under the motorway and a bridge over a railway
line will be widened. Work begins later this year and the project will take
3 1/2 years to complete.
One of Europe's most congested stretches of road - the five miles of the M25
between the M4 and M40 junctions close to Heathrow airport - is to be
widened from three to four lanes. Work on the Pounds 24.5m contract will
start early next year and it is expected to take about 12 months to
complete.
Widening will be kept within the existing M25 boundaries by converting the
hard shoulders to traffic lanes and building new hard shoulders.
Tarmac has also clinched a Pounds 2.5m contract for repairs and maintenance
on the M3 motorway between junctions 4 and 5 near Fleet in Hampshire.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The tunnelling company of TRAFALGAR HOUSE CONSTRUCTION has been awarded a
subcontract to design and construct an undersea tunnel to carry an outfall
for South West Water's Penzance and St Ives sewerage and sewage treatment
scheme, phase 1, which is worth about Pounds 60m.
The 2.6km rock tunnel will run from Gwithian on Cornwall's north coast to
outside St Ives bay. The tunnelling contract also includes the installation
of four diffusers at the seaward end of the tunnel.
Treated waste water will reach the tunnel outfall through a new 8km pipe
between Hayle and Gwithian. Work on sinking the tunnel shaft has commenced
and construction is scheduled for completion in late 1994.
The tunnel is an important element of the Penzance and St Ives scheme which
is being constructed by the Trafalgar House Water Projects Consortium,
comprising Trafalgar House Construction and John Brown Engineering.
The scheme involves diverting crude sewage outfalls in the Penzance area and
redirecting the flows to Hayle for treatment prior to discharge through the
tunnel outfall.

A project management contract has been awarded to the P&amp;O Group company
BOVIS INTERNACIONAL DE ESPANA for a Pounds 100m extension programme at
Spain's Palma de Mallorca Airport.
The 36-month first phase includes the construction of a 200,000 sq metre
terminal building, 40,000 sq metres of aircraft concourse and boarding
gates, together with associated car parking, access routes and landscaping.
Palma de Mallorca is Spain's second busiest airport and the expansion
programme is needed to cope with the rapid increase in both international
and domestic traffic anticipated over the next decade and beyond.
Engineered by the Spanish company Initec, the new terminal building will be
six storeys high. The ground floor will accommodate the arrivals hall,
arrivals concourse and baggage handling areas, together with parking for 154
coaches, 56 micro buses, taxis and private cars.
Level 2 is intended primarily for services and baggage handling. The
departures concourse is to be located on level 3, together with the check-in
area. At this level there will also be parking for 40 coaches, as well as
parking for taxis and private cars.
The departures lounge and restaurant facilities will be located on level 4,
together with extensive retail and duty free shops. Levels 5 and 6 will be
used for office accommodation and services.
The boarding gates and two existing terminal buildings will be reached from
the new terminal by way of high level access 'fingers'.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Construction Contracts: Completing Brighton bypass
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TAYLOR WOODROW CIVIL ENGINEERING has started work on the final stage of the
A27 Brighton and Hove bypass.
The Pounds 19.5m contract covers the 4.3km section between Hangleton in East
Sussex and Kingston, West Sussex.
A substantial part of the 30-month project involves a 490 metre twin-bored
tunnel beneath Southwick Hill. The contract also requires construction of an
interchange to link the dual two-lane carriageway with the Shoreham bypass
at Kingston. Roadworks leading to the complex will be linked with access
routes to the bypass.
To carry out the tunnelling work as rapidly and cost-effectively as
possible, Taylor Woodrow Civil Engineering will be using the New Austrian
Tunnelling Method, which relies on quick-setting sprayed concrete instead of
precast concrete or iron segments for initial ground support.
Work will go on underground round the clock in order to complete the twin
bores by next summer, when the tunnel will be used to transfer up to 400,000
cu metres of excavated chalk from the eastern side of the road job to the
western side for landfill purposes before winter sets in, reducing
disruption to local traffic.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Economics: Focus on the US election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIG event this week is the US presidential election tomorrow. Whoever
wins will inherit a fragile economy as a number of indicators this week are
likely to confirm.
October's non-farm payrolls should be relatively free of the temporary
distortions that have affected the data since June, including the temporary
Federal jobs programme designed to create 300,000 jobs. The forecast is that
25,000 jobs were created in October, mainly in the service sector.
This is 'minute by comparison with typical emerging recoveries,' say
economists at Greenwell Montagu.
This is also an important week for Germany where the economy looks to be
heading for a recession. Business confidence has fallen sharply while
consumer confidence is at an all-time low. After a surprisingly big bounce
back in industrial production in August, data for October is expected to
confirm the picture of a declining economy.
Sluggish activity will also be reflected in the employment figures. Many
economists believe short-time working is being converted increasingly into
full unemployment. This will have been exacerbated by the squeeze on export
sales resulting from a strong D-Mark. In August west German unemployment
rose by 20,000. A repeat performance is expected for September.
Other economic highlights follow. The medians of economists' forecasts, from
MMS International, a financial information company, appear in brackets.
Today: US, October NAPM index (49.8 per cent), September construction
spending (up 0.5 per cent); Canada, August leading indicators (up 0.1 per
cent); Japan, October forex reserves, trade balance first 20 days October.
cent).
Tomorrow: US, presidential and congressional elections, Treasury announced
quarterly refunding package, September leading indicators (down 0.1 per
cent), Q3 productivity, Johnson Redbook October 31; UK, October official
reserves (down Dollars 2bn);
Wednesday: UK, Maastricht debate in parliament; US, Federal Reserve releases
Tan book for November 17 FOMC meeting, September factory orders (flat),
September factory shipments, car sales October 21-31 (6.3m); Canada, October
foreign reserves, October Help Wanted index (64); Japan, September current
account, September trade balance.
Thursday: US, initial claims week ended October 24 (380,000), state benefits
week ended October 17, money supply data for week ended October 26.
Friday: US, October non-farm payrolls (up 25,000), supplementary summer
youth programme (down 40,000), October manufacturing payrolls (down 5,000),
October average workingweek, October civilian unemployment rate (7.6 per
cent); Canada, October employment growth (up 0.1 per cent), October
unemployment rate (11.4 per cent).
During the week: Germany, September industrial production (down 0.8 per
cent), September manufacturing output (down 0.8 per cent), September
manufacturing orders (down 0.6 per cent), September trade balance (DM3.5bn
surplus), September current account (DM2.8bn deficit).

RESULTS DUE
J. Sainsbury, which earlier this year wrested the crown from Marks and
Spencer as the UK's most profitable retailer, is likely to present an
encouraging set of numbers when it reports its interim results on Wednesday.
Analysts suggest that Sainsbury's will be able to stretch its profits by
about 16 per cent to Pounds 380m even though the food retailing market has
proved to be somewhat sticky of late.
Added interest will stem from the fact that this set of results will be the
first to be presented by Mr David Sainsbury, who will have succeeded his
cousin, Lord Sainsbury, as chairman earlier in the week.
Associated British Foods, reporting its preliminary full-year results today
, will highlight again the value of its purchase of British Sugar. With
milling and baking profits under great pressure despite ABF's 30 per cent
share of the bread market, sugar will have contributed about half of the
group's profits. Despite that profits are likely to be down sharply from
Pounds 332m the year before to around Pounds 290-Pounds 300m.
British Petroleum, the UK oil group, announces its third-quarter results on
Thursday. Although its shares have outperformed the UK market since their
fall following the halving of the dividend in August, analysts say it is too
early for any of the strategy changes and cost-cutting measures announced
then by BP to be reflected in the results.
Forecasts for net income on a replacement cost basis range from Pounds 100m
to Pounds 170m, but most are between Pounds 100m and Pounds 120m, little
changed from Pounds 107m before the Pounds 1bn of exceptional items in the
second quarter of this year or, from Pounds 129m in the third quarter of
last year.
Unilever will continue its stately progress on Friday. Third quarter profits
are likely to be around Pounds 580m (Pounds 525m) for a nine-months total of
Pounds 1.48bn (Pounds 1.39bn), despite adverse currency translation.
Wm Low, reporting full-year results on Thursday, is one supermarket chain
which has lost its way. After the Scottish group warned a few months ago
that its operating margins were 'below expectations', analysts cut their
forecast. They are now looking for about Pounds 20m pre-tax against Pounds
23.6m a year earlier.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Management: The proud cleaners of Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Owen, a private school headmaster, last week asked us to imagine a
future Europe in which uneducated young Britons were the waiters, porters,
cleaners and lavatory attendants.
Owen, headmaster of Rushmoor School, Bedford, and chairman of the
Independent Schools Association, is an optimist.
There are few signs so far of continental European cities using the British
to do their cleaning. The traffic has been the other way. Onyx, a French
company, has won 5 per cent of the UK's refuse collection and
street-cleaning contracts.
As for waiters, a survey published last week by the British Tourist
Authority shows that only a third of UK tourist businesses are fully able to
serve foreign visitors in their own languages, with restaurants prominent
among the monoglots.
The headlines do not do full justice to Owen's speech to the schools
association's conference in Rouen, France. It is a wide-ranging,
common-sense look at Britain's failure to give its children the skills they
need.
But while pleading for an escape from some traditional British attitudes, he
appears imprisoned by at least two others. The first is that there is
something demeaning about bringing people their food, cleaning up after them
or carrying their luggage to their rooms. The second is that these are jobs
for the uneducated.
In some continental countries, waiting on tables is seen as a job for
professionals. Waiters and porters are expected to speak languages other
than their own. Street-cleaning is an increasingly mechanised and
sophisticated business.
The waiters, porters and cleaners of the future will be those able to
benefit from Owen's dream of a better-educated Britain. Our worry about the
rest is that they will make their livings from burglary, car theft and dope
dealing, rather than the honourable occupations Owen apparently contemplates
with such horror.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Engineer body urges bolder reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERIM proposals for unifying the engineering profession have been
criticised by one of the big three institutions for being 'insufficiently
bold and imaginative' as the debate over the profession's future moves into
a crucial phase.
The Institution of Mechanical Engineers, which has 78,000 members, was
responding to interim proposals announced in August by a steering group set
up after Sir John Fairclough, chairman of the Engineering Council, launched
a personal initiative to reform and unify the profession.
The reform programme has created widespread interest, as many engineers feel
the current structure, with the Engineering Council as an umbrella body for
44 professional institutions, has failed to revitalise the profession or
adequately represent their views.
The steering group proposed a structure based on 'colleges' elected by
members, which would sit between the institutions and a new top body
appointed by the colleges. Alternatively, it proposed a directly elected top
body.
Now the institution says that, while it supports the need for unification,
including the present initiative, it is disappointed by the reform
proposals. They 'lack a clear vision statement' and go into too much detail.
The institution's stance underlines the difficulties faced by the steering
group in reconciling differing views on the future of the profession. The
big institutions are keen to preserve their influence and the institution
says it cannot envisage a workable structure where all the present
institutions are given more or less equal influence.
Yesterday Sir John said he was encouraged by the institution's call for a
bold approach. He noted that Professor Duncan Dowson, institution president,
was also a member of the steering group.
The institutions have been given until November 10 to respond to the
proposals. Sir John said the shape of final proposals would probably be
determined by discussions over the next two months.

<TEXT>
NEARLY ONE in three people would like to move to the countryside, rejecting
city life as dirty and stressful.
The possibility of a migration into rural Britain is highlighted in a Mintel
survey examining social and economic differences across regional divides. It
says 17 per cent of those under 35 in the top socio-economic groups (ABC1)
plan to move to rural areas in the next five years.
Greater London and south-east England experienced a net loss of 83,000
people in 1989 while Wales, south-west England and Scotland registered net
gains of 41,000. Net losses of more than 500,000 are forecast for London and
the south-east by the turn of the century.
Mintel questioned 1,000 adults on a range of socio-economic issues. The
survey's other findings include:
Northerners are the most avid bargain-hunters, searching for sales and
special offers. They are less likely to shop at a single supermarket,
whereas southerners prefer one-stop shopping.
Do-it-yourself enthusiasts are most common in Yorkshire and north-east
England.
Non-package overseas holidays, independently booked, are most popular with
southerners. Yorkshire and north-east holidaymakers are more likely to
return to familiar spots.

FT  02 NOV 92 / What future for Coal?: French lessons for the mining
industry - One approach to pit closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government could look for useful lessons on its programme of pit
closures in the slow programme of euthanasia being administered by France to
its state-owned coalmines.
Since the early 1960s France has lost 200,000 coal jobs - 35,000 of them in
the past eight years - without creating a revolution.
Two years ago, the last mine in the northern region of Nord Pas de Calais,
historically the heart of the French coal industry, closed without a public
murmur. Most of the remaining 17,000 jobs and all the remaining mines, in
Lorraine on the Belgian and German borders and in Centre-Midi, southern
France, will go by 2005. All that will remain by then will be a handful of
coal-related businesses that still have a commercial future, such as the
dozen engineering groups, construction businesses and compressed coalbrick
makers now left in Nord Pas de Calais.
Pit closures were greeted with misery and violence, but nothing on the scale
of the demonstrations in central London last weekend or the 1984-85 national
coal strike faced by the government of the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher.
France's tradition of long-term planning has allowed it to bleed the
industry to death in measured drops over the years, so that the drowsy
victim has hardly felt a twinge. Former miners have also been anaesthetised
by generous state compensation, and a total of FFr4.5bn (Pounds 530m) a year
in pensions, housing and heating that will continue to be paid to their
widows after they die.
On top of that, Charbonnages de France the national coal board, receives
FFr2.4bn a year in production aid to keep the surviving pits going until
their closure deadline.
The regions affected have also been handsomely compensated. A fifth of the
state's total budget for local economic development has, for example, gone
to Lorraine alone over the past five years, for spending on roads, business
parks and job-creation schemes.
However, France's long-term planning for coal has not been quite as smooth
as it looks. As in the UK, there have been changes of heart over whether the
coal industry should be allowed to die, merely shrink or be revived. Yet in
the end, successive French governments could not ignore the fact that high
mining costs and the country's relatively low-grade coal could never compete
in the long term with cheaper high-grade imports from the US - France's
biggest coal supplier - and Australia and Germany.
The first decision to run down the French coal industry dates from the mid
1960s, but went through a reversal when the 1973 oil price shock momentarily
made domestic coal look competitive again. Closures resumed in the early
1970s, when France launched what was to become Europe's most ambitious
nuclear power programme, which now supplies three quarters of the nation's
electricity.
Another quick U-turn took place when the Socialists came to power in 1981
and ordered coal output to rise by a third by the end of the decade, only to
revert to the closures in 1984, under the pressures of falling prices of
coal and oil imports. The new government had in any case abandoned its early
experiment with go-it-alone economic expansion and changed to the budgetary
rigour it has followed since.
Being able to plan job losses over the long term has enabled the French coal
board to avoid redundancies since the closures got under way again in 1984,
says Mr Francis Asseman, its secretary-general. Most of the job losses since
then have been achieved by early or natural retirement, plus a freeze in
recruitment.
That is not the whole story, however. France's treatment of its ex-miners is
generous even by the standards of their colleagues in other troubled
industries such as agriculture, cars or steel. That is partly due to the
sheer weight of the coal industry, but also because the government
recognises that miners, by the nature of their jobs, find it less easy to
adapt to other work.
Electricite de France, the electricity board, for example, has an agreement
to employ a quota of ex-miners, while those who want to work in other
industries qualify for a grant of up to FFr300,000, plus free training. The
French coal board also helps former miners look for new jobs and pays their
salaries for a two-month trial with new employers.
Foreign companies are one of the main sources of new jobs, attracted to Nord
Pas de Calais and Lorraine by generous regional aid, low labour costs and
the good communications in those regions.
On top of that, there is a small venture-capital fund, Sofirem, launched in
1967, which invests roughly FFr100m a year in business start-ups or the
expansion of existing companies. It has a FFr1bn portfolio of small-business
equity stakes and also helps potential entrepreneurs to present their cases
to bank lenders. Sofirem works closely with FIBM, an industrialisation fund
run by the coal board, which subsidises the creation of business parks and
factories and the acquisition of machinery. Some of FIBM's clients are also
funded by Sofirem.
Mr Richard Muller, head of industrialisation for the Houilleres (coalfields)
du Bassin de Lorraine, reckons that the system costs the public purse about
FFr100,000 for each job created and that the failure rate of Sofirem-helped
businesses is about 15 per cent. He observes: 'On an international
comparison, we think that is pretty reasonable.'

FT  02 NOV 92 / Subsidy sought for waste projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES that generate power from waste are lobbying the Department of
Trade and Industry to grant them a subsidy from the Pounds 1.2bn 'nuclear
levy'.
Four of the UK's biggest waste-to-energy companies last week formed a lobby
group. They are anxious that renewable energy sources should not be
overlooked in the government's energy review.
The Pounds 1.2bn 'nuclear levy', or non-fossil-fuel obligation, is an 11 per
cent tax on electricity generated from oil, gas and coal. It is supposed to
subsidise higher-cost power projects using alternative fuel sources but more
than 90 per cent goes to the nuclear industry.
Two grants have been made for renewable-energy projects but waste-to-energy
companies are pressing for more to enable them to take advantage of changes
in waste management next year.
Local authorities have to contract out many of their waste-management
functions by April 1, giving generators an important opportunity to sign
waste-to-energy contracts.
The generators warn, however, that a subsidy of about Pounds 100m will be
required to enable the projects to operate economically.
Mr Malcolm Chilton, managing director of Mass Energy, a joint venture
between Midlands Electricity and US group American Ref-fuel, said his
company was preparing to bid for contracts with three or four local
authorities. There were more than 20 other projects being discussed around
the UK, but without a subsidy none would be economic.
Between 90 per cent and 95 per cent of the UK's annual household waste of
30m tonnes is disposed of in landfill sites, with only 5 per cent recycled.
Waste-to-energy supporters say modern incinerators produce lower emissions
than decomposing waste, which can contaminate groundwater.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Gas power curb 'threatens thousands of jobs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than Pounds 2bn of investment in the North Sea and thousands of related
jobs might be jeopardised if the government tries to cancel contracts for
gas-fired power stations or force generators to use more coal, a report
warns today.
The latest North Sea Report from County NatWest WoodMac's oil services
consultancy, which includes a detailed analysis of the 'dash for gas',
emphasises that the government has limited room for manoeuvre in its
forthcoming energy review. It warns that the review has come 'three years
too late'.
Several new gas developments rely on power-generating contracts and might
have to be cancelled if the contracts are not fulfilled, the report says.
That has important implications for gas producers, for thousands of jobs in
the offshore construction and services industry, and for producers'
confidence in the North Sea as an investment area.
The consultancy says that 16 gas-fired stations have secured contracts for
gas supplies and obtained government consent. With a total generating
capacity of 9,800 megawatts, they are likely to play a significant part in
basic electricity generation in the UK by 1995.
A further three power stations, with a total capacity of 4,200MW, have
secured gas supplies but not government consent. They may not now be given
consent after the opposition to the government's plans to close coal mines.
One of them is the plant at Connah's Quay, Clwyd, owned by PowerGen, the
privatised electricity generator. It is due to receive gas from the Hamilton
and Hamilton North fields in the Irish Sea. The cancellation of the Pounds
400m-Pounds 500m plant would also throw into question the Pounds 500m
development of the Hamilton fields.
North Sea fields whose economics depend largely on gas-fired generating
projects are Caister, Everest/ Lomond, Lancelot/Guinevere/ Excalibur, Orwell
and Pickerill.
The government may force generators to use more coal. Professor Stephen
Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, is also carrying out an
investigation into gas generation contracts to ensure that regional
electricity companies are buying the cheapest power.
If those moves affect the amount of gas that can be taken by gas-fired power
stations, the report warns, that might either make the fields uneconomic to
develop or force producers to put gas prices up to a level that would make
gas-fired power uncompetitive. Generators might then have to default on
their contracts.

FT  02 NOV 92 / SIB reviews rules for life policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECURITIES and Invest-ments Board has decided to review its
controversial disclosure rules for the sale of life insurance products.
The move is certain to anger the life insurance industry. It reflects
widespread criticism from consumer groups and the SIB's expectation that the
Office of Fair Trading will reject key elements of the disclosure rules as
anti-competitive.
The disclosure rules, announced in May after consultation with the industry
and consumer groups, will not take effect until the OFT has determined that
they sufficiently promote competition. In December 1990 the OFT said a
previous set of disclosure rules did not meet that objective and asked the
SIB to reconsider.
Mr Andrew Large, the SIB's chairman, is said to have privately expressed
concern that the present rules, agreed last May under Sir David Walker, his
predecessor, still fail to protect the public adequately from high-pressure
sales tactics.
In particular, the OFT is expected to challenge the SIB's decision not to
require sales agents to disclose their commissions to prospective customers.
It will also challenge the basis for illustrations of prospective charges
and investment returns.
The SIB will announce later today that it has retained Mr Tim Miller,
formerly marketing director at M&amp;G Group, the unit trust company, as a
consultant. Mr Miller's role will be to examine whether the present rules
ensure that the public is not sold unsuitable products.
Mr Miller, a long-time critic of life insurance sales tactics, resigned
earlier this year from the board of Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the
industry, over its support for the SIB disclosure regime.
He objected in particular to allowing companies to show prospective
customers industry-wide averages of costs, rather than showing their own
projected costs.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Venture fund set up for east Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VENTURE capital fund has been launched to provide cash, usually in the
form of share capital, for small businesses in the east Midlands.
The Midland Enterprise Fund for the East Midlands is the second of a series
designed to cover the UK, region by region. The first was set up in the
Yorkshire region. The third, for East Anglia, will be announced in January
and the fourth, for the south-east, in February. The main commercial
investor is Midland Bank.
The funds are designed to provide sums of between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds
125,000. That area of the venture-capital market has generally been ignored
by the established funds because the cost of appraising a business has not
justified the provision of capital in such small doses.
Mr Kevin Caley, managing director of the east Midlands fund, said: 'This is
the first time anybody has attempted to make commercial investments at this
sort of level.'

FT  02 NOV 92 / Pound's fall gives industry scant aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE devaluation of sterling has given only a slight boost to manufacturers,
according to the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply. It says the
outlook for the sector remains gloomy.
According to its monthly poll of purchasing managers in manufacturing, new
orders last month showed little increase on September.
The pessimistic tone is echoed in a broader assessment of the economy by
Oxford Economic Forecasting, a consultancy, which says prospects for growth
have worsened.
Oxford Economic Forecasting said gross domestic product was likely to grow
by only 0.8 per cent next year after a fall of 0.9 per cent this year.
In the manufacturing sector, according to the institute's survey, sentiment
remains depressed, even though an 'activity index' based on the results
showed a slight rise.
The index, built up from an average of variables in the poll including
intentions about increasing output and hiring or sacking people, stood last
month at 47.7, up from 45.1 in September. Consumers last month registered a
rise in intentions to purchase goods and services over the next six months,
according to Verdict Research, a consultancy specialising in retailing. It
says the rise may be linked to seasonal changes ahead of Christmas.
Kwik Save, the discount grocery chain, has become the third most popular
food retailer after J. Sainsbury and Tesco, according to Audits of Great
Britain, the research company. It was in fifth place 20 months ago.

FT  02 NOV 92 / 'Men's club' still proves exclusive: The difficulties women
face in reaching the top in management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MRS Sara Morrison, a long-standing board member of General Electric
Company and one of the participants in the Institute of Management survey on
female managers published today, advance notice of the report's findings
have made depressing reading.
'I'm surprised so many of the old barriers still loom so large,' she says,
referring to the main conclusion that the single biggest obstacle seen by
women to female progress at work was the continued existence of the 'men's
club' network. Prejudice by colleagues was the second most commonly
experienced barrier.
The results do not match her personal experience, she says, expressing her
astonishment that many of the attitudes described in the report had not died
out in the 1950s. 'But it's jolly difficult to argue against the findings,
given the number of people in the survey,' she says. The fact that 51 per
cent of the nation's brainpower is not being properly exploited is bad news
for women, but 'much more serious, it's bad news for UK Limited'.
Later this month, Opportunity 2000, the employer-led initiative that covers
more than 20 per cent of the workforce, will report on its first year of
operation. It will be interesting to note whether organisations have made
any headway in the past 12 months in tackling fundamental prejudices, or
whether they have stuck principally to improving the more obvious practical
conditions surrounding, for example, career breaks and part-time working in
junior grades.
There is a danger, the institute points out, that 'focusing on tangible ways
of allowing women to combine a family with a traditional management role
obscures the real debate'. It adds: 'If creche facilities and flexible
working are the whole answer, why do so many women still fall behind their
male counterparts at the early stages of a management career - even before
they have family responsibilities?'
Prejudice among colleagues is not restricted to men, the report discloses.
While 18 per cent of men in the survey said they would, or did, find it
difficult to work for a woman, 12 per cent of women made the same
confession. Only two thirds of women felt they received adequate respect
from male superiors, and the figure remained well under three quarters even
when it came to getting respect from female superiors. Some women observed
what has sometimes been described as the 'queen bee' syndrome. Said one:
'Women who make it to the top do not help or mentor others to do likewise.'
For one senior woman in the City, Ms Anne McMeehan, managing director of
Framlington Unit Management, respect is gained, regardless of sex, if
'you're clearly good at your job, provided you're not dealing with blinkered
or bigoted individuals'. Does she ever come across such individuals? 'Yes,
but of both sexes,' she says.
Women could also be their own worst enemies because they often undervalue
themselves, according to Ms Kathleen Wood, headteacher of Pimlico
Comprehensive School, London and a participant in the survey.
'At interviews you still do see women who feel the need to justify their
ability to run a home and a career,' she says. They emphasise that they have
the agreement of their partners in applying for the job. 'You wouldn't hear
men say that,' she says. By endlessly justifying themselves, such women end
up 'raising doubts in people's minds'.
Perhaps the most thought-provoking of the report's findings is that female
managers are significantly less likely than their male counterparts to be
married or have children and are more likely to be divorced. Ninety-two per
cent of the men in the sample were married while 32 per cent of the women
were unmarried. The reasons for the findings were not explored in the
questionnaire. It is possible, the report observes, that some women had made
a deliberate choice at an early stage, and that that choice had in itself
made it easier for them to follow a management career. It is also possible
that, faced with the practical difficulties of combining the two, many have
elected for a career over children. The institute says: 'If the choice is a
deliberate one for many, the findings seem to show that in the current
cor-porate climate women are justified in making it if they do want to reach
the top. Of the women managers who have had children, half say that caring
has adversely affected their career. Similarly, 39 per cent of those who had
taken a break to care for children had returned to work at a lower level.'
However, the report concludes that a deliberate choice of career or family -
a dilemma not presented to men - 'is not a realistic or sustainable solution
for the majority of women looking for a career in management'.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Leasehold reform under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is under intense pressure to improve landlords' rights by
amending its legislation giving private-sector tenants the right to buy the
properties in which they live.
The measure returns to the Commons for debate tomorrow and while few believe
there is any chance of the leasehold reforms being dropped altogether,
several Tory MPs are supporting landlords' efforts to narrow the criteria by
which tenants acquire the right to purchase their properties.
They are also determined to raise the level of compensation paid to owners
to reflect more accurately the market value of the asset they are being
forced to surrender.
The controversy over the leasehold provisions in the Housing and Urban
Development Bill first centred on the very notion that a Conservative
government would consider undermining property rights. But in spite of
fierce opposition from such groups as the Duke of Westminster's Grosvenor
Estates Holdings, many Tory MPs pushed successfully to have leasehold reform
included in the party's general-election manifesto.
Backed by a strong lobby of Tory-voting tenants - pre-dominantly in London
and south-east England - they argued that it was unacceptable for council
tenants to have a right to buy their homes while denying them to those
living in properties leased from private owners.
Under pressure from objectors, the government has shelved its commitment
made in July last year to create a new 'commonhold' ownership category
whereby groups of tenants would own a joint share of a building's common
parts.
Tory backbenchers are pressing for changes in the bill that would further
restrict the numbers of tenants to whom the law would apply - thought to be
about 750,000.
One proposal is that the bill should be altered to ensure that only those
who can establish that their leasehold property is their primary residence
should be entitled to buy out their landlords.
Another change sought by the landlords' lobby centres on the 'marriage
value' derived from the combination of leaseholds with freeholds. Under the
present provisions, that sum would be, in effect, divided equally by
purchasing tenant and vendor landlord.
Opponents say that as the landlord is being obliged to sell he should
receive nothing less than the whole sum to compensate him fully for his
loss.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Branson seeks apology over tax allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAWYERS for Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group asked for retractions and
apologies yesterday over an article in Business Age magazine published
today.
The magazine said Mr Branson had used family trusts to avoid paying capital
gains tax on Pounds 229m from the sale of the Virgin music group to Thorn
EMI earlier this year - which is perfectly legal.
The magazine said that out of the total Pounds 510m sale price of Virgin
music, Mr Branson had received Pounds 22.4m from his 4.4 per cent personal
stake - which would lead to a capital gains tax liability of Pounds 8.8m.
The magazine said that Branson family trusts had shown a total gain of
Pounds 229.3m and that as a result Pounds 92.1m in capital gains tax was
saved.
In other articles, the magazine raised the general issue of offshore trusts
and the billions of pounds it says is lost to the Inland Revenue as a
result.
Mr Branson said yesterday that the article was 'misleading, riddled with
inaccuracies and Virgin were never approached for a comment'. He added that
his personal stake was understated and that the capital gains tax on the
shares he owned was likely to be in excess of Pounds 20m.
'It is no secret that the trusts were set up before we took one of the
Virgin companies public in 1986, and financial journalists and shareholders
were fully informed of that fact,' Mr Branson said. Full capital gains tax
was paid, the company said, in relation to the setting up of the trusts.
Virgin said the proceeds of the sale to Thorn EMI were being used to build
up various Virgin holding companies rather than being paid to Mr Branson or
his family.
It added: 'If this policy of investment is as successful as it has been in
the past, the tax created should one day be very considerable indeed and
considerably more than if Richard Branson had pocketed the money
personally.'
The magazine said yesterday that it stuck to its story, which was a matter
of public record.
On the general issues of offshore funds and capital gains tax, the Revenue
has already taken steps to tighten up on taxpayers holding assets offshore,
but has not managed close all the loopholes.
The basic principle is that foreigners are not subject to tax when assets
are sold. That is designed in part to encourage as much investment from
overseas as possible. It also means that UK taxpayers with assets overseas
may be in a position to escape liabilities. Offshore trusts can hold assets
that can then be sold free of capital gains tax if the money remains
offshore.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Company support for wages councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY smaller companies support the retention of wages councils, according to
a survey by the independent IDS pay research group, Catherine Milton writes.
The Department of Employment has recently restated its view that the
councils, which set minimum pay for about 2.5m workers in low-paid
industries, have no permanent place in the labour market.
The IDS survey shows employers are 'deeply divided' over the councils. Many
smaller companies, and some large companies, say the annual increases are
useful for reviewing pay rates. The IDS says: 'Arguably wages councils
fulfil the role for which they were created - to protect small companies and
their workers from competition by undercutting wages.'

FT  02 NOV 92 / Council spending curb may be eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RELAXATION of the rules that stop local authorities spending receipts from
council-house sales is being considered by the government as a central
element in the economic recovery programme promised for the Autumn
Statement.
Ministers also voiced confidence yesterday that an unconditional offer of
private finance by the administrators of the Canary Wharf development would
open the way for approval of London Underground's planned Jubilee Line
extension to Docklands.
The U-turn on capital receipts, which would push up public borrowing but
would not count against next year's Pounds 244.5bn public-expenditure
target, might help to defuse a threatened political backlash against deep
cuts in Whitehall spending programmes.
The Treasury is expected to accept at least a temporary relaxation of the
rules. Local authorities have more than Pounds 5bn in accumulated receipts
which they can use only to pay off debts. Release of a small proportion for
housing repair budgets and for house building by housing associations could
provide a significant boost for the construction industry.
But a cabinet negotiating session later today on overall spending priorities
is threatening to develop into a series of interdepartmental battles over
the proposed spending cuts.
The cabinet will be told that the squeeze might leave some households in
southern England facing a rise in their annual tax bills of Pounds 250 as a
result of the replacement of the poll tax with the council tax.
Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, will warn that the Treasury's
rejection of a more generous transitional relief scheme for the new tax
might leave many homeowners in the south with an increase of Pounds 100 a
year.
The proposed transitional scheme has yet to be worked out in detail. Mr
Howard is fiercely resisting a Treasury suggestion that any rebates should
be based on notional rather than actual bills.
The present arithmetic points to those in the top property band for the
council tax being forced to meet any rise in bills of up to Pounds 5 a week,
those in the middle band up to Pounds 2 a week and those in the lowest
Pounds 1 a week.
Other senior ministers, however, are likely to set Mr Howard's warnings of a
potential revolt on the Tory back benches against their concerns to defend
their own budgets.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, and Mr Peter Lilley, social
services secretary, are among those fighting cuts in their budgets.
Mrs Shephard faces a reduction in her training budget in spite of the sharp
rise in unemployment. Mr Lilley is threatened with a freeze on a number of
social security benefits.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, has been told she must accept a
cash reduction totalling hundreds of millions of pounds in her budget. Mr
John Patten, education secretary, is warning of large-scale redundancies
among teachers as a result of planned cuts in his budget.
Senior ministers remain divided about public-sector pay, with most arguing
for increases to be held to about 2 per cent or slightly less but some still
pressing for a freeze.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Treasury seeks to retain fiscal grip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY is already laying plans to ensure that it keeps tight control
of fiscal policy when the reformed budget system - combining government
decisions on taxation and on spending - is introduced in just over a year.
The department is pleased with the work of the new cabinet committee on
public spending, which includes heavyweights Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr
Kenneth Clarke. However it is adamant that the committee's role will not be
extended to fiscal policy, although the unified system will make the
trade-off between spending and revenue measures more explicit.
One minister said: 'There will be no committee enabling Mr Clarke and Mr
Heseltine to suggest tax changes.'
The change in timing, with the Budget statement made in early December
rather than mid-March, also means that increases in excise duties will no
longer be introduced with just a couple of hours' notice.
Ministers are aware that raising duties on alcohol just a few weeks before
Christmas would be politically inept. Instead, increases are likely to be
imposed from January.
Most tax changes will still come into effect on April 1, when, under the new
system, parliament will already have passed the finance bill.
The Treasury views with some anxiety the greater opportunity that this will
give MPs to force changes in the proposals, especially since the Tory
majority has been reduced so much - to 21 - since the idea was put forward
in the pre-election budget.
In spite of their determination not to allow departmental ministers into the
budget-making process, Treasury ministers still believe the new arrangements
will mean a loosening of the traditional secrecy surrounding the budget.
That is unless the government decides that it likes the idea of a chancellor
unable to deliver a speech at the annual party conference in October because
he is in pre-Budget 'purdah'.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Tory rebels firm on vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TORY rebel camp was holding surprisingly solid last night with 72 hours
to go before the critical vote the Maastricht treaty.
Questioning of rebels yesterday suggested that those who are determined not
to support the government might still number as many as 35, even after a
hard weekend's work by government whips.
Should that hard core vote against Mr John Major's paving motion on
Wednesday, the prime minister, would face an ignominious defeat. However, if
even a relatively small number were to abstain, the government would
probably scrape home.
The most heartening news for the rebels yesterday was a clear statement from
Mr Bill Cash, the arch-Euro-sceptic MP for Stafford, that he will be 'most
emphatically voting against' the government motion.
'I cannot see a redeeming feature in the treaty,' he said yesterday, adding
that he would support his party in a vote of confidence if the verdict went
against the government.
Mr Iain Duncan-Smith, Lord Tebbit's successor as MP for Chingford, was also
on the point of deciding to vote against the government, saying that he
would inform the whips today of his final decision.
'This is about the Maastricht treaty,' he said of the meticulously crafted
motion with which the government still hopes to bring enough potential
rebels back on board. 'Now is the time to vote against it. We will never get
another chance.'
In another shot in the arm for the rebels, Sir Gerard Vaughan, MP for
Reading East, made clear that he was still agonising over how to vote in
spite of telling the whips that the government would have his support.
'I may have to tell them that I have changed my mind,' he said, adding that
he did not think he would abstain.
In a more cheering development for the government, Mr James Pawsey, MP for
Rugby and Kenilworth, was one of a number of potential rebels to say they
had decided not to vote against the motion.

MOST UK companies believe adoption of the Maastricht treaty will be
beneficial to them, although few appear to understand precisely what is
involved, according to a survey for Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants and
management consultants.
The Mori survey of 131 companies found that 56 per cent thought adoption of
the treaty would benefit their companies while 13 per cent said it would be
detrimental. A further 27 per cent said it would have no effect and 5 per
cent had no opinion.
Mr Michael Gardiner, the Ernst &amp; Young partner in charge of European issues,
said that support for Maastricht from respondents 'appears to be based on a
positive attitude to Europe rather than an understanding of the detail'.
The Institute of Directors has urged the government to clarify what it sees
as the uncertainty created by the treaty. The IoD, which has 42,000 members,
has written to ministers and MPs saying there are at least 20 questions that
need to be answered.
They include the areas over which European Community member states will
retain competence and the extent to which governments will control economic
policy.
Mr Peter Morgan, IoD director-general, said: 'Since the (European exchange
rate mechanism) is in disarray, with many countries only hanging on by
imposing capital controls, while Germany seems unlikely to give up the
Deutsche Mark, what is the urgency for ratification?'
By contrast, the Confederation of British Industry said failure to ratify
the treaty would damage confidence.
Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, last week told the Conservative backbench
European committee: 'If the Maastricht treaty is not ratified, the UK runs
the risk of losing the benefits of the single market.'

FT  02 NOV 92 / Power of a postal route to rescue: Charles Leadbeater finds
Japanese strength against recession in an old savings method
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LOCAL post office in Tokyo's fashionable Harajuku district, tucked in a
narrow back-street, is as central a social institution in its community as
the collective bath-house opposite, which attracts a stream of people each
evening.
The office, overseen by the postmaster and a team of staff in sharp white
shirts, hums not so much with people posting mail as with those withdrawing
cash from its two automatic teller machines and depositing their savings.
The 23,000 tiny local post offices like that at Harajuku are the main way by
which most Japanese people save. Over the next few years, those savings will
play a vital role in attempts to prevent Japan slipping into full recession.
The chief risk of recession stems from the weakness of Japan's once mighty
banking industry, plagued with bad debts on real estate loans that turned
sour as the property market collapsed. The main hope of reviving the economy
is investments made by the postal savings system, Japan's fastest-growing
and strongest financial institution. With assets of Y138,500bn (Pounds
700bn), it is about three times as large as Japan's largest bank, DKB, which
has 390 branches.
Just as the local post offices are usually hidden away in back-streets, so
the role of the postal savings system in seeking to revive the economy will
not be obvious from government's accounts. This is how it will work.
The savings collected through the post offices are passed to the post and
telecommunications ministry, which then passes them to the trust fund bureau
of the finance ministry.
The money goes into the Fiscal Investment and Loan Programme, which funds
about 11 government banks and financial corporations to carry out investment
in infrastructure and industry. Also, the trust fund bureau uses the FILP to
buy government bonds, thereby financing government borrowing.
The FILP is worth about Y40,000bn a year, more than half the central
government spending budget of Y72,000bn. The finance ministry can use the
FILP as a shadow budget. It does not require scrutiny by parliament, so it
can respond swiftly to shifting political priorities, such as dealing with
the onset of recession.
This year, the FILP, rather than the official budget, will fund most of the
Y10,700bn emergency package to revive the stock and real estate markets,
announced by the government in August.
In April the programme's budget was set at Y40,802bn. After the emergency
measures are implemented, it should turn out at Y45,199bn - a 10.8 per cent
increase.
Public expenditure through the budget will be as originally planned, despite
a Y4,900 fall in tax revenues. The FILP is to make up a lot of the tax
shortfall. The government will borrow more by issuing an additional Y2,256bn
in construction bonds. These are mainly bought by the trust fund bureau,
which is mainly funded by the FILP.
Most of the rest of the money will come from reduced repayments on
government debt, most of which is owned by the postal savings system.
The FILP's expanding role is unlikely to end with this year's budget. There
will be a five-year moratorium on central government repayments of debts it
owes to the trust fund bureau, which in effect means the FILP. The
government may have to borrow more from the FILP if the economy does not
revive and pressure rises for tax cuts in 1993.
It is not new for postal savings to play a central role in Japan's economy.
Since its establishment in 1875, it has helped to fund Japan's defence
build-up before the second world war, its industrial modernisation in the
1950s and 1960s, and more recently has increased public investment in
housing and social infrastructure.
The system is more than twice as large as most of its European counterparts;
the US system was scrapped as anachronistic in 1966.
The Japanese postal system has increased its share of the savings market
through an impressive display of public sector innovation.
The number of post office automatic teller machines rose from 5,411 in 1986
to more than 15,000 last year. It has developed a portfolio of savings
products closely tailored to consumer needs.
The system is underpinned by strong cross-party support. Local postmasters,
highly respected figures in their local communities, have strong ties to the
ruling Liberal Democratic party, which often uses them as local recruiting
sergeants. The Social Democratic party has an equally powerful interest in
the system's expansion because the Zentei, the postal workers' union, is one
of its affiliates.
The investments have built up strong constituencies of support among
recipients in industry, small businesses and outlying regions which have
benefited from infrastructure spending.
A new departure is the role the system will play over the next few years,
with its strategic purpose the salvation of the Japanese financial system.
The Japanese banks have been highly critical of the advantages bestowed on
the postal savings system in the form of higher interest rates for savers
and much lower taxation than for bank saving. In the last few months, as
interest rates have come down, banks have been hit by a flight of deposits
to the postal system, which has been able to keep its rates higher. The
leading banks have constantly pressed the finance ministry to create a level
playing field by liberalising the postal system.
This poses a dilemma for the ministry. As supervisor of the banking system
it favours deregulation; as guardian of the national economic growth rate it
is used to drawing on postal savings at need.
The banks' ability to clear their rising bad loans will depend in large part
on whether the FILP's increased investments will revive the economy and
specifically the property market.
The private and public sides of Japan's finance industry will develop an
increasingly symbiotic relationship over the next few years. While the
finance ministry will remain publicly committed to financial liberalisation,
its actions to support the economy will rely on the strength of a highly
regulated public sector savings institution.
Thus the salvation of Japan's banks, which became more internationalised in
pursuit of their own modernisation over the last decade, could turn on an
entirely domestic network of tiny post offices with their roots in the 19th
century.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Case for wage subsidies in east Germany grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ABJECT failure of the international economic forecasting fraternity in
recent years has given economists a bad name. But the economic disaster in
east Germany provides a powerful retort to those who argue that economic
analysis has no predictive power. The collapse of the east German economy
was foreseeable and avoidable. But the warnings were ignored.
The 'desolate' state of the east German labour market, as described in last
week's bleak economic report from the five leading economic institutes, lies
at the root of the united Germany's growing fiscal and monetary and
political problems.
Yet this collapse was predicted long ago, most notably in the spring of 1991
by Mr George Akerlof and his colleagues at the University of California at
Berkeley (FT, 13.5.91). They argued that the pace of convergence of east
German wages to west German levels, given the poor state of east German
industrial productivity, would render 90 per cent of east Germany's
industrial capacity obsolete.
The subsequent path of events appears to support their analysis. Average
wages in the east rose by an average 38.3 per cent between 1988 and 1991 to
about 50 per cent of west German levels. The result has been to squeeze the
profits of existing industry while blunting the incentive for new investment
in east Germany. Producer prices have fallen by over a third since 1989,
raising the real wage faced by producers by 180 per cent. Measured in
dollars, wages in east Germany are at least three times higher than in other
former communist economies, as the chart shows.
Little wonder that east German output continues to collapse. Manufacturing
output in the eastern Lander was 3.6 per cent lower in August than a year
ago, while capital goods production was 16.1 per cent lower. Official
unemployment has risen to 14.6 per cent, while 'real unemployment' -
including people in job-creation schemes or re-training - is about a quarter
of the potential workforce.
The pains and the gains in the east have been unevenly shared. Mr Alan
Krueger and Mr Jorn-Steffen Pischke have examined the change in the
structure of wages and unemployment since unification.*
Not surprisingly, they find there was less wage inequality in the East
Germany before unification than in West Germany or the US. The top 10 per
cent of wage earners earned 142 per cent of the median wage in East Germany
in 1988, compared to the 173 per cent in West Germany and over 200 per cent
in the US.
Since unification, wage inequality has grown. Between 1990 and 1991, the
earnings of the top 10 per cent rose twice as fast as the average, raising
the wages of the top 10 per cent to 160 per cent of the median wage. But a
combination of union agreements and government unemployment subsidies has
prevented the wages of low paid workers from falling relative to the
average, as the upper chart shows.
Low wage workers have, in fact, had above-average wage growth, increasing
the wage of the bottom 10 per cent from 68 per cent to 70 per cent of the
median between 1988 and 1991, compared to 62 per cent in west Germany and 48
per cent in the US. This has meant a disproportionate squeeze on
labour-intensive industries, with unemployment falling hardest on the
low-skilled. The unemployment rate for university-educated east Germans was
6 per cent last year, compared to 33 per cent for people with a secondary
education.
Lower unemployment requires a fall in both the relative and the real wages
of unskilled workers. But the German government could reduce unemployment
and maintain the living standards of low-paid workers by subsidising their
employment rather than unemployment. A temporary wage subsidy would lower
the cost of labour for industry in the east, speed privatisation and
encourage new investment. The Berkeley economists' predictions were correct.
So was their policy advice.

FT  02 NOV 92 / US attacked over satellite launches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US government is putting unfair pressure on international satellite
operators to place launch contracts with Russia and China, the chairman of
Europe's Arianespace has claimed.
Mr Charles Bigot said Washington had 'political reasons' for pressing
Intelsat, the world's biggest independent operator of telecommunications
satellites, to consider such launches. Intelsat is an international
co-operative owned by 120 national telecommunications companies such as
privatised British Telecom and state-owned France Telecom.
In an interview Mr Bigot identified two main benefits for the US of
encouraging the flow of contracts to China and Russia. The US wanted to
improve political goodwill with these new business partners, and to dilute
competition to its own satellite launch companies, he said.
In the last decade Arianespace has overtaken US rivals and now dominates the
market.
Mr Bigot pointed to the US decision in September to allow the export of the
first US-built Intelsat satellite to China for launch in 1995.
This followed the US sale of F-16 fighter aircraft to Taiwan, to which China
had objected. Washington controls where US-made satellites are launched
through the granting of export licences.
Mr Bigot said Washington was using Comsat, the US official body with a 23
per cent stake in Intelsat, to press its case. Intelsat denied, however,
that Comsat exerted undue pressure. 'As an international organisation we
have an obligation to consider international bids,' it said.
Nevertheless, Comsat's legal staff acknowledged that the US State Department
'regularly takes a note of Comsat's position to ensure it is not
inconsistent with the US government's position.'
Further international launch contracts, worth up to Dollars 200m, are at
stake over the next few weeks as the governing board of Intelsat meets in
December and the board of Inmarsat, a parallel body that operates satellites
for mobile telecommunications, meets later this week.
China and Russia are challenging the established launch companies in the US
as well as Europe's Arianespace, despite their absence of a track record in
the commercial satellite business.
For Russia, an Intelsat contract would mean its entry into the lucrative
western commercial space market.
The row, which has been brewing for months, centres on the price of a
launch. China and Russia charge about Dollars 30m, compared with Dollars
60m-Dollars 100m for Arianespace or the US companies McDonnell-Douglas and
General Dynamics.

FT  02 NOV 92 / German unions warn on budget
</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES for negotiation of a 'solidarity pact' of wage restraint between the
German government and trade unions could be dashed by plans to cut social
spending next year, union leaders warned at the weekend.
The ruling coalition plans to cut several billion D-Marks from next year's
budget, including a freeze on social security payments, a cut of 25 per cent
in allowances for asylum seekers and rise in unemployment contributions.
Details of the spending package, due to be finalised on Wednesday, were
spelt out by Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister. He called for a three-year
pay pause for public sector workers, with wages tied to inflation, and a
postponement in student grant rises.
He said a freeze on social security payments could save DM2bn (Pounds 810m)
next year, while the cut in allowances for asylum-seekers would save a
further DM1bn. Linking public sector pay rises to inflation could save as
much as DM5bn in 1993 and DM10bn in 1994, for central government, the
federal states and local government combined.
As for subsidies to special industries - including agriculture, shipbuilding
and coal mining - Mr Waigel would say only that payments would be
investigated again before the 1993 budget was finalised.
Despite the savings, the government has accepted that next year's slower
economic growth will mean a DM6bn increase in the forecast central
government budget deficit.
Mrs Ursula Engelen-Kefer, deputy chairman of the DGB trade union federation,
said cuts in social spending would postpone a pact 'into the distant
future'.
The opposition Social Democrats (SPD), which Chancellor Helmut Kohl also
hopes to involve in a pact, also attacked the cuts.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Airline body seeks let-up on investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent and MICHAEL SKAPINKER

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Air Transport Association (Iata) is urging governments to
relax rigid foreign investment rules for airlines to encourage cross-border
mergers and alliances in the industry.
The organisation, which groups 210 international airlines, recommends in its
annual report to be published today that governments allow foreign investors
to acquire up to 49 per cent of the voting rights in their national
airlines. Competition law should override national transport policies.
This issue is at the centre of tense negotiations between the UK and the US
over British Airways' plan to acquire a 44 per cent stake with 21 per cent
of the voting rights in USAir for Dollars 750m (Pounds 460.1m).
The US is seeking greater access for US airlines into the UK market as a
condition for approving BA's investment in USAir. But the UK is only
prepared to grant this if the US in turn relaxes its foreign investment
rules for airlines.
The Iata recommendation comes at a time of consolidation and globalisation
in the airline industry which has been accelerated by deregulation and the
economic recession. Mr Gunter Eser, Iata's director-general, also warns that
despite a slow recovery the industry is heading for another big loss this
year of around Dollars 2bn.
Iata airlines lost Dollars 4bn on international scheduled services last year
after losing Dollars 2.7bn in 1990.
Mr Eser notes in the annual report that airline interest charges have
doubled since 1987 reflecting high interest rates and, above all, the very
high proportion of debt which airlines now carry on their balance sheets.
Iata is forecasting average annual growth of 5 per cent in international
passenger traffic between now and 1996 after a fall of 4.4 per cent last
year.
The International Federation of Tour Operators (Ifto) has warned that the
number of tourists visiting Greece next year could fall by 1m following the
introduction of a Pounds 16 airport departure tax, writes Michael Skapinker.
Mr Martin Brackenbury, president of Ifto which represents travel companies
in 17 countries, said the tax, which came into effect yesterday, could cost
Greece up to Pounds 500m annually in lost tourist revenues.

</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING differences in Italy's Socialist party, tainted by revelations of
corruption in its Milanese stronghold, emerged over the weekend with calls
for its leader, Mr Bettino Craxi, to step down.
In his toughest challenge to the leadership, Mr Claudio Martelli, the
Socialist minister of justice and a former protege of Mr Craxi's, said the
current leaders had become a liability and should step aside before a
national conference due later this month.
Mr Martelli, backed by more than 20 of the party's 73-strong directorate,
said the resignations would let the conference concentrate on reform and
improving the party's image. The leadership, for years the party's strongest
card, had become a 'problem', he said.
Claiming surprise, Mr Craxi said he would make inquiries to see whether the
majority of the party's directorate favoured the call.
Although Mr Craxi has not been implicated in the various investigations into
corruption and illegal political funding, close allies have been arrested in
Milan, while Mr Gianni De Michelis, the Socialist former foreign minister
and now the party's deputy leader, is under investigation in the Veneto
region.
Separately, magistrates in the northern city of Varese, a stronghold for the
autonomist Lombard League, have started investigations into five MPs, one
from the European parliament, for a variety of alleged charges including
corruption and illegal funding.
In Naples, the battle of wills between politicians and magistrates
investigating alleged corruption and electoral malpractice took a new turn
with judges defending their decision to seek computer records from Mr
Francesco De Lorenzo, the health minister, and other local MPs. Magistrates
are looking into claims that MPs traded votes for political favours, notably
jobs in state companies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S main political parties are down but not out, judging by the clutch
of appointments to head some of the country's big public-sector banks.
The latest batch of names - traditionally appointed on party political
grounds - - suggests the Amato government has only partly responded to the
national desire for change.
There are some new faces among the 72 appointments and re-confirmations,
notably with the choice of a few apolitical academics to bank chairmanships.
However, many former political appointees have also kept their jobs after
the expiry of their mandates.
The most prominent among the newcomers is Mr Giovanni Grottanelli de' Santi,
the new chairman of Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which is one of Italy's
biggest and most conservative banks. An academic at the city's university,
Mr Grottanelli fills the job vacated over two years ago by Mr Piero Barucci,
now treasury minister, who left to become joint managing director of Credito
Italiano before joining the new government.
Among the most prominent political appointees to be reconfirmed was Mr
Roberto Mazzotta, Christian Democrat chairman of Cariplo, Italy's biggest
savings bank.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government has taken a significant step forward in its attempt to
modernise France's docks by clinching an agreement with Le Havre dock
workers to cut 1,000 jobs and modernise working practices.
France's dock authorities have for months been locked in negotiations with
dockers at different ports as part of a national initiative to make the
docks more internationally competitive and to stem the loss of business to
other countries.
The negotiations have been fraught with problems which culminated this
summer in stoppages that brought many French ports to a standstill.
The authorities have already concluded negotiations at some ports but the
agreement at Le Havre, the biggest port in France in terms of the value of
cargo handled, is a landmark and could clear the way for similar accords at
other ports.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Salinas signals electoral reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas of Mexico yesterday signalled modest electoral
reform and underlined his government's commitment to fiscal austerity in his
annual state-the-union address.
The president also announced that the Bank of Mexico's reserves had risen to
Dollars 18.258bn (Pounds 11.1bn), allaying fears that there had been a large
outflow of capital in early October. Reserves, announced just three times a
year, were Dollars 18.023bn in August.
Mr Salinas outlined a three-point plan for electoral reform, in an apparent
effort to end the post-electoral demonstrations that have forced three state
governors to resign in just over a year. The plan addresses criticisms that
the electoral process is loaded in favour of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary party.
A new law, which would be negotiated between the political parties, would
make the source of party finances transparent, set ceilings on electoral
expenses, and attempt to ensure more impartial electoral processes and more
equal access to newspapers and television.
The president emphasised his government's fight against inflation, forecast
to fall below 10 per cent next year. 'The stability of prices has proved to
be the best way to achieve sustained real growth of salaries. Because of
this, we will not relax fiscal discipline, and we will maintain the
financial surplus in the public sector.' He said the fiscal surplus would
not be reduced to boost demand, and strict fiscal discipline would be
maintained 'even when we reach single-digit inflation'.
Mr Salinas highlighted the need to raise the savings rate, to promote more
investment, and to raise productivity.
In an apparent response to concerns about Mexico's widening current account
deficit, expected to come close to Dollars 20bn this year, Mr Salinas raised
for the first time the issue of the dumping of foreign products in the
Mexican markets. 'We will face greater pressure from imports of foreign
products that cannot find buyers in their own markets, but we can counter
this by mounting an effective guard against unfair trade practices.'
He said: 'We must ensure that imports do not enter the country under terms
of unfair competition. Consequently, we have strengthened mechanisms to
defend ourselves against unfair trade practices.'
On the domestic front, he said he planned a constitutional amendment to make
secondary education compulsory.

regime

RUSSIA flew 3,000 special forces to halt ethnic fighting in the troubled
Caucasus mountains at the weekend, its second troop deployment in a week to
support a beleaguered government in its former empire.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent Spetsnaz commandos and elite police to
Vladikavkaz, capital of the Russian autonomous republic of North Ossetia,
1,100 miles south of Moscow. The troops were sent to halt fighting between
Ossetians and a regional ethnic group, the Ingush, who officials claimed
were setting fire to Ossetian-owned homes. Scores were reported killed and
injured in street fighting between Ossetians and Ingush in the past several
days.
Ingush rebels were reported yesterday to have taken hostage 80 Russian
interior ministry soldiers based in the region. A local official said the
soldiers were seized on Friday in the Dzhermen settlement, located near the
regional capital, Vladikavkaz, and populated mostly by Ingushis, Mr Felix
Gutnov, spokesman for the North Ossetian interior ministry, said.
The Ingush, who declared an independent state in June, are demanding the
return of lands that Russian leader Josef Stalin expropriated in 1944 and
declared part of North Ossetia.
Mr Yeltsin and Russian Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar held emergency meetings
on the crisis on Saturday and yesterday. At the same time, the North
Ossetian government said it would distribute Russian army-supplied automatic
weapons to civilian volunteers.
'The Russian authorities are strong enough to make all those violating the
law respect it,' Russian Deputy Prime Minister Georgy Khizha, Mr Yeltsin's
specialist on the Caucasus, told Russian television.
The Russian action mirrored recent developments in the former Soviet
republic of Tajikistan, where Russian troops have also been deployed. The
Central Asian nation, which has yet to form its own army since the Soviet
Union collapsed last December, has also distributed weapons to civilians. On
October 26-27 Russian soldiers played a crucial role in crushing a coup
attempt in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe.
The Caucasus mountains, which stretch from southern Russia to the borders of
Turkey and Iran, are engulfed by several conflicts. Among them are Georgia's
war with Abkhazian separatists, and Azerbaijan's conflict with ethnic
Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Driving bargains along the road to privatisation: Russia
starts to break up state-owned trucking monopoly by selling vehicles to a
wary populace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIXTY battered trucks, parked around the Lenin statue in the Russian city of
Nizhny-Novgorod, were sold off to the people at the weekend in a successful
test run for the country's controversial privatisation vouchers.
The theatrical flair of the bow-tied auctioneer in the city, Russia's third
biggest and its unofficial laboratory for market reforms, made
privatisatsia, usually a subject of fierce theoretical debates, an exciting
reality for ordinary people.
'Here is Russia,' thundered Mr Sergei Maslov, pointing to the 500
participants, from struggling private farmers to smart new businessmen, as
they raised their bidding cards at the start of Saturday's auction in a vast
hall which once hosted provincial fairs in pre-revolutionary Russia. Flanked
by two glamorous assistants in sequined dresses, Mr Maslov proceeded to sell
the trucks with energetic swings of a large wooden gavel.
The first Russian to spend a voucher was Mr Sergei Demyanov, a physicist
turned businessman, who was so delighted that he said he did not care if his
lorry failed to make it home.
On the other hand, Yuri, a car plant worker who wanted a truck to carry
produce to market from his small plot of land, left in despair saying the
prices fetched were too high.
Since the government began distributing vouchers to Russia's 165m citizens a
month ago, they have been selling on the unofficial secondary market for
well below their face value of Rbs10,000 amid criticism that the scheme is
above the heads of ordinary Russians.
Successful bidders however were able to obtain big discounts by obtaining
Rbs10,000 worth of truck against vouchers they had bought from poorer
citizens for Rbs2-3,000, or in some cases for just a bottle of vodka.
'It's a myth to say that the Russian people have no idea what to do with
their vouchers,' Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the deputy prime minister, told a
news conference after the auction.
'If somebody exchanges their voucher for a bottle of vodka, it's his
problem, but he's no citizen.'
The auction, at which half the price of a truck could be paid for with
vouchers and the rest with cash, and which will be followed by more lorry
sales, also marked the launch of a model plan to break up Russia's
state-owned trucking monopoly. Ranging from a brand-new Kamaz lorry that
fetched Rbs1m to the cheapest, oldest vehicle, which went for Rbs110,000,
the trucks were described as excess capacity hived off from 42 local
transport companies which are themselves due to be privatised.
The new trucking companies, once locked into a single monopoly for the whole
Nizhny-Novgorod region of 3.7m people, are to be allowed to set their own
prices and compete with one another as part of efforts to improve the
distribution of food and goods around bottle-necked Russia.
The only snag with the use of the vouchers to buy trucks was that the
government had initially planned to reserve them for the sale of shares in
medium- and large-scale enterprises. That this is a more difficult
undertaking was illustrated by the fact that the Nizhny-Novgorod authorities
have yet to organise the sale of shares in the trucking enterprises which
parted with the trucks.
The obstacles facing any privatisation in Russia were underlined by the fact
that Saturday's auction was only made possible thanks to tremendous lobbying
by Mr Boris Nemtsov, the region's dynamic governor, and the organisational
skills of the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's investment
arm, which has been piloting small-scale privatisation projects in selected
spots around Russia.

MR Milan Panic, the Yugoslav prime minister, could lose a no-confidence vote
in the federal parliament today, report Laura Silber in Belgrade and Reuter

Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian president, has orchestrated a campaign to
undermine the Belgrade-born California businessman since he was designated
prime minister in July.
The presidents of Bosnia and Croatia, allies against the Serbs, promised
yesterday to halt fighting between their own troops which has turned the war
in central Bosnia into a three-way fight, Reuter reports from Zagreb.
Bosnia's Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic arrived in the Croatian capital
Zagreb for an unannounced meeting with President Franjo Tudjman to discuss
the Moslem-Croat fighting around the towns of Travnik, Vitez and Prozor.
Near Travnik yesterday, a Croatian cameraman working for the BBC was killed
when his car was hit by a mortar bomb, according to Croatian Defence Council
officers. They said Mr Tihomir Tunukovic's vehicle was apparently hit by
Serbian fire.

THE corruption scheme allegedly involving Brazil's suspended President
Fernando Collor reached into most areas of government and had a yearly
turnover in excess of Dollars 200m (Pounds 123m), according to computer
records published in the Brazilian press yesterday.
The records show the existence of a big corruption network, a 'parallel
government', with contacts in almost all ministries. It extorted kickbacks
on everything from road construction contracts to importation of food and
health items for charity programmes.
Veja magazine published extracts from the 251 pages so far transcribed by
police from secret files stored in the computer seized from the office of Mr
Paulo Cesar Farias, Mr Collor's friend and former campaign treasurer who
allegedly ran the scheme, and on whom Mr Collor blames the scandal.
Mr Collor is referred to throughout as 'Big Boss' and Mr Farias as 'chief
lobbyist'.
Accounts and objectives are clearly presented, with finances rigorously
controlled. Targets include forming 'joint ventures' with big companies and
'the strengthening of new economic groups'. It also explains how
participants should behave in public, adding that the scheme would run until
December 1994 - the end of Mr Collor's mandate.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Race for the White House: Japanese adjust to idea of
'President Clinton' - Challenger is seen as more realistic about the causes
of US problems
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of Mr Bill Clinton riding in from Arkansas to take up the reins
of presidential power in the White House could have been tailor-made to
highlight the differences between politics in the US and Japan.
It is inconceivable that a young, untested outsider could rise from the
political shadows as governor of one of the poorest regions of Japan to
within reach of the most powerful post in national politics.
In Japan access to the top political jobs is so tightly regulated that the
choice of the cabinet can be calculated almost by a formula.
Despite the cultural shock a young US president might deliver to a Japanese
political leadership generally at least 20 years his senior, the Tokyo elite
is learning to tolerate the prospect of change in Washington. Japanese
attitudes towards the US presidential race have gone through several phases
this year.
At the outset it appeared the looming Japanese trade surplus might play an
important role in the election, especially as President George Bush choose
to kick off his campaign in January with an ill-fated visit to Tokyo. Even
so, Japanese officials were adamant that Japan needed the continuity of a
Republican White House committed to free trade.
The entry of Mr Ross Perot, the Texas independent, provoked fears that the
US might succumb to economic nationalism, with Japan as the main victim.
Briefly, over the early summer, stopping Mr Perot was seen as the main
priority.
After the Democratic convention the mood changed. Mr Clinton's impressive
lead in the polls - later much diminished - persuaded Tokyo analysts that Mr
Bush's defeat was almost inevitable; they had to learn to tolerate Mr
Clinton.
Two schools of thought run through Japanese politics, the bureaucracy and
business about the impact of a Clinton presidency.
The pessimists are apprehensive on several counts. The uncertainty of change
would be highly unsettling to Tokyo policy makers. Japan has done well from
Republican presidents. Its economy was given a hefty kick start by the
Korean and Vietnam war efforts in the 1950s and 1960s. In the past decade
Japan's economic power grew hugely during the Reagan-Bush years, partly
because of the rise in the US federal deficit and the growth of the Japanese
trade surplus.
The pessimists acknowledge that the US has made increasingly insistent
demands upon Japan over bilateral trade and foreign policy issues such as
Japan's contribution to the the Gulf war. Yet Republican foreign policy has
generally provided a familiar framework for Japan to rely upon, particularly
as its gropes for a broader international role in the wake of the end of the
cold war.
But the pessimists fear a Clinton presidency would fall prey to
protectionists in the Democratic party who call for industrial policy to be
matched by an aggressive trade policy targeted at Japan, with quotas for
imports into the US and market opening in Japan.
However, over the past few weeks a growing number of Tokyo policy-makers
have become optimistic that a Clinton victory could pave the way for more
equitable relations with the US. Their optimism is encouraged by the belief
that the election campaign has marked a significant shift in Americans'
perceptions of the US economy's strengths and weaknesses.
Tokyo optimists believe US politicians are becoming more realistic about the
domestic factors behind declining US competitiveness, particularly poor
education and training and low savings and investment, and think this new
realism will lead the US to moderate its demands on Japan.
This belief has several sources. Protectionism has played far less of a role
in the campaign than many in Tokyo feared. Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice
minister at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, commented:
'The election has shown a strong common sense in the US about the importance
of avoiding protectionism.'
Mr Clinton's stress upon a revised industrial policy to promote US
competitiveness also strikes a chord. An active state policy to boost
competitiveness would be more recognisable to Japanese policy makers who
have never shared the Republican ideological zeal for the free market.
A senior official at the Ministry of Finance goes even further, predicting
that if he wins Mr Clinton might put trade relations on a more stable
footing: 'The trouble with the Bush administration's approach to trade was
that it started from the premise that the problem lay in Japan, with
Japanese unfairness. The Clinton team start from the premise that the main
problem is in the US. That is a fundamental shift. We might be more willing
to help if the US is really making an effort to restore its
competitiveness.'
The possibility of Democratic control of both the White House and the
Congress also encourages the optimists that 'Japan-bashing' will become less
powerful. As a senior US businessman in Tokyo put it: 'The Bush trade
initiatives have been an economic failure but a political success because
they were primarily designed to head off political pressure in Congress.
With a Clinton administration there would be less political window dressing
and more emphasis on what can be done practically.'
This optimism has not reached into the popular press, whose commentators
issue daily warnings of the dire consequences which lie in store for Japan
from a Clinton victory. But the Tokyo professionals are more pragmatic; they
are quietly clearing the ground to allow them to shift their allegiances if
Mr Clinton wins.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Race for the White House: California water allocation bill
signed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush has signed controversial legislation reallocating
scarce California water supplies from agriculture to the state's cities and
drought-threatened wildlife, despite the opposition of the state's farmers
and a last-minute appeal for a presidential veto from California's
Republican Governor Pete Wilson.
The water bill also includes funding for several popular large scale dam and
water projects throughout the west, forcing the president to choose between
the interests of his California supporters and those in other states who
were urging passage of the bill.
It addresses a bitter century-long battle between agricultural and urban
interests over water rights in California. Farmers now use about 85 per cent
of the state's water, while city residents and other industries face severe
rationing after six years of drought.
The bill signed on Friday will reform allocation of water supplies from the
Central Valley Project (CVP), a massive system of 20 dams and miles of
canals, built by the federal government in the late 1930s, that transports
water from northern California to the Central Valley, where it is used to
irrigate about 3m acres of farmland.
The changes 'will cripple farmers in the nation's most productive
agricultural region, without solving California's basic water problem,' said
Mr Bob Vice, president of the California Farm Bureau Federation. Growers
will be forced to leave land fallow and lay off workers, he predicted.
Environmentalists were, however, pleased by the president's decision.
'This is a big day in California's water history,' said Mr Tom Graff of the
Environmental Defence Fund, one of the groups that has fought hard for the
legislation.
The bill reserves roughly 10 per cent of the amount of water that would be
delivered by the CVP in a year of normal rainfall to replenish river flows
and reservoir levels, restoring fish and waterfowl habitats destroyed by
diversion of water to the Central Valley.
It also provides city dwellers with access to CVP water supplies by enabling
farmers, for the first time, to sell surplus supplies to cities.
Although the president has sided with the urban majority in California, his
decision is not seen as a big vote-winner in the state, where he is trailing
Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, in opinion
polls. Rather, the passage of the water bill is seen as a defeat for the
president, governor and other Republican politicians who have long opposed
the water reform measures.
Mr Bush was put in a 'no win situation' by Democratic lawmakers, Mr Wilson
charged.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Race for the White House: US-Japan relations suffer sharp
deterioration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's relations with the US have suffered a sharp deterioration, with
mounting distrust on both sides, according to a poll published yesterday by
a leading Japanese newspaper, Charles Leadbeater writes.
The poll, conducted with more than 4,000 interviewees in the US and Japan,
found the number of Japanese and Americans who believe relations between the
two countries are good has fallen to a 15-year low. The proportion of those
who think relations are poor has risen sharply over the past year.
The annual poll conducted by the Yomirui newspaper group in Japan and
Gallup, the polling organisation in the US, found that only 8 per cent of US
respondents thought Japan was a trustworthy nation. About 60 per cent of US
interviewees believed its policy would be shaped by the idea that Japan is a
threat to US interests.
Yomirui said the deterioration in attitudes probably marked the rise in the
Japanese trade surplus with the US as well as the increasing domestic
orientation of US policies.
Japan's standing in US esteem has fallen consistently over the past six
years according to the poll. In 1987 it found that Japan was ranked as the
ninth most trustworthy nation by US respondents. This year it fell to 14th.
The survey found that President George Bush is still popular among the
Japanese despite the controversy over his illness-plagued visited to the
country in January, at the outset of the presidential election campaign.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush made it crystal clear over the weekend that he has no
intention of responding to the latest Iran-Contra revelations in any detail
and thinks the public should focus much more on Governor Bill Clinton's
evasion of military service 23 years ago.
Mr Bush bristled in a TV interview yesterday when questioned about new
evidence in an additional indictment against Mr Caspar Weinberger, the
former defence secretary. Mr Weinberger's notes suggested Mr Bush was much
more familiar with the arms-for-hostages scheme far earlier than he has let
on.
'Do you want to spend the whole half hour on this,' the president demanded.
The time could be better spent talking about Mr Clinton and the draft, he
said. In any case, the two issues were entirely different. He thought the
Iran-Contra investigations were 'a big witch-hunt' and found it sinister
that the latest indictments should have been handed down so close to the
election.
Over the weekend he accused the Democrats of seizing on the issue to divert
attention from the fact that their lead was 'slipping away'. Whether that is
true or not, the Clinton campaign has lost no opportunity to capitalise on
the fact that the trust issue may be as relevant to Mr Bush as to Mr
Clinton.
Thus, on Friday night, Mr George Stephanopoulos, Mr Clinton's communications
director, called up the Larry King Live TV show, on which Mr Bush was a
guest, to point out discrepancies in presidential statements about his
knowledge of Iran-Contra.
Mr Clinton also consistently accuses Mr Bush of putting out false and
misleading advertisements about his record. He specifically charged the
president of pandering to regional prejudice. 'In one state,' Mr Clinton
said in Georgia, 'he says I'm too liberal, in another state he says I'm a
backwater redneck.'
Mr Bush said yesterday: 'I have never accused him of being a redneck, I've
just said he has a sorry record in Arkansas.' He denied he bore any
responsibility for what he conceded was 'an ugly campaign, the worst I've
known', adding 'I will dish it out and see if they can take it.'
He then denied all knowledge of two recent commercials which portray
Arkansas as an industrial and environmental wasteland. The authors of two
studies which form the basis for the advertisements have complained that the
Bush campaign has completely distorted their findings.

hears Bush's horror stories

HALLOWE'EN in the American Midwest is a time for goblin masks, witches' hats
and pumpkin lanterns, but for President George Bush this weekend it brought
a final chance to tell horror stories about what would happen if Governor
Bill Clinton were to win tomorrow's presidential election.
'If you want to go the Clinton route, every day will seem like Hallowe'en -
fright and terror, fright and terror, witches and devils everywhere,' Mr
Bush proclaimed on Saturday as he meandered through the marshy flatlands of
Wisconsin on a whistle-stop train trip.
In Burlington, Oshkosh, Stevens Point and Chippewa Falls, the president
returned repeatedly to the theme that Republicans hope will at the last
minute bring their voters back: that Mr Clinton is inexperienced,
untrustworthy and ready to take both sides of every issue.
'The pumpkin in the Arkansas governor's mansion has two faces: whatever side
you're on, he's right there. You can't do that as president of the United
States,' Mr Bush said.
But Mr Bush could not stop a skeleton from rattling in his own closet, as a
small aircraft flew over his head trailing a banner reading 'Iran Contra
Haunts You'.
Mr Bush at first ignored the issue, brought back to life by renewed evidence
from the trial of Mr Caspar Weinberger, the former defence secretary, that
as vice-president he was not, as he has asserted, 'out of the loop' on the
deal to trade arms to Iran in exchange for the release of US hostages held
in Lebanon.
But in Oshkosh, confronted by a cluster of hostile placards waved by Clinton
supporters, Mr Bush confronted Iran-Contra head on. He said his opponent had
seized on the issue because he had started to panic that 'the power that
he's lusted for is going to slip away from him.'
'He has now latched onto these silly little charges, accusations, in a
desperate attempt to stop his free fall in the polls,' Mr Bush said.
Despite the recent narrowing of the gap between Mr Bush and Mr Clinton in
national opinion polls, the president's 40-hour visit to Wisconsin, a state
he lost in 1988 to Mr Michael Dukakis, suggests that his campaign is still
struggling to make up lost ground.
Mr Tommy Thompson, the state's popular Republican governor, argues that it
is possible for Mr Bush to win a majority in the presidential electoral
college without Wisconsin's 11 votes, but he admits Mr Bush does not have 11
votes to spare.
Because California has swung this year away from Mr Bush towards Mr Clinton,
Republican campaign managers have had to rework their electoral college
arithmetic.
That they still need so badly to win Wisconsin speaks clearly of how
difficult they are finding it to scrape together the 270 electoral college
votes they need.
It is clear, nevertheless, that the Bush campaign has regained some of its
enthusiasm, and that the president is far from beaten yet.
One promising sign is that Senator Robert Kasten, who earlier had kept his
distance from Mr Bush's ailing campaign for fear of jeopardising his own
re-election bid, joined the president at his railway rallies on Saturday.
Governor Thompson is counting on supporters of Mr Ross Perot to decide that
a vote for the Texas independent would be wasted. 'I am confident that over
the course of the next hours, of these Perot supporters a higher proportion
will go for George Bush than for Bill Clinton. That is what is going to
carry Wisconsin for George Bush,' he says.
But the governor still calls the race 'a toss-up. It is whoever gets their
voters to the polls on Tuesday.'
If that is so, the president may need to drum up more enthusiasm than he
generated among the respectable but not ecstatic crowds who came to see him
at the weekend.
'Our people shout louder, but maybe that's because we have bigger problems,'
commented Mr Alexander Shulepov, a Russian student who is spending a year in
Wisconsin.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Clinton holds his lead in polls on eve of election: Bush
loses momentum as Democrat weathers fierce counterattack

<TEXT>
THE MOST relentlessly negative presidential election campaign in recent US
history moved into its final hours yesterday with Governor Bill Clinton of
Arkansas still favoured to defeat Republican President George Bush.
Yesterday's polling evidence suggested that Mr Clinton may have weathered
the fierce Bush counterattack and be back on track to victory. The largest
survey, the New York Times-CBS poll of more than 1,900 registered voters,
taken from Tuesday to Friday of last week, gave Mr Clinton 43 per cent, Mr
Bush 34 per cent and Mr Ross Perot, the Texas independent, 15 per cent.
All three candidates campaigned exhaustively over the weekend in states
deemed critical tomorrow. Yesterday, Mr Clinton was in Ohio, Pennsylvania
and New Jersey, while Mr Bush visited Michigan, New Jersey and Connecticut.
Mr Perot was flying off to two rallies in California, having hit Florida and
Missouri on Saturday.
Mr Clinton, his voice virtually gone, worked the crowds at a football game
in Cincinnati, croaking out his message of 'change' and attacking the
president for distorting his record. Mr Bush denied on TV that there was
anything new in the latest Iran-Contra revelations and at a rally in
Michigan returned to the attack on Mr Clinton's draft record. He said
friends of the governor had destroyed his military records to protect him
from embarrassment over not serving in the Vietnam war. The Clinton camp
dismissed the charge.
The New York Times-CBS poll said Mr Clinton's edge was statistically almost
identical to its final poll in 1988, which presaged Mr Bush's easy victory
over Mr Michael Dukakis. Its previous survey, published a week ago, gave Mr
Clinton only a five-point lead. The poll takers reported some tightening of
the race among those questioned on Thursday and Friday, but on those days it
still found Mr Clinton up by eight points among the probable electorate and
seven among registered voters.
The volatile CNN-USA Today poll of 1,600 'likely' voters, which is conducted
by Gallup and which releases its findings daily, yesterday gave Mr Clinton
43 per cent, Mr Bush 36 and Mr Perot 15. From Wednesday to Saturday last
week, it had Mr Clinton's lead down to between one and three points, greatly
boosting Mr Bush's hopes. An ABC survey released on Saturday gave Mr Clinton
a three-point margin.
The election is determined not by popular vote but in the electoral college,
the 538 votes of which are awarded, with two minor exceptions, on a
winner-take-all basis, state-by-state. A Washington Post survey of all the
states plus the District of Columbia demonstrated yesterday how much of an
uphill task Mr Bush still faces.
It put Mr Clinton 'clearly ahead' in 16 states, plus DC, worth 227 electoral
votes and with 'a slight edge or better' in another 15 states, with 112
votes. This would give him more than the 270 needed for victory. Mr Bush had
a 'marked advantage' in only nine states with 68 votes, and was 'even or
slightly ahead' in 10 others with 131 votes.
The Bush campaign was encouraged by the latest poll putting him only three
points behind in Wisconsin, a strong Democratic state which Mr Bush toured
by train on Saturday, and virtually level in Ohio. But new surveys in
Michigan and New Jersey, 'must win' states for the president, still had him
8-12 points adrift of Mr Clinton and his lead was down to only three points
in Florida, which had looked more secure.
The main element of unpredictability centres on the Perot vote, still at a
high level for an independent candidate so late in the game. Though his poll
scores are going down and his unfavourable ratings rising, his local impact
may yet be large. Mr Bush seems to have moved ahead in Texas, but both the
New York Times and the Washington Post found it possible that Mr Perot could
hand the state to Mr Clinton. In as many as 25 states, the Post found,
last-minute decisions by his supporters could be critical.

FT  02 NOV 92 / BA, USAir may switch to Airbus if alliance is blocked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways and USAir, two of the US Boeing company's biggest aircraft
customers, may consider switching to the European Airbus consortium if their
Dollars 750m (Pounds 460m) alliance is blocked by the US government.
The threat was raised this weekend by Mr Seth Schofield, USAir chief
executive, in a letter to Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential
candidate, who warned last week he would oppose BA's acquisition of a 44 per
cent stake in USAir if elected.
Mr Schofield told Mr Clinton that the deal would not only ensure security
for 47,000 USAir jobs and increase domestic airline competition, but also
had important implications for the US aircraft manufacturing industry.
'The alliance will provide a solid future for Boeing,' he wrote, adding that
USAir operates 268 Boeing aircraft and has firm orders and options for 183
additional Boeings to be delivered over the next eight years.
'The financial infusion from the BA investment assures that those aircraft
will be delivered,' he told Mr Clinton, implying that the orders would be
threatened if the deal collapsed.
BA is also a big Boeing operator, with 174 Boeing aircraft in its fleet and
firm orders in place for 81 additional Boeings and options for 70 more.
Neither USAir nor BA had ordered European Airbus aircraft so far, Mr
Schofield added. Apart from 10 Airbus A320s it inherited from the British
Caledonian merger five years ago, BA since privatisation has opted for
Boeing aircraft and is the only large European airline not to have bought
any Airbus jets.
This has led to a fierce controversy with Airbus whose chairman, Mr Jean
Pierson, has repeatedly accused BA of being anti-European. Last year he
asked the European Commission to investigate BA's aircraft purchasing policy
after the airline placed a Pounds 3bn order with Boeing for new Boeing 777
widebody aircraft instead of Airbuses. BA also chose US General Electric
engines for its 777s rather than UK Rolls-Royce engines.
After losing the BA order, Mr Pierson banned all Airbus staff from flying on
BA aircraft.
Although no decision has been taken, a US rejection of the USAir deal could
lead BA to reconsider its aircraft purchasing policy in favour of Airbus.
Relations between the UK airline and Airbus also appear to be improving
following a recent meeting between Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive,
and Mr Pierson.
A decision by BA and USAir to switch their allegiances would be all the more
significant because of the depressed state of the civil aircraft market. Mr
Schofield said the biggest three US carriers, United Airlines, American
Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which have all lobbied furiously against the
BA-USAir deal, have bought Airbus equipment.
Last night Sir Colin, in Montreal for the International Air Transport
Association meeting, gave assurances that the proposed USAir deal would not
result in job losses.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Tory Euro-rebels snub ministers' appeals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR was braced for two days of frantic campaigning yesterday after
forecasts from Tory Euro-sceptics and independent bodies found some 35
rebels still pledged to oppose him or abstain in Wednesday's Maastricht
debate.
The findings underlined the uncertainty of the outcome in what is
increasingly being seen as a crucial test of the prime minister's
credibility and his ability to command party respect.
Several loyalist Tory MPs have publicly expressed broad agreement with
Labour that Mr Major's authority would be critically damaged if he loses the
debate - even if the government goes on to win a confidence vote.
If all 35 potential rebels vote against the motion, Mr Major would face the
real possibility of defeat. However, it would only need a few rebels to
abstain for the government to win by a narrow margin.
After a weekend of frenetic behind-the-scenes activity by government whips,
the crisis atmosphere was fuelled yesterday by dire warnings from cabinet
ministers and a ferocious row over tactics between Labour and the Liberal
Democrats.
Early yesterday, Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, used an
interview with TV-am to insist that Conservative MPs would be 'playing with
fire' if they put the government at risk.
His message was repeated by Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary. In a clear
warning to the rebels, he said: 'If they think the government can just be
defeated on Wednesday and everything will just settle down the following day
 -it won't'
Meanwhile, Labour was raising the pressure on the Liberal Democrats by
warning that their support for the government would rebound when public
expenditure cuts are announced next week.
In a statement, Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, warned that
voters would not forgive the Liberal Democrats if they 'propped up' the
prime minister. 'If he wins next week's vote, John Major will have a mandate
to go ahead with the public spending cuts which he denied would be made,'
she said.
The charge drew a furious retort from Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat
leader, who described Labour's decision to oppose the Maastricht motion as
'a tawdry deceit'.
Claiming the Liberal Democrats were putting the interests of the nation
first, he argued that if the government was defeated it would immediately
win in a confidence motion. 'So we would be left with the worst of all
possible worlds - no general election and no future for Britain in Europe
either,' he said.
The idea of Britain working in collaboration with Europe was the main
message of Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, as both
attempted yesterday to stress the importance of ratification for the
economy.
In an article in the News of the World, the prime minister claimed that
Community membership had brought 'a tidal wave of job-creating foreign
investment', adding that it would be a disastrous mistake for Britain to
walk away from it.
Leading Tory Euro-sceptics, however, were confident there was no erosion of
their support.
Mr James Cran, an unofficial 'whip' for the rebels, said that 37 MPs
remained ready to oppose the government's motion. 'They have been subject to
a lot of pressure in their constituencies and elsewhere, but they are not
prepared to move,' he said.
A BBC poll of 70 possible rebels found that 36 MPs are ready to oppose or
abstain.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Three copier suppliers face suspension of credit licences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE of Fair Trading will this week be asked to revoke the consumer
credit licences of three companies offering controversial 'copy plan'
schemes to users of office photocopier machines. Similar action is expected
against other companies.
The use of copy plans, under which the capital cost of photocopying
equipment is merged with the running costs to produce a charge-per-copy
agreement, is coming under increasing scrutiny following customer complaints
about alleged misrepresentation.
Customers allege that high-pressure sales techniques have misled them into
signing contracts with a life well in excess of that of the equipment and
which conceal several onerous and unfair conditions.
Some of the leasing companies offering copy plans are owned by leading banks
and institutions. which could be embarrassed if the activities of any of
their subsidiary operations were subject to OFT action.
On Wednesday, members of the Campaign to Clean Up Copier Contracts, and Mr
Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, will tell the OFT that
sufficient evidence has been assembled to justify the withdrawal of consumer
credit licences from three companies. They will also offer to compile
evidence of alleged contract abuse against several other leasing
specialists.
The campaign, started earlier this year by companies claiming to have been
misled into signing expensive copy plan agreements, says it has received
nearly 2,300 complaints. It is demanding a two-week cooling-off period to
enable customers to cancel agreements, and wants changes in the law to
extend to companies and other organisations the same protection available to
individuals under the consumer credit acts.
A campaign spokesman said yesterday: 'The photocopier industry is trying to
suggest that the abuses surrounding copy plan contracts have been stamped
out. Our evidence suggests the contrary and we will keep up pressure to
ensure malpractice is identified and stopped.'
The OFT, which is discussing the copy plan with the Department of Trade and
Industry, has warned that it will revoke the consumer credit licences of
photocopier leasing companies if contract malpractice is confirmed.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Monday Interview: Russia's true power broker - Arkady
Volsky, leader of Russia's industrialists, talks to John Lloyd and Leyla
Boulton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
He has the face and manners of a Renaissance courtier: strong, subtle,
humorous, but with the foxy look of a man with a thousand projects and
stratagems. His reputation is for intelligence and guile: even an enemy like
Mr Mikhail Poltaranin, information minister and confidant of Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, admitted recently: 'Volsky is cunning: and he is
now manoeuvring.'
Arkady Ivanovich Volsky has ended up on the right side of power for a
quarter of century, and may now, in his 61st year, be reaching the apogee of
his influence. As president of the Union of Industrialists and
Entrepreneurs, he is the disposer of favour, contracts and authority, whose
ability to construct coalitions of apparent strength at a time of flux and
crisis has given him the role of kingmaker in Russia.
Mr Volsky is tremendously well connected in a country where contacts are
all: years in the industrial department of the Communist party's central
committee give him a network of acquaintances in nearly every plant of any
size in the land. His style is that of the jovial man of business with a
grasp of the world - rare, still, in post-Soviet Russia.
Last week, to an audience largely of Italian business people, he was an
expansive and funny, yet always pointed, lunchtime speaker, warning of the
need for political change in Russia: 'Do you know which country understands
us best? Germany. And why? Because they have been given a present of East
Germany. East Germany has had a mama (he makes the motion of lifting out a
breast to give suck) who can feed it. But (his finger up, monitory) we have
no mama. Yet Germany now has two fascist parties and 2m unemployed. We must
think about this.'
However, his commodity is power - and knowledge of where it can be applied.
'Power belongs to those who have property and money,' he told Reuter in
July. 'At present it is not the government but the industrial managers who
have both.'
He is constantly consulted by leading politicians. During our interview in
his office last week, he took a call - long, confidential, alternately
soothing, joking and commanding - from first deputy prime minister Vladimir
Shumeiko, before being bustled out by his aides to meet Vice-President
Alexander Rutskoi. His endorsement of a project is almost a guarantee of its
success.
He moves easily among the business and political elites of the former Soviet
states and of foreign countries: travelling and receiving delegations
constantly. His friends are British financiers, German bankers, Japanese
industrialists. He has the gift, shared with his former patron, Mr Mikhail
Gorbachev, of conveying personal warmth to anyone he meets - but he has not,
it seems, made Mr Gorbachev's mistake of believing personal charm is enough.
Mr Gorbachev inherited and lost the vast power of a Communist party
general-secretary: Mr Volsky, even while he was in the final 'Soviet'
government between the August 1991 putsch and the resignation of Mr
Gorbachev last Christmas, was building up his base from the disintegrating
parts of the command system.
He brought together the great Soviet enterprises, which increasingly had
been cast adrift from the 'mama' state at the end of the 1980s, in what is
now called the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.
Associations of joint ventures and co-operatives mingle with the big state
companies on the union board, a blending of the public and the private
sectors.
In the past year, he has added political clout: his union was the guiding
spirit behind the combination of three parties - Mr Rutskoi's Free Russia,
Mr Nikolai Travkin's Democratic party and his own creation, the Renewal
party headed by his deputy, Mr Alexander Vladislyavyev - into the Civic
Union. Since it was founded in August, it has attracted the support of
parliamentary factions and individual deputies - and of the main trade union
federation, the Federation of Indepedent Russian Trade Unions.
In Russia, an alliance between the unions and the main employers'
organisation is no surprise: both have an interest in putting pressure on
the state to continue subsidies to industry. More surprising, and even more
of a testament to Mr Volsky's political skill, has been a pledge of support
from Mr Konstantin Borovoi, a former commodity and stock market boss who
created and leads the Economic Freedom party, a pro-business group.
Mr Borovoi initially set himself up as a liberal critic of Mr Volsky: now he
has joined the fan club. By enlisting Mr Borovoi's support, Mr Volsky seems
to cover almost the entire spectrum of 'moderate' opinion.
What will he do with all of this power? Why, to use Mr Poltaranin's word, is
he now 'manoeuvring'?
Using the practised phrases of a politician who must have employed them at a
hundred meetings and briefings, he talks of wanting a 'correction' in
government policy; of wanting to rid the cabinet of 'incompetent people and
crooks'; of a round table, convened by the president, with the participation
of all the politicial parties and blocs.
His union of industrialists has already completed a plan to 'correct' the
government's policies: this has gone to President Yeltsin, and will be
presented to a conference of industrialists on November 14.
As for cabinet changes, Mr Gaidar, the acting prime minister, must stay in
it, he says. But, asked if Mr Gaidar must stay as prime minister, Mr Volsky
avoids a direct answer. Instead he says that he has told Mr Gaidar that
anyone who cannot command authority in that post should go.
Will he get the changes in government and policy that he wants? It is
evident things have been moving his way: 'The government has listened to us
and is listening to us,' he says. He claims the meeting between senior
ministers and industrialists in the car-manufacturing town of Togliatti, on
the Volga, last weekend fulfilled his idea that ministers should get out of
Moscow and meet real people. And he can point to passages in the speech the
Russian president gave to parliament last month in which he specifically
commended the Civic Union, told the government to listen to its ideas and
pointed to it as the basis for 'a modern, civilised two-party system'.
In a significant phrase, Mr Yeltsin said: 'A market economy is not an end in
itself: it is a means by which we can and must raise Russia.' Mr Volsky had
said almost exactly that in an earlier speech.
Is he, then - as many in the present government charge - a disguised
commisar: a man who wants to bring back at least elements of the old system?
It is a charge which he passionately rejects, denouncing those (including
the Financial Times) who, he says, had seen his espousal of the 'Chinese
option' as a plea for an authoritarian state. 'We can use the experience of
China; we can use the experience of Japan; we can use the experience of Mrs
Thatcher,' he says.
He wants privatisation - not through giving the population the right to own
shares via vouchers, but through a system giving more direct control to
industrial managers. He wants to see bankruptcies - not through the system
favoured by the government, which gives state committees the power to close
companies, but by giving the courts the right to declare a company bankrupt.
He wants foreign investment: but he wants it more regulated by the state,
with systems in place that foreign investors can understand.
He is equally passionate on his rejection of political ambition, saying he
does not want to be prime minister. This is believable: he has amassed so
much power in his present position that he would hardly gain more in that
hot seat.
He wants to see the cabinet changes he has called for take place in the
latter part of this month. If this is done, he believes, the scenario of a
government destroyed and a president damaged by an angry Congress of Peoples
Deputies, which opens on December 1, could be avoided.
If not? He will, he says, 'go into opposition'. This would mean his becoming
leader of the disparate but large groups he represents, rejecting completely
the government's policies and initiatives. Such a battle would be a testing
one: some government radicals believe that his troops exist only on paper,
and that there are pro-government constituencies which still have to be
counted. But Mr Yeltsin is clearly leaning towards the Civic Union platform.
The government is weak; Mr Volsky, for now, has most of the cards.

FT  02 NOV 92 / British patience runs dry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Vaclav Havel, the soon-to-be ex-president of the soon-to-be
ex-Czechoslovakia, last week was received as an honorary member of the
French Academie des Sciences Morales et Politiques. In his acceptance
speech, he meditated at length on the virtues of patience. There is no point
waiting for Godot, in the sense of an external salvation, for Godot does not
exist; there is no point indulging in the impatience of a rational activist,
for that is a communist-type error; the only real merit lies in simply
waiting.
It is an admirable, almost a saintly prescription for Job-like self-control.
It will have been music to the ears of President Francois Mitterrand, whose
most constant political maxim, exercised throughout his long political
career, is: 'Il faut donner du temps au temps (let time do its work).'
But it is not a prescription which seems to have a wide following in Britain
today. Foreigners have long noticed the physical evidence of economic
decline and decay; the whole world knows that Mr John Major's government has
recently suffered - or has brought on itself - a set of policy failures on a
truly heroic scale. But what really strikes the visitor from abroad as a new
phenomenon is the violence with which the media denounce the government's
failures.
Old-timers may protest that the situation, while obviously worrying for Mr
Major, is not really all that frightful, nor indeed all that different from
a longstanding British pattern. This is just another little economic crisis
followed by another little economic policy U-turn, similar to so many we
have known ever since the second world war. OK, so Mr Major's ERM strategy
turned out to be unsustainable; but now we have another strategy (for
growth, no less), and with any luck that will work better and please the
people more.
There is a narrow sense in which weary familiarity is painfully close to the
mark. The relative economic decline of Britain has been going on for a
century or more, and shows no sign of ending; the British economy has been
erratically mismanaged ever since the war, and the current fiasco is only
the latest episode in a long-running farce.
Moreover, it is sometimes claimed that Mr Major is only in the same boat as
many other political leaders in the industrialised world, ranging from
President Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Germany, to President
George Bush in the US. They are all unpopular, and for broadly similar
reasons; they have economic problems at home for which they have no
solutions.
But there is another sense in which the new debacle seems to me
qualitatively different from its predecessors. Where Mr Major seems to be in
a class of his own is in the depth and intensity of the media criticism of
his administration, in the broadest sense of the term. President Mitterrand
is almost as unpopular as Mr Major, according to the public opinion polls;
but his treatment in the press is restrained and comparatively respectful;
he is not the target of such strident vituperation.
Returning to Britain after some years abroad, I find myself shocked by the
volume and the violence of the current wave of criticism to which the
government is subjected - not because it is undeserved, but because the
pervasive tone of anger and contempt seems to me of an intensity without
precedent in postwar British history. It is not clear that Mr Major's policy
failures are fundamentally worse than those of Home, Eden, Wilson or many
others; but they were not treated like this.
Moreover, the anger and contempt are directed not merely at the government
but at the whole administrative machine. Once upon a time, economic
mismanagement was blamed on the wilful stupidity of ministers, while the
Treasury was generally exonerated, despite its arrogance; today even the
Treasury has lost all credibility. This loss of reputation has spread like
wild fire to many other institutions once respected, and we may be
perilously close to a general failure of credibility by the apparatus of the
state.
This seems to me a new phenomenon in Britain, and different from anything
commonly observed in other European countries, except perhaps in Italy; and
I suspect that the explanation has something to do with the second world
war.
In the past the British people excused their leaders for policy failure,
because they tacitly made allowance for the heavy economic legacy inherited
from the war effort. The Germans became rich because they lost the war, the
British became poor because they paid for it. The corollary of this excuse
was that the British refused to take seriously their reduced position in the
world, or do anything significant to improve their performance or modernise
their institutions. But few now remember the war, and forgiveness for that
failure has been exhausted.
The central element of this national self-indulgence has been refusal to
come to terms with Europe. France and Germany were both traumatised by the
disasters they suffered in the war, and were forced to frame their future in
European terms. The British are still obsessed with war heroics, from Bomber
Harris to El Alamein, and are still wrestling in anguish over their
relationship with the Community.
There is a time for patience, and a time for anger. In Britain the time for
anger appears to have arrived.

FT  02 NOV 92 / The irresistible logic of change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US seems to face a fateful choice. At 68, President George Bush looks
too old to lead the nation in a radically new direction. His campaign
pledges often sound like feeble echoes from the 1980s. Governor Bill
Clinton, nearly a quarter of a century his junior, vibrates at a different
frequency. As a baby-boomer, he speaks without embarrassment about Aids and
homosexuality. He understands the changed social and economic role of women
and minorities. He knows that the US economy must adapt if it is to prosper
in a more competitive world. Like John F Kennedy in 1960, he seems to stand
for the future rather than the past.
The contrast between the two men is stark, but it can also be overstated. A
victorious Mr Clinton will face the same budgetary pressures as Mr Bush; he
will have no magic wand with which to wave away social and economic
problems. It will not be a sudden transition from darkness to light, night
to day, as some Democrats fondly imagine. The president is commander in
chief, but his ability to fight poverty, crime and other social evils is
strictly limited, as Lyndon Johnson discovered in the 1960s.
If Mr Bush defies the pollsters, his second term need not be a disappointing
rerun of his first. Circumstances have changed; the economy has been
stagnant for three years; the cold war is over: attention will thus shift to
domestic challenges whoever occupies the Oval Office. Contrary to
expectations even 18 months ago, issues such as healthcare and education
have counted in this campaign. And the Republicans, belatedly, have begun to
assemble an agenda for domestic reform. After a narrow victory, even Mr Bush
would surely realise a return to business as usual was not possible. He has
seen the voters' anger.
Adversarial politics tend to exaggerate party divisions. But there are many
similarities in the two candidates' plans because both are drawing on a body
of progressive policy research, dating from the late 1980s, that bridges
traditional liberal/conservative divisions. Mr Clinton is a past chairman of
the Democratic Leadership Council, a body that has held a joint conference
with the Heritage Foundation, a supposed bastion of conservatism. As
governor of Arkansas Mr Clinton has helped formulate domestic policies
subsequently endorsed by Republican administrations.
'Dear Bill . . . well done, oh so well done. You were a joy to work with on
the summit and all our folks felt that way.' This was Mr Bush, writing to Mr
Clinton in 1989 to thank him for his help in developing the National
Education Goals that subsequently formed the foundation of Mr Bush's America
2000 education initiative. Like the president, Mr Clinton favours moves
towards a national curriculum and national testing, supports experimental
schools and advocates greater choice and competition within the public
sector. Privately Mr Clinton has even shown interest in conservative plans
to extend choice to the private sector by allowing parents to use public
funds to pay part of the costs of private education.
There are differences on healthcare. Mr Bush wants to expand access by
offering poor families tax credits to help pay for insurance premiums, while
Mr Clinton favours rules requiring employers to offer insurance or
contribute to the cost of expanded public sector schemes. But both men urge
reforms of the private health insurance industry and both advocate 'managed
competition' as a means of controlling costs and improving efficiency. In
practice both will work to adapt the present system.
On welfare, Mr Clinton has spent nearly a decade experimenting with forms of
'workfare' that make handouts conditional on claimants' willingness to
accept jobs or training. He helped write the Family Support Act which
enshrines similar principles and which President Reagan signed into law in
1988.
There are strong similarities even on economic policy. Neither candidate
favours tough action on the deficit. Contrary to his rhetoric Mr Bush
increased spending a lot and taxes a little - exactly the policy mix
expected of Mr Clinton. Mr Bush is spending more on infrastructure and
recently climbed on the training bandwagon, promising a Dollars 10bn
programme to hone workers' skills if re-elected. Republicans have even begun
to edge towards an industrial policy, recognising the role government can
play in promoting 'critical technologies'.
Contrary to appearances, the issue in this election is less the direction of
change, than the speed of change and the skill with which it is managed. In
these respects, Mr Clinton carries greater conviction.
The Democrat is both more able and more familiar with the issues. He
believes passionately in government and is likely to assemble an
administration of greater talent than any since the Kennedy era - many of
America's brightest academics, for instance, are queueing up for jobs. As a
long-serving governor, he understands state government from the inside, and
it is the states that in practice will be responsible for many of the
domestic reforms. Finally, he is more likely than Mr Bush to develop a
constructive relationship with a Democratic Congress - making effective
government more likely. If, as expected, Mr Clinton wins, it will be because
he is perceived as the better manager of change.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Bush and Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The foreign exchange market's attention this week will be firmly focused on
the results of tomorrow's US Presidential election, writes James Blitz.
The markets have already priced in a victory for Mr Bill Clinton and, unlike
previous elections, the dollar has benefited form the prospect of a Democrat
with an activist policy stance making it to the White House.
Dealers believe that Mr Clinton's commitment to a rise in infrastructure
spending funded by tax increases and cuts in the defence budget will force
the Federal Reserve to stop cutting interest rates.  The Fed may have to
tighten policy to counteract the effect of the boost in fiscal spending.
As a result there could be a short-term rise in the dollar this week,
following through to next year.  However, two factors may force the dollar's
rist to be c hecked.
First, even if Mr Clinton is elected, interest rates may still fall.
'Regardless of who wins,' says Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB
International in London, 'the Fed will be under pressure to cut rates again,
and to keep them at low levels until the economy and the banking sector show
stronger signs of recovery.'
The second possibility, of course, is that Mr George Bush will win tomorrow.
 One opionion poll on Friday put them neck-and-neck.
Ironically, a republican victory could trigger a fall in the dollar/D-mark
rate.  Dealers have become convinced of the merits of a Clinton victory to
such an extent that, if he loses, some bullish positions will have to be
unwound.
Moreover, a Bush victory would probably change little in US economic policy
in the short-term.  This would throw the market's focus firmly back on to
the sluggish upturn in the US.

FT  02 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Time for a change of
programme - A farewell note
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS NOT, after all, where I came in. The film looks much the same, but
they seem to have jumbled the reels. At the start - in 1973 - we had a
Conservative government which had abandoned exchange rate discipline and
dashed for growth; Sir Alan Walters - plain Mr then - issued a strong
monetary warning, which he quaintly called a memorial.
Second time round, more Walters' warnings, but this time of collapse, and it
might be worth inscribing on a memorial.
My own first financial comments on pink paper were about unwise bank lending
and hollowed-out balance sheets.
I might say this was prescient, but in fact that was quite another episode -
the time when it was rumoured (wrongly, as it turned out) that the National
Westminster had made such losses that it might have to be nationalised.
'Would it matter?' asked one drinking companion whom I had tried to shock
with this suggestion. 'After all, they wouldn't even have to change the
name.' In the event, we inflated out of that trouble and settled for other
problems instead.
This may help to explain why the banks did it all over again a mere 15 years
later - but it does not excuse them (or the authorities, for that matter).
All we have achieved by the end of the cycle is to stand the old saying on
its head: we have repeated history, but the first time as farce, and the
second as tragedy.
The Greek chorus is still muttering darkly about bank nationalisation here
and now in Washington too.
So there were mistakes; but at least we have a leaner, fitter manufacturing
sector, don't we? Leaner, certainly. Nowadays you could buy up most of it
for the capitalised salaries of a few privatised monopoly boards. They owe
their seats to the biggest debt-for-equity swap in history.
Economic result: we can resume our old borrowing habits without blushing
much, for a time at least. It's not much to show for the march of
enterprise, and all that oil.
Certainly not what believers expected. Perhaps we should have taken the
advice of Sir Michael Edwards, once paragon of leaner-fitter virtue.
He suggested that rather than destroy our competitiveness, we should have
left the oil under the sea as a strategic reserve.
Now turn the reel upside down, and run it for coal; you might conclude that
the only strategic reserve we will have left when they've finished is of
cautionary tales. A sad couple of decades, really.
Wait a minute, though; this is getting too grumpy.
There must have been some benefits, even if they were unintended. The
economy admittedly looks like the result of a forest fire; but one of the
livelier arguments during the years I spent away in the US was about the
effects of such fires.
According to the experts, they do for trees very much what competition is
supposed to do for industries: they clear away choked old growth so that new
plants can reach the sunlight. (A bit like defeat in war, which did so much
good to the old Axis powers, without the bombs. Let's hope so.)
The financial Big Bang was supposed to perform a similar brush-clearing
service for the capital markets.
It certainly wiped out the old City - which was perhaps too comfortable, and
certainly too profitable, but did the job. In its place we have a mess.
The new City did offer better returns to depositors, until the money ran
out; but now it seems stagnant and a bit putrid. At least, though, this
episode may reteach the lesson which Adam Smith's recent disciples failed to
learn from him: finance needs to be held in check.
Right at the end, though, one unexpected benefit: the Treasury seems to have
learned some humility.
Open economic analysis, sensible new rules about investment - whatever next?
There might be exciting new possibilities here. But there might not: the
chances are that history will go on with its cyclical variations; and if
that happens, could this column avoid repeating itself too?
You may never find out, at least in this space. FT readers, I will miss you.

FT  02 NOV 92 / International Bonds: French franc's strength adds spice to
Euromarket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Euro-French franc bond market is the only European bond market other
than the D-Mark sector which is open for large financings.
A number of European sovereign borrowers seeking funds to cover losses in
the foreign exchange market in September, are looking to the French market,
lifted by the franc's status as one of Europe's strongest currencies.
There is talk that the UK may raise more than FFr10bn in the market next
week, following other recent large issues, including a FFr6bn deal from
Sweden.
New issue volume has grown from 15 issues totalling FFr9bn in 1987 to 92
worth FFr105bn so far this year, according to figures from Euromoney.
Nevertheless, the sector still lies behind the US dollar, the yen, the
D-Mark and the Ecu, so far this year.
The market is dominated by five French banks, Credit Commercial de France,
Credit Lyonnais, Societe Generale, Banque Paribas and Banque Nationale de
Paris.
The market has become increasingly liquid, as the average size of new issues
has grown. In addition, the setting up of a market-making system  - known as
specialistes en valeurs publiques (SVTs) - for French government-owned
borrowers issuing large international bonds, has lifted investor confidence
in the sector.
The franc is emerging not only as a much-needed alternative to the D-Mark,
but also as a substitute for the Ecu sector which collapsed under an
overhang of paper after Denmark rejected the Maastricht treaty in June.
The accepted wisdom is that France has won its battle for a 'franc fort'
within the European exchange rate mechanism. While the franc is not a fully
signed up member of the D-Mark zone, there are strong links between the two,
and investors are flocking to buy the currency, which offers interest rates
between 85 and 100 basis points higher.
The franc is the only viable alternative currency to the D-Mark, according
to Mr Stephen West of Banque Paribas, which arranged Sweden's recent FFr6bn
five-year offering.
'People don't want currency risk: they're refocusing money into core
markets, and buying less of the peripheral currencies. People realise that
the French franc market is a professional one,' he said.
He argues that the market is more liquid than its D-Mark rival, given the
wider range of securities available and its more sophisticated structure.
However, the development of the market has been less than smooth. It was
forced to close during the summer, due to a severe bout of indigestion after
an avalanche of paper failed to be placed - one week in early July saw 10
issues totalling FFr17bn.
In the past two weeks the trend has been for large issues by borrowers with
heavy funding requirements. The next is expected to be for the UK, possibly
as early as this week. Talk is of at least a FFr10bn five-year issue with a
yield spread of between five and 10 basis points over five-year French
government paper. It would be the largest deal in the sector by a
substantial margin over Sweden's FFr6bn transaction. One French banker
suggested an issue up to FFr15bn over 10 years could be feasible.
The borrowing would form part of the second half of the UK's Ecu10bn funding
programme announced in September, which consisted of an Ecu5bn syndicated
facility and an Ecu5bn note programme. Under the programme, the UK completed
a DM5.5bn five-year Eurobond.
Although there is strong international demand for the franc for the time
being, there could be a quick shift to oversupply if too many large deals
emerge.

FT  02 NOV 92 / UK Gilts: Price rises show signs of running out of steam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were distinct signs last week that the recent rise in gilts prices at
both ends of the yield curve are starting to run out of steam, even though
the market continues to gain strength.
The large fall in yields recently has made gilts look expensive relative to
other European government bonds, given uncertainties about sterling after
the UK's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism.
Furthermore, worries about funding of the public sector borrowing
requirement (PSBR), which have largely been absent from the market in recent
weeks, are set to return soon, as indications pile up about rising
government deficits in the next year or so.
As evidence has strengthened that the longest UK recession for 50 years
seems likely to continue for some time, the government has come under
increased pressure to cut official interest rates, now at 8 per cent.
A further 1 or 2 percentage points off base rates seems highly likely over
the next few weeks, especially given the lack of need to peg the pound to
specific targets after the ERM departure.
The perception that short-term rates are coming down has lifted prices at
the short end of the yield curve, while long yields have come down on
indications that inflation is unlikely to be a problem in the UK for the
next year.
Last week, long gilts saw a fall in yields of nearly 20 basis points, while
yields for short-dated bonds fell by rather less: around 5 basis points.
The changes continued the trend in the market over the past month, during
which the difference between yields of 10-year gilts compared with yields of
10-year German bunds have narrowed substantially to about 100 basis points,
the lowest figure for several years. At the same time, the yield spread
between these gilts and 10-year French bonds has come down to around 10
basis points.
However, in the view of Mr John Shepperd, a bond specialist at S. G. Warburg
Securities, the rise in prices for gilts has just about run its course. He
reckons a correction in the market place may be about to start.
Behind this thinking is partly that investors are starting to take account
of the high levels of government deficits over the next few years. With many
City economists estimating that the PSBR will run to more than Pounds 40bn
in 1993-94, the government will need to sell large quantities of gilts to
fund the deficits.
This is especially since Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, appears to have
no plans to order a switch in policy to make gilt sales to banks and
building societies count towards funding the deficit.
The large volumes of gilts coming on to the market will depress prices, at
the same time making gilts more attractive to would-be buyers, especially
overseas. The need to entice more foreigners into buying gilts was
underlined by figures last week from the Bank of England, which showed that
in September, overseas investors were net sellers of gilts to the tune of
Pounds 600m, after having sold Pounds 1.2bn worth in August.
While non-UK investors are hardly falling over themselves to buy gilts at
the moment, the opposite is true for many banks and building societies. Many
are borrowing at relatively low short-term base rates and then re-investing
the money by lending to the government through buying long-dated gilts at
significantly higher yields.
In this way, banks and building societies have taken advantage of the
substantial steepening in the upwards-sloping yield curve in recent weeks.
In this environment, according to Mr Peter Warburton, an economist at Robert
Fleming, Mr Lamont may have missed a trick by failing to change policy rules
to make gilt purchases by banks and building societies count towards funding
the PSBR.
Not only would this have eased funding problems, it would have had a
much-needed stimulatory effect on the economy by increasing the money
supply. Mr Warburton was among several observers of the gilt market to be
disappointed that Mr Lamont made no mention of changes in funding policy in
his Mansion House speech last week.
The Bank of England continued its recent run of issuing index linked gilts
by announcing that Pounds 300m of such bonds will be available for trading
from today. The securities are Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked
Treasury stock due 2009, and Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked
Treasury stock due 2024.

FT  02 NOV 92 / US Money and Credit: Investors indulge in odd behaviour as
election nears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US BOND investors have been behaving in a most contrary fashion over the
past few days. This is as much a reflection of confusion over the likely
outcome of tomorrow's presidential election, than it is the result of a
clear-eyed investment strategy.
Take Tuesday's release of a much stronger-than-expected third-quarter gross
domestic product report. GDP grew by 2.7 per cent between July and
September, not 1.5 per cent as forecast by most analysts. The news did not
depress prices, as it would have done under normal circumstances.
Instead, the markets chose to focus on the inflation component within the
GDP figures, which showed a further slowdown in the rate of price rises, and
on some additional, if minor, bad economic news.
On Friday, Treasury prices again confounded established wisdom by falling
sharply in spite of two pieces of gloomy economic news - a very weak Chicago
purchasing managers' report and an unexpected drop in September new home
sales.
While the market's odd behaviour had something to do with technical factors,
such as the effect of new supply, the chief influence was the election. The
selling at the end of the week, for example, was primarily the result of
dealers and investors either squaring or lightening their positions ahead of
the election day.
More importantly, the confused nature of trading last week mirrored the
bewilderment felt throughout the financial markets in the face of
last-minute shifts in the opinion polls. The comfortable double-digit lead
in the national polls enjoyed by Governor Bill Clinton at the start of the
final week of the campaign had dwindled to between one and five points by
the end of the week.
Although this would normally be cause for celebration in equity, and
especially bond markets, investors appeared unwilling to respond positively
to the changing dynamics of the election race. This is not necessarily a
grudging endorsement of Mr Clinton, but rather a reluctance to reassess the
judgments, and reverse the tactics, adopted several weeks ago when it looked
as if the Democratic candidate was going to coast home.
During the discounting of a Clinton victory, prices dropped sharply and the
yield on the benchmark 30-year bond jumped more than 30 basis points. Yet
since then, prices and yields have barely moved, in spite of the sharp
narrowing in the national opinion polls.
This is because given the choice, investors would rather leave their
positions as they are and be caught out by the rally that would follow an
unexpected Bush win, than load up with bonds in the hope of a stunning
Republican comeback, only to be caught out by the sell-off that would follow
a Clinton victory. Of the two, the second scenario would probably inflict
greater losses than the first.
For those who want to look past tomorrow's election, the week offers plenty
of economic news to digest.
The National Association of Purchasing Management publishes its October
index later today, and in the wake of the big drop in equivalent surveys in
Chicago and Philadelphia, analysts are expecting another decline in the
national gauge of manufacturing activity.
The leading economic indicators for September are released tomorrow and they
are slated to show a drop of 0.3 per cent, while factory orders data the
following day are forecast to reveal a modest rise. The most important
statistics of the week will be reported on Friday when the October
employment data are published.
Analysts are at odds over what the figures will show, although the consensus
is for an increase in non-farm payrolls of about 20,000 and for a rise in
the unemployment rate from 7.5 per cent to either 7.6 per cent or 7.7 per
cent.

FT  02 NOV 92 / German Government Bonds: Economists optimistic about cut in
rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is little doubt among economists that the Bundesbank will sooner or
later embark on a substantial cut in interest rates - following its
half-hearted move in the middle of September to cut the Lombard rate by 0.25
percentage points to 9.50 per cent and the Discount by 0.5 points to 8.25
per cent.
This optimism, combined with the safe-haven status of the D-Mark amid
September's currency turmoil, explains why over the last two months bund
yields have dropped. They fell from the plateau of 8 per cent or above where
they were for most of the first eight months of the year and are now at 7.45
per cent, and are widely expected to fall still further.
However, the timing of the Bundesbank's next move on interest rates - and
thus the future course of the bund market - remains uncertain. Some
observers expect a cut of at least 0.5 percentage points in the Lombard rate
by the end of the year. Others more cautiously predict the cut will not come
until next spring, by which time inflationary pressures may have subsided
and the 1993 wage round will be out of the way.
The conviction that rates will turn is based on a number of factors,
including past experience: rates halved during two previous recessionary
phases - 1974-76 and 1981-83 - and the market is convinced that a
significant cut in the Lombard rate will presage the beginning of a swift
move back to very much lower levels.
Hopes have been fuelled further by a fall since early September of nearly a
full percentage point in the overnight money rates which the Bundesbank
steers via its security repurchase agreements and other instruments. But
last week the Bundesbank resisted the temptation to let rates fall below
8.75 per cent.
Increasingly bad news on the state of the German economy - most recently the
predictions last week from Germany's five most important research institutes
that GDP growth in western Germany would be only 0.5 per cent next year - is
grist to the interest rate optimists' mill. It is thought extremely unlikely
the Bundesbank will want to hold rates at the present level in the face of a
serious recession.
In spite of all this, the Bundesbank still sees its main task as squashing
inflation out of the system, not acting as an instrument of counter-cyclical
economic policy.
Here the indicators are negative: preliminary consumer price figures for
October out last week showed a 3.8 per cent increase in annual inflation,
worse than expected after a 3.6 rise in September. And there is no
indication that M3 money supply growth is suddenly going to crumple back to
the Bundesbank's 3.5 to 5.5 per cent target range.
Over the longer term, the sharp slowdown in the economy, combined with the
appreciation of the D-Mark will work to squeeze inflation out of the system.
But the Bundesbank is unlikely to squander decades of carefully won
anti-inflation credibility at a time when its chosen indicators - headline
inflation and M3 money supply growth - are out of line.
Thus the big cut is likely to come next spring rather than this Christmas,
with the result that bunds are likely to enter another phase of
consolidation.

PLACER Dome, Canada's biggest gold producer, has reported a big rise in
profits for the third quarter and first nine months, mainly because of
record production and lower operating costs.
Third-quarter net profits rose 133 per cent to USDollars 33m or 14 cents a
share, from USDollars 14m or 6 cents a year earlier, on revenues of
USDollars 264m, up 5 per cent. Nine-month net profits advanced 45 per cent
to USDollars 68m or 29 cents, from USDollars 47m or 20 cents. Revenues rose
11 per cent to USDollars 771m. Gold sales jumped 21 per cent to almost 1.5m
oz while the average realised gold price dipped 7 per cent to USDollars 372
per oz and cash cost of production averaged USDollars 188 per oz.
Placer achieved greater mill output and better grade control and gold
recoveries. Low cost mines increased production while exchange factors were
favourable.
Placer may extend the big Dome mine in Canada and plans to buy 50 per cent
of Chile's Zaldivar copper deposit for USDollars 100m. Cost control and the
search for new gold reserves are top priorities.

ISETAN, the leading Japanese department store company which invested heavily
in modernising its stores over the past two years, suffered a 72 per cent
drop in taxable profits to Y1.36bn (Dollars 11.3m) for the first half to the
end of September from Y4.7bn a year earlier. Sales fell 2.7 per cent to
Y213bn.
The Tokyo based company said the fall was mainly due to a sharp rise in
depreciation charges to cover the modernisation programme.
The company is to cut the salaries of 26 top executives and the year-end
bonuses of 300 department heads by 5 per cent to save about Y41m.
Isetan is maintaining its interim dividend of Y5 a share in spite of a fall
in earnings per share to Y2.37 from Y10.2 a year earlier.

FT  02 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Warning for London banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPETITION to London's investment banking industry is coming increasingly
from continental Europe rather than from North America and Japan, and
London's role as an international banking centre may be challenged,
according to a study from Price Waterhouse Management Consultants.
'Since 1988 there has been a major shift away from fear of the North
American and Japanese banks to viewing the continental European banks as a
major threat.
'Undoubtedly these banks have improved their understanding of and expertise
in the investment banking markets, and in particular those with a large
capital base are well-placed to increase their market share in all markets,'
the study concluded.
London's prestige as an international centre has been undermined by recent
self-regulation problems, most notably the difficulties at the Lloyd's
insurance market.
Meanwhile, the study found there has been almost no progress in product
innovation in the past three years. 'Following a period of rapid innovation
during the 1980s, the industry appears to have lost the will, the ability or
the opportunity to innovate,' the study said.
Since 1988, only three significant products have emerged in Europe;
asset-backed securities, commodity derivatives and over-the-counter equity
options.
'Even these are not expected to show improved profitability over the next
two to three years,' the study said.
Aside from these products, investment banking products are largely mature
and profitability is unlikely to improve from them.
Against this background, service quality rather than product innovation will
be the main avenue through which competitors seek to differentiate
themselves.

FT  02 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Petrofina shares jump on news
of safety proposals

<TEXT>
SHARES in Petrofina, the Belgian oil company, jumped in late trading on the
Brussels bourse on Friday ahead of publication of proposals by Phillips
Petroleum of the US to improve safety measures at its Ekofisk oil field,
writes Andrew Hills in Brussels.
Petrofina's shares were hit by the announcement earlier this month that the
Norwegian authorities might consider closing the Ekofisk oil and gas
processing and storage centre for safety reasons. Petrofina owns about 30
per cent of the field, which accounts for half its crude oil production.
The group's shares closed up BFr300 on Friday at BFr8,080 their highest
level since the Norwegian authorities issued their statement on October 8.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Syndicated Loans: Bankers await launch of Italian deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF syndicated bankers had to choose their least favourite credits, the
chances are that Italian names would top the list.
Last year's collapse of Federconsorzi, the Italian farm services group, and
this summer's debacle with Efim, the Italian state holding company which was
put into voluntary liquidation, have certainly reduced foreign bankers'
appetite for Italian credits.
International bankers were furious when the Italian government refused to
repay Federconsorzi's debts, since many of the banks had lent money to the
group on the understanding that it was effectively a state credit.
In Efim's case, foreign banks were told that their loans would not be repaid
in full. After months of lobbying by the foreign banks, the Italian
government announced proposals to repay the debts in full, although some of
the foreign banks involved claim they have not received full details of the
proposals.
So syndicated lenders will no doubt watch the next Italian loan closely.
Three banks - ABN Amro, Bank of America and Banca Commerciale Italiana - are
preparing a Dollars 120m five-year loan for Trans-Tunisian Pipeline Company
(TTPC) which is intended to help finance its expansion.
Although TTPC is a Jersey-registered company, the loan market regards it as
an Italian credit because it relies on a payment agreement from SNAM, the
gas pipeline subsidiary of Italian state group ENI. The pipeline carries gas
from the Algerian border across Tunisia. Another company -
Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline Company - transports the gas from Tunisia to
Sicily.
One of the bankers familiar with the borrower said that even though the deal
is regarded as Italian risk, he felt confident that the money would be
raised. 'All of the banks involved are familiar with the pipeline project,
and this borrower has done several deals in the past,' he said.
SNAM is a well-known name and some bankers believe that provided the pricing
is suitably generous, there should be little difficulty in getting the deal
done.
However, bankers are awaiting the launch of the deal with considerable
interest - not only because this could be the first real test of appetite
for an Italian deal since Efim ran into trouble with its lenders. Bankers
admit they are growing increasingly worried about lending to Italian names
because of concern over the state of the Italian economy.

FT  02 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Sweden in move to tackle bank
sector crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN will this week announce plans to set up a special authority to tackle
the crisis in the country's banking sector.
The move is part of a package of measures designed to shore up the battered
financial system and strengthen foreign confidence in it. It follows concern
that credit losses for all of Sweden's banks could reach SKr100bn (Dollars
18.7bn) over the next few years.
Details of the new proposals could be announced as early as tomorrow. It is
expected that the authority will provide loans, guarantees and capital
assistance to stricken banks and other financial institutions and play a key
role in the restructuring of the sector during the 1990s.
Mr Bo Lundgren, tax minister, said the earliest the new authority could
start operations would be the middle of next year.
The proposals are being drawn up in consultation with the opposition Social
Democrats to ensure they are approved in parliament.
The problems in the Swedish banking sector were underlined only last week
when Sparbanken Sverige announced eight-month losses of SKr6.5bn after a 62
per cent increase in loan losses to SKr10.4bn.
It warned that if losses continued at the current pace next year, it might
have to seek state support.
Earlier this year, the state had to intervene to save Nordbanken with
SKr20bn worth of grants and guarantees and Forsta Sparbanken with SKr7.3bn.
In September, the government had to pledge it would guarantee Gota Bank's
commitments after the bank indicated that credit losses this year would
reach SKr8bn.

FT  02 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Gucci denies bid speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GUCCI, the Italian luxury goods group best known for its shoes and
accessories, may be facing a return to the shareholder differences which
plunged it into difficulties in the early 1980s.
However, the company, now 50 per cent controlled by Investcorp, a
Bahrain-based investment bank, firmly denied reports that it was set to be
taken over by the UK's acquisitive Dunhill group. A Gucci official said
contacts between the two companies had been limited to meetings of middle
management to discuss possible product synergies.
Having survived family feuds and criminal charges in the 1980s, Gucci has
run into trouble because of the recession and the need for costly
restructuring.
Fast expansion in the 1980s came partly at the expense of its exclusive
image and, more recently, profits. Now, the company, guided by Mr Maurizio
Gucci, grandson of the founder, has been rationalising its range, which had
rocketed to 10,000 items, and closing outlets to project a much more
exclusive identity more closely associated with its traditions in leather
goods and accessories.
That strategy, and recessionary markets, contributed to an 18 per cent fall
in sales to L280bn (Dollars 212.9m) in 1991. The company, which has not
revealed precise earnings figures, said it broke even in 1991 and hoped to
return to profits this year.
However, falling turnover and costly restructuring is believed to have been
viewed amiss by some of Gucci's Bahrain-based shareholders. Though
Investcorp has placed about 30 per cent of its holding with local funds, it
retains voting rights.
Growing unease with the Gucci's strategy probably explains the revival of
rumours about its future.

lending up 26%

In the six months ended June 30 1992 the North of England Building Society
increased its gross mortgage lending to Pounds 172.4m, a rise of almost 26
per cent over the same period of 1991.
But the society said there was strong competition for retail funds from
National Savings, and net retail receipts fell substantially, from Pounds
24m to Pounds 13.5m.
Provision for loan losses were Pounds 400,000, but remained significantly
lower than many other competitors, the society claimed.
At June 30 the assets stood at Pounds 1.36bn, an increase of 11per cent over
the six months. Liquidity ratio dropped from 17.77 per cent to 15.8 per
cent.
Net profits for the period were Pounds 5.22m (Pounds 4.86m).

BEVERLEY Group, the engineering concern formerly known as Petrocon, reported
pre-tax profits down from Pounds 518,000 to Pounds 56,000 in an eventful six
months to the end of June. Losses for the whole of 1991 amounted to Pounds
2.57m.
In March, Petrocon acquired Beverley and in April it failed to acquire James
Wilkes in a hostile bid.
And this week the High Court approved a capital reconstruction involving the
reduction of share capital and the writing off of the share premium account
to eliminate a deficit on profit and loss reserves of Pounds 6.68m.
In addition the 12 1/2 p shares have been divided into ordinary shares of 7
1/2 p, dealings in which are expected to start today and deferred share of
5p, which have been cancelled.
Turnover increased to Pounds 9.68m (Pounds 9.2m) as a result of the Beverley
acquisition.
Earnings per share came out at 0.16p against 1.18p and the interim dividend
is being passed. There was a payment of 0.625p last time.

FT  02 NOV 92 / International Company News: HK Land is 'relaxed' with stake
in Trafalgar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG Land, which has a 14.9 per cent stake in Trafalgar House, is
unlikely to buy any more shares in the property, construction and
engineering group for at least another five months.
Mr Rodney Leach, a director of Hongkong Land who joined Trafalgar's board
last month, said: 'We are not trying to buy more shares; we have no bids in
the market.
'While we made no secret of our desire to have a bigger stake than 15 per
cent we are very relaxed with our current holding.'
When Warburg Securities, acting for Hongkong Land, offered 85p for the
ordinary shares and 82p for the A shares on October 1, it said Hongkong Land
would not buy shares above these prices for six months.
This has effectively underpinned the Trafalgar share price. The ordinary and
A shares closed on Friday at 84 1/2 p and 81 1/2 p respectively.
Mr Leach said Hongkong Land would look again at whether the group wanted to
buy more shares next year.
He was careful, however, not to close the door on the possibility of
increasing the stake before next April, although he said it was not his
intention to do so.
Hongkong Land's main priority over the next five months is to get another of
its director, Sir Charles Powell, to join Trafalgar's board.
Mr Leach, who is also a director of Jardine Matheson, said his group's
involvement in Trafalgar should not be seen as a prelude to making an
outright bid for the company.
'This is a long-term investment. We are not in the business of taking stakes
as a prelude to making bids. We do not take the cheap expedient way. We are
interested in what the profits of Trafalgar will be in five years time.'

FT  02 NOV 92 / International Company News: Critchley listing with Pounds
25m value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRITCHLEY GROUP, which makes products that help identify wires and cables
used in industrial applications, is set to join the trickle of companies
seeking a stock market listing.
Later this month, the company will seek a placing likely to raise up to
Pounds 15m, valuing the Stroud-based concern at about Pounds 25m and raising
Pounds 3m of new money for development.
Critchley's makes small plastic collar sleeves printed with numbers and
letters which assemblers use to identify the spaghetti of wires that go into
industrial control systems.
But what is interesting is the range of projects it is involved in, Mr Ian
McCallum, the managing director, says. 'The strength of the business is the
range of industries that we serve - energy, aerospace, industrial controls
and utilities. We supply the haberdashery items of the electrical industry.'
Products appear on the new Rolls-Royce Trent engine for Boeing and Airbus;
it is on Elf Enterprise Consortium's Piper B platform; and it is used on
control control systems at BNF's Sellafield plant.
Critchley made its first cable marker 40 years ago and sales are still
growing. Last year it produced profits of Pounds 2.26m from sales of Pounds
19.24m and trading has continued strongly in the first half of this year.
The most interesting development is a heat shrinkable identification label.
It fulfils a similar task as the plastic sleeves but is targetted at the
most sophisticated end of the electrical market.
These HSI label now account for more than 40 per cent of all sales of
identification business. Critchley also has an array of products that fix,
bind and manage wires.
A less interesting part of the business is Critchley Wound Components in
Nottingham, which makes small transformers for the communications and data
communications industries and which accounts for about 15 per cent of sales.
The business is mature, 'a job shop' adding value by selling labour, says Mr
Christopher Humphrey, finance director. Although the business depresses
group operating profits it will be supported as it is profitable and cash
generative
About 38 per cent of group sales are abroad, either sourced from the UK or
from plant that has been built or bought abroad.
The group is likely to focus expansion and the small 'war chest' it is
building with the placing on the cable identification part of the business.
'Identification is the most exciting area of growth,' says Mr McCallum.
'Everything in industry has to be labelled and there is a de-skilling on the
factory floor.'
Critchley started life over 100 years ago. In response to a hostile approach
from then independent M K Electric in 1984, Mr McCallum led a consortium of
institutions, including MAM and Midland Montagu, which supplied 60 per cent
of the capital in a Pounds 4.5m buy-out.
The management will share about Pounds 1.5m of the proceeds of the placement
and will be left with 11 per cent of the company. Critchley estimates the
institutions will sell about 50% of their holdings.
Impact day is expected to be in late November.

UNION International, the trading arm of the privately owned Vestey Group,
one of the largest private companies inn the UK, has returned to profit.
In the six months to June Union made operating profits of Pounds 29.1m and
pre-tax profits of Pounds 12m on sales of Pounds 584.3m. In the same period
of 1991, the respective figures were profits Pounds 18m, losses Pounds 20.5m
and Pounds 1.3bn.
The results suggest the arrival in January of Mr Terry Robinson as chief
executive has begun to make an impact on the group, that has been in talks
with its bankers all year.
Mr Robinson said the terms of a standstill agreement with 70 banks, owed
Pounds 300m, had been agreed subject to conditions which were expected to be
fulfilled imminently.
The agreement will 'formalise' the company's refinancing through to December
1994 and will allow a continuation of the strategy of debt reduction, Mr
Robinson said in a statement. All Union's bank's have signed the standstill
agreement.
Operating profits included a Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 14.9m) surplus on the
disposal of fixed assets.
Payment of dividends on the cumulative preference stocks are suspended for
the foreseeable future.

FT  02 NOV 92 / International Company News: How BT could boost shareholder
value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications could increase shareholder value by several
billion pounds through a radical change in its dividend policy, according to
a report to be published today by stockbrokers Robert Fleming Securities.
Such a change could involve giving shareholders a one-off 'mega dividend',
making large supplementary payments on top of its normal dividends.
Alternatively, it could buy in its own shares.
Larger distributions would benefit tax-free investors like pension funds.
Those payouts or share purchases would also prevent BT accumulating a cash
mountain expected to be Pounds 2.6bn by end-March 1997.
According to Mr Laurence Heyworth, of Robert Fleming, it would be better to
pay shareholders and allow them to recycle the cash to more productive
investments
If BT paid out cash, tax-exempt investors would be able to reclaim from the
Inland Revenue advance corporation tax paid on dividends.
There would, theoretically, be an advantage in distributing cash so long as
ACT payments did not exceed BT's corporation tax liabilities. Because the
company has for years paid out less than half its earnings in dividends and
such shortfalls can be carried over for six years for tax purposes, the
theoretical maximum scope for distributions would be Pounds 9.6bn.
A maximum distribution would transfer tax credits of Pounds 3.2bn to
shareholders. Those who are tax-exempt (they own about half BT's shares)
would be able to reclaim their proportion from the IR.
Even in the context of BT's stock market capitalisation of Pounds 23bn,
these are large amounts of money.
'BT is the largest of a number of leading UK companies such as British Gas
and Marks &amp; Spencer which could substantially increase the tax efficiency of
their earnings to most shareholders,' said Mr Philip Shirley, a tax
specialist of accountants Lewis Shirley.
But such a move by BT might be controversial, Mr Heyworth warned. It might
lead to complaints that the company was making excessive profits out of
customers or that it was helping holders to recoup tax at a time when
government finances were plunging heavily into the red.

FT  02 NOV 92 / International Company News: Toye incurs Pounds 742,000
losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Toye and Company, a maker of civil and military regalia, fell from profits
of Pounds 373,000 to losses of Pounds 742,000 pre-tax for the half year
ended June 30.
The loss was struck after taking account of an exceptional provision of
Pounds 202,000 for rationalisation and reorganisation.
Turnover fell Pounds 1.25m to Pounds 5.52m, the shortfall being blamed
almost entirely on a sharp fall in profitable exports. Losses per share
emerged at 24.8p (earnings 10.6p).

FT  02 NOV 92 / Fokker finds a way to flex its wings: Dasa is the strong
partner the Dutch group needs to launch a new generation of aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1917, the Red Baron, the German World War I flying ace, turned to Anthony
Fokker of the Netherlands when he needed quick, flexible flying machines to
outmanoeuvre and ultimately shoot down his larger opponents.
Now, 75 years later, the German aircraft industry is poised to take control
of Fokker's legacy, the Amsterdam-based Fokker aerospace group, in a bid to
boost its role in civil aircraft.
For Fokker, which is itself a past master at waging - and surviving - fierce
dog fights with its bigger competitors in the crowded skies of the global
aerospace industry, the deal spells the end of its independence. But the
company is counting on the financial support of Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) to
help it realise its goal of spawning a 'Fokker JetLine' range of regional
jets, based on its existing 100-seater Fokker 100.
The Fl 880m (Pounds 317m) deal, which will give Dasa 51 per cent control of
Fokker, took nearly 10 months to arrange, reflecting Dutch sensitivity to
the prospects of one of the country's proudest industrial names being
transferred to German control.
The government, whose 32 per cent stake in Fokker gave it the power of veto,
worked hard during the negotiations to ensure the Dutch company would not be
downgraded to a mere 'screwdriver' assembly plant. For Fokker's management,
the prize was Dasa's promise that Fokker would play the leading role in
looking after present and future aircraft in the 65-seat to 130-seat range.
'This means Fokker will have responsibility for the management and
profitability of the entire production process, from conceptual design to
customer-related product support activities,' the company says.
In essence, the accord gives Fokker the go-ahead to develop the Fokker 70, a
70-seater aircraft which will draw heavily on the existing Fokker 100 and
which may be launched as early as 1994. It also brings closer to reality
Dutch ambitions for a Fokker 130 in 1997, creating a three-member 'jet
family' bearing the Fokker name by the turn of the century.
The Dutch government, which came to Fokker's rescue in 1987, told the
company from the start it would need a strong industrial partner if it
wanted to launch a new generation of aircraft. Fokker has found precisely
that in Dasa, part of the Daimler-Benz industrial group.
The German-Dutch link grew out of talks aimed at persuading Dasa - whose
Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm subsidiary builds fuselages for the Fokker 100 -
to participate in the 130-seater aircraft. Specifically, Fokker hoped to
lure Dasa from plans for a rival aircraft to be built with its two partners
in the 'Regioliner' venture, Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy.
Fokker says it will now be the nucleus of the European regional jet
industry. But it knows Dasa has not dropped Aerospatiale or Alenia. Far from
it, Dasa will be inviting the French and Italians to take over part of its
Fokker stake later in the 1990s, creating a strong European consortium for
regional jets of which the Dutch company will simply be one, albeit
important, part.
The secure outlook for Fokker's role in jets with between 65 and 130 seats
contrasts sharply with prospects for its second existing aircraft, the
50-seater turboprop Fokker 50. The aircraft's biggest competitor is the ATR
42, a joint effort between Fokker's future minority shareholders,
Aerospatiale and Alenia.
In the past, Fokker complained that the Fokker 50 was failing to break into
the important US market because national subsidies in France and Italy gave
the ATR 42 an unfair price advantage. Presumably, it will be a lot less free
to criticise in future.
The outlook for the Fokker 50 was the last obstacle in the way of this
week's accord between Dasa and the Dutch government. In the end, it was
agreed the aircraft's future would be determined primarily by market forces,
and that its production could be ended, if necessary, as long as this did
not threaten Fokker's survival.
'I was never aiming for water-tight guarantees,' Mr Koos Andriessen,
minister of economic affairs, said of his negotiations with Dasa. 'I know
only too well that there has to be a certain restructuring in that segment
of the market, but if you take away the aeroplane now, the company will
disappear.'
The government will retain certain rights to help determine policy at Fokker
until the year 2000. But, ultimately, the sale of a 51 per cent stake
(through the disposal of the state's holding and a planned private
placement) means Fokker's future is inextricably bound to that of Dasa.
The German company, which recently announced more than 7,000 job losses, is
facing troubles of its own, not least uncertainty about the Euro-fighter
project and difficulties confronting the entire civil aircraft sector.
With British Aerospace looking to Taiwan for a partnership and with the rest
of the industry in a state of flux, Fokker's decision to join the
Daimler-Benz fold will not shield it entirely from the turbulence besetting
the aircraft market, even now that it will be flying in formation with its
bigger European colleagues.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Hanson silent over bid battle for RHM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD HANSON is expected to indicate early this week if he plans to trump the
Tomkins conglomerate's Pounds 935m recommended offer for Ranks Hovis
McDougall, the UK milling, baking and grocery products group, which topped
his hostile bid by Pounds 145m.
The head of the Anglo-US conglomerate maintained silence at the weekend amid
rumours that Barclays de Zoete Wedd had problems with underwriting the
Tomkins offer.
Mr Greg Hutchings, Tomkins chief executive, said last week underwriting of
the Pounds 653m one-for-two rights issue, with which Tomkins is partially
funding the bid, had gone well. However, Gartmore, with 4.4 per cent of
Tomkins' shares, declined to participate in the underwriting. This sparked
suggestions Tomkins had been forced to pull out all the stops to find
backing for the bid at the current price.
Mr Hutchings has put his former boss in a tight spot. Lord Hanson has to
weigh up the cost of being seen to be paying too much, if he increases his
bid from 220p a share, against a potential loss of reputation if he lets his
protege win.
In financial terms, a takeover of RHM would enhance earnings considerably
more for Tomkins than for the much larger Hanson group.
Also, the rights issue is structured to allow Mr Hutchings to increase the
Tomkins offer, if necessary, without asking the underwriters.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Economics Notebook: Deficits cast a shadow over growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The economic prospects for Mexico and Argentina, the second and third
largest economies in Latin America after Brazil, have been transformed in
the past five years. But amid the good news - economic growth, higher
investment and lower inflation - there is an economic indicator causing
concern: both countries face growing current account deficits of a size that
compares with those they were running before the onset of the debt crisis in
1982.
Mexico's deficit is expected to come close to Dollars 20bn (Pounds 12.2bn)
this year, 6.2 per cent of gross domestic product and a higher proportion of
gdp than during its 1977-82 borrowing spurt. Argentina's deficit is expected
to exceed Dollars 6bn, more than 4 per cent of gdp and the highest level on
record in nominal terms.
Until recently, both governments affected unconcern. The Mexican government
argued in the first place that its current account deficit was caused by
large inflows of capital into Mexico, not the other way round. Second, it
made the point that since the government was running a budget surplus, the
current account deficit was a private sector phenomenon - a function of the
lending and spending decisions by private sector actors at home and abroad -
of no concern of the government.
To British readers, the argument will be familiar as one used during Mr
Nigel Lawson's tenure of 11 Downing Street in those long-past days when the
UK government was running a budget surplus. According to this hypothesis,
the only current account deficit that should be of concern to policy-makers
was one that stemmed from a budget deficit.
If the argument holds water, both Mexico and Argentina should have no need
to worry. Mexico is expected this year to run a public sector surplus of
around 2 per cent of gdp - in sharp contrast with the budget near deficit in
1981 of 12.4 per cent of gdp - and Argentina a surplus of around 0.6 per
cent.
It is mathematically correct that a country's current account deficit is
identical to the capital account surplus, adjusted for changes in foreign
exchange reserves.
It is true, too, that because the governments are not enlarging their
borrowings and above all they are not borrowing at floating rates from
foreign banks, there is no replay in sight of the 1982 debt crisis.
However, it is also true all current account deficits are not created equal.
The issues are, first, the ability to sustain capital inflows that back the
deficit and, second, the constitution of imports. In both countries, capital
goods imports have grown considerably, suggesting a pick-up in investment
that should increase the economies' productive capacities. On the financing,
though, a significant proportion of the capital inflows are potentially
volatile, short-term funds.
As Mr Paul Luke of Morgan Grenfell says in research published last month,
worries about the levels of borrowing needed to finance the deficits can
force up the interest rates Mexican and Argentine entities must pay to
borrow abroad, and force governments to raise domestic interest rates to
attract investment, thereby slowing growth.
Developments over the past two weeks suggest that - in spite of ample
foreign exchange reserves - neither government takes a sanguine view of its
deficit. Looked at another way, they are worried about what the process of
self-correction might entail for economic growth and for their
anti-inflation strategies.
In Mexico, the government has announced a gradual widening of the target
band for the peso by doubling the maximum daily devaluation. Furthermore -
and government officials admit this is no coincidence - Mexican importers
have been meeting unusual difficulties in trying to get goods into the
country as customs are insistent on compliance with new documentation
requirements. Along similar lines, President Carlos Salinas yesterday
promised effective action against unfair trade practices.
Mr Jonathan Heath, chief economist at Macro Asesoria Economica, an economic
forecasting group in Mexico City, said: 'This is a strong indication that
the government is very worried about the current account deficit.'
The Argentine government last week also announced measures to increase
incentives for exporters - for example, they will be refunded the 18 per
cent value added tax on inputs used in products to be sold abroad - and
increased taxes on imported goods. Such actions partly reverse the
aggressive economic deregulation pursued by the government.
An important common factor between the two economies is that both
governments have been using exchange rate policy as a central plank of their
anti-inflation strategy. Argentina's peso is fixed against the dollar;
Mexico's slides on a preannounced crawling peg. The result has been, in the
view of many economists, overvalued domestic currencies in both countries
and a loss of competitiveness. Both governments therefore have to resolve a
severe dilemma of how to keep their successful anti-inflation policies on
track, while preventing a further erosion of competitiveness.
Mr Heath believes the faster devaluation of the Mexican peso should stop
erosion of Mexican competitiveness. The annual peso devaluation of 4.6 per
cent is sufficient to keep pace with the difference between expected US
inflation and that which he forecasts for Mexico over the next 12 months,
7.6 per cent. This leaves future increases in Mexican productivity to do the
job of reducing the overvaluation.
In Argentina, the government has less room for manoeuvre with its fixed
exchange rate and the measures should give its exporters a breathing space.
Furthermore, much of its current account deterioration has been caused by a
powerful neighbour pursuing an opposite exchange rate policy. While
Argentina has fixed its nominal exchange rate, Brazil has been pursuing a
policy of devaluing the cruzeiro at a rate slightly faster than inflation,
depreciating the real exchange rate. Brazilian goods have flooded into
Argentina.

FT  02 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Tomkins/RHM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Personalities apart, it is the two very distinct views of UK milling and
baking which makes the tussle for Ranks Hovis MacDougall (RHM) so absorbing.
On one side are those who claim the industry is stuck in a long-term
decline, plagued by complex structural problems and the fast-changing
patterns of retailing and distribution. On the other side are those who say
the sector is approaching the low point in the cycle, that shorn of a bit
more capacity it can still deliver respectable, if not wildly attractive
returns.
Hanson and Tomkins, whose bids were both made with the retention of RHM's
core activities in mind, naturally incline to the latter thesis.
Back-of-the-envelope calculations, though, suggest Hanson's 220p per share
cash offer - assuming he recouped most of the money by selling RHM's brands
 -would have allowed him to acquire the milling and baking for a song. By
contrast, Tomkins' offer of 270p (including a 10p dividend) appears to leave
little margin for error if anything goes wrong.
Certainly the idea that there is huge overcapacity in UK milling is an old
story. RHM has already done much to redress the balance itself, and is an
efficient player. But the fact remains that flour is a commodity product,
subject to external variables like the size and quality of the harvest. That
said, baking is indeed the trickier problem. At the moment RHM appears
caught between low-cost independent bread producers on the one hand, and
market leader Associated British Foods on the other. Given that ABF is run
more like a private than a public company - and has cash flow from sugar
coming out of its ears - there seems little reason to suppose it will
suddenly abandon its aggressive pricing policy. Tomkins ought to be able to
make large acquisition provisions if it chooses, but will be unable to
protect earnings per share indefinitely.
The City may not worry so much about Tomkins' claim that its expertise in
mowers and push bikes will help revive RHM's food brands. There will
presumably be willing buyers on hand. But savings at the Windsor head office
apart, investors are likely to require more persuading that RHM will respond
to the conglomerate treatment.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Omens bad for Angola's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAIROBI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jonas Savimbi, the hard-line leader of the rebel Unita movement, has the
future of Angola in his hands. The choice between renewed civil war or an
11th-hour negotiated settlement now lies firmly with the 58-year-old
guerrilla chief, whose troops have engaged in heavy fighting in the capital
Luanda and several other provincial towns.
Nobody, however, not even his former backers in Washington and Pretoria,
seems to know what the mercurial Mr Savimbi wants.
Is he determined to fight his way to power against seemingly impossible
odds, throwing the vast country of 10m people back into suffering and
incurring global opprobrium? Or is he still able to pull Angola from the
brink of renewed conflict, swallowing electoral defeat and seeking
reconciliation by hammering out a power-sharing deal?
Unless the ceasefire announced late last night turns into a solid diplomatic
breakthrough, Angola seems doomed to renewed conflict, with earnings from
its oil exports of 500,000 barrels a day fuelling war, rather than
rebuilding the country.
The omens are bleak. The recent eruption in fighting was the worst since Mr
Savimbi disputed the results of democratic elections in September, which he
lost to President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and the ruling MPLA party.
Since the elections, attempts to broker a summit of the two leaders, work
out a power-sharing deal and hold the second round of the presidential
election have floundered amid mutual suspicion and historical antagonisms.
Instead of committing itself to a negotiated settlement, Unita has mobilised
its troops throughout the country, apparently for a full-scale offensive.
The events of the past month, culminating in the fighting of the past 72
hours, suggest that Mr Savimbi and his hard-line generals are unable to
accept electoral defeat and participation in a government of national unity,
unless Unita is given a big slice of power.
Throughout the cold war, Unita was supported by South Africa and the US in
its battle against the Marxist MPLA, which in turn was supported by the
Soviet Union and 50,000 Cuban troops. Since the elections, though, both the
US and South Africa have made clear they are no longer interested in
fuelling an African civil war and have pressed Mr Savimbi to negotiate.
He, however, has spurned mediation efforts by both Mr Pik Botha, South
African foreign minister, and Mr Herman Cohen, US assistant secretary of
state for Africa. 'The US has no influence on Savimbi despite the hundreds
of millions of dollars they have given him. They created a Frankenstein
monster,' said one western diplomat.
Western observers remain puzzled. They point out that, even if Mr Savimbi
returns to full armed conflict, it would be impossible for Unita to win.
For all that, Unita can do great damage, having kept at least 20,000 troops
and huge stockpiles of sophisticated weapons, say military observers. In the
first weeks of fighting, Unita could seize the strategically vital
provincial towns of Huambo, Cuito and possibly the railway town of Benguela,
which all eluded Unita during the civil war.
The capture of these central towns, which all voted solidly for Unita in the
elections and are the stronghold of Mr Savimbi's Ovimbundu tribe, would
split the country in two and prepare the ground for a possible secession of
the south.
Unita could also create chaos in Luanda, though the oil-producing enclave of
Cabinda is harder to disrupt, most installations being off-shore.
Despite this short-term capacity, Unita would find it very hard to hold
territory beyond its southern strongholds. Western nations have already
warned that any government Unita organises in the south would be isolated
diplomatically and economically.
Diplomats hope Mr Savimbi will heed these realities and pull Angola back
from the precipice of disintegration. Despite last night's ceasefire Mr
Savimbi's behaviour in the past six weeks and the level of violence have
given little reason for such hope.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Management: Into the great wide open - Companies are in a
better position to exploit new opportunities if they take a broader view of
where they are going
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most powerful maxims of modern management is that companies are
best organised by splitting themselves not only into divisions or
businesses, but also into smaller 'strategic business units' focused on
particular product markets.
The approach fosters efficiency, market responsiveness and managerial
motivation, as a growing number of western companies has found over the past
decade or more - though not all of them have chosen to use the American
'strategic business unit' (SBU) terminology.
Yet there is also a groundswell of opinion that today's business units - and
even much larger divisions - provide far too narrow a set of boundaries from
which to make appropriate decisions about all tomorrow's competitive
opportunities and threats, especially those in new industries.
Such opportunities and threats may either cross boundaries between divisions
or business units, or may fall somewhere in between. As a result they may be
fought over, confronted inadequately, or just ignored. A much broader
corporate perspective needs to be taken if the company is to act
appropriately - but without the sort of bureaucracy sometimes used in the
past.
One way of trying to do this used to be to rely on senior 'functional'
executives at head office, such as chief technology officers. Even in its
heyday, this was generally inadequate. In today's streamlined matrix
structures, where divisions or businesses generally hold most power, such
functional executives lack muscle. Their perspective is also usually too
narrow - for instance, most technology officers lack market experience and
insight.
Another favourite US practice in the early 1980s, at General Electric and
elsewhere, was to overlay a laborious 'sector' structure across the
businesses and SBUs. GE then abandoned this, and has since relied instead on
less formal cross-company co-ordination. But sceptics have questioned
whether this has been really effective at putting GE in a position to
exploit the industries of the future.
GE has not been alone in having too narrow a perspective on future
industries. So, according to Dr Gary Hamel of the London Business School,
does Digital Equipment, together with most large western companies - in
stark contrast with many of their Japanese rivals.
On the other hand, Hamel argues that Kodak, Apple, Motorola and Hughes
Aircraft are all looking beyond the boundaries of their current businesses
in order to harness the 'core competences' which underpin several of them.
Such competences include Apple's experience in software and 'user-friendly'
interfaces, and Kodak's skills in chemical photography and digital imaging.
The latter have been combined successfully to produce several cross-business
products, notably Kodak's 'photo compact disc', which allows high-resolution
video images to be stored, retrieved and altered.
Because of the sensitivity of all the strategic and organisational issues
involved, a presentation by Hamel on 'competing for industry futures'
excited intense debate among the executives, academics and consultants at
last month's annual conference of the international Strategic Management
Society, held this year in London.
Hamel shares most academics' penchant for jargon, but his prescription is
powerful all the same. Among other things, it calls for radical change in
the sorts of strategic concepts and techniques which companies employ, and
the way they use existing ones. His prescription is summarised below.
If companies want to 'compete for industry futures', rather than just for
shares of existing markets, they must recognise several new guiding
principles, says Hamel. Doing so is much more important than any structural
reorganisation which may also be necessary. The principles include the
following:
New industries are emerging out of all sorts of existing ones, and in the
'white space' between them. Hamel cites nine examples, ranging from digital
television to multi-media systems and applications, and from gene-engineered
drugs and branch-less banking to intelligent vehicle and highway systems.
Many new industries offer opportunities to rivals from a range of
backgrounds. For instance, companies are coming at the emerging 'digital
industry' from consumer electronics, professional electronics, entertainment
and publishing, professional systems, information technology services,
software, and telecommunications.
Competing for such 'industry futures' is therefore of a different character
from current competition for 'market position'. Instead of competition being
between products, it is between companies. Instead of being for
'stand-alone' opportunities, it is for systemic ones. (Hence Kodak's
reconception of itself as an 'imaging company', using both chemical and
digital technology.) Instead of speed of execution being the key,
perseverance is. And instead of competition being for cost and quality
leadership, it is for intellectual leadership.
The conventional assumptions and tools of industrial analysis 'just don't
apply' - the boundaries of each industry are unknown and unstable; it is
hard to differentiate between customers, suppliers and competitors; and
'strategy' is about positioning the company in new, not existing, 'industry
space'.
In this context of uncertainty, companies such as Apple, Kodak and Motorola
 -just like, for example, Sony and NEC in Japan - act as 'nodes'. That is,
they have built core competences which will be valuable under a broad
variety of industry outcomes; they feel they have more to gain from changing
the rules of their industry than from abiding by them; they actively manage
the process of transition into new industries; and they build networks of
alliances which have a cumulative logic to them, rather than just a series
of one-by-one relationships.
Competition for industry futures takes place in three phases. The first,
akin to preparing for a marathon, includes understanding potential patterns
of evolution in core competences, in technical functionality, and in
customer patterns. It also includes aligning corporate resources within a
strategic framework (or 'strategic architecture') that shows how various
technological and other developments may fit together as the new industry
emerges. NEC published such a framework as far back as 1977 for the
integration of computers and communications - a process which is occurring
only now.
The second phase is akin to the long, hard slog of the marathon proper. It
involves competing for the acquisition of competences, and for product
concepts and standards. It involves building alliances (or 'coalitions') of
companies which share the same view of the future; these coalitions then
compete with each other for market learning.
The third phase, 'like the final 100-metre sprint', involves competing for
market share and profits around the world. Most western top management time
is spent just on this phase, 'yet nothing happens here unless someone has
been busy on phases one and two, winding up the mainspring in the clock,'
says Hamel. Like IBM, companies can hold market leadership long after they
have lost in phases one and two. But eventually the spring unwinds and
leaves them floundering. Kodak, by contrast, has been investing in phase
one, creating 'stored energy' for the future.
In deciding which core competences to build, companies should ask three
questions. First, which competences will allow them to exploit discontinuous
changes in industries - their own or those of others? Second, which core
competences (such as flat screen displays) will provide 'gateways' to future
markets? And third, which core competences would provide influence over
other industry players? Sony's near-monopoly of the skills of
miniaturisation is an obvious example here.
As a result of all the above, companies, when they are competing for the
future, need to think very differently from usual about the meaning of that
all-important goal, 'market share'. It can have at least six meanings: share
of technology creation (where the west's share is high in most industries);
share of core competence (where it is much lower in a growing number); share
of 'core platform' (such as Canon's stranglehold over laser printer
'engines' for western companies); share of a format or standard (eg the
Japanese VHS format for cassette recorders); share of end-product
manufacturing; and finally, the usual definition of brand share.
If a company controls the manufacturing of 'core platforms', says Hamel, it
has ultimate control over the share of end-product. Hence the tendency in a
number of industries for Japanese companies to focus on achieving a high
share of both, leaving US and European companies clinging to the consolation
prize of high brand shares - for the moment, anyway.
Strategy has been seen traditionally in the west as a positioning game
within existing businesses, rather than as the creation of new ones, Hamel
told the Strategic Management Society conference. 'Everybody in Europe
worries today about market share in the car business, or in semiconductors.
Yet the question for the rest of the decade and beyond is 'what is your
share of new business creation?' Chief executives and their teams need to
make a far greater intellectual investment in thinking about the future than
most of them are.'

MR FABIANO Fabiani, managing director of Italy's state-controlled

offer to buy assets from Efim, the state holding company put into voluntary
liquidation in July.
Finmeccanica has proposed to buy Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie (BCF), Efim's
railway equipment subsidiary. which would then be merged with Finmeccanica's
quoted Ansaldo Trasporti subsidiary.
The combined companies, creating Italy's biggest rail equipment company,
would form the railway equipment group which has for years been the
unrealised dream of Italy's sometimes warring public-sector companies.
In a letter to Mr Alberto Predieri, Efim's special administrator, Mr Fabiani
is reported to have offered to pay cash for BCF, which made net group
profits of L5.7bn (Dollars 4.3m) on sales of L512bn last year. The company,
which has net debts of L219bn, has built a reputation for its rolling stock
and equipment for urban mass transit systems, sold successfully in the US.
Finmeccanica's interest in acquisitions, the motor for its recent growth,
has been tempered by growing indebtedness and the effects of recession. Last
month, it gained a stock market quotation via the reverse takeover of Sifa,
a quoted subsidiary.
The transaction should have been the first stage in a series of capital
increases raising up to L1,700bn. However, the financial problems of IRI,
Finmeccanica's parent, and poor sentiment on the bourse have led the deal to
be postponed indefinitely.
Finmeccanica is known to be keen on bidding for Nuovo Pignone, the turbines
and compressors subsidiary of the ENI energy and chemicals group. Merging
Nuovo Pignone with Finemccanica's existing Ansaldo turbines business would
form the biggest turbine-maker in Italy.
Although bankers think Nuovo Pignone will be sold via an international
auction, many expect that Finmeccanica will emerge as the winner.
Creating large near-monopolies in railway equipment and turbines could
ensure steady business for Finmeccanica from Italy's state-owned railway and
electricity generating groups, currently involved in very heavy investment
drives.
Successful incorporation of the state-owned assets now for sale could be the
prelude to a large internal restructuring for Finmeccanica.
Many bankers believe the company plans to buy out minority interests in
quoted subsidiaries such as Alenia, in favour of having Finmeccanica as the
single quoted vehicle. Minority shareholders in the subsidiaries would be
offered shares in the parent company in exchange for their existing
holdings.

Hill Samuel
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HILL SAMUEL Investment Management is losing its 'active quantitative' fund
management team to State Street Boston Global Advisers in a move which
highlights growing demand in the UK for the computer-based stock selection
technique.
The team's leader, Mr Alan Greenhorn, who is also a director of HSIM, has
developed one of Hill Samuel's most successful asset management products,
known as Active Value Management.
It has Pounds 450m under management for 11 clients, most of whom are pension
funds. Among its clients are Emmanuel College, Cambridge, Cable and Wireless
Pension Fund and Allied Lyons Pension Fund.
Meanwhile, Hill Samuel has told State Street that it intends to strictly
enforce terms of Mr Greenhorn's contract which bars him from working for a
competitor for six months after having given a resignation notice.
That clause, frequently inserted in fund managers' contracts, is intended to
ensure that they do not poach clients for their new employer.
Hill Samuel said that while it was disappointed to lose the team, it had
already arranged to replace it with other quantitative experts.
The company has taken steps to reassure its clients about the new management
team. 'We've reassured them that the database and the systems will all
remain,' Hill Samuel said. In total, Hill Samuel manages Pounds 9.6bn in the
UK.
Active quantitative management, a technique pioneered in the US, involves
the use of large quantities of data entered on computer software to make
stock selections.
Mr Greenhorn said that the technique allows fund managers to identify
characteristics likely to occur in underperforming stocks and avoid them.
State Street, in its US operations, has been a leading provider of active
and passive quantitative fund management techniques.
Mr Greenhorn will be joined at State Street by five others from Hill Samuel
who will join as their management contracts expire.

FT  02 NOV 92 / US regulators close big Texas bank: First City's main
subsidiaries insolvent - Dollars 500m rescue for depositors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK

<TEXT>
FIRST City Bancorporation of Houston, one of the largest banks in Texas, has
been closed down by US regulatory authorities because two of its main
subsidiaries are insolvent.
At the same time the regulators have put up Dollars 500m (Pounds 306.7m) to
protect depositors. This bailout of First City, with assets of Dollars 8.8bn
and 900,000 customer accounts in its 20 banks, is one of the costliest ever,
and the second time regulators have had to come to the aid of the troubled
bank.
Closure of a leading Texas bank comes at a politically sensitive time for
President George Bush, who has strong ties to the state. Texas-based
billionaire Mr Ross Perot, the independent challenger in tomorrow's
presidential election, has criticised the administration for its stewardship
of the country's banking system.
In 1988, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) spent more than
Dollars 900m trying to shore up First City. The slump in the local property
market and mounting problem foreign loans meant the plan, masterminded by Mr
Robert Abboud, former chairman of the First Chicago Corporation, did not
stem losses.
After failing to find a partner to save the group, First City unveiled in
August a plan to raise capital by selling 13 subsidiaries. Regulators,
however, found the plan would not shore up the group's capital.
The final act came after the office of the comptroller of the currency, one
of the industry's main regulators, discovered last week that a
management-led recovery plan for First City Bank of Houston, the largest
subsidiary of the First City group, was inadequate. First City of Houston
had only Dollars 15m in capital, but needed to make substantial provisions
for its reserves to cover potential loan losses.
After deciding to close First City, the FDIC established 'bridge banks' to
assume deposits, and other assets and liabilities of the group. Full
protection will be given to the 16 subsidiaries that had adequate capital,
but customers with deposits of more than Dollars 100,000 at the four
insolvent banks in Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio are expected to
face losses.
Regulators will now try to find buyers for some or all of the 20 banks in
the group. Industry observers say Chemical Banking Corporation, which
already owns a large Texas bank, may acquire part or all of First City.
The closing of First City means regulators have closed 104 banks with assets
of Dollars 36.6bn this year.

FT  02 NOV 92 / Lufthansa pulls out of race for Continental Airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA, the German state airline, yesterday pulled out of the race to buy
Continental Airlines just days before the November 9 deadline for final
bids.
Lufthansa said it had not been able to clarify all the 'open issues'
concerning the bid for the US carrier, which has been operating under
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since 1990. The withdrawal is a blow to
Lufthansa's strategy to forge international links in response to alliances
in recent years by British Airways, Air France and KLM, the Dutch carrier.
It said it would renew efforts to seek a partner to improve its share of the
North Atlantic market.
The big three US carriers - American, United and Delta - have also been
aggressively expanding their European operations. Lufthansa's biggest threat
has come from Atlanta-based Delta, which last year acquired Pan Am's
European routes and Frankfurt hub.
It also has to see through a restructuring proposed in September to cut
operating losses expected to rise to DM1.2bn (Pounds 480m) this year from
DM800m.
The airline and Mr Marvin Davis, a Los Angeles-based billionaire, offered to
buy Continental in September for Dollars 100m in cash and Dollars 300m of
corporate bonds.
Their departure from the bidding comes less than three weeks after the
withdrawal of another group, Benefit Concepts, of New York which was
designing a Dollars 425m offer based on employee share ownership schemes.
The bids by Benefit Concepts and Lufthansa were the highest and the second
highest respectively of offers on the table.
Three bidders remain: an investor group headed by Mr Charles Hurwitz, a
Texas-based businessman, an offer from Mr Alfredo Bresner, whose family owns
a large stake in Mexicana Airlines, and an offer from Air Canada with
another Texan investment group.
All three proposals are similar in design and to Lufthansa's defunct bid.
The investors would put up cash in return for a majority equity stake in the
carrier once it emerged from bankruptcy, with creditors being offered a
minority interest.
This would be done in conjunction with the airline's reorganisation plan.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN DENMARK'S foreign minister, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, sets out this week
to sell his country's ideas on the Maastricht treaty to the other European
Community governments, he will leave behind an administration adrift on a
sea of domestic troubles.
These problems could become so acute within the next few weeks that the
prime minister, Mr Poul Schluter, might have to resign after 10 years in
office.
This would almost certainly precipitate an election in which the opposition
Social Democratic party would have an excellent chance of emerging as the
winner, with its leader, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, as the next prime
minister.
All this would be happening at a particularly difficult moment, with Denmark
to assume the presidency of the Community on January 1, but a change of
government might help gain Danish electoral acceptance for the Maastricht
treaty next year.
When the treaty was voted down by referendum last June, the result was
determined by the fact that 60 per cent or more of the supporters of the
Social Democratic party rejected their party's advice and voted against.
In government, the party's authority and ability to persuade its supporters
to back the treaty in a second referendum would be much greater, according
to a senior diplomat.
The government's troubles have nothing to do with Maastricht, but are
related to a series of political-administrative scandals.
The most serious is the long-running 'Tamil scandal'. In 1987, a minister of
justice broke the law by denying the right of Tamil refugees in Denmark to
bring in their close relatives to join them.
The prime minister had no part in his minister's action but, in April 1989,
he reported to parliament on the matter with the words: 'Nothing has been
swept under the carpet'.
A judicial inquiry, conducted by High Court Judge Mogens Hornslet, has spent
almost two years trying to establish whether there is a case for further
proceedings against any of the ministers or civil servants involved. The
judge's report is expected early next month.
Politicians and political commentators believe Mr Schluter will have to
resign if the report criticises him either directly or implicitly.

Ms Segolene Royal, the French minister for the environment, and Mr Carlo
Ripa di Meana, her Italian counterpart, agreed yesterday, during their

One would be in an area between Corsica and Sardinia, the other by the
Hyeres islands off the French port of Toulon, where naval traffic and
fishing would be severely restricted.
The two ministers are forming a working party to finalise proposals for
special nature zones in the Mediterranean.
They are also joining Mr Flavio Cotti, their opposite number in Switzerland,
to try to impose environmental protective measures on the rail network

FT  02 NOV 92 / Private armies bring instability to Tajikistan: A Central
Asian power struggle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ORDER has so deteriorated in the former Soviet Union's south-eastern corner
that political power now hinges on the loyalty of competing private armies,
and, ironically, the long-hated Russian army.
Six months of turmoil in Tajikistan, where the strongest private armies
fought for power in a failed coup attempt a week ago, have made it the least
stable of the 15 ex-Soviet republics.
The capital of Dushanbe, under a 10pm-to-5am curfew, is controlled by these
irregular forces and the Russian army. Acting President Akhbarshah
Iskandarov travels around in an armoured personnel carrier. Shops have been
locked shut for a week and no food is to be bought other than onions,
potatoes and cabbages.
Tajik officials do not expect things to improve soon, admitting that the
government's dependence on untrained, volunteer forces, some of which
include criminal gang members, is inherently risky. 'Criminal gangs have no
religion, no ideas. They remain with those who pay them well, and with whom
they feel influence,' said Col Jurabek Aminov, deputy chief of Tajikistan's
KGB.
Since the Soviet Union collapsed last December and left the emerging
republics without their own armies, irregular forces have risen to
importance both in Central Asia and the Caucasus mountains. They helped
bring down governments in Azerbaijan and Georgia.
They emerged in Russia itself last weekend. The government of the Russian
Caucasian republic of North Ossetia announced it would distribute arms to
volunteers to help crush an uprising by the minority Ingush.
As in Tajikistan, Russian forces have been deployed to prop up North
Ossetia's government.
Tajikistan's current trouble can be traced to a 51-day rebellion in the
capital that ended in May when then-president Rakhmon Nabiyev handed over
some power to the opposition. In the rebellion, volunteers loyal to both
sides fought in the streets and more than 200 people died. Afterwards,
despite the settlement, the competing forces went south to the region of
Kurgan-Tyube and began fighting there; officials estimate deaths there at
more than 1,000 and say some 250,000 Tajiks have become refugees. In
September, opposition fighters forced Mr Nabiyev to resign at gunpoint.
About 50 private armies, some of them criminal syndicates, have carved
Tajikistan up into areas of influence, say diplomats and Tajik officials.
Most of them possess arsenals of Soviet-made weapons bought illegally from
Russian soldiers or smuggled from neighbouring Afghanistan. The weapons are
bought at a high price, and no one is sure where the money comes from,
though government officials speak darkly of 'outside forces' financing the
fighting. In the last week, the price of a Kalashnikov automatic rifle rose
from Rbs170,000 to Rbs250,000.
One of the most important forces is commanded by Mr Juma Khan, who is loyal
to the government. His army, which he calls Tajikistan Youth, forced Mr
Nabiyev's resignation. It happened at the local airport. With Mr Nabiyev in
the airport's VIP lounge, Mr Khan's men moved in tanks and armoured
personnel carriers, and reportedly threatened to fire on the building.
Mr Khan also helped crush the October 26-27 coup attempt by rebels who
wanted to reinstall Mr Nabiyev. The attempt failed when, with Russian troops
taking control of roads and key strategic installations in the capital,
private armies loyal to Mr Nabiyev failed to reach Dushanbe to counter those
of Mr Khan's and other, allied forces.
Mr Khan is now among the most powerful men in Dushanbe. His forces man
checkpoints around the capital. Recently, he boasted to reporters that he
had bought three Soviet tanks and 10 armoured personnel carriers.
In the failed coup attempt, three of Mr Nabiyev's most important militia
commanders were either killed or wounded. But the most notorious of them - a
convicted murderer named Mr Sangak Safarov - remains healthy, and the word
last week was that he might be organising a new assault against the capital.
In addition, some Tajik officials are predicting that forces now allied with
the government will eventually splinter and have their own, bloody struggle
for power.
As it stands, the Tajik government controls little territory outside the
capital and it may not even control that. It is not clear how it can soon
stabilise the country.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANGOLA appeared to be slipping inexorably into renewed civil war yesterday
as heavy fighting continued across the country between government forces and
troops of the rebel Unita movement.
Fears are rising that the latest round of pitched battles, the most bloody
since Unita disputed the results of September's elections, will scotch
remaining attempts to broker a negotiated settlement.
The fighting threatens UN-led efforts to bring Angola through a 17-month
transition to peace and democracy after a ceasefire was signed in May 1991,
ending a civil war that began at independence in 1975.
According to the Portuguese news agency Lusa at least 300 people, including
two United Nations peacekeeping staff, have been killed in clashes in the
capital Luanda since Thursday night, and corpses and abandoned weapons
littered the city's deserted streets yesterday.
Although the fighting subsided yesterday, mortars and grenades continued to
fall on parts of the city, particularly in the Unita stronghold of Miramar,
a suburb of Luanda. Bursts of heavy machine-gun fire erupted in the downtown
area.
Russian Mi-8 helicopter gunships circled the city and the government put
into force an all-day curfew and threw up road blocks around the city.
Foreign residents bunkered down in hotels and private residences.
Fighting was also raging yesterday for control of the key cities of
Benguela, Lobito, Huambo and Cuito in the Unita tribal strongholds of the
central provinces. Unita also seized several diamond-producing areas in the
north and south of the country.
South African President Mr FW de Klerk, whose country sent support and
troops to aid Unita throughout most of the civil war, added his voice
yesterday to international appeals calling for a ceasefire in the fighting
and fresh peace talks between President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Mr Jonas
Savimbi, the leader of Unita.
Mr Savimbi, however, appeared increasingly isolated and immune from
international pressure, most recently expressed by a United Nations Security
Council Resolution passed late Friday night which demanded an immediate end
to the violence and threatened action against any party endangering peace.
Luanda airport was closed yesterday and commercial flights into the capital
have been cancelled. Britain, the US, Portugal, South Africa and Brazil were
attempting to evacuate their nationals as international efforts to pull the
vast country away from further conflict appeared increasingly futile.
Several hundred people were evacuated by air and sea over the weekend but
evacuation plans are being constrained by lack of movement in the city and
continued fighting near the airport.
Portugal is trying to evacuate 40,000 nationals by air and sea.

Correction (published 5th November 1992) appended to this article
NIKON, the leading Japanese camera and precision equipment manufacturer, has
reported operating losses of Y248bn (Dollars 2bn) for the first six months
to September, largely due to a steep fall in sales of semiconductor
manufacturing equipment. This compares with operating profits of Y5.39bn a
year earlier.
Pre-tax profits fell by 81.9 per cent to Y1bn, while net profits slid by
73.8 per cent to Y645m. Only the redemption of Y1.1bn of dollar denominated
bonds allowed the company to record pre-tax profits.
Nikon's turnover fell by 14.7 per cent to Y104,273bn. However, sales of
semiconductor equipment, which last year accounted for a third of the
company's sales, fell by almost 50 per cent to Y19bn in the six months from
Y37bn.
Sales of cameras fell to Y48bn from Y51bn. Only sales of spectacle lenses,
frames, sunglasses and binoculars increased, to Y16bn from Y13bn.
Nikon hopes to contain its operating deficit for the year to March to about
Y2.5bn, with cost savings in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment
division.
Nikon declared an unchanged interim dividend of Y4.50.
CORRECTION
Nikon announced operating losses of Y2.48bn (dollars 20.3m) on sales
of Y104.27bn for the six months to September 30. These figures were
incorrectly reported in the FT on November 2.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Property: Stately homes saved from the ruins - Many owners
of listed houses do not look after them / A look at ways in which local
government can safeguard history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS an imposing village house, listed Grade II, in an awful state. After
thieves had stripped the lead from the roof valley, the rain poured in.
'I had never seen such virulent dry rot', said Mike Pearson, conservation
officer of South Northamptonshire Council. 'It was a textbook example'.
But the council thought the building worth saving. It tried to deal with the
elusive owner and eventually served a Repairs Notice in 1988, requiring him
to do the necessary work. When the time limit on that expired, they took a
deep breath and served the sequel - a Compulsory Purchase Order - deciding
to do the job themselves. It was a rare move in the fight to keep a fine
house, but they will soon be rewarded.
The Elms at Eydon, a pretty upland village between Banbury and Daventry, is
now safe and sound, and on the market at Pounds 225,000 with Savills
(0295-263535). The new owner will get a handsome family house, 17th century
with a smart 1830 front added to make a show on the main road to the
important village of Woodford Halse. There is also a large old bakehouse
that will make a fine place for grandmother, or a couple, and an overgrown
garden best decribed as an opportunity.
What matters is that the house is now rot-free, reslated, retiled, and
watertight. It is hard to guess what bad shape it was in when the council
decided that, as the planning authority, it should not just tell others what
to do but be seen to be doing it. 'An excellent example of a local authority
putting its money where its mouth is', said Charles Wagner of English
Heritage which gave a Pounds 60,000 grant under its Buildings at Risk
scheme.
The first job was to clear the rubbish fill from the cellar, revealing the
wine bins. Then architect Andrew Brookes of Rodney Melville in Leamington
Spa and contractors Marriott from Rushden, who both specialise in historic
buildings, set about undoing a rabbit warren of little rooms that the
reclusive owner had forced into the house. 'The partitions went up as he
retreated from the world.'
The house gradually returned to its proper self. As the smell of rot
dispersed, a diversity of spaces and heights appeared which will make it an
exciting place for the new owner to finish. the council has wisely left it a
shell building. All the important work has been done to the highest
standards, and checked by both the council and English Heritage. Now
completion and decoration await. It is an unusual opportunity to reclaim a
period house as you want it, rather than gamely enduring the previous
owner's notions.
Repairs Notices are rare, but councils are using them more under the
Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. If you own a
deteriorating listed building, it is wise to know what is involved.
The philosophy is simple. Owners have a legal obligation to keep listed
buildings in good repair. If they let them fall apart, the council can issue
a Repairs Notice. This is two-fold: it requires specified works to be done
forthwith to restore the building to its state when listed, and it is the
preliminary in law to compulsory purchase. Usually the council does not
serve the Notice until after it has tried every other way of persuasion. The
threat of the Notice is an effective weapon. And if it is served, most
owners comply quickly for fear of losing their property, though they can
appeal to the magistrates court if the list of jobs seems excessive.
An alternative is the Urgent Works Notice, which does not lead to the
ultimate sanction of compulsory purchase. As it may mean a smaller
commitment and fewer legal costs for the council, some councils see them as
the better solution. Their intent is to provide essential repairs for vacant
buildings. Cherwell District Council is preparing one for Grimsbury Manor, a
superb building on the edge of a Banbury industrial estate near the M40,
which has planning permission to make it a corporate headquarters. But no
work has been done and vandals are wrecking the place. It is essential to
protect it now against the weather, or it will suffer as badly as The Elms.
If the council issues a Repairs Notice and the owner ignores it, the next
relentless step is a Compulsory Purchase Order which the Secretary of State
for the Environment must confirm, perhaps after an appeal (public inquiry).
The council then acquires the building at a market value determined by the
District Valuer on the basis of its use and condition. If the council shows
that it has been deliberately neglected, compensation is minimal. The owners
lose their building, and can do little about it, as the House of Lords
confirmed in the case of Willesborough Windmill near Ashford in Kent. In
1969 the owner bought this 100-year-old windmill, in use till 1938 and
listed in 1951, to turn into a house. By 1983 it had deteriorated so badly
that Ashford Borough Council issued a Repairs Notice. Little was left of the
sweeps and the catwalk round the base of the mill had gone. When it came to
the public inquiry, the owner said he was taking steps to preserve the
building. As the inspector concluded that that was not the case, the DOE
confirmed the Order. The owner went to the High Court, Appeal Court and
House of Lords, and lost each time.
If the council acquires a building in this way, it usually passes it on to a
Building Preservation Trust, or sympathetic developer or individual, as Bob
Kindred, Conservation Officer for Ipswich Borough Council, shows in his
recent report on Listed Building Repairs Notices.
the council may be unique in doing the whole course itself from attempting
negotiations, through Notice and Order, to repairs and sale. It is a lengthy
process which will not be able to cope if too many of the owners of the
37,000 listed buildings English Heritage sees as 'at risk' renege on the
obligations of ownership. But at present it is clear that the councils have
no lack of powers to safeguard listed buildings - though the money they need
may be another matter - and have the backing of English Heritage.
Neither the DOE nor National Heritage has ordered any copies of Kindred's
report, but National Heritage has issued a Repairs Notice, for a terrace
building that was part of the Baths at Matlock in Derbyshire.
Owners, be warned. Look after what you own.

enough to tempt the ancient rulers of Sarmarkand.
Furthermore, I take the even less attractive standpoint, from the view of
manufacturers, that old is much nicer than new. Finely-woven, smooth as
silk, old linen sheets cannot be beaten for imbuing the nightly ritual of
bed and oblivion with a sense of luxe and well-being.
I know, I know . . .they are murder to launder and after just one night on
the bed they look as if they had witnessed much more than a sedate night's
sleep. You may be as surprised as I to learn that at The Mandarin hotel in
Hong Kong, where staff change the linen sheets daily, if you crumple them by
enjoying an afternoon snooze the housekeeper changes them again in the
evening.
For those, like me, who enjoy fine linen, antique fairs and markets often
yield happy finds. I have picked up embroidered linen bedspreads, cotton
woven Marcella bedspreads and embroidered sheets all at prices way below
those in the smarter shops. For those who do not have the time or do not
enjoy scrummaging around antique stalls there are quite a few specialist
shops where antique textiles of all sorts can be found.
In London, Lunn Antiques, both in its original shop at 86 New King's Road,
SW6 and its brand new one at 21 Cucumber Alley, Thomas Neal's, Covent
Garden, has built up a reputation for being a sure source of marvellous old
bedlinens.
When it comes to sheets Stephen and Juliette Lunn only deal in linen. A good
indicator of quality, according to Stephen, is the thread count - the larger
the number of threads used per square inch in the weave, the finer the
thread, the better the quality.
In much modern linen the thread count has become less in order to keep the
price down (an honourable exception is the Irish Linen Board which ensures
standards - and that also means thread counts - are kept up).
'If the linen feels floppy, it's a sure sign of a worn-out piece,' says
Stephen. 'Linen should have body and some dealers pack it with starch to
give an impression of body. Each time linen is washed it loses some of its
molecular surface so careful washing is essential.'
In grand old country houses, where most of the second-hand and antique linen
sheets started out in life, one person used to be in charge of the linen
cupboard and sheets were numbered and used carefully in rotation.
So munificently stocked were these linen cupboards that many of the sheets
that come on to the market have never been used.
At Lunn Antiques a pair of plain, hem-stitched, linen double sheets with
good hand-finished hems costs about Pounds 125. Single size ones are more
plentiful and cost about Pounds 65 a pair. Lavishly embroidered ones start
at about Pounds 125 each.
At the moment there are four truly exceptional sheets - 'the best I've ever
stocked,' says Stephen Lunn, no doubt to explain the price of Pounds 500
each.
They are 9 ft by 12 ft each, of the smoothest linen, with fine handwork,
deep borders of needle and bobbin lace and embroidered with the coronet and
monogram of the Countess of Westmoreland who married in 1892. The 12 ft
length is to enable the sheet to be turned back to reveal the beautiful
handwork. To put the price into perspective it is worth knowing that at The
Irish Linen Shop, in the Burlington Arcade, a pair of plain, linen double
sheets with a two-row cord finish sells for Pounds 310, while a hemstitch
finish is Pounds 395.
If you cannot run to those prices even a pair of handworked pillowcases
gives an air of luxe to almost any bed. At Lunn Antiques a pair would set
you back anything from Pounds 38 for plain hem-stitched ones to about Pounds
95 for very lavish ones.
Most towns sport a good supplier of antique textiles. Hand in Hand, for
instance, at 3 North West Circus Place, Edinburgh has double linen sheets
that range in price from Pounds 60 to Pounds 140, standard size pillowcases
range from Pounds 35 and linen bedcovers with intricate embroidery or drawn
threadwork start at Pounds 75.
In Bath, Avon, there are two marvellous shops which seem to me to have
friendly prices - Collectable Costume at 6 Bladud Buildings had, when I was
there, beautiful plain white quilted 18th century Marcella bedspreads, fine
embroidered pillowslips and lots of embroidered and lace-trimmed bedspreads.
It is also worth looking in on Penny Philip, at 5 London Street, Bath, who
has a lot of French homespun linen, including 19th century double linen
sheets for Pounds 45, turn-of- -the-century pillowcases with cotton lace and
white embroidery at about Pounds 35 each and double Jacquard, woven, white,
cotton counterpanes for Pounds 65.
After linen, next best has to be 100 per cent cotton. The cheapest ones I
could track down come from - you've guessed - Marks &amp; Spencer. At Pounds
11.99 a time for singles and Pounds 15.99 for doubles, in pure white cotton,
they are commendably plain and simple.
If you like a more old-fashioned style Cologne &amp; Cotton is a company worth
knowing. Just three years old it has started 'to reintroduce the pleasures
of . . . two completely natural products, 100 per cent pure cotton bed and
table linen, and a range of eaux de colognes based on original 18th century
formulas.'
All the bedlinen is in pure cotton, much of it beautifully hand-embroidered
and prices are very user-friendly. For those who cannot get to the shop at
74 Regent Street, Leamington Spa or the two concessions at 3 Broad Street,
Bath or 9 Little Clarendon Street, Oxford, the complete range is available
by mail order.
There is a pure white collection - a double duvet cover with drawn-thread
work and cutwork detail is Pounds 46.95, double sheets, classically plain
but beautifully hemstitched are Pounds 39.95, Jacquard cotton bedspreads,
woven in Damascus, start at Pounds 44.95 for the single size and go on up to
Pounds 64.95 for the King size.
Photographed here (below) is a crisp blue and white check range - duvet
covers start at Pounds 19.95 for a single, standard pillowcase are Pounds
8.50. Tel: 0926- 332573 for a free catalogue.
More nostalgic charm from Damask - anything from absolutely plain white
cotton napkins with drawn threadwork edging to pukka old-fashioned
eiderdowns. For those who like the sweet simplicity of pure white there is a
whole range of white, cotton, hand-embroidered sheet sets. The Athene range,
for instance, includes a hand-embroidered sheet with fine drawn threadwork,
at Pounds 70 for a single sheet and similarly embroidered pillowcase.
There is a big range of pillowcases - every shape from traditional oblong to
continental squares and bolsters. There is a creamy woven cotton bedspread
and the enchanting reversible eiderdown in old-fashioned cabbage rose prints
(Pounds 225 for the single size, Pounds 270 double).
The Damask range is widely available from: Harrods of Knightsbridge, London,
SW1; The General Trading Company, 144 Sloane Street, London SW1; And So To
Bed, 638-640 Kings Road, London SW6; Homework, 12 Swan Street, Wilmslow,
Cheshire; The Hambledon Gallery, 42-44 Salisbury Street, Blandford, Dorset;
and Woods of Harrogate. A brochure is available for Pounds 2.50 from Damask
Furnishings &amp; Fineries, Unit 7 &amp; 10, Sulivan Enterprise Centre, Sulivan
Road, London SW6 (or tel: 071-731-3470).
At Liberty, of Regent Street, the onslaught of winter has brought a rash of
tucking-up ideas - on the third floor a beautiful collection of handforged
iron bedsteads and bases made by a blacksmith in Cumbria are perfect props
for a collection of outrageously pretty bedlinen. For purists there is
Nimble Fingers' range of crisp, white cotton and linen mixes, most of the
pieces hand-edged.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Man In The News: Master of ceremonies - Helmut Kohl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a good week for Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
The great survivor of German politics, the great prevaricator, master of
double-speak, and yet at the end of the day the one-and-only coalition
leader, consensus-builder and unification chancellor, was in his element.
He came to the annual conference of his ruling Christian Democratic Union
(CDU) in Dusseldorf looking bruised and embattled. Only a month before, the
German press was writing him off, openly speculating about the imminence of
a palace putsch and a grand coalition government with the opposition Social
Democrats (SPD).
His popularity was on the floor, languishing behind the ratings of his
greatest rivals such as Mr Bjorn Engholm, leader of the SPD and Mr
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister. Mr Kohl was accused of
indecision and weak leadership, there was open grumbling in the party ranks,
and deep divisions between the party barons from east and west Germany. Not
to mention the gathering gloom on all sides of the German economy, as the
hoped-for autumn revival slid towards a winter depression.
The celebrations of his 10 years as German chancellor, on October 1, had a
decidedly half-hearted air, even if he did promise to decorate his office
with a montage of all the newspaper headlines predicting his imminent
demise.
Then he pulled a strange rabbit out of his conference hat, and it was enough
to secure him re-election as party leader with acclamation, to see his
proposals swept through, and his critics silenced.
It all added up to a brilliant piece of party stage-management.
It is not at all clear that the rabbit he produced will add up to any
serious strategy to deal with the overwhelming problem in hand: how to pay
for the soaring bill of German unification. Mr Kohl's proposal is to
threaten in advance a tax rise in 1995 - conveniently after 1994, when the
country faces no fewer than nine important elections - to bridge the
spending gap.
Yet that could well add up to the worst of all solutions. The threat of a
future tax rise may be enough to damage business and consumer confidence,
and at the same time to undermine the will to save on the part of the 16
federal states, and all the local authorities, which need to trim their
budgets. The proposal was certainly not well received either by German
industry, or by Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and leader of the CDU's
Bavaria-based sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU).
Moreover, the chancellor's tax plan does not look likely to satisfy the
other side of the political spectrum - the SPD and the trade unions - which
Mr Kohl wishes to woo into a 'solidarity pact' of wage and budget restraint
to ease the pain of the coming years.
In the smoke-filled corridors of German political power-broking, however, it
was a brilliant move to buy the Chancellor time - and a comforting
conference. For the tax proposal bought off the pressure of his eastern
members, who have been demanding instant action to pump in more cash to
their bankrupt councils and companies. And it reassured the western members,
who are desperate that their electors should not feel more tax pain from
unification in the immediate future.
Mr Kohl is in his element at party conferences, recognising and fraternising
with all the lowly ward chairmen and women from the grass roots, the old
friends he has cultivated and stood by over the years. His easy bonhomie,
elephantine memory for a face, and slightly mumbling man-of-the-people
touch, together with a prodigious capacity to sink food and wine and
reminiscences into the early hours, are what has reinforced his position as
party leader since 1973.
This time, however, he knew it was not the moment for a celebration. Mr Kohl
has been seeking to extricate himself for some time from his initial
excessive optimism that unification might be accomplished without real pain.
'Some conferences are the right place for a speech of jubilation,' he said
afterwards. 'This was not one of them.'
The trouble was that it was vintage Kohl. No sooner had he given an
apparently clear indication of the way forward, than he proceeded to muddy
the waters, and leave everyone confused again. He talked not of 'tax
increases,' but of 'income improvements' - obviously referring to the income
of the state, not of the benighted taxpayer. In the press bar, later, he
insisted that 'a tax rise would be pure poison for the economy'.
Two days later, he delivered an off-the-cuff closing speech of quite
bewildering ambiguity. No tax rises for two years. That was clear. And the
savings were going to be tough. 'When I say save, I mean save,' he declared.
And then immediately followed it with a gaping caveat: 'We must admit that
we do not always act in the same way as we speak.'
He then proceeded to launch into a defence of state subsidies - be it for
shipbuilding or the coal-mining industry - as an integral part of the German
concept of a 'social' market economy, as opposed to Lady Thatcher's idea of
a pure market economy. 'I rejected that (Thatcherite) approach, and I think
what has happened since has proved me right,' he said. Subsidy cuts must be
seen 'in the total context', whatever that may mean.
He is already manoeuvering for his next great challenge: to negotiate the
solidarity pact, and keep on board not only his conservative coalition
partners, but also bring in the trade unions and the SPD.
Yet Mr Kohl must never be underestimated, as Mr Volker Ruhe, his former
secretary-general and now ambitious defence minister, can tell. Mr Ruhe came
bottom of the poll in the vote for four deputy leaders at the congress, an
ignominy he would never have suffered if the chancellor had cared to put in
a good word for him.
But in recent weeks Mr Ruhe has not disguised his desire to be the crown
prince. He has been making nice noises to the SPD. He has talked out of turn
on the unfair distribution of the burden of unification. Mr Kohl may be
unclear in his speech-making. But he is quite ruthless in his treatment of
precocious pretenders.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE ARE worrying times. The German economy is sliding into what one of the
members of the Bundesbank council has said could be 'a very long-lasting and
very deep' recession. Japan's economic recovery is more a hope than a fact,
while that of the UK is more of a prayer than a hope. The US recovery,
feeble though it is by postwar standards, seems to offer what chance of
early recovery exists.
Avoiding recessions altogether is impossible. Avoiding recessions that last
for years is both possible and necessary. Years of disappointment have
already been experienced in the US and the UK. Now the rest of Europe and
even, it appears, Japan are threatened by a similar fate. The European
economy would decline with Germany's, while Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of
the Federal Reserve, has warned of the prolonged adjustment needed to remedy
the balance sheet deterioration that occurred during the 1980s in the US,
Japan, the UK and several other industrial countries.
Unfortunately, there are both political and intellectual obstacles to
effective action, the central fact being the extraordinary weakness of the
governments of every leading industrial countries.
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party is paralysed by factional
infighting. Implementation of the government's Y10,300bn (Pounds 53bn)
fiscal package could be adversely affected, while any Gatt package that
includes liberalisation of the rice market would be no less imperilled.
Meanwhile, Germany's government has demonstrated yet again its disagreement
over how to pay for unification. Arguing that 'the hour of truth is here',
Mr Helmut Kohl admitted at the annual congress of his Christian Democratic
Union that tax increases might be needed after 1995, only to be contradicted
by his finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel.
Longest recession
The French government is so fearful of the outcome of next spring's
parliamentary elections that it is prepared to render the future of France,
the European Community and the world economy hostage to the fate of its
grain barons. In Italy, Mr Giuliano Amato's fragile government has made
fiscal progress. But it still seems likely to do no more than halt the
deterioration in Italy's fiscal position.
By Italy's standards, the UK's problems look small. They are not. It is not
merely that the UK is suffering the longest recession since the Great
Depression, nor that the exit from recession seems to be as far away as
ever. It is that the whole system of British government is under a cloud.
North America is not immune. Canada has failed once more to resolve its
constitutional problems. There is even talk of dissolution, while in the US
talk is rather of the deep economic and social problems that the two leading
candidates, Mr Bush and Mr Clinton, have done little to address.
It is, in short, only by the standards of the losers in the cold war that
the western world looks healthy. Much depends on the US. But it is difficult
to feel much optimism, whatever the outcome of the election.
Profoundly destabilising
It would be wrong to exaggerate the need for global leadership. What is
needed, first and foremost, is enlightened domestic policy in the major
countries. Attempts to drive global monetary policy by the aim of exchange
rate stabilisation, at least without equivalent co-ordination of fiscal
policy, have been profoundly destabilising.
What has made the life of the monetary authorities so difficult is
persistent errors in fiscal policy. Within a globally integrated capital
market, large fiscal deficits tend to seem costless, at least until
governments find themselves looking into the abyss of uncreditworthiness.
The International Monetary Fund is right, therefore, to warn of the
consequences of failure to achieve reductions in fiscal deficits in the
medium term. It is right, but doomed to be ineffective. Deficit cutting
seems politically suicidal during recessions and unnecessary during periods
of expansion.
During a recession, it is not merely politically convenient to run larger
fiscal deficits; it is intellectually respectable. Many advisers are driven
to recommend the politically implausible combination of a fiscal boost in
the short run with fiscal consolidation in the medium term.
Partly because of the weakness of governments, partly because of genuine
intellectual disagreements over the role of fiscal policy, no major
co-ordinated effort to reignite global growth can be expected. Nor is much
to be expected even within Europe, given the stalemate into which German
politics has fallen over fiscal policy.
What politicians must avoid above all is committing major new errors. The
most important danger now is a tit-for-tat trade conflict between the US and
the EC over oilseeds, which may start as soon as November 4, the day after
the US elections. It takes strength to avoid succumbing to temptations. At
the moment, western governments do not seem purposive enough even for that.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Still fumbling for first gear: The government must restore
confidence before the British economy can shrug off recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'A year that began in uncertainty is ending in perplexity' - Montagu Norman,
Governor of the Bank of England, starting his Mansion House speech in 1933
Neither Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, nor Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the
present bank governor, chose to echo Montagu Norman's words in their own
Mansion House speeches on Thursday. But they could well have done.
Six weeks after Britain's departure from the European exchange rate
mechanism, much remains unclear about government policy and baffling about
the true state of the UK economy.
Mr Lamont in his speech went some way to removing uncertainty by putting
himself and the Treasury behind the prime minister's goal of returning the
UK to growth.
But as City analysts and industrialists picked over his words yesterday, it
became clear that the government still faces a struggle to restore the
business and consumer confidence on which economic recovery will hinge. Each
partial unveiling of government economic policy-making since Black Wednesday
has produced more questions than answers. The Mansion House speech was no
exception, making all the more important the government's full exposition of
its post-ERM strategy in the Autumn Statement on November 12.
At first sight, Britain presents a picture of almost unrelieved economic
gloom. The Confederation of British Industry this week reported a sharp fall
in business confidence in the third quarter while the British Chambers of
Commerce say the economy is entering a 'second leg' of recession.
Unemployment rose 32,200 to 2.85m in September and the underlying trend is
upwards. According to Gallup, the polling organisation, more than half of
Britons expect economic conditions to deteriorate over the next 12 months.
House prices, that vital measure of middle-class well-being, registered
their largest ever monthly fall in September, according to the Halifax
building society. Little wonder, therefore, that some high street banks are
now placing solicitors among their high-risk borrowers.
The turns and twists of government policy since Black Wednesday have added
greatly to the sense of despondency. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the
decision on September 16 to push base rates up to 15 per cent gave a
surprisingly long-lasting shock to many consumers even though it was
reversed within 24 hours. The spectre of rising unemployment helps explain
why the planned redundancies in the coal industry earlier this month
unleashed such a wave of anger and proved such a debacle for the government.
On the other hand, there are some more hopeful aspects to the economy. Many
mocked Mr Lamont's welcome for September's small 0.2 per cent volume
increase in retail sales, which the chancellor said marked a 'clear upwards
trend'. But according to Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at S G Warburg
Securities: 'The resilience of consumer spending until September was the
best-kept secret in town.' Retail sales in the third quarter were 0.6 per
cent up on the previous three-month period and 0.8 per cent higher than a
year ago in a period when bank base rates were mostly at 10 per cent. The
two percentage points cut in base rates since late September should soon
begin to boost individual spending power when mortgage rate cuts take
effect.
Recent business surveys may also be overdoing the gloom as they were
completed too soon to include the October 16 base rate cut to 8 per cent.
Businesses can now borrow at interest rates well below continental European
levels, while sterling has experienced a substantial 13.4 per cent
devaluation against the Bank of England's trade-weighted basket of
currencies since leaving the ERM.
As the chancellor made clear on Thursday, this devaluation - far greater
than would have been allowed in an ERM realignment - should greatly enhance
the export competitiveness of British industry.
But the world business climate has also deteriorated sharply in the past six
weeks. Germany seems to be sliding towards recession while independent
growth forecasts for both the US and Japan next year have been scaled back.
As Mr Leigh-Pemberton reminded bankers in his Mansion House speech: 'The
risk of a further world downturn resulting from debt deflation is real.'
In the present unpredictable climate, no one, least of all the Treasury, can
foretell whether the British economy is on the verge of continuing recession
or faltering recovery. The interplay of forces pointing in either direction
has never been more finely balanced.
Mr Lamont insisted on Thursday that the government can neither talk the
economy out of recession nor 'press a button and see the economy spring to
life'. But he also recognised that government has a key role to play in
rebuilding confidence.
His promise of greater openness in economic policy-making is a useful
adjunct to this goal. But the individual proposals - to set up a panel of
independent economic forecasters to help inform the Treasury and give more
information on monetary policy - are modest compared with provisions in
countries such as the US where freedom of information is a right. And how
accountable UK policy-making will be remains to be seen.
The sections of Mr Lamont's speech that most excited the chancellor's City
audience were those about supporting infrastructure investment, putting
capital spending at the top of public spending priorities and reviewing
every policy option as to whether it would benefit industry. Although
yesterday the chancellor played down the idea of a 'dash for growth', the
tone of his earlier remarks marked a significant break with Treasury
rhetoric over the previous decade. The stress on public investment was
redolent of the 1970s before Mrs (now Lady) Thatcher came to power.
But the lack of detail about specific projects also disappointed bankers and
industrialists. This vagueness has boosted speculation that the Autumn
Statement will be accompanied by a substantive 'package of measures' - even
a mini-Budget - to boost the economy and raise the morale of Conservative
backbenchers.
The government's imprecision has so far only fostered uncertainty, bordering
on perplexity. Mr Lamont spoke only of maintaining public spending on
infrastructure in a time of recession, raising doubts in the building
industry as to whether the planned moves would be sufficient to staunch
rising unemployment and cuts in capacity in the sector.
His talk of finding ways to give the private sector a greater role in
financing capital projects cut little ice. 'How do you get the private
sector involved in capital spending if companies are worried whether they
are going bust or not?' asked Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at James
Capel, the City stockbroker.
It is also debatable how far the government's promise to support capital
programmes is compatible with its determination to hold its planned spending
total at the pre-set level of Pounds 244.5bn for 1993-94.
In nominal terms, the planning total for the coming financial year is a
generous 7.9 per cent more than the current year's planned spending. The
faster than expected fall in inflation this year should mean that spending
growth in real terms will be more than the 4 per cent increase estimated by
the government in January.
On the other hand, existing spending plans assume that unemployment will
average 2.4m in 1993-94. Since the summer, UK industry has been shedding
labour at an accelerating rate, making it likely that unemployment will be
about 3m by the new year. As every 100,000 extra on the average jobless
total adds Pounds 345m to government spending in a financial year,
government outlays on unemployment alone could be some Pounds 2bn more than
anticipated in 1993-94.
In addition, the government will have to find money to finance redundancies
in the coal industry, is under pressure to ease the introduction of the
council tax, and faces ever-rising costs in the health and social security
fields. While a freeze on public sector pay has been widely touted as a
possible outcome of the Autumn Statement discussions, such a course of
action is fraught with difficulty. Pay arrangements and bargaining
procedures differ throughout the public sector. The government could find
itself in confrontation with unions representing 3m public sector workers
and face large-scale problems enforcing its will on the review bodies that
recommend pay rises for a further 1.5m employees.
It is hardly surprising that the negotiations among ministers in EDX, the
public spending committee chaired by Mr Lamont, are reportedly proving very
difficult. It appears that no ministers disputed the need to keep within the
1993-94 planning total when spending plans were discussed in cabinet this
week. But the decision to discuss public expenditure in the full cabinet on
Monday points to serious difficulties in reaching a consensus on how share
the burden.
From today's perspective, the government looks ill-placed to give
substantial support to the economy through public works. Spending on some
carefully selected projects - the extension of London's Jubilee Underground
railway line is often mentioned in this context - could boost confidence.
But short of a radical departure from existing policies - through short-term
tax incentives, perhaps, which would have to be financed by increased
borrowing - it is difficult to see how fiscal policy can meet the
expectations being vested in it.
Those rising expectations summarise the problems that have confronted Mr
Lamont and the Treasury in the six weeks since sterling left the ERM. Each
faltering step in the so-called 'rebalancing' of policy has been signalled
in advance, stoking up hopes that have not been fulfilled.
It is always possible that the Autumn Statement will break this pattern,
and, through measures as yet unknown, boost confidence and tip the UK in the
direction of recovery. That would get the government off the hook. But for
the UK economy as a whole, it would be only the beginning of a long
rehabilitation after the inflationary excesses and de-industrialisation of
the past 13 years.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Dawson to axe 205 Scots jobs: Clothes maker shuts 2 plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAWSON International, one of Britain's biggest clothing manufacturers, best
known for its luxury Pringle and Ballantyne brands, is to shut two Scottish
factories with the loss of 205 jobs.
Most of the cuts are in the Pringle of Scotland division. Its four-year-old,
purpose-built factory at Dumfries will close at the end of next month.
Pringle's workforce will shrink by 10 per cent.
Mr Nick Kuenssberg, chief executive of Dawson Premier Brands, the company's
luxury and sports clothes division, did not blame the recession for the
closures. 'The two factories did low-margin, own-label work. It's a matter
of improving margins and getting more from expensive knitting machines.'
The Dumfries plant employs 268 people in lambswool knitting. Jobs will be
offered to 63 workers and the remainder offered redundancy.
The other factory, at Arbroath, employs 40 people finishing clothes for the
Pringle label. All are being offered jobs at a Dawson plant nearby.
Earlier this year the Dumfries factory took on 30 staff to cope with demand
for its autumn ranges. 'At that time we had not finalised our plans,' Mr
Kuenssberg said.
Since then, a strategic review has identified 'a surplus of manufacturing
facilities at (Dawson's) Dumfries factory'.
The factory was built on an industrial estate greenfield site and opened
officially in 1988 by the Princess Royal.
'At the time, the market was steaming away,' Mr Kuenssberg said. Production
for the McGeorge label would have been trebled if the factory had ever
worked at full stretch.
He said the closure was 'a disaster for Dumfries but good for the business
and the shareholders'.
Reorganisation costs were provided for in this year's accounts, but now
there will be an additional charge of Pounds 1m to reflect the fall in the
value of the Dumfries property.
After the reorganisation, Pringle of Scotland will have about 1,840
employees.
These are the first job losses at Dawson Premier Brands since the start of
the year when 100 were cut at the Blackwoods carpet yarn operation.

AS Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, tries to find more
room in the energy market for coal, he is making the nuclear power industry
nervous.
Dogged by controversy and high costs, its members sense that the industry
may be a ready candidate for scaling back, and the fact that the UK's
earliest reactors are approaching the end of their lives anyway provides a
convenient excuse for replacing them with coal. Also, since the nuclear
industry is one of the few energy sectors left in public ownership, it is
available for manipulation by the government.
But the nuclear industry will fight back. Within hours of the announcement
of Mr Heseltine's review, Mr Bob Hawley, Nuclear Electric's chief executive,
was promoting its virtues. To cut nuclear power, he said, would be a 'quick
fix' that would ignore the industry's long-term benefits. This week the
Nuclear Forum, the industry's trade group, launched its own campaign.
Nuclear's case is built largely on claiming to provide the cheapest
large-scale electricity supplies in the long term. It is also
environmentally friendlier than fossil fuel and could help the coal industry
by offsetting heavy emissions.
At present, nuclear accounts for about 20 per cent of the electricity
generated in the UK, and its share is rising fast. It is produced mainly by
Nuclear Electric, with 12 stations in England and Wales, and Scottish
Nuclear, which has a further two plants.
NE operates at a heavy loss, as it was incorporated by the government
without financial provisions to decommission its nuclear reactors. The
deficit is made up by a Pounds 1.3bn levy on electricity bills which is due
to be phased out by 1998, although NE hopes to be making a profit before
then. Scottish Nuclear has provisions and already makes a modest profit.
The real question facing Mr Heseltine is whether coal has a stronger claim
to subsidy than nuclear power. Although the latter claims to produce some of
the cheapest electricity available, that has been challenged by its
competitors.
Professor Peter Jones, a consultant to Nuclear Forum, says nuclear would be
able to generate power at 3p a kilowatt hour by the year 2000. Other power
generators estimate that NE's costs are anywhere between 3.5p and 8p a kWh,
compared with less than 3p for coal-fired power stations. They maintain that
keeping nuclear going at coal's expense is vastly uneconomic. It would be
more sensible to phase out the early stations rather than extend their
lives, as seemed to be the government's plan until recently.
Mr Hawley vigorously denies the figures. The early stations, he says, have
had all their costs written off and are generating electricity at a mere
1.2p a kWh. It would be crazy, he says, to shut down such a cheap power
source, particularly since that might lead to higher energy imports. The
Treasury would also have to stump up decommissioning costs running into
billions.
It is not just a question of whether existing stations should be phased out,
but also whether additional ones should be built. That is central to the
nuclear industry's argument that it can become truly economic only if
allowed to build many stations to achieve economies of scale.
NE makes much of the fact that the only station under construction, Sizewell
B in Suffolk, is ahead of schedule and on budget. Although its cost is a
huge Pounds 2bn, the station should be able to generate power for 3.8p a
kWh, according to Mr Hawley. If NE was allowed to build a proposed Sizewell
C, the generating cost would fall below 3p.
Those figures, though, are based on financing costs of 5 per cent for B and
8 per cent for C. Other power generating projects being planned in the
private sector assume 12 per cent. 'Where would Nuclear Electric get money
at 8 per cent?' asks a senior electricity industry executive. Mr Stephen
Ogle, NE's financial control director, says finance would be available
either from the government, with its new interest in large job-creating
projects, or from the private sector, which, he maintains, is showing signs
of overcoming its suspicions about nuclear power.
Mr Heseltine's review comes too soon for nuclear power. The government had
previously promised to review the industry in 1994, and both NE and Scottish
Nuclear were gearing up for then: Sizewell B would be up and running, the
sector's financial performance would have improved, and the environmental
case might have strengthened. If nuclear does now face the axe, it will
argue that it has not been given a fair chance to prove its case.

FT  31 OCT 92 / EC drops commitment to mandatory works councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR European Commission official indicated yesterday that Brussels was
no longer committed to legislation forcing companies to set up works
councils.
Dr Hermanus van Zonneveld, head of working conditions and labour law in the
commission's social affairs directorate, said he thought progress could best
be achieved by voluntary agreements.
Speaking to the annual conference of the Institute of Personnel Management
in Harrogate, he said: 'A settlement between the two sides of industry can
better take into account the many specific situations of companies with
quite often complex structures than a piece of legislation coming from the
Commission civil servants.'
The shift in the Commission's strategy brings Brussels closer to the UK
government, which has consistently opposed European legislation to set up
works councils, the company-based consultation forums for employers and
employees.
Dr van Zonneveld hinted that the voluntary agreements would cover Britain
because they would avoid the need for a vote under the social chapter of the
Treaty of Maastricht, which the UK has not signed.
He told the conference that many employers recognised the importance of
employee involvement, especially in the recession.
About 20 European companies had established structures for information and
consultation procedures, and voluntary labour management councils were
widespread in Japanese companies, where they played an 'important role'.
He said that member states had failed to agree legislation after more than
20 years of negotiations. The latest legislation proposed by the commission
last year can be adopted only if the 12 agree. It is opposed by one
government and two others have reservations.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Countdown starts for 10 mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL has formally served notice to miners' union representatives
that it is starting a 90-day statutory consultation period, at the end of
which it intends to close 10 pits.
Letters inviting local union representatives to meetings with management
were issued yesterday as British Coal ceased production at two more pits -
Grimethorpe and Houghton Main in South Yorkshire - leaving only one of the
10 - Betws in south Wales - still cutting coal. British Coal officials said
the consultative period would present miners with an opportunity to argue
their case against closures.
Instead, miners' unions are concentrating their efforts on legal action to
force British Coal to resume production at all the pits. They also want the
10 pits to be discussed at national level and to be included in the
government's wide-ranging consultations on its energy policy.
Applications for injunctions by the National Union of Mineworkers, the
Nacods pit supervisors' union, and the Union of Democratic Mineworkers are
scheduled to be heard in the High Court on Tuesday.
The unions claim to have compiled evidence pointing to a deterioration of
coal faces, roadway and equipment at some of the pits that have ceased
production over the past two weeks. According to union officials, the
evidence suggests that British Coal is effectively pre-empting the outcome
of the consultation period by allowing the mines to become unworkable.
Yesterday a group of women demonstrators chanted and cheered as miners
emerged, possibly for the last time, from Grimethorpe Colliery.
Meanwhile, the Labour party will today launch a campaign aimed at exploiting
public outrage at the government's pit closures in an attempt to promote its
alternative economic strategy.
The effort to link the closure of the pits with wider fears of depression
and redundancies begins in earnest next week when Mr John Smith, the party
leader, begins a tour of mines in Durham and South Yorkshire.
Nottinghamshire County Council is to hold an independent inquiry chaired by
Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, last year's chairman of the Bar Council, into pit
closures and their effect on the local economy.
Evidence provided by the inquiry will be collated and presented to the
review promised by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Audit of safety risks ordered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL EMPLOYERS will be required to detail health and safety risks to their
employees from the beginning of next year, the Health and Safety Commission
said this week.
Employers were warned at the launch of the HSC's guidance on how to comply
with new regulations, which might cost industry as much as Pounds 120m in
the first year and Pounds 70m a year in continuing costs, that inspectors
would take firm action to enforce the requirements. The provisions implement
the European Community Framework Directive and are the first in a series of
UK regulations drafted to meet the requirements of eight directives that
must be incorporated into domestic law by the end of this year.
The Health and Safety Executive, the enforcement arm of the HSC, last year
set the maximum cost to industry of implementing all eight directives at
Pounds 300m in the first year.
Mr Alan Tuffin, a member of the Health and Safety Commission and chairman of
the UCW communications workers' union, said: 'It will now be more difficult
for anyone to claim that they misunder-stood the law, as the management
regulations - in giving more detail - make much clearer what the law
requires.'
Employers will have to appoint 'competent persons' with 'sufficient training
and experience or knowledge' as well as enough time and information to
assist them in complying with the regulations.
The HSE said that although inspectors understood that employers needed time
to take sensible actions where requirements are were completely new, 'Where
we find the law is deliberately being ignored or flouted, inspectors will
take firm enforcement action.'

FT  31 OCT 92 / Unions fight for naval dockyards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACK DROMEY, national secretary of the TGWU, Britain's largest trade
union, urged the government yesterday to avoid 'a second great coal board
disaster' in the naval dockyards.
That follows reports - denied by the government - that there are plans to
close the Rosyth yard, with thousands of job losses. The yard is Scotland's
largest single employer and has 4,000 direct employees.
Unions say the Navy Board would prefer Devonport dockyard, Plymouth, to
handle refitting on Trident submarines. Unions at both yards have joined
forces to argue for both sites to be kept open. They also want a review into
overall industrial policy and consequences of mass redundancies and
closures.
Mr Dromey said: 'With the right approach, Devonport and Rosyth have a bright
future. Their prime purpose will remain naval refitting, but both yards
should continue to diversify to win commercial work because defence
expenditure will fall throughout the 90s. That is why an industrial policy
from the government to help Devonport and Rosyth plan for the future is so
critical.'
Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU engineering and electrical
union, said: 'If spare capacity exists, then the first task should be how to
fill it, to make use of skills and to protect jobs and local communities.'
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, has said the reports are clearly 'at
best premature, and at worst totally wrong', that he was unaware of any
conclusion to the nuclear submarine refitting studies, and that a final
decision was expected by Christmas.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Meagre rise in top Whitehall women
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROPORTION of women in the top three grades of the Civil Service has
risen half a percentage point over the past two years, an analysis of
government figures shows.
The analysis, carried out by the FDA top civil servants union, shows that
women make up 7.7 per cent of top civil servants, compared with 7.2 per cent
in 1990.
The FDA said the figures showed some departments with no women in the top
three grades, such as the Inland Revenue, where 60 per cent of the staff are
women. Other departments had 20 per cent women at the top and the Home
Office 25 per cent.
The analysis shows that out of a total of 647 top Civil Service jobs, 50
were held by women by the end of June, compared with 43 out of 688 at the
same time last year.
Mrs Barbara Mills, the director of public prosecutions, is the only woman in
grade one. Mrs Stella Rimington, head of the security service, is her equal
in grade but is not strictly a home civil servant.
The proportion of women in grade 3 is lower than that in grade 2, with only
six out of 70 posts held by women. The FDA said: 'This suggests it will take
a determined recruitment drive for women at grade 3 for there to be
improvement.'

FT  31 OCT 92 / Bogus adverts lure workers to Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOBLESS UK construction workers are being lured to Hong Kong under false
pretences to work on the new airport, the territory's government has warned.
Advertisements offering lists of prospective employers for sale to
'English-speaking manpower' in all categories of labour have been published
in The Sun, Today and the Daily Express. Some workers have travelled to Hong
Kong in vain.
Mr Ranjit Peiris of the Hong Kong government office in London said that only
highly skilled professional staff were being sought to work on the
multi-billion-pound project. A list of contractors for the airport project
is published by the Hong Kong government and is available free.
He said he had written to 'most of the daily newspapers' to warn them
against the rogue advertisements.
News International said it had received 20 letters of complaint after an
advertisement was published in The Sun.
The Advertising Standards Authority has upheld complaints against one of the
advertisers, Maurice Walker Marketing of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. It
was 'extremely concerned that the advertisements had failed to provide any
evidence that employment was likely to be available'.
It noted that there had been a similar spate of advertisements at the end of
the Gulf war 20 months ago.
Mr Dick Livingston, head of the London office of Hong Kong's Provisional
Airport Authority, said that typical UK wages for basic jobs were too high.
Workers would be recruited from Hong Kong, China, Thailand and the
Philippines.
'They are very industrious in the Far East, the training is good and they
already have the skills,' he said. 'But professionals will be recruited
increasingly from Europe.'
Several of Britain's hard-pressed construction companies have won contracts
for Hong Kong's airport, the most ambitious single infrastructure project
ever undertaken in Asia. They include Costain and Trafalgar House which,
with Mitsui of Japan, won a Pounds 600m contract earlier this year to build
a suspension bridge between Chek Lap Kok, the island where the airport is to
be built, and the Hong Kong mainland.
UK consulting firms have also done well in bidding for consultancy contracts
for the airport programme.

The HSE said that although inspectors understood that employers needed time
to take sensible actions where requirements were completely new, 'Where we
find the law is deliberately being ignored or flouted, inspectors will take
firm enforcement action,' it said.
The commission said if only 5 per cent of all accidents at work were
prevented as a result of the measures, the additional costs of implementing
the framework directive would be covered.
The HSC said the action required by employers would vary according to the
level of risks at work. The detail required in the 'risk assessment' would
be determined by the level of risk.

FT  31 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continental bourses end mixed
after volatile week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES closed mixed after a volatile week, writes Our Markets Staff.
AMSTERDAM, with the exception of Elsevier, closed the week sharply lower as
Daf fell further and fears began to mount of more bad corporate news. The
CBS Tendency index lost 1.1 to 101.8, down 2.4 per cent on the week.
Elsevier rallied as revised terms were announced for its merger with Reed
whereby the UK publisher will reduce its stake in the Dutch group from 11.5
per cent to 5.8 per cent. The revision has been necessary following the
devaluation of sterling following its exit from the ERM. Elsevier's shares
rose to a day's high of Fl 115.70 before slipping back on profit-taking to
close up Fl 2 at Fl 112.
A foreign institution was believed to have been behind the sale of a large
parcel of Daf shares and the price slipped below Fl 10, closing down Fl 1.30
at Fl 9.30, a fall of some 13 per cent on the week.
Investors were nervous about Akzo's interim figures, due next week,
following Thursday's poor third-quarter results from DSM, which was
unchanged at Fl 77.20. Akzo lost Fl 1.70 on the day to Fl 125.30.
FRANKFURT took a breather after a week beset by bad economic and corporate
news. The DAX index closed down 1.32 at 1,492.32, a 2.3 per cent fall on the
week. Turnover fell to DM3.1bn from DM4.8bn.
There was little fresh corporate news to excite interest and there was
further selling of some of the week's biggest losers. Porsche shed DM6 to
DM455, a 3 per cent fall since Monday.
After a few, disappointing days, banks went against the trend: Deutsche Bank
rose DM1.20 to DM653.70, Dresdner Bank put on DM2.40 to DM356.00 while
Commerzbank managed a rise of 70 pfg to DM240.70. RWE, which gave an
optimistic forecast about current year earnings, dropped DM2 to DM395.70.
PARIS rebounded slightly after Thursday's loss, as the CAC-40 index ended
11.53 higher at 1,742.40, down 1.4 per cent on the week, in turnover of
FFr2.6bn, bloated by month-end arbitrage. The market will be closed on
Monday.
Axa added a further FFr27 or 3.3 per cent to FFr839 following its
respectable interim results. There were also hopes that lower interest rates
might help to enhance the bond portfolio held by its US subsidiary,
Equitable Life.
Generale des Eaux fell another FFr50 to FFr1,876 on reports that a leading
domestic broker had taken the stock off its recommended list after its
interim results.
MILAN ended higher in lively trading on hopes of a further cut in interest
rates and short-covering ahead of the weekend.
The Comit index rose 10.52 to 439.03, 5.2 per cent higher on the week, and
turnover was estimated at a high L300bn after L190bn on Thursday.
Fiat rose L195 or 5 per cent to L4,495 and Mediobanca was up L800 or 7 per
cent to L12,120. Generali gained L550 to L28,950 and Montedison rose L36 to
L1,240.
STOCKHOLM lost ground in a shortened session ahead of a holiday weekend. The
Affarsvarlden index slipped 7.1 to 706.9, a 2 per cent fall on the week.
Turnover declined to SKr338m from Thursday's SKr484m.
The announcement on Thursday that Svenska Kredit had filed for bankruptcy
pulled the banking and financial sector lower, even though the insurer's
main shareholders, Trygg-Hansa SPP Holding and Skandia, were unchanged on
the day at SKr31 and SKr78.50 respectively.
SKF B shares fell another SKr5 to SKr65 after its disappointing interim
figures earlier in the week.
BRUSSELS closed mixed in trading dominated by Petrofina and Kredietbank. The
Bel-20 index inched 2.61 higher to 1,139.96, little changed on the week.
Petrofina closed at the day's high, up BFr300 or 3.9 per cent at BFr8,080
ahead of news of planned safety investments demanded by the Norwegian
government for the Ekofisk oil field. Kredietbank, which on Thursday
announced a 15 per cent increase in first-half profit, climbed BFr90 to
BFr5,630.
ZURICH rose on short-covering ahead of the weekend. The SMI index gained 6.1
to 1,911.1, a fall of 0.5 per cent on the week.

FT  31 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average falls 2%
on the week

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE equities fell on arbitrage-related unwinding, as corporate interim
earnings announcements and uncertainty in the currency market ahead of the
US presidential election depressed activity, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average fell 170.31 to 16,767.40, down 2 per cent on the week.
The index moved between a high of 16,926.48 in the morning and a low of
16,675.23 just before the close. Small-lot buying of speculative theme
stocks supported the index in the morning, but arbitrage-related selling and
profit-taking by dealers later pushed the index to its low.
Volume remained low at 190m shares against 169m, as arbitrageurs and dealers
were the only notable participants. Losers outnumbered gainers by 719 to 217
with 157 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first sections stocks
retreated 8.22 to 1,278.91 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 3.75
to 1,027.79. Investors remained absent from the market while share prices
were manipulated by technical factors. The announcement that banks had
established a new land buying organisation, to purchase land collateral of
non-performing bank loans, was ignored by investors. Traders noted mounting
scepticism about the effectiveness of the new corporation.
Fears that the opposition may delay the approval of the supplementary budget
unless leaders of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party testified in
parliament weighed on sentiment. However, a ministry of finance official
said that a lengthy delay was unlikely as the opposition parties recognised
the negative effects on the faltering economy if the measures were held up.
Dealers took profits on speculative theme stocks. Green Cross, the most
active issue of the day, fell Y60 to Y1,430 and Aisin Seiki lost Y50 to
Y1,140.
Bank stocks were mixed. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y10 to Y2,440, but
Sakura Bank rose Y20 to Y1,130.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 240.66 to 18,401.33 in volume of 11.3m shares
.
Roundup
THE region's markets were in a positive mood yesterday.
HONG KONG bounced back after a drop of over 100 points in the previous two
days, and the Hang Seng index jumped 73.19 or 1.2 per cent to 6,190.69. But
the index was 1.1 per cent lower on the week. Turnover, swollen by Bank of
East Asia's HKDollars 1.9bn placement, rose to HKDollars 4.2bn against
HKDollars 2.1bn.
Hutchison fell 30 cents to HKDollars 16.60 while Swire Pacific and Jardine
Matheson gained HKDollars 1 each to HKDollars 37.50 and HKDollars 59.
SEOUL rose for its fifth consecutive session, as foreign buying interest in
financial shares outpaced profit-taking following the recent sharp rises.
The composite index rose 4.31 to 610.09, up 6.8 per cent on the week.
All of the Daewoo Group's listed shares hit their daily upper limits. Daewoo
Corp and Daewoo Heavy Industries gained Won400 to Won9,500 and Won9,800
respectively.
KUALA LUMPUR closed at another record high as the budget proposals were
greeted warmly by investors. The composite index advanced 4.18 to 641.31, a
1.7 per cent rise on the week. Turnover surged to MDollars 606m from
Thursday's MDollars 351m. Finance and property stocks showed the strongest
gains.
AUSTRALIA rose on good economic data and a good performance by News Corp.
The All Ordinaries index advanced 8 to 1,425, up 2 per cent on the week.
Turnover was ADollars 425.7m.
News Corp rose ADollars 1.10 to ADollars 25.90 on expectations of good
third-quarter results which are due in the next two weeks. BHP was another
heavily traded stock, rising 10 cents to ADollars 11.08.
Among mining stocks, CRA put on 20 cents to ADollars 11.96 after its
production report showed increased output at its mine in western Australia.

FT  31 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Election fears and bad data
prompt selling

Wall Street
CONTINUED uncertainty about next week's presidential election and bad news
on home sales and from Chicago purchasing managers prompted selling of US
shares, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 19.99 at 3,226.28,
and the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 down 2.18 at 418.68. The
Amex composite, however, gained 0.43 at 381.72 but the Nasdaq composite
eased 0.66 to 605.16. NYSE turnover was heavy at 198m shares, and declines
marginally outpaced rises by 875 to 855.
Share prices opened slightly firmer, but investors began to sell stocks soon
after the Chicago Purchasing Management Association reported that its index
of business activity in October had plummeted from 59.5 per cent in
September to 49.7 per cent. A reading below 50 per cent indicates that
manufacturing industry is contracting.
The decline steepened when the commerce department reported that
single-family new home sales fell 0.1 per cent in September, the first
monthly decline since April. The market had been expecting a solid rise in
home sales, so the sell-off after the figures was rapid.
Both sets of data cast a gloomy cloud over the market, which was already
unsettled by the ups and downs of the presidential election campaign.
Although the latest national polls showed President George Bush catching up
with Governor Bill Clinton, the more revealing state-by-state polls of
electoral college votes showed the Democratic contenders still maintained a
decent lead.
Among individual stocks, General Motors weakened further in the wake of its
third-quarter losses and the upheaval at the company's top management. GM
shares slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 30 3/4 in turnover of 1.7m shares.
Ford, which also announced a big quarterly loss this week, eased Dollars
3/4 to Dollars 36 1/2 , while Chrysler, the only one of the big three car
manufacturers to report a profit, was unchanged at Dollars 27 1/8 .
Aetna Life firmed early on but ended unchanged at Dollars 42 1/8 after the
insurer announced earnings from continuing operations of Dollars 127m for
the third quarter, up sharply from the Dollars 72m earned a year ago.
The ADRs in Glaxo fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 25 in turnover of 3.1m shares
after three US doctors linked the UK company's Zofran drug, used to reduce
nausea after cancer chemotherapy, to the deaths of two patients and the
non-fatal cardiac arrest of another. Glaxo officials later rejected the
findings.
Imo Industries plunged Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 7 after the company, which
reported a third-quarter loss following a charge and suspended its quarterly
dividend, announced it would divest between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of
its assets.
Atlanta Gas Light fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 34 5/8 on a ratings
downgrade from the broking house Smith Barney, which also reduced its
earnings forecast for 1993 from Dollars 2.50 a share to Dollars 2.35 a
share.

FT  31 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Toronto rushes to make up for lost
ground - Bernard Simon asks if the TSE can sustain the upward momentum seen
since Monday's referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past six weeks, the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) has fallen into a
deep trench and then dug itself out again.
The TSE 300 index plummeted by more than 300 points, or almost 10 per cent,
on the back of a surge in interest rates ahead of last Monday's referendum
on proposals for a new Canadian constitution.
But with the referendum now out of the way, the market is rushing to make up
lost ground. This week, the TSE 300 soared by 89 points to yesterday's close
of 3,336. Trading volumes on Wednesday were the heaviest of the year.
The question now is whether the market can sustain the momentum or whether
it will flatten out between 3,350 and 3,600 where it has been stuck most of
this year.
Ms Barbara Taylor, vice-president for Canadian equities with the Ontario
Hospitals Association (OHA) pension fund, says that the TSE 300 can 'at
least get back' to the 3,450 mark. Even that, however, would be well below
last January's peak of almost 3,700, not to mention the August 1987 record
of 4,112.
Ms Taylor notes that many companies, especially in resource industries, are
still trading at prices below their book value. The OHA took advantage of
the recent sell-off to invest its entire fourth-quarter equities allocation
in the first week of October.
But a portfolio strategist at one Toronto investment management firm says
that the Canadian market, having recovered from its referendum jitters, is
now unlikely to move much further ahead without some outside stimulus.
'We're now going to play to the same drummer as the US and Japan,' he
predicts.
The best performers over the next month or two are likely to be concentrated
in three categories: the big banks, selected resource producers, and
industrial companies whose earnings are starting to pick up.
Bank shares normally benefit from falling interest rates, as loan losses
shrink, margins improve and the economic turnround approaches. Lower returns
on fixed-income investments improve the attractiveness of the banks'
dividends.
Mr Roy Palmer, banking analyst at Bunting Warburg in Toronto, predicts that
Bank of Montreal's share price, now at about CDollars 47, could climb to
CDollars 55 by the end of next year. Bank of Nova Scotia could advance from
CDollars 24 to about CDollars 30.
But his forecasts are conditional on the Canadian economy getting up a
strong head of steam in 1994, and Mr Palmer is starting to wonder whether
the upturn may not take longer to materialise. 'I'm less confident about
1994 now than I was about 1993 a year ago,' he says.
The drop in the Canadian dollar from over 89 US cents a year ago to just
over 80 cents now has given a boost to commodity exporters' earnings. Hopes
for a further rise rest on a US fiscal stimulus in the early months of a
Clinton presidency, and on a European recovery as interest rates come down
in Germany and the UK.
For some resource companies, the worst could be over. Abitibi-Price, the
newsprint producer, posted a third-quarter loss of CDollars 73m from
continuing operations. But it noted that the low point for newsprint and
groundwood papers appeared to be reached in the second quarter. 'Conditions
are continuing to improve, with volume up and price increases being
implemented in newsprint,' Abitibi said.
Mining analysts however are generally advising buyers to wait until the
recent slide in base metal and gold prices is arrested. For the moment,
their attention is riveted on the stampede for diamonds in the Northwest
Territories.
Mr John Hainey, an analyst at Canaccord Capital, calls an investment in the
junior resource companies which have joined the diamond rush 'pure
gambling'. But he notes that 'the signs are so exceptional that I'd be
surprised if it peters out into nothing'.
The leader of the pack, Dia Met Minerals, is trading on the Vancouver Stock
Exchange at close to CDollars 20, a 20-fold increase over the past year.
Some market watchers say that they have begun to detect a consistent
improvement in the performance of many industrial and retail companies,
based on third-quarter operating earnings.
A prime example is Northern Telecom, which surprised analysts earlier this
week with an 11 per cent rise in net earnings, including a small gain at the
operating level. Northern's share price has rocketed by 12 per cent in the
past week to almost CDollars 48.
Imasco, the conglomerate controlled by BAT Industries, saw its share price
jump by more than CDollars 2 on Wednesday to CDollars 39 1/2 , its highest
level this year after reporting advances in earnings from its tobacco, drug
store and fast-food businesses.
With political uncertainty on Canada's future pushed to the sidelines for
the time being, investors are taking the view that they have more to lose by
staying out of the Toronto market than by getting in.
Share prices may not rise much further for the next month or two, but they
seem less likely to fall. Those who decide to buy now, however, may need
some patience until the business recovery finds a firmer footing.

JOHANNESBURG ended mixed after a sideways drift for most of the day as the
market looked for fresh factors. Trading picked up slightly towards the
close on month-end position-squaring.
Some shares, like Pick 'n Pay and Amgold were also bought ahead of the last
day to register for dividends.
The overall index was unchanged at 3,017, down slightly on the week. The
industrial index was 3 off at 4,013 and the gold index was up 1 at 816.

FT  31 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Prudential statement awaited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE gathering on Monday of at least 100 top UK fund managers for the
unveiling of the restated 1990 and 1991 accounts of Prudential Corporation,
one of the leading UK insurance institutions, was foreshadowed yesterday by
a sharp rise in Prudential shares. In a generally strong equity market, the
shares closed 6 1/2 higher at 278 1/2 p on turnover of 5.5m.
Mr Mick Newmarch, Prudential's chief executive, is expected to reveal a big
increase in Prudential's profits for 1990 and 1991 which have been
recalculated on the 'accruals method of accounting.
There was general agreement that anything less than a doubling of life
profits under the new accounting process would be disappointing. For 1990,
Prudential reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 244m and for 1991, Pounds
267m. The move to accruals accounting among insurers has developed since
Pearl Assurance, the UK life company, was taken over by Australian Mutual
Provident, a strike which frightened the whole of the sector.
Life sector analysts are divided over outlook for Prudential shares after
the details are announced on Monday. Kleinwort Benson is cautious and has
told clients to reduce overweight holdings, noting that the shares have
performed this year and that there may be a sense of anti-climax and some
profit-taking short-term .
County NatWest highlighted the stock's outperformance but said it still
offers good value. Mr John Marr at Charterhouse Tilney, was more
aggressively bullish; 'The shares could go much higher, possibly over 300p;
we think historic earnings will be more than doubled and also that
Prudential will produce a chunk of life assets that wil pleasantly surprise
the market.
Steel hit again
Badly-mauled British Steel suffered again yesterday in anticipation of a cut
in profit forecast from a leading UK securities house. The 6 per cent fall
in the shares was the biggest in percentage terms in the FT-SE 100 Index
list; they closed 3 off at 47p, within a whisker of their all-time low, on
turnover of 6m.
Smith New Court analyst Mr Ian Lowe had planned to discuss Steel's prospects
at the morning meeting but decided against it because he needed to do more
work on the figures. However, the news that Smith was expected to produce
bearish views leaked into the market and the shares were hit towards the
close of trading.
Mr Lowe confirmed that he would be increasing his loss forecast in the light
of the recent announcement of plans to cut production by 20 per cent. He
added that 'The shares are not being valued on any coherent grounds at the
moment' and said he would be 'urging people to sell the shares on Monday.'
Glaxo setback
Shares in Glaxo turned sharply down yesterday afternoon as word reached the
market of an article in the medical press believed to be highly critical of
one of the company's leading drugs. The stock fell sharply after highlights
of the article, on Glaxo's anti-nausea drug Zofran, were carried by an
international newswire. Glaxo fell to 796p and closed 10 off at 799p with
5.2m traded.
The article, in The Lancet, the premier UK medical journal, discussed
perceived links with Zofran and chest pains. As a result of the reports and
the fall in the share price, Glaxo published late yesterday a strongly
worded rejection of The Lancet article.
Analysts' reactions on The Lancet study ranged from caution to scepticism.
Most pointed out that Glaxo had had a good run recently and traders were
looking for excuses to take profits on the last day of the account.
Publisher Dorling Kindersley came to the market on a high note. The
flotation was six times oversubscribed and the shares which were issued at
165p began trading at 193p. They closed a further 20 higher at 213p.
A series of profit downgrades left Standard Chartered the weakest of the big
banking stocks. The shares closed 8 lower at 485p having been even lower
during very early trading; turnover was 2.8m shares.
County NatWest lowered its current year profits estimate from Pounds 220m to
Pounds 175m.
There was no let up in the takeover speculation surrounding Royal Insurance
which jumped a further 10 to 225p on heavy turnover of 4.6m shares.
The exploration and production sub-sector attracted a fresh bout of strong
support, especially Enterprise Oil which raced up 14 more to 456p on higher
than usual turnover of 2.2m. Dealers said the shares had lagged behind Lasmo
and were in the process of catching up. Lasmo were barely changed at 176p.
Blue Circle Industries (BCI), a strong market since news of the Tomkins'
counter to Hanson's bid for RHM, jumped a further 5 to 167p, after 69p on
heavy turnover of 5.2m shares. Dealers said relatively high turnover in BCI
during the past two months had raised the possibility of a stakebuilder in
the background. Lafarge Coppee, the French group was suggested as a
predator.
Magazine publisher Reed International rose 7 to 582p announcing new terms
for the planned merger with Dutch publisher Elsevier. Analysts said the
terms, which centre on Reed taking a stake of about 5.8 per cent in
Elsevier, were good but slightly lower than market expectations of about 7
per cent. However, the market was still optimistic about the merger and also
cheered by Reed's first half figures, which showed better-than-expected
profit of Pounds 94m.
Specialist magazine Euromoney was boosted 45 to 858p. SG Warburg has put the
group on its buy list ahead of results on November 12.
Smith New Court took a harsh view of its forecasts for Simon Engineering and
metals group ASW Holdings (11 off at 50p). On Simon, the house cut its 1992
forecast by Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 12m and the figure for next year by Pounds
4.1m to Pounds 17.5m. It also reduced its dividend estimate again. The
shares tumbled 35 to 79p, the worst fall in the London market.
Supermarket chain Marks &amp; Spencer eased 2 to 322p as Nomura cut back its
forecast for 1993 by Pounds 30m to Pounds 730m and advised clients to take
profits.
Retailer Kingfisher slipped 11 to 532p on profit-taking and hints of a
profit downgrade.
The bought deal via which Sun Alliance disposed of a block of 60m shares in
CU on September 18 was executed jointly by Smith New Court and Cazenove and
not by Warburg and Cazenove as incorrectly stated in this column on
Thursday.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Coffee
prices reach 9-month highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT turnround in coffee market sentiment following news of a smaller
crop in Brazil, the biggest producer, was maintained this week. But the
continued advance, which lifted robusta coffee prices at the London Futures
and Options Exchange to fresh nine-month highs, chiefly reflected technical
factors.
After a Dollars 12-a-tonne setback on Monday, the uptrend that last week
added Dollars 47 to the January futures position got back into full swing on
Tuesday, when technically-inspired US investment fund buying pushed the
price up Dollars 33 to Dollars 924 a tonne. Although producers remained
reluctant to sell the market needed a period of consolidation before moving
further ahead, and profit-taking on Wednesday and Thursday saw the January
price fall back to Dollars 915 a tonne. Yesterday, however, the bulls were
back in the driving seat and the January quotation touched Dollars 944 a
tonne before closing up Dollars 26 on the day and Dollars 38 on the week at
Dollars 941 a tonne.
Dealers told the Reuter news agency that technically the New York and London
markets looked set to move higher and that the next 'upside' target was
Dollars 950 a tonne for London's January contract.
Cocoa prices also moved higher early in the week, the March position in
London touching a nine-month high of Pounds 734 a tonne on Tuesday. But that
largely reflected sterling's weakness against the dollar. By yesterday's
close the price had surrendered its rise, ending the week Pounds 3 down on
balance at Pounds 705 a tonne.
The market was not looking forward with much optimism to next week's session
of talks on renegotiating the moribund International Cocoa Agreement. So far
little progress has been made on the crucial issues of how a new pact's
price support operations would be financed, what 'floor' and 'ceiling'
prices would be defended and how output would be controlled.
'We always approach the talks with a certain amount of optimism, but we know
how the state of affairs was at the end of the second session in July,'
consumer spokesman Mr Jan van Sluisveld told Reuter.
'We note the positions are far away from each other.'
At the London Metal Exchange cash copper ended the week at Pounds 1,452 a
tonne, up Pounds 69 a tonne, but Pounds 40 of that reflected sterling's
reduced value. Early in the week the copper price rise had also been
encouraged by a threatened strike by workers at Codelco, the Chilean state
metals group, over government privatisation plans. But the threat faded
after union leaders welcomed the government's offer of negotiations. Copper
market sentiment was depressed, meanwhile, by a further rise of 7,250 tonnes
in LME warehouse stocks, taking the total to 314,400 tonnes, the highest
since January.
LME zinc stocks were also up - by 9,225 tonnes to 386,800 tonnes - and
prices remained under pressure. The cash price ended the week at a 9 1/2
 month low of Dollars 1,092.50 a tonne, down Dollars 16.50 on the week.
The price slide, which has wiped Dollars 237.50 off the cash zinc price
since the beginning of this month, resulted in a decision this week by
Curragh Resources, the Canadian mining group, to close its
500,000-tonnes-a-year Faro zinc-lead complex in the Yukon for 16 days over
the Christmas period. But analysts said that would not be enough to turn the
market round. 'Zinc will need a much bigger shock than this,' said Mr Nick
Moore of Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group. 'Production
cutbacks so far have been pretty tentative but this price of about 50 cents
a lb will force producers to make more cuts.'
Tin and nickel prices fell in early trading on Monday in response to news of
British Steel's plans for production cuts. But dealers described that as a
'knee-jerk' reaction and doubted that the BS move would have much long-term
impact on the markets unless there was a round of substantial production
cuts in the European steel industry.
Both metals ended the week lower, nevertheless, although tin steadied
yesterday after the announcement of another fall in LME stocks, taking the
total to the lowest level since July.
The gold price broke through the bottom of its recent trading range this
week following a wave of selling, initially from Europe - principally
Germany and the UK - and then, on Tuesday, from the Middle East. The Dollars
341-a-troy-ounce support level gave way and the price bottomed at Dollars
336.70 an ounce, before recovering to end the week Dollars 3.60 down on
balance at Dollars 339.65 an ounce.

FT  31 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: More optimistic note as account ends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO-WEEK trading account in the London equity market closed on a more
optimistic note yesterday. The City of London interpreted Thursday night's
speech by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, as
confirmation that domestic interest rates are headed lower, while the latest
political reports suggested that Mr John Major's government will next week
secure the support needed for the Maastricht proposals.
Equities closed just under the day's best levels, however, and the
government bond sector heeded a warning from the chancellor against
over-enthusiasm on interest rate prospects. Long-dated gilts shed about  1/8
of a point while index-linked gilts, the securities markets' prime
anti-inflation hedge instruments, put on  3/4 of a point.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,658.3, plus 16 on the day.
This week has seen the Footsie give back 19.4 points as hopes for another
early reduction in base rates from the present 8 per cent level have been
cooled by the Bank of England. But over the two-week equity account, the
Footsie has gained around 3.4 per cent in the wake of the UK government's
move to a policy of economic growth.
Yesterday's recovery in share prices indicated significant confidence for
the medium term in the face of a round of very gloomy trading reports this
week from leading names in British industry - notably ICI and British Steel.
Trading volume remained brisk, with the Seaq-reported total at 558.3m shares
compared with 567.1m in the previous session.
Thursday's retail or customer business was worth Pounds 1.3bn, maintaining
the improved trading volumes of the past two months.
The London market came off the top at the close when Wall Street came in
with a fall of 21 Dow points early in its new session. Now that tensions on
the domestic political front appear to be easing, the next test for
investment confidence is the US presidential election; the latest opinion
polls from across the Atlantic were indicating a dead heat between President
Bush and Governor Clinton.
ICI remained depressed following the third quarter trading report which has
cast over the UK blue chip company the same worries over the dividend
outlook as have already unsettled other European chemical groups.
After slipping back from the best levels achieved following sterling's exit
from the ERM network, retail business has begun to rise again.

FT  31 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES markets had a quieter session yesterday as the two-week equity
account came to its close, writes Terry Byland.
In stock index futures, the FT-SE contract for December delivery moved
erratically in thin turnover with only 6,633 contracts traded, but
maintained the premium which has now been sustained for more than one month.
Interest rate optimism was encouraged by Thursday night's speech in the City
of London by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer and with
the domestic political outlook now more stable, there was support for the
futures contract. At the official close, December showed a premium of about
30 points to cash. Dealers estimated the fair value premium, which allows
for dividend flows and carrying costs, at about 17 from Monday morning,
taking account of expectations that interest rates could fall before
December expires.
In traded options, volume fell to 19,164 contracts from Thursday's 24,637.
The FT-SE contract recorded only 3,415. Among individual share contracts,
British Airways (1,917) headed the actives list.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Reynolds throws down the gauntlet: The Irish premier has
dared his coalition partner to bring down the government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATCHING the crisis being played out in the coalition government in Ireland
this week has been like watching two people play Russian roulette.
Prime Minister Albert Reynolds this week set the country on course for a
pre-Christmas general election by accusing Mr Des O'Malley, his industry
minister and leader of the Progressive Democrats, the junior coalition
partners, of having been 'dishonest' and of having deliberately misled a
parliamentary inquiry into the country's beef industry this year.
Mr Reynolds was defending his own record as industry minister in 1987 and
1988, which Mr O'Malley criticised last June, accusing Mr Reynolds of 'grave
errors of judgment' in allocating export credit insurance to Irish meat
companies for beef exports to Iraq.
During three days in the witness box, Mr Reynolds repeated his accusation,
saying Mr O'Malley had deliberately exaggerated the potential liability to
which this export cover had exposed taxpayers.
In effect, the charge accuses Mr O'Malley of having perjured himself.
Yesterday however, Mr Reynolds acted as though nothing had changed and told
the Dail (parliament) that he would be proceeding with government business
as usual. He later told a party meeting: 'I have no difficulty whatever in
continuing to work in government with the PD ministers. I want to
categorically refute the suggestion that I want a general election or am
attempting to bring one about.'
The PDs have called upon Mr Reynolds either to withdraw the accusation or to
sack Mr O'Malley. A spokesman for Mr Reynolds said yesterday that neither
course of action was being contemplated. 'It's a question now as to whether
they (the PDs) want to bring the government down.'
Mr Reynolds has thus placed the bullet in the revolver, spun the chamber,
pointed it at the government's head, and then asked Mr O'Malley to pull the
trigger.
The PD party was formed in 1985 after Mr O'Malley was expelled from the
Fianna Fail party, then in opposition and under the control of Mr Charles
Haughey. Mr O'Malley had bitterly opposed Mr Haughey's controversial style,
and set out to create a party which would be seen as holding the high ground
in political ethics. So it cannot ignore Mr Reynolds' 'dishonesty' charge
against Mr O'Malley.
A PD spokesman said yesterday party officials would meet party activists
around the country at the weekend to discuss whether to continue support for
the coalition. Any decision to withdraw would be announced next Tuesday, at
the next cabinet meeting.
A coalition collapse would be followed quickly by a no-confidence motion in
the Dail, and the fall of the government. Elections would then have to be
held within 30 days. The most probable date would be December 3, the date of
a referendum on abortion.
His denials notwithstanding, the events of the past week increasingly appear
to have been a calculated move by Mr Reynolds to force the PDs out of the
coalition. But why?
One answer is that many activists in Mr Reynolds' party have come to view
the six PD deputies in the Dail as the tail wagging the Fianna Fail dog,
which has 77 seats. When Mr Haughey was prime minister, Mr O'Malley forced
successive policy changes on his government by threatening to walking out,
and even brought about Mr Haughey's downfall in January following a series
of scandals, when a PD ultimatum to Fianna Fail made it clear that either Mr
Haughey must go, or the PDs would.
Under Mr Reynolds' leadership Fianna Fail is now much stronger in the
opinion polls than a year ago, and Mr Reynolds has used that advantage to
ignore the PDs on a number of key issues in recent months such as fiscal
policy, industrial development strategy, the wording of the coming abortion
referendum, and the government's negotiating stance on Northern Ireland.
The PDs have swallowed their pride and their principles on each issue, and
have grudgingly continued to support Fianna Fail. But the final slap in the
face came this week at the beef tribunal.
Fianna Fail aspires to become a majority government, an ambition which
eluded Mr Haughey during his 12 years as party leader. Mr Reynolds himself
has described the coalition 'as a temporary little arrangement'. The latest
polls show Fianna Fail support at 50 per cent of the electorate, but when
undecided voters are included their support falls to 42 per cent, less than
the 44.1 per cent in the 1989 elections.
It may be Mr Reynolds' calculation that with unemployment rising, high
interest rates possibly continuing well into 1993, and a difficult budget
next year, he stands a better chance calling a snap election now, rather
than waiting for Mr O'Malley to choose the moment when the economy looks
much bleaker.
The problem is that if an election fails to secure an absolute majority, no
party is now likely to join Fianna Fail to form a government. Fine Gael, the
main opposition party, has this week been oiling its electoral machinery and
discussing coalition strategy, but the Labour party, with 15 seats, has said
it is not interested. Months, rather than weeks, of political instability
lie ahead.

FT  31 OCT 92 / US and EC in last-ditch trade talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community and the US are to make a final effort to resolve
their farm trade disputes at a top-level meeting in Chicago tomorrow and
Monday.
The meeting, between Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, and Mr
Ed Madigan, his US counterpart, is seen on both sides as the last chance to
avert a trade war, and salvage hopes for wide-ranging trade liberalisation
under the Uruguay Round, which has been held up for two years by the food
exports row.
In the US, a trade official said there was little optimism that the new
talks would provide a breakthrough. They agreed to meet after Mr John Major,
Britain's prime minister and current president of the EC, urged President
George Bush to make one last try for a settlement before the US presidential
election.
By Monday night, the eve of the US election, the US and EC will either have
resolved small outstanding differences on EC oilseeds output and wheat
exports, and US exports of cheap cereals substitutes, or Washington will
probably go ahead with punitive tariffs on EC farm products - a move that
would almost certainly trigger retaliation.
Mr Bush has been keen to get an agriculture agreement before the election,
according to an aide, because he will find it difficult to continue
negotiations if he loses the election.
Senior EC officials think a deal can be done, but are suspicious of US
timing. They say any agreement will be very finely balanced, and will fall
short of the demands of the powerful US farm lobbies.
This week, the US relented in efforts to hold the EC to maximum oilseeds
output of 9m tonnes, compared with 11.4m tonnes now, offering to accept the
ceiling implicit in the Community's reformed Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP) of 9.5m tonnes. But it wants binding guarantees.
Mr MacSharry is willing to carry into an international agreement the
enforcement mechanisms of the CAP reform, but refuses to move outside the
CAP framework.
The two sides appear to have agreed to cut subsidised food exports volume by
21 per cent, compared with 24 per cent under the Uruguay Round.
France has been opposing a Gatt deal because it claims this provision will
batter its lucrative wheat exports.
The EC wants a commitment from the US that its exports of corn-gluten - a
feedstock substitute cheap enough to undercut almost any cereals price -
will not undermine the CAP reform, which cuts cereals prices by about a
third to near world market price.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Vatican admits Galileo was right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Catholic Church is to set right tomorrow one of its great wrongs.
In a special ceremony in Rome, Pope John Paul will formally rehabilitate
Galileo Galilei, the astronomer and pioneer of modern physical science who
was condemned by the Inquisition in 1633 for daring to prove the earth
orbited the sun.
The rehabilitation of Galileo is a rare breach in the church's dogmatic
approach to infallibility. Cutting through the coded language of the Vatican
in reassessing Galileo's achievements, the Holy See is admitting the Church
of the day was wrong and the Pisan scientist was right.
Galileo fell foul of Rome after publishing in 1632 his famous Dialogue on
the Ptolemaic and the Copernican Systems. This defence and exposition of the
Copernican view that the earth orbited the sun along with other planets in
the solar system ran directly counter to church doctrine based on the
Ptolemaic idea of the earth being in a fixed position.
Not content with demolishing church doctrine in this respect, Galileo became
embroiled in theological controversy by trying to explain the relevance and
inconsistency of certain biblical texts in the light of his theory. Despite
powerful friends, Galileo was by this time an old man in poor health, and
faced with torture he agreed to abjure his 'heresies'.
For three years he was obliged as a penitent of the Holy Inquisition to
recite the seven penitential psalms once a week and spent the rest of his
life under house arrest.
His books were removed from the index in 1757 but the church still refused
to admit any mistake had been made, despite the clear recognition of his
achievement by scientists. The Galileo case thus remained until the advent
of the present Pope the most controversial symbol of the clash between
science and Christian faith, a subject immortalised by Brecht's play
Galileo.
In 1979, the Pope announced a commission of the Vatican's Academy of Science
to study Galileo's rehabilitation. The commission's judgment after 12 years'
deliberation is that Galileo's judges erred in good faith, but they were
wrong.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Statoil gas supply fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, has been forced to consider
drastic measures to prevent threatening interruption of gas supply to the
European continent, its main market.
The group is looking at alternatives to allow domestic gas production to
bypass the ageing Norwegian North Sea Ekofisk field centre, the hub of the
world's largest transportation system.
Concern over the 20-year-old Ekofisk facilities has increased since the
Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the oil industry watchdog, warned Phillips
Petroleum Norway, operator, that the tank on the main processing and
transportation facilities might have to be closed for safety reasons in the
winter of 1995-1996.
Approximately 18bn cu m of gas annually is transported to a consortium of
European buyers via Ekofisk and approximately 40 per cent of Norway's
petroleum production is processed there.
The directorate is expected to respond on Monday to interim measures
presented yesterday by Phillips for modifications at Ekofisk until a final
plan to meet stringent demands for the field's rehabilitation and safety
enhancement can be presented late next year. Phillips said yesterday it
would relocate process facilities elsewhere in the field.
With Norway's gas supply to Europe increasing, Statoil sees it as a priority
to reduce dependence on Ekofisk. It said operational reliability of the
Statpipe gas transportation system, which is connected to Ekofisk, had been
reduced by problems this year at the field.
Statoil intends to unveil a proposal for an alternative solution next year.
Production from the Ula and Gyda fields, operated by British Petroleum
Norway, is also affected by Ekofisk irregularities.

THE General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world trade body yesterday set up
a dispute panel to investigate a Japanese complaint against duties imposed
by the European Community on imported audio cassette tapes, trade sources
said, Reuter reports from Geneva.
The decision was taken at a closed-door meeting of the Gatt anti-dumping
committee.
The two trading partners agreed to neutral arbitration on the nearly
18-month row after the committee chairman, Mr Armando Ortega of Mexico, held
mediation talks this week.
Canada, the US and Hong Kong told the 25-nation committee that they had a
'trade interest' in the matter and would submit their own data to the panel.
In May 1991 the EC, charging that the cassettes were being dumped, or sold
at artificially low prices, imposed duties of 15 to 25 per cent on tapes
imported from Japan. Tokyo says the duties violate Gatt's 1979 anti-dumping
code.
According to Tokyo figures, Japanese producers' share of tapes sold in the
EC market dropped to 35.1 per cent in 1988 from 41.9 per cent in 1985. In
1985, EC-made tapes' EC market share was 27.4 per cent, falling to 19.6 per
cent in 1988.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Commission rushes to Delors' defence: Comments rejecting
Danish opt-outs from Maastricht 'taken out of context'
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday issued an angry response to reports that
Mr Jacques Delors, its president, had ruled out any possibility of Denmark
getting a series of legally binding opt-outs to the Maastricht treaty.
According to his spokesman, Mr Delors's words were wrenched from their
context, which was a simple restatement of what the 12, including Denmark,
have reiterated ever since Danish voters rejected the treaty by a narrow
margin in the June 2 referendum - that there can be no renegotiation of the
treaty.
Nevertheless, a transcript of Mr Delors' remarks cannot be interpreted as
less than a reminder to Denmark that it risks being left behind by its
partners if it fails to ratify Maastricht in a new referendum. Diplomats in
Brussels were unwilling to add to the controversy, but regarded the remarks
as unhelpful during the unresolved ratification crisis in Denmark and the
UK.
'The president was merely restating the doctrine of the Community,' Mr
Delors' spokesman insisted. 'Frankly, he only said what I have heard him say
at least 15 times.'
The spokesman drew attention to introductory and concluding remarks Mr
Delors made in a question-and-answer session with the Belgian parliament on
Thursday, which appeared to hedge Mr Delors' judgment that the treaty could
not be tampered with to accommodate Danish concerns.
The Commission president said: 'We can only resolve the Danish problem by
adding interpretative declarations (to the treaty), and not a protocol,
since that has the value of a treaty.'
Denmark is looking for binding guarantees it will not have to take part in a
single currency later this century, or the eventual common defence policy
mooted by Maastricht.
Denmark sent its demands for special terms, to enable it to submit the
Maastricht treaty to a second referendum, to European governments yesterday,
claiming that the special terms could be made legally binding without having
to renegotiate the treaty.
The Danish position paper, in which the country's demands are set out, is
backed by seven of the eight parties in the Folketing. The paper received
the formal approval of the Market Affairs Committee yesterday.
Mr Delors underlined 'two principles', which conjured up again the spectre
of Europe's integrationists going ahead towards union, leaving Denmark, and
the UK if it fails to ratify Maastricht, on Europe's sidelines.
'First,' Mr Delors said, 'nobody can force a country to ratify Maastricht.
Second, no country can possess such an enormous right of veto that it can
stop others from going forward.'
The Danish question, in the judgment of many Brussels and member state
officials dealing with it, is likely to turn on the wording and legal status
of the guarantees Copenhagen is seeking.

IN defiance of the United Nations peace plan, leaders of Serb-held
territories in Bosnia and Croatia today meet to create the 'Union of Serbian
States'.
The 'all-Serbian parliament' is due to meet in Prijedor, a Serb-controlled
town in northern Bosnia, to work on the creation of the new state linking
Serb-held territories in Croatia and Serbia.
They propose to establish a joint army, currency and citizenship.
Local Serb leaders are spurning the efforts of Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen,
the co-presidents of the Geneva Conference, to broker a peace in the former
Yugoslavia. This occurs amid growing calls from Croatia, under President
Franjo Tudjman, to assert control over the UN-controlled zones, which
comprise a third of Croatian territory.
Mr Cedric Thornberry, the UN chief of civil affairs, warned on Thursday of
'deteriorating anarchy' in one of the UN zones, where he said local Serb
militia refused to hand over their weapons.
While the UN peace plan is under threat in Croatia, hopes of ending the
fighting in neighbouring Bosnia have also receded. Bosnian Serb and Croat
leaders have rejected a new constitution proposed by peace mediators Cyrus
Vance and Lord Owen to set up a decentralised republic, which is not divided
on ethnic lines. Serb forces yesterday seized another key city in central
Bosnia.
Belgrade radio announced the 'liberation' of Jajce, whose population of
40,000 is 81 per cent non-Serb. The loss of Jajce dealt another blow to the
mostly Moslem Bosnian forces. The city was the headquarters of the Partizan
resistance to German rule in the second world war. They proclaimed the
formation of Communist Yugoslavia there in 1943.
Jajce was earlier the seat of the last Bosnian king, Stjepan Tomasevic, in
1463. Bosnia's mainly Moslem government has appealed for foreign military
intervention in the former Yugoslav republic, which was recognised by the
European Community and the US on April 7. Serb forces now control 70 per
cent of Bosnia and Croats about 25 per cent.

FRANCE'S unemployed, the government's main economic and political problem,
rose by 1 per cent to 2.9m last month, wiping out the marked fall in August.
The rise brings the September unemployment rate to 10.3 per cent, from 10.2
per cent in the previous month, well above the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development average of 7.5 per cent in August. Mrs Martine
Aubry, the labour minister, blamed the increase on a jump in redundancies
and the end of more temporary work contracts than usual.
This means the number of French unemployed has risen by 4.9 per cent over
the past year. The outlook for a revival in employment is poor.

DEFENCE of the lira during the currency markets' turbulence of September

It also showed for the first time the full extent of its short-term

This short-term support, due to be repaid on December 16, ensured that
foreign exchange reserves at the end of September were L20,801bn against the
previous month's L22,891bn. Nevertheless between August and September, total
net reserves were halved, falling from L62,670bn to L32,917bn.
The country's net reserves are now at their lowest since 1978 and are less
than one third of the L108,581bn this time last year. The acceleration in
the loss of reserves began in June with the result of the Danish referendum
on Maastricht. However, throughout the crisis the bank has refused to touch
its reserves of gold, now valued at L26,228bn.

<TEXT>
THE US treasurer, the official heading the Bureau of the Mint, is under
investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on charges of influence
peddling and accepting payment from her former employer after taking up her
government post.
Ms Catalina Vasquez Villalpando, appointed treasurer by President George
Bush in 1989, was placed on administrative leave, the Treasury said. Her
signature appears on US dollar bills alongside that of Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady.
Her only other appearance in the limelight was at the Republican convention
in August, when she had to apologise for calling Governor Bill Clinton, the
Democratic presidential nominee, a 'skirt-chaser'.
The investigation is the latest in a series of increasingly bizarre probes
and counterprobes involving the FBI.
It is investigating the Justice Department's handling of the Banca Nazionale
del Lavoro prosecution in Atlanta, and also recently mounted a operation to
see if the head of the Bush re-election campaign in Texas would sign up for
a wiretap on the telephones of independent presidential candidate Ross
Perot.
At the same time, Mr William Sessions, director of the FBI, is himself under
investigation by the Justice Department for possible ethics violations.
The FBI said its agents two days ago carried out searches in the Washington
area and in Georgia in connection with the Villalpandoinvestigation.
It said the raids were conducted to look for evidence of fraud, bribery of
public officials, racketeering, conspiracy, conspiracy to defraud the
government, fraudulent claims and false statements.
Affidavits in support of the search warrants and detailing the alleged
criminal activity have been sealed by federal courts, the FBI said,
preventing public disclosure.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush knew about and personally supported the Reagan
administration's covert arms-for-hostages dealings with Iran at a White
House meeting in January 1986, according to fresh evidence presented by a
grand jury in Washington yesterday.
The evidence was in a new indictment of Mr Caspar Weinberger, the former US
defence secretary who was charged yesterday with lying to Congress about the
transactions.
The evidence, based on a handwritten diary note by Mr Weinberger,
contradicts Mr Bush's claim that he was 'out of the loop' on the Iran-Contra
affair.
Mr Bush's knowledge of the Iran-Contra affair, together with allegations
that the Bush administration has covered up Washington's involvement in the
arming and financing of Iraq, have both become issues in the election
campaign.
Democratic candidates Bill Clinton and Al Gore have both questioned whether
Mr Bush has told the truth in both the Iran and Iraq affairs, with Mr Gore
claiming the dimensions of the alleged cover-up are 'larger than Watergate'.
According to the new indictment of Mr Weinberger, he attended a White House
meeting held in the Oval Office on January 7, 1986 with then President
Ronald Reagan; Vice-President Bush; Mr Schultz; Mr William Casey, then CIA
director; Mr Edward Meese, then Attorney-General; and Mr John Poindexter,
then National Security Adviser.
According to yesterday's indictment, Mr Weinberger's notes from that meeting
included the following: 'Met with President, Schultz, Poindexter, Bill
Casey, Ed Meese in Oval Office. President decided to go with Israeli-Iranian
offer to release our five hostages in return for sale of 4,000 TOWs
(anti-tank missiles) to Iran by Israel. George Schultz and I opposed. Bill
Casey, Ed Meese and VP favoured, as did Poindexter.' That meeting took place
10 days before Mr Reagan formally approved a covert plan for the
arms-for-hostages transactions.

President Carlos Salinas of Mexico has ended speculation that he might alter
the nation's constitution to enable him to seek re-election after his first
term expires at the end of 1994, Damian Fraser reports in Mexico City.
Addressing congressmen, the president said: 'I will not promote, nor accept
the promotion of any measure to modify the principle of no re-election.' Mr
Salinas is still only 44, relatively popular and clearly happy in office -
all of which fuelled speculation that he might seek another term.

<TEXT>
WALL STREET was unsettled yesterday by an unexpected fall in new home sales
and a plunge in the Chicago purchasing managers' index of industrial
activity for October.
New home sales fell 1 per cent in September, to register their first drop in
five months despite lower mortgage rates. The Chicago index fell 10 points
to 49.7 per cent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 19.99 at 3,226.28.
However, the Chicago purchasing managers' index has been running
substantially higher than the national index, to be released on Monday.
The new home sales figures were also better than they looked because data
for August were revised up sharply. Sales were running at annual rate of
617,000 in September; the new figure for August was 623,000, up 1.6 per cent
from July. Previous estimates had shown August sales running at only
570,000, down 6.1 per cent from July.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Fourth estate stands in as whipping boy: Complaints of
distortion by the media figure prominently in all three campaigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS only a gentle tap on the shoulder in Winston-Salem and the little old
lady was very polite. Could I please move a few feet to one side so she
could get a better view of the candidate when he arrived and perhaps could I
ask some of my colleagues in the press pen to do the same.
Blocking the view is a problem. There were approximately 190 members of the
fourth estate on the Clinton-Gore bus tour through the small towns of North
Carolina, three-quarters of them from television, and it often was difficult
for members of the public to catch even a glimpse of the candidates through
the forest of cameras and sound mikes.
But, if blocking the view were the only problem, solutions could always be
found: trenches for cameramen, for example, or the public in the front rows,
the zoom-lens press in the back. The candidates' complaint - and it is as
bad this year as it has ever been - is that it is their views that are being
distorted.
President Bush has a bumper sticker that he waves to rallies: 'Annoy the
media: Re-elect George Bush.' Hardly a day goes by without his charging that
the media depict the economy as being far worse than it is, or that it keeps
asking him questions he has already answered, on Iran-Contra, for example.
There was nothing wrong with the Republican convention, he said yesterday,
only the way it was reported.
His son, Jeb, also chipped in yesterday with a letter to the Wall Street
Journal about an article that had investigated his business connections, and
those of his brother, Neil. It demonstrated, he wrote, 'a predisposition to
broadcast any set of facts that may have even a remote likelihood of
inflicting damage on the president's family, and by association President
Bush himself.'
Republicans have always claimed the media is infused with liberal bias. This
was clearly daft in the 1980s, when President Reagan got an almost free
ride, and even in 1988, when much negative Bush advertising passed largely
without comment.
It is true that Mr Clinton has picked up more newspaper endorsements than
most Democrats have for years, and from some unlikely sources, such as the
Portland Oregonian and the Hartford Courant, both for 100 years rock-ribbed
in the other direction.
Even Mr William Safire of the New York Times, who used to write speeches for
Nixon and Agnew, wound up a sharply anti-Bush column on Thursday with these
words: 'Any reader who cannot figure out against whom this lifelong
Republican is voting this year isn't trying'.
The president's particular grouse against 'talking heads' is that they wrote
off his election chances too early. Some of them, he even acknowledged in a
television interview yesterday, were conservative or Republican.
Private cold feet may be found in the studios and newsrooms of the nation in
the face of Mr Clinton's narrowing lead, but it is hard to tell that from
their public utterances. Two of them, Ms Cokie Roberts of ABC and Mr Kevin
Phillips, the political consultant and quondam Republican, agreed on the
radio yesterday that the striking aspect of the latest polls was that Mr
Bush could not rise much above 35 per cent, simply not enough to win an
election.
Mr Clinton has had a rough year with the media and, once or twice, when the
accusations about his private life have been flying thickest, has stopped
being affable and chatty, which is his wont.
But nobody has the contempt for the fourth estate that infuses Mr Ross
Perot, the purest of populists.
He wants no filter between himself and his public and is convinced that the
media distorts every self-evident truth he speaks. This is why his campaign
relies so much on paid-for 'infomercials', in which only he gets to talk.
The extent of this consuming passion was more than evident on Thursday,
during his latest appearance on Larry King Live, his favourite talk show. He
launched into an endless digression on why it was wrong for the ABC network
to ask him to choose between two programmes he had been booked for. 'I've
got a say in this,' he said, implying that ABC, which could hardly give him
more 'free' air time than his opposition, did not.
In reality, the candidates protest too much. When all is said and done, this
has not been a 'soundbite' election campaign, not only because of the
televised debates but because the proliferation of new media and programme
outlets has allowed all of them to talk the hind legs off a donkey. This
weekend, President Bush is even appearing on MTV, the pop music channel.
Also, after a bit of initial huffing and puffing about displacement, the
establishment media really has not minded that much. If nothing else, talk
shows are a way of finding out what the great electorate and the candidates
do think. And some of the press corps really did heed the little old lady's
request in Winston-Salem.

Mr Clark Clifford, the former US defence secretary who is seeking to use
health reasons to avoid standing trial on criminal charges stemming from the
Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) affair, was accused in
court yesterday of trying to manipulate the US criminal justice system,
writes Alan Friedman in New York. The accusation came from Mr Robert
Morgenthau, the New York district attorney who filed a 50-page motion in
court to oppose Mr Clifford's request that his BCCI-related case be
dismissed because of his heart condition.
Lawyers for the 85-year-old Mr Clifford have claimed he should not be tried
as he might die as a result of the stress inherent in a court trial. Mr
Morgenthau said that dismissing the Clifford case would be wrong since it
would indicate that 'public figures can manipulate and avoid the US criminal

FT  31 OCT 92 / Selling the silver: English Heritage's planned disposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fort Cumberland stands on the foreshore at Portsmouth, an awesome monument
to 19th-century Britain's determination to keep the French at bay. For years
it has been derelict, unloved and unvisited, one of English Heritage's more
tiresome responsibilities.
It was hardly surprising that, when Mr Jocelyn Stevens, chairman of English
Heritage, announced this week his plan to dispose of about 200 of the 360
properties in the care of his organisation, Fort Cumberland was high on the
hit list.
Mr Stevens was convinced that Hampshire County Council would be keen to
acquire the fort; indeed that it might actually pay for the privilege. Here
was an example of how the stewardship of minor relics from the past - ruined
monasteries, derelict castles, remote pre-historic barrows - could
successfully pass from distant London to proud local councils, or special
interest groups.
Mr Freddie Emery-Wallis, leader of Hampshire County Council, does not quite
see it this way. He would be quite happy to take on the fort, and what is
left of bomb-damaged Portsmouth Royal Garrison Church, another potential
casualty - but only if he gets extra money to do it.
Mr Stevens, however, has shown no enthusiasm to finance new custodians on a
long-term basis, although some transitional funding seems inevitable.
'These sites are the responsibility of the government and English Heritage.
I'm sure we could do a better job looking after them but we expect to
receive financial assistance.'
The White Horse at Uffington in Oxfordshire, probably an early Iron Age
fertility symbol, is also on Mr Stevens' yet-to-be-finalised list of
disposals. The National Trust owns the adjacent downland and would be an
obvious candidate to take over the horse. But, says Mr Warren Davis of the
Trust: 'We will not willingly take on an existing liability.' The Trust
administers the surrounding countryside on the understanding that English
Heritage pays for the archaeological investigations and maintenance of the
site. It would expect English Heritage to hand over money with a change of
ownership.
There is, however, no mention of money in Mr Stevens' master plan, drawn up
within six months of his arrival at English Heritage. Previously he had been
rector of the Royal College of Art which he made more commercially minded,
though at the cost of losing many of its top professors. He was given the
job because the government felt English Heritage was a rather bloated
bureaucracy, which cost Pounds 90m a year in subsidies. But it could be that
Mr Stevens' overhaul has gone further than his pay-masters had anticipated.
In his rush to shake things up Mr Stevens seems to have ignored
consultation. Even English Heritage's Ancient Monuments Advisory Committee,
headed by Sir David Wilson, former director of the British Museum, was kept
in the dark about the changes. He has expressed dismay at the site
disposals.
As well as upsetting the National Trust, whose chief executive has belatedly
arranged a meeting with Mr Stevens next week, other interested parties are
angry. Mr Neil Sinden, planning officer at the Council for the Protection of
Rural England, sees it 'as a very significant abdication by English Heritage
of part of its responsibilities'.
The National Heritage Memorial Fund, the other main guardian of the past,
feels the reforms could have been handled more diplomatically. 'It makes
sense for piles of stones, which are the main sites that English Heritage
wants to hand over, to be run at a local level rather than from London, but
it has been sprung on the world,' says Ms Georgina Nayler, director of the
fund.
So does Mr Stevens face an almost impossible task in unloading his surplus
sites? He maintains that he would only negotiate with respectable
proprietors and is 'not keen on selling to entrepreneurs'. He does not
expect that business groups will be interested in taking on what are often
obscure and out of the way relics. Indeed, it is hard to imagine many
commercial interests willing to take on an Iron Age barrow in Dorset, for
example.
There are now signs of retrenchment at the appropriately named Fortress
House, the London home of English Heritage.
'We have an eight-year programme to dispose of the sites,' says chief
executive Ms Jennifer Page. 'We will not hand over any site unless we are
certain it can be safely managed and maintained.'
English Heritage wants to concentrate its resources on a new agenda, on
improving its more spectacular sites, such as Stonehenge, with almost 1m
visitors a year. It plans to invest where there are people and tourists, on
enhancing towns such as Bath and York, as well as such historic industrial
areas as Halifax. It expects to spend more on restoring churches and
cathedrals. But the money to invest in these chosen growth areas will not
come from savings achieved by disposing of properties.
Even more than the planned disposals, Mr Stevens' critics are concerned by
his decision to relinquish the powers over Grade II listed buildings in
London which English Heritage inherited when the Greater London Council was
abolished in 1986.
Its responsibility for protecting such buildings has proved valuable. When
the Duke of Westminster wanted to demolish St George's Hospital at Hyde Park
Corner (now the Lanesborough Hotel) English Heritage stiffened the resolve
of Westminster Council. Mr Stevens expects the local boroughs to assume full
responsibility for their historic buildings. But none has the resources and
few the personnel to undertake the task.
Lambeth, for example, rate-capped and in terrible financial straits, cannot
afford the luxury of conservation officers. 'We are deeply concerned,' says
Janet Crook, chair of the environmental services committee. 'I believe in
safeguarding our heritage but the council is not going to cut the social
services budget by Pounds 100,000 to find the funding. It's impossible for
it to work.'
Much of what Mr Stevens proposes is sensible. Who could complain if the
Ivanhoe Trust wants to take over the remains of Conisborough Castle near
Doncaster, where it already organises events? Some rationalisation of
headquarters staff is also inevitable, although the speed with which the
appeal for 100 redundancies has been met should worry Mr Stevens. The loss
of 180 jobs among the direct labour force by April and its eventual
privatisation is more disturbing, because of the dispersal of a team of
skilled craftsmen.
But the real cause for concern in the drive to get the English Heritage
workforce down from 1,600 to 1,000 must lie in the disappearance of the
London specialists.
It is the speed with which the changes were announced, and the fear that
they have been undertaken at the government's order, that most alarms the
heritage lobby. English Heritage should quickly demonstrate cultural gains
from the overhaul. It should, for example, confirm that it is contributing
Pounds 1m to save the deteriorating Royal Crescent in Buxton.
At the moment it is in danger of losing the support of its 300,000 members,
who are being asked to pay more in annual fees for access to fewer sites, as
well as that of the heritage professionals. If these disparate groups were
to join forces, they would make a powerful coalition of opponents.

FT  31 OCT 92 / War and pieces: UN proposals to resolve Bosnia's ethnic
conflict through decentralisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first tentative steps towards reaching a political settlement in Bosnia
were taken earlier this week when Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the joint
chairmen of the Geneva conference, unveiled a draft constitutional plan for
the former Yugoslav republic. It is an ambitious document which hinges on
the principle that Bosnia's territorial integrity must remain intact, that
the republic must not be carved up between Serbia and Croatia, and that
ethnic cleansing should be reversed.
'The cantonisation of Bosnia into three regions, largely dominated by Croats
and Serbs, will never be accepted,' said Lord Owen in a recent interview.
'Instead, we will work towards a decentralised republic consisting of about
10 provinces, each with a wide degree of autonomy covering the spheres of
education, police, judiciary and local government.'
Lord Owen insisted that the 10 regions would be anchored on the democratic
principles of the rule of law. What remains unclear is how such principles
would be implemented, or indeed how the fighting between the Moslems, Croats
and Serbs could be stopped. More important, the criteria for drawing the
proposed regional borders have yet to be agreed.
He stressed that 'any family, mainly Moslems, who have been forced out, can
return. Ethnic cleansing will be reversed. It will probably take about 20
years to achieve this. But we are not prepared to make the Moslems the new
Jews of Europe.'
Despite these well-meaning intentions, it is difficult to see how ethnic
cleansing - the forcible expulsion of local populations along ethnic lines -
will or can be reversed. The homes of many Bosnian Moslems have been
destroyed by the Serbs precisely in order to prevent them from returning.
Further, the peace plan does not guarantee the security of those who want to
return. Above all, the hatred between the ethnic groups of the former
Yugoslavia is now so intense that it is hard to imagine that Croats, Moslems
and Serbs will want to live together again in Bosnia - or in any of the
former Yugoslav republics.
A senior UN diplomat commented: 'I fear it is already too late to save
Bosnia. I do not know how it can be put back together again. I do not know
know how the war can be contained.'
But since the Geneva negotiators seem determined to prevent Bosnia becoming
what Lord Owen called 'another Lebanon', many Balkan specialists believe the
newly created provinces should be given protectorate status.
'A UN protectorate, backed by outside police and judges, would mean that it
would be impossible for Serbs and Croats to organise their own states within
Bosnia,' said Mr Zarko Puhovski, a political scientist at Zagreb University.
Ms Jane Sharpe, a defence specialist at the Institute for Public Policy
Research, a London-based think-tank, concurs: 'The provinces created for
Moslems and Bosnians will be surrounded by authoritarian Croat and
Serb-dominated provinces. The Moslems will feel vulnerable; they will need
protection.'
While the Geneva negotiators consider the issue of setting up protectorates
in Bosnia, the international community is already being pushed into
accepting ethnically pure regions throughout the former Yugoslavia as one of
the prices of peace. 'Whether we like to accept it or not, we have already
turned a blind eye to the forcible transfer of populations, particularly the
Moslems,' the same UN diplomat said. 'For the price of peace, it would not
surprise me if the international community will tactily condone more
movements of people, whether through force, or through negotiations,' he
added.
The prospect of Bosnia being divided along ethnically homogeneous lines
could set dangerous precedents, not only for the rest of the former
Yugoslavia, but for the countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union.
'If the Serbs, or any other group in the region, can get away with it,
potential dictators (elsewhere) can adopt the same methods with the aim of
setting up their own ethnic states,' said Mr Charles Dick, a defence expert
at the Soviet Studies Research Centre at Sandhurst. 'The point is that
ethnic cleansing, and the transfer of populations in the former Yugoslavia,
have been achieved through violence.'
Mr James Gow, a Balkan specialist with the Centre for Defence Studies at
Kings' College, London, agrees: 'If such mono-ethnic communities, originally
established through force, are accepted at the Geneva peace conference, what
will dissuade the ethnic Albanians from the Serb-controlled province of
Kosovo, or any other minority from setting up their own ethnically pure
states through the diktat of either precedent or force?'
These views are echoed by Mr George Schopflin, a lecturer at the London
School of Economics. He believes a process of restricted citizenship based
on ethnic background - which is now being implemented both in Croatia and in
Serb and Croat-held regions of Bosnia - could be emulated by the governments
of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Moldova, Croatia, Slovakia and Romania, all of
which are involved in ethnic disputes.
'The west is not helping to create the climate in which democratic habits
can take root,' he said. 'The fledgling democratic institutions of these
countries will be undermined because these new states will have been built
on ethnic criteria, and not on democratic principles. That is why any
precedent in establishing ethnically pure regions in the former Yugoslavia
is not only dangerous, but it will lead to instability in the entire
region.'
The primary goal of the Geneva negotiators is to reach a settlement in
Bosnia. How they define peace, however, is likely to have wider and more
long-term implications.

<TEXT>
Sir, I was interested in Barry Riley's remarks (The Long View, October 24)
where he says that '. . . devaluation only works if real incomes are cut';
and at the end of the same paragraph '. . . that British employees fiercely
resist nominal pay cuts'.
In the Netherlands, such cuts have been made in the past - for instance, in
1951, the early 1980s and possibly even now. The system of tripartite wage
negotiations (government, employees' and employers' federations) seems to
have helped.
Should you wish to talk to the ministry of finance in the Hague about it,
the key words to use would probably be 'bestedings-beperking' and
'inleveren', meaning roughly 'scaling down expenditure' and 'temporary
belt-tightening by everyone'.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Letter: Privatisation of Post Office ludicrous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr THOMAS J PERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The notion that privatisation of the Post Office is a desirable and
'feasible' proposition ('Post Office privatisation 'feasible'', October 26)
is ludicrous if one couples with it the idea that both the standard of
service and employment levels are to be maintained.
Britain's Post Office evolved over 150 years to become the best in the
world. Accountants with calculators cannot measure the negative welfare
effect of dismembering the services it offers.
Sir Ronald Deering, the former chairman, knew this and said so - perhaps
that is why the blinkered Thatcherite marketeers welcomed his departure.
The less profitable counters business provides both a service and a kind of
life line for the least affluent sections of the community as both staff and
customers will testify. Furthermore, sub-postmasters, who account for more
than 70 per cent of the total business, have collectively invested Pounds
6bn in their businesses. The best way forward is to permit Post Office
Counters to extend its services to include other money collection and
financial services. The national network is ideally suited to do this.
Royal Mail Letters has consistently improved its performance and
profitability while at the same time passing the benefits on to the public.
In January 1977 a first-class letter cost 8 1/2 p compared with 24p at
present - an increase of 282.35 per cent against a rise of 415.94 per cent
in the retail prices index. Furthermore, postage rates have now been frozen
until March 1993. Compare that with gas, electricity, water and telephone
charges over a similar period.
Only supporters of madcap economics would propose the destruction of a
proven and generally well-run public service. It should remain intact and be
encouraged to utilise and develop new technology to provide an even better
service.

Sir, I read with considerable interest Joe Rogaly's article 'Deep mine of
discontent' (October 17), but there is one point which seems particularly
bothersome in the present economic mess we are in, and that is the state of
the government's own finances.
The extent to which the National Debt is doomed to increase, and the ongoing
reliance on a continuing high level of new borrowing by the government,
would seem to raise the spectre in the not-too-distant future of government
being unable to meet its commitments when borrowings mature owing to its
inability to obtain yet further borrowings.
I would be delighted to hear that this is an impossible situation, but is
it? If a government can see nothing wrong in a prime minister and a
chancellor stating assertively that there will be no devaluation, permitting
overseas investment in gilts on the back of that promise, and then allowing
the chancellor to remain in office after devaluation has taken place, it
would seem entirely comprehensible that it might welsh on its debts.
If it did not want to tell overseas investors they could not have their
money back, it would be a simple domestic matter to tell domestic investors
in National Savings products and gilts that the substance of their
investments would not be repaid, pleading force majeure.
Or am I being too fanciful? I hope so for the sake of my remaining years of
retirement. G M Armitage,

<TEXT>
Sir, I was dismayed to read of the prominence given to the views expressed
by Mr Peter Owen, chairman of the Independent Schools Association, in your
report, 'UK schools at bottom of class' (October 28).
I would make no claim to pass judgment on the competitive position of the
education system in Britain as opposed to those of our European neighbours
and I am sure that there are many aspects that could and should be improved
upon. My main experience of the education system has been in working with
schools, assisting them with careers work. Owen's contemptuous estimation of
the work of the waiter reveals much about his own lack of understanding of
the world for which he is supposed to be preparing his pupils. Next time he
visits a restaurant, he may care to reflect upon the craft skills,
organisational ability and social skills required to perform what ought to
be a valued and respected profession.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Letter: University research outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr J BARLOW and Dr S HALFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The recent report by the Royal Society, The Future of the Science Base
(Technically Speaking: 'Time to act on careers in research', October 27),
raises many timely questions about the future of all research in British
universities.
The lack of a sustainable career structure coupled with the constant search
for new funding and the effects of this on researchers' productivity are all
features of the social sciences as well as the natural sciences.
Like the natural sciences, the current system promotes high turnover. This
severely impedes the development of long-term research programmes as highly
experienced researchers leave full-time research in higher education and the
cumulative knowledge from past research is lost.
While these points are obviously critical to individual researchers
attempting to build careers, the current problems also have significant
implications for the financial well-being of educational institutions. Under
new funding arrangements, university income is increasingly tied to research
standing.
There is clearly an urgent need for a radical overhaul of the position of
contract research in higher education. It is imperative that the
universities and the major funding bodies embark on a joint investigation
into the future of research in the natural sciences, social sciences and the
humanities.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Letter: Only a market-led regime will lead to lowest cost
electricity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER ROST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, If the generators wish to slash the amount of coal they burn, that
should be their decision. But they should be prepared to face the
consequences in a genuine, not a rigged, market. The economic case for
closing coal-fired power stations should be tested. Power stations which the
duopoly (National Power and PowerGen) wants to scrap should be offered to
other operators who wish to prove they can under-price the new gas-fired
plant.
A market-led regime would ensure that only the lowest cost electricity is
sold. It is the regulator's responsibility to establish such a competitive
market. If gas-fired electricity is cheaper, then more pits may indeed have
to close. But it is more likely that it would be some of the new gas-fired
power that would be left unsold.
The government claims it wants a competitive energy policy. In that case the
coal capacity which it is claimed cannot be sold should also be subjected to
the market test. Other willing operators should be encouraged to take over
the pits which British Coal claims are not viable, but which others believe
can be operated at lower cost. Why are they being prevented from putting
their money where their mouths are?
Then we would preserve a fairer market for coal, saving pits and jobs. The
economy would benefit from lower cost coal and our hard-pressed industry
would see lower priced electricity. Proper market forces would slow down the
dash for gas, so easing the upward pressure on its price to the additional
advantage of energy-intensive users.

FT  31 OCT 92 / International Company News: GM agrees terms to end Daewoo
link-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors, the US vehicle maker, and the Daewoo group of South Korea,
have reached final agreement on the terms for GM's withdrawal from Daewoo
Motors, the two groups' troubled Korean car manufacturing joint venture.
Daewoo said yesterday it had received approval from the South Korean
government for its takeover of GM's 50 per cent stake. Three Daewoo units
will acquire the GM holding for Dollars 170m with payment spread over three
years. Daewoo Electronics will acquire 55 per cent of the GM stake with
Daewoo Telecom purchasing 22.8 per cent and Daewoo Heavy Industries 22.2 per
cent. Daewoo said the three units would pay 40 per cent of the purchase
price this month with payments of 30 per cent in each of the next two years.
Relations between the Daewoo Group and GM have been strained for several
years. Plans for GM to withdraw first emerged in the second half of 1991,
after the US carmaker refused a Daewoo request to inject fresh capital into
the venture to expand business and to develop a new model.
Honda, the Japanese vehicle maker, is preparing to provide Daewoo with
technical support to produce a range of executive cars in Korea.
The withdrawal by GM is a setback to its ambitions in the Asia-Pacific
region, where it hoped to develop Daewoo Motors as a low-cost production
base in Asia.

<TEXT>
SHELL OIL, the US arm of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, yesterday reported a
rise in third-quarter earnings from Dollars 28m to Dollars 42m and announced
further reductions in its labour force as part of a significant cost-cutting
programme.
Shell, which previously announced it planned to cut its 31,500 US workforce
by 10 to 15 per cent, mainly through attrition and early retirement
programmes, said that it now expected to reduce it by more than 20 per cent
by early next year.
However, a spokesman said most of the increment would come from workers who
left the company through the sale of businesses, including its credit card
processing operations and the planned sale of its coal mining business to
Ziegler Coal Holding.
Excluding special items, its quarterly operating results rose Dollars 102m,
which the company said reflected its extensive cost reduction programme.
However it was now taking additional cost reduction steps because of the
difficult industry environment, and aimed to realise by year-end some
two-thirds of its Dollars 800m cost-cutting target, originally scheduled for
completion at the end of 1994.

<TEXT>
THE RECOVERY of the shipbuilding market supported earnings at Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, the machinery makers, which
have suffered from a decline in orders from the domestic manufacturing and
construction industries.
Mitsubishi Heavy reported an 8.4 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y62bn
(Dollars 503m) for the first half to the end of September on a 9.1 per cent
increase in sales at Y1,111.6bn, a record for the company.
Shipbuilding had been a burden for Japan's heavy industrial companies until
two years ago, but strong demand and reduced competition has left them with
full order books and the prospect of a steady increase in ship prices in
coming years.
Mitsubishi reported that sales at its shipbuilding and steel structures
division rose 8.4 per cent, while machinery sales were 7 per cent higher,
power systems up 22.6 per cent, and aircraft and special vehicle sales were
down 1.2 per cent.
For the full year, Mitsubishi Heavy forecasts a 3.5 per cent fall in pre-tax
profit to Y150bn on sales almost unchanged at Y2,500bn.
Kawasaki Heavy Industries reported a 10 per cent fall to Y4.87bn in pre-tax
profit for the first half, and a delay in the delivery of six ships was
partly the cause of a 7.7 per cent fall in sales to Y359.9bn. After-tax
profit was 17 per cent higher at Y4.17bn.
Both Kawasaki and Mitsubishi said the recent appreciation of the yen had put
the companies' export divisions under increased pressure, and Kawasaki
reported a foreign exchange loss of Y3.6bn for the first half.
For the year to March, Kawasaki expects a 2 per cent increase in sales to
Y950bn and a 9.8 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Y22.5bn.

AETNA LIFE &amp; Casualty, one of the largest US composite insurers, yesterday
reported third-quarter net income of Dollars 239m, up from Dollars 115m in
the same period of last year, despite higher catastrophe losses from
Hurricane Andrew.
The income figures, which worked through at Dollars 2.17 a share, compared
with Dollars 1.06 a share in the same period of last year, included the
earnings of American Re-Insurance which Aetna sold for Dollars 1.4bn to the
leveraged buy-out firm of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts, at the end of
September.
Stripping out the Dollars 34m of income from American Re and Dollars 78m of
profits from its sale, Aetna made Dollars 127m, or Dollars 1.15 a share,
from continuing operations, compared with Dollars 72m, or 67 cents a share,
a year ago. The results included Dollars 58m, or 52 cents of net realised
capital gains, compared with losses of Dollars 45m, or 40 cents a share, a
year ago.
This quarter's gains included losses from additional property reserves of
Dollars 52m, down from Dollars 72m a year ago.
The group's commercial property and casualty insurance services earned just
Dollars 4m, down from Dollars 32, as catastrophe losses rose to Dollars 29m,
up from Dollars 6m, mainly because of Hurricane Andrew, which devastated
Florida during the summer.
For the nine months Aetna reported total net income of Dollars 426m, up from
Dollars 412m.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAISHOWA PAPER, Japan's second largest paper manufacturer which is facing
large debts due to over-expansion, recorded a deepening in its interim
pre-tax loss due to sluggish demand and a sharp fall in gains on securities
sales.
The company said pre-tax losses for the first six months to September
increased to Y10bn (Dollars 81m) from Y3.7bn in the same period last year.
Daishowa's sales fell 12.8 per cent to Y157.8bn, due to the slack paper
market. The company will skip its dividend payment for the first time since
it listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1961.
After-tax losses totalled Y11bn, compared with a profit of Y287m. Daishowa
blamed its failure to sell its holdings of forest land and other assets
because of the current real estate slump.
As of September, Daishowa's debts stood at Y465bn, up from Y200bn in March.
The company plans to repay Y42.5bn by selling land and stock holdings, and
from the proceeds of its share allotment to Mr Ryoei Saito, honorary
chairman.
For the whole year, Daishowa expects to post a pre-tax loss of Y14.6bn on a
0.3 per cent fall in sales to Y348bn.
Honshu Paper, another leading paper company, said pre-tax profits fell 19.9
per cent to Y2.6bn on a 5.3 per cent decline in sales to Y197.1bn. After-tax
profits, however, increased 8.4 per cent to Y1.8bn due to profits from asset
sales.
For the full year to March, Honshu expects the slump in the paper market to
continue, and projects an 11 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y5.6bn on a
3.8 per cent fall in sales to Y397bn.

<TEXT>
FANUC, the leading Japanese equipment maker for machine tools, saw
non-consolidated profits for the six months to September tumble, due to a
sharp fall in corporate capital spending.
The company's pre-tax profits for the first half fell 47.8 per cent to
Y16.2bn (Dollars 131m) on a 26.5 per cent decline in sales to Y62.2bn.
After-tax profits fell 46.3 per cent to Y9.27bn, compared with Y17.27bn in
the same period of the previous year.
At the operating level, profits fell to Y11.02bn compared with Y23.09bn the
previous year.
Sales of Fanuc's numerically controlled systems fell 31.4 per cent to
Y25.7bn due to sluggish orders from machine tool makers, while the fall in
demand from automotive manufacturers resulted in a 7 per cent fall in robot
sales to Y10.7bn.
Overall orders for the first six months declined 27.4 per cent to Y61.1bn.
For the full year, Fanuc expects a continuing fall in demand to push pre-tax
profits down 40.9 per cent to Y30.8bn on a 20.2 per cent decline in sales to
Y124.2bn.
After-tax profits are projected to fall 42.3 per cent to Y17.3bn.
The company will spend Y8.7bn on plant and equipment for the current year as
originally planned. It has agreed to an unchanged dividend of Y9 per share.

<TEXT>
VICTOR COMPANY of Japan (JVC), the consumer electronics company specialising
in audio and video equipment, yesterday reported a Y13.5bn (Dollars 109m)
parent company pre-tax loss in the half year to September and suspended its
interim dividend pay-ment.
JVC, which holds rights to the industry standard VHS video format, has been
especially hard hit because of its excessive dependence on video equipment,
which last year accounted for nearly half of all sales.
This year, sales of video equipment have been hurt by the weakness of
consumer spending as well as a natural slowdown in sales as the market
matures. JVC, however, has failed to respond to the changing market by
diversifying product lines.
JVC's total sales fell by 20 per cent to Y273.5bn, while receipts from video
equipment alone were down by 31 per cent to Y105.4bn.
While JVC has more or less kept pace with its competitors in the domestic
market, it has been badly mauled overseas. Export sales were down by 30 per
cent to Y132.8bn, mainly because of poor sales in Europe.
Only part of the decline can be explained by currency fluctuations.
JVC is not expecting improvement in the second half of the year. The company
believes it will lose Y21bn pre-tax, and expects to pay no dividend.
On a consolidated basis, the pre-tax profits forecast has been lowered from
Y3bn to a loss of Y28bn.
The parent company net loss for the interim period came to Y15.9bn.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Specialist bodies set to dispense lottery profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROCEEDS from the planned national lottery are likely to be dispensed by a
number of specialist bodies, the government said yesterday.
The lottery, which is planned to be running by 1994, will raise money to
benefit the arts, sport, heritage and charities, and create a fund to
celebrate the millennium.
Mr Robert Key, national heritage minister, said consultations and a study of
top lotteries suggested that it would not be sensible for a single body to
regulate the lottery and distribute the profits.
Mr Key disclosed to the Charities Aid Foundation annual conference in London
some of the details of how Britain's national lottery, which he said would
have a top prize of Pounds 1m, will work.
The government plans to introduce its Lottery Bill by the year-end, with the
award of a contract to a private company to run it next year.
Mr David Mellor, the former national heritage secretary, hoped the lottery
would raise up to Pounds 1bn a year.
Mr Key said distribution of money would require efficiency and speed,
accessibility to large and small organisations, and experience so that
decisions could be made. 'We need to distribute the riches of Croesus with
the wisdom of Solomon,' he said. 'To me that suggests some degree of
specialisation is necessary.'
Although the government is clearly leaning towards giving specialist bodies
the responsibility for distributing money, no decisions have yet been taken
about the basis on which funds will be allocated. Lottery proceeds will be
taxed, but probably at less than the 37.5 per cent paid by football pools.
Mr Key said the government was considering clarifying laws for small
lotteries 'to make charitable lotteries potentially more attractive', and
raising the limits on prizes for small lotteries.
The national heritage minister also questioned the view that the national
lottery could hit charities' income. Research for national heritage
suggested that the lottery would compete with newspapers and sweets rather
than charities.

FOUR British airlines have complained to the European Commission's
competition authorities about British Airways' plans to rescue Dan-Air, the
troubled Gatwick-based UK carrier, Andrew Hill in Brussels writes.
Brussels announced yesterday that the deal - in which BA would take over
Dan-Air for a nominal Pounds 1 and assume its liabilities - did not fall
under EC merger control rules because Dan-Air's turnover in the community
was less than Ecu250m (Pounds 204m).
The UK airlines - Virgin, British Midland, Air UK, and Britannia - have
lodged their complaint under separate EC treaty rules aimed at preventing
distortion of competition or abuse of a company's dominant position.
The EC decision means that UK competition authorities might investigate the
deal.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Schools bill will widen central state powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADICAL proposals to extend the government's powers over the education
system and wind down local education authorities in England and Wales were
published yesterday.
The Education Bill, which implements reform plans set out in a white paper
in the summer, proposes to give Mr John Patten, education secretary,
wide-ranging powers to close schools with surplus places and send management
teams into failing schools.
It also proposes a funding council, appointed by Mr Patten, for
grant-maintained schools - schools that have opted out of local-authority
control.
The bill gives to Mr Patten and the funding council powers over
grant-maintained schools as extensive as those at present possessed by local
education authorities, including the powers to close and reorganise schools.
More than 45 new powers would be conferred on the education secretary by the
proposed legislation. Even the power to reorganise schools would be subject
to his absolute discretion once a public local inquiry has been held.
That will disappoint many grant-maintained schools, particularly schools
with falling rolls that opted out - or are considering doing so - in order
to evadeaction being taken against them by their local authorities.
The bill, which will be debated by MPs within 10 days, is intended to boost
the number of grant-maintained schools from the current 313. It would make
it easier than at present for schools to opt out.
Mr Patten said his plans would 'expand choice, diversity and specialisation'
in the education system. 'All schools will be encouraged to specialise in
their particular curricular strengths, if they wish.'
The most novel feature of the bill is the plan for education associations to
take over the management of failing schools where the governing body and
local authority have shown themselves 'unable or unwilling' to bring about
improvements identified by the Schools Inspectorate.
It would also set up a School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, to
replace the School Examinations and Assessment Council and the National
Curriculum Council; and an independent tribunal to hear parental appeals
against the treatment of pupils with special needs.

AS MANY AS 35 Tories were insisting yesterday that they were still likely to
defy the government in next week's vote to decide whether the bill
implementing the Maastricht treaty should return to the Commons for further
consideration.
But it was unclear how many of those rebels would go as far as to vote
against the government and how many would merely abstain.
That followed the publication of a meticulously crafted 140-word government
motion, which was substantive as promised, but did not touch on the matter
of timing or even mention the dreaded 'M' word.
Reaction to the motion suggested that the rebel camp was likely to fall
short of the number needed to defeat the government, but indicated that
prime minister John Major was not yet home and dry.
The final picture is expected to become clear only on Tuesday - one day
after publication of the Labour amendment - when Tory Euro-sceptics are
scheduled to meet in a bid to agree a common approach.
There was speculation in Westminster that the gathering might result in a
mass decision to abstain rather than exercise the ultimate sanction by
voting against the government.
Yesterday's tone was set by comments from Mr Bill Cash, MP for Stafford, and
Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the rightwing 92 group.
Both of those arch-Euro-sceptics did not say they would definitely oppose
the government, but indicated that they thought the non-confrontational
phrasing of the motion represented a victory of sorts for the rebel cause.
Sir George said: 'This motion is so general one wonders why it was necessary
to table a substantive motion at all.'
A number of Tories, including Mr John Carlisle, MP for Luton North; Mr
Michael Carttiss, Great Yarmouth; and Ms Teresa Gorman, Billericay, remained
determined to vote against the motion.
All of those were among the 22 Tories who in May opposed giving the
Maastricht bill a second reading.
Mr Carttiss said: 'I have to vote against that motion even though there is
much in it with which I can concur.'
Others not among the 22 who were still inclined to vote against the
government next week included: Mr Bill Walker, MP for Tayside North; Mr
Peter Griffiths, Portsmouth North; Mr John Wilkinson, Ruislip-Northwood; Mr
Barry Legg, Milton Keynes South West, and Mr Peter Fry, Wellingborough.
In a potentially crucial move Mr Rupert Allason, MP for Torbay, who opposed
the second reading in May, said he would almost certainly be supporting the
government.
He said: 'I cannot imagine there is anybody who can oppose it.' However, he
emphasised: 'My views on Maastricht have not changed one iota.'
Some of the 22 original rebels indicated that they might abstain. Mr
Nicholas Winterton, MP for Macclesfield, said: 'I shall in no circumstances
support it. I think this is just a cosmetic exercise.'
Mr Warren Hawksley, MP for Halesowen and Stourbridge, said he 'certainly
won't be voting for' the motion. 'As I feel at the moment, I will be voting
against.'
Mr Hawksley was one of a group of MPs who had expected to be on the island
of St Helena on a parliamentary visit for next Wednesday's vote: 'The whips
have cancelled that; they may regret it.'
Mr Robert Jones, MP for Hertfordshire West and another potential rebel, said
he was 'unlikely to support the government' unless he was persuaded that
'what will come out of Edinburgh is a legally binding agreement on
subsidiarity.'
Mr Vivian Bendall, MP for Ilford North, said he would 'consult with' his
constituency association.
Among those who were considering not supporting the government, but who
appeared to have been brought back onside were Mr Andrew Hargreaves, MP for
Birmingham Hall Green; Mr Michael Fabricant, Mid Staffordshire, and Mr
Geoffrey Dickens, Littleborough &amp; Saddleworth.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Failure to ratify will put jobs at risk, Scots told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN LANG, Scottish secretary, warned yesterday that tens of thousands of
jobs north of the border would disappear if Britain failed to ratify the
Maastricht treaty.
The warning followed one by Sir Leon Brittan, Britain's senior EC
Commissioner, that Britain would become a less attractive place for new
investment by countries outside the EC if it was seen to be a reluctant
member of the EC.
Mr Lang told a gathering of leading Scots at Gleneagles, Tayside, that if
Britain failed to ratify Maastricht it would 'undermine the confidence in us
of those partners with whom we do so much business. That would damage our
reputation beyond repair'.
Mr Lang said failure to ratify the treaty would hurt the export-led Scottish
economy particularly badly and 'cost tens of thousands of Scottish jobs'.
Both men were addressing the international forum of the Scottish Council
Development and Industry, an annual conference of 200 of the most prominent
people in Scotland. A substantial majority of those present appeared to be
in favour of Maastricht.
In an impassioned after-dinner speech on Thursday, Sir Leon urged Britain to
ratify the treaty. Companies from the US and Japan that had set up
manufacturing plants in Britain to exploit the single European market were
asking whether Britain was going to be part of the new Community or was
going to be 'cast adrift' in second-class membership.
That is a significant worry for Scotland, where about 25 per cent of
manufacturing employment is in foreign-owned factories.
Britain needed to ratify Maastricht to ensure that the rules of the single
market were applied fully, Sir Leon said. That would not happen if Europe
was thrown into turmoil because of Britain's failure to ratify the treaty.

FT  31 OCT 92 / City finds Lamont speech 'lame'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMISTS in the City showed little enthusiasm yesterday for what the
chancellor had said in his keenly awaited Mansion House speech.
Mr Norman Lamont promised a new commitment to growth, lower interest rates,
and no risks to inflation in the long term.
'Rather lame' seemed to be the London financial community's general view of
a speech traditionally used to outline the government's monetary policy.
Indeed, by yesterday morning few analysts felt much wiser about the
government's intentions.
'The speech had more hands than a Hindu goddess,' said Mr Gerry Holtham,
chief economist at Lehman Brothers, the securities house. 'On the one hand
he is going for growth, on the other hand he will control inflation; on the
one hand he wants rates lower, on the other hand he will not ignore the
sterling exchange rate. It was pretty Delphic stuff.'
Yesterday, Mr Lamont said he had not intended to set out the government's
strategy.
The chancellor also made clear that he was ready to raise interest rates to
defend the pound or if inflation threatened to breach the 1 per cent to 4
per cent target range he announced at this month's Tory party conference.
The City's unexcited to the speech response was reflected in the markets.
The pound continued to drift downwards to close in London a pfennig lower at
DM2.41. Share prices were lifted a little on hopes of an early interest rate
cut. The FT-SE 100 share index closed 16 up at 2,658.3.
A particular grievance among economists was that Mr Lamont did not deliver a
coherent monetary strategy.
'It just leaves us with the same old flabby policy,' said Mr Peter Spencer,
chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, the securities house, 'which means: cut
interest rates now, get the economy going, then head off any inflation by
putting interest rates up.
'We are left feeling very uncertain about whether or not a future chancellor
would be prepared to raise rates if necessary.'
His thoughts were echoed by Professor Tim Congdon, head of Lombard Street
Research, an economics consultancy, who described Mr Lamont's speech as 'a
dud'.
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, was more charitable,
if only because the speech was a departure from its usual form. 'It was
quite an interesting Mansion House speech because it wasn't about monetary
policy. It was about getting the economy moving.'
The announcement that the Bank of England will make a regular report on
inflation was greeted sceptically. 'The Bank has published quarterly
bulletins for years but you have to read them very, very closely to find any
criticism of the government,' Mr Saunders said.
Or, as Mr Stephen Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell, the investment
bank, said: 'Published minutes on the government's reasoning behind monetary
policy changes could make very interesting reading. But if they want to make
them meaningless, they will make them meaningless.'

FT  31 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Facing the realities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING and Euromark futures again fell sharply yesterday, reflecting the
growing belief that official policy will be eased on the continent more
slowly than expected, writes James Blitz.
In European cash and futures markets, the dominant sentiment is that central
banks will ease credit policy before the end of the year. The UK government
has put increasing emphasis on the need for growth, the Bundesbank is faced
with the reality of German economic stagnation, and the Bank of France,
which cut one of its key repo rates this week by 1.5 percentage points, is
confident that the intense speculative selling of the franc on the foreign
exchanges is over.
But when will the next round of rate easing come?
Throughout this week, markets have started to think that the easing will
occur later than had been expected, firming rates.
Yesterday, German 3-month money was trading at 8.85 per cent, 10 basis
points above the rate of the Bundesbank's most recent injections. The
December short sterling contract fell another 26 basis points from its
opening level, to close at 93.34.
And, although 3-month French francs are nearly 200 basis point lower than
they were a month ago, they are, at 9 3/4 per cent, still 90 basis points
above the 3 month D-Mark cash rate. 'There is still room for a move
downwards in French rates,' said one London-based commercial bank dealer
yesterday.
However, recent policy signals from the Bundesbank have injected a strong
note of caution. Officials in the German central bank reiterated this week
that inflationary pressures in the German economy remained high. And the
continuing debate in the German government over whether to meet the growing
fiscal deficit through tax hikes or a cut in lending to eastern Germany may
make the Bundesbank's final decisions on rates more drawn-out.
A UK fund manager said yesterday that if German rates are not lowered again
soon, the recession will force the Bundesbank to reduce them in the New Year
at speed. 'That will not be good for the stability of the D-Mark or the
European exchange rate mechanism,' he said.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound dips on policy speech
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING lost more than two-and-a-half pfennigs against the D-Mark in Asian
trading on Thursday night, as the markets took a dismissive view of the
chancellor's keynote speech to the Mansion House, writes James Blitz.
On the eve of Mr Lamont's speech, Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency
research at UBS Phillips and Drew, said that the chancellor would need to
describe the broad and detailed framework within which macro-economic policy
was being formed if the pound was to be boosted. It would not be enough, he
said, to list the broad range of indicators to be used in the making of
policy.
In the aftermath of the speech, many dealers clearly took the view that the
policy detail was missing. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, vice president of Bank of
America, said that sterling investors were worried by the strong emphasis on
growth as the guiding principle of policy with little mention of inflation.
And there was a strong feeling on Thursday night that cuts in UK interest
rates would be announced as Friday trading opened in London. The pound
therefore broke an important barrier of DM2.40 in Asia, slipping to DM2.3952
against the D-Mark and to Dollars 1.5575.
However, the Bank of England did not cut interest rates when London opened,
and the pound recovered some of its lost ground, peaking at DM2.4127. It
later closed in London at DM2.41, down 1 pfennig on the day.
The market's focus for the next few trading days will be firmly fixed on the
US Presidential election. With the approach of polling day, the market has
become increasingly unwilling to take a bet on the result.
In part, that has been because of the narrowing of Mr Clinton's lead. A
CNN/USA Today poll yesterday put him neck-and-neck with President Bush.
According to Mr Hawkins, a Clinton victory will probably be followed by a
short-term rise in the dollar. The incoming President's commitment to
increased fiscal spending would make another ease in US interest rates
unlikely.
If Mr Bush wins, however, there could be a fall in the dollar/D-Mark rate.
The dollar has been supported by republican victories in the past, but, in
recent weeks, dealers have talked themselves into thinking that a Clinton
victory would be good for the currency. 'If it doesn't happen there will be
some unwinding of positions,' says Mr Hawkins. A Bush victory would also
give dealers more time to focus on the plight of the US economy.
Until the election, the dollar will probably trade quietly against the
D-Mark. Yesterday, it closed at DM1.5420 from a previous DM1.5410.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Embattled Yeltsin braves anger over Baltic troops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, yesterday refused to rule out
direct presidential rule to control the steadily rising political tension.
Meanwhile Baltic leaders bitterly attacked his decision on Thursday to halt
withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltics, charging that his decree was
a sign of 'political instability' in Russia.
A spokesman for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in Brussels said that
the decree was a 'matter for concern' and urged 'no further delay' in the
pullout of the troops.
The troop levels in the Baltics stood at 130,000 earlier this year, but some
tens of thousands have been withdrawn.
Mr Vitaly Churkin, a Russian deputy foreign minister, said that social and
economic issues had to be sorted out before the rest of the troops left.
Mr Yeltsin's decree said that the human rights issues were a matter of
concern for the Russian government: most ethnic Russians were debarred from
voting in the recent Estonian elections because of language and citizenship
laws, while neighbouring Latvia also has high linguistic and residential
requirements,
More weighty, however, has been the flat refusal of the Baltic-based
officers, strongly backed by the top echelons of the army, to leave their
billets for homelessness in Russia. President Yeltsin, increasingly
embattled, depends upon the support of his generals - a support which has
pointedly been made overt in the past week.
Mr Andrejs Krestins, deputy president of Latvia, said that 'you have to be
aware that this unstable Russian position puts in danger not only the
Baltics but also the whole of Europe, especially when national radicals with
imperial ideas are fighting for power inside Russia'.
Mr Yeltsin, on a tour of the southern city of Astrakhan, said in answer to
reporters' questions that presidential rule, which some advisers have urged
upon him, would 'violate the constitution' but added, ambiguously, that 'I
took my oath to the people first and the rest came later'.
He promised price stabilisation in December or January, the latest of a
series of promises of better economic times, none of which have been
fulfilled.
He said that the Front for National Salvation, which he banned earlier this
week, was a 'very dangerous organisation' - an estimation backed by Mr Yegor
Gaidar, the acting prime minister, who said that the threat to democracy
from the left and right extremes was very grave.

LESS THAN a week after crushing an attempted coup by rebels loyal to the
former communist leader, the Tajik government has conceded that it needs the
security of Russian military support and has asked Moscow for additional
troops to protect the capital.
If the request is granted, Tajikistan would be the first of the Soviet
Union's 15 former republics to return such a big security role to Moscow.
Tajik Prime Minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov said he would fly to Moscow
shortly to argue for troops to reinforce Russia's 201st motorised rifle
division, which is stationed in the central Asian nation.
The request had already been made orally, Mr Abdullajanov said.
The troops would reinforce Russian soldiers already blocking roads leading
into the capital, and securing the airport and railroad, television and
radio stations.

RECORD exports offset the impact of a big rise in Australia's monthly
current account deficit yesterday, helping the weak Australian dollar to
resist further falls.
The government said the seasonally adjusted deficit jumped to ADollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 658m) in September from a revised ADollars 936m in August, adding to
concerns that the 1992-93 deficit will exceed the budget forecast of
ADollars 15bn. The announcement caused a short-lived sell-off of the
Australian dollar, which dropped to a five-year low of 69.17 US cents in
morning trading in Sydney, following a fall from 72 to just under 70 cents
earlier in the week.
However, the currency recovered to close at 69.58 cents after the foreign
exchange market digested the detailed figures, which suggested the
deterioration was not as bad as was first feared.
Most of it was caused by an increase of 20 per cent in merchandise imports.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Miyazawa urges political clean-up: Japan is slipping deeper
into political and economic crisis - The Politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER and ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government has become gridlocked in the wake of the Tokyo
Sagawa Kyubin scandal while the economy is facing a severe slump, Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, the prime minister, warned the Japanese parliament yesterday.
Mr Miyazawa told an extraordinary session of the Diet there was an urgent
need to restore public trust in politics, which had fallen to an all time
low. A newspaper poll this week showed the cabinet's approval rating fell by
10 points over the last month to a low of 23 per cent.
The slump is mainly a reflection of the scandal which has provoked a vicious
power struggle at the top of the ruling Liberal Democratic party. This
follows the resignation of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the party's powerbroker who
admitted receiving an illegal donation of Y500m from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, a
trucking company with links to organised crime syndicates.
The Diet session, which has been convened for 40 days, will start by
focusing on the scandal towards the end of next week. Opposition parties are
demanding that Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister and titular
head of the LDP's largest faction, should testify over his role in the
affair. Mr Takeshita's testimony could further destabilise the party
leadership.
Mr Miyazawa issued a ringing denunciation of the current political system:
'I am unalterably resolved to work for far-reaching political reform to
eliminate the root causes that have bred today's distrust of politics,
including ensuring greater transparency of political funding and
facilitating elections contested over policy issues and political activity
that does not require vast sums of money.'
However, the reform plan which the government has agreed with the main
opposition parties falls well short of demands made by leading reformers.
The plan would reapportion several Diet seats from rural to urban areas,
strengthen the political ethics council, force Diet members to make a fuller
disclosure of their assets and allow illegal contributions to be
confiscated.
Mr Miyazawa called on the LDP and the opposition to continue talks on the
more far-reaching reforms to the electoral system and political funding
which would he said would be needed to meet public criticism.
Mr Miyazawa responded to the uncertainty created by next week's US
presidential election by stressing that relations with the US would remain
the cornerstone of Japanese foreign policy.
However, he said Japan would increasingly develop Asian foreign policy
initiatives which would lead Japan into a political role in resolving
disputes in the region as well as providing financial assistance.
Japan would not waver from its Russian policy that bilateral financial aid
would be increased only once the dispute over the Kurile Islands was settled
and a peace treaty was signed.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIA is cutting public spending in an effort to control inflation and
bring down a current account deficit projected to reach MDollars 7.9bn
(Pounds 1.93bn) this year.
Mr Anwar Ibrahim, finance minister, presenting the 1993 budget, said that
despite achieving growth of more than 8 per cent in each of the last five
years, the country could not afford continuously to increase annual
expenditures. The size of the public service would be reduced and emphasis
placed on tighter financial management.
The budget raised the level of compulsory savings contributions for both
employers and employees, extended the scope of an existing 5 per cent
services tax to include telecommunications and other services and signalled
the introduction soon of a sales and service tax of up to 10 per cent.
Mr Anwar made concessions in the form of lowering the corporate tax rate
from 35 per cent to 34 per cent and reducing income tax levels by between
one and two per cent.
Analysts said Mr Anwar had not been tough enough in curtailing both public
and private spending and warned of continuing inflation problems. They also
felt the full effects of the slowdown in Malaysia's main export markets had
not been fully taken into consideration in the budget.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Banks unveil plan to prop up ailing loans: The Banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE banks yesterday unveiled plans for a loan and land purchase company
intended to clean up a banking system troubled by non-performing loans and
stimulate the property market, the collapse of which has created the
problem.
The size of the bad loan burden was highlighted by a ministry of finance
announcement that the non-performing loans of the leading 21 Japanese banks
rose by 54 per cent to Y12,300bn (Pounds 62bn) in the six months to the end
of September. The ministry also said valuation losses on bank's stock
portfolios had more than doubled over the past year.
Eleven leading Japanese banks last night revised down their first-half
earnings forecasts by between 27 and 60 per cent, blaming the decline on
appraisal losses on their securities holdings and on increases in their
reserves for bad loans.
Fuji Bank said that its pre-tax profits would be Y29bn, about 55 per cent
lower than forecast, while the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan revised down
its estimate by 56.6 per cent to Y23bn, and the Industrial Bank of Japan cut
its forecast by 49 per cent to Y35.5bn.
Finance ministry officials said the fall in stock and property prices had
eroded the asset base of leading banks, putting them under increasing
pressure to write off non-performing loans, a process which will be
quickened by the industry-funded body.
The Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan, conscious of public
criticism of proposed government assistance to banks, said the new company,
expected to be established before the end of the year, will be entirely
self-funded.
The company will have an initial capital of Y6bn, shared among participating
banks, which will also provide low-interest funds for the purchase of their
own non-performing loans at a discount to face value - that discount, in
principle, will be based on an independent valuation of the loan's property
collateral.
With the non-performing loans transferred to the new company, banks will be
able to write off some of their losses in the current financial year, while
the company will then become responsible for finding purchasers for the prop
erty.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance minister, said the establishment of the company is
'very timely', and he was confident that the valuation of the property, to
be done by a panel of accountants and valuers, would stimulate the ailing
property market.
However, the banks are offloading the loans because they cannot find
purchasers for the property and it is not clear that the new company will be
able to find buyers. If that is the case, the bank which originally
transferred the loan would be required to buy the rights to the property
back at a much later date.
The establishment of the new body enables the banks to spread the losses
associated with the non-performing loans. It is expected that the valuation
panel will assess the collateral at higher than market prices, creating a
small write-off this year, and that the afflicted bank will take a second
hit in a few years' time, when its asset base has strengthened.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Consumer demand likely to weaken even further: The Economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S consumer spending, already weak, may fall further according to
government figures published yesterday which show the labour market's health
is deteriorating.
Employers' demand for labour is falling fast with job offers barely matching
the number of applicants.
The ratio of job offers to job seekers fell to 1.01 in September, which
means that for every 100 people looking for a job there were 101 vacancies.
Officials expect the index, which peaked at 1.47 in March last year, could
fall to as low as 0.90 as the economic downturn takes its toll on
employment.
The gathering slowdown in the job market is likely to depress personal
income and consumption over the next year, putting additional pressure on
the government to consider an income tax cut in the 1993 budget.
Overtime working at companies which employ more than 30 people fell by 16.5
per cent to 11.7 hours in September, the largest fall since June 1975 when
the economy was in the midst of a recession provoked by the rise in world
oil prices.
Overtime pay fell by 11.6 per cent and bonuses awarded between June and
August rose by only 2.2 per cent. Bonuses account for more than a quarter of
the average pay packet.
The government was cheered by a 10.4 per cent rise in housing starts in
September to 123,224 units. This second monthly increase, after a 12 per
cent rise in September, reflects the efforts of the public sector Housing
Loan Corporation to revive the market.
However the property market remains depressed, particularly in urban areas,
with starts on condominium blocks down 26.3 per cent.
Orders placed with the top 50 construction companies fell by 15.6 per cent
to Y11,493bn in the six months to September, the worst fall since 1975.
The government will be encouraged by signs that inflation is falling, adding
weight to calls for further interest rate cuts. Consumer prices in Tokyo
rose at an annual rate of only 1.1 per cent last month, down from 2.2 per
cent in September.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Tokyo turns to public works to lift economy: The Budget
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S so-called hidden budget, the Y40,000bn (Pounds 202bn) a year Fiscal
Investment and Loan Programme funded by post office savings, will be the
main stimulant for the flagging economy, according to a supplementary budget
approved by the cabinet yesterday.
Spending by the FILP, which is largely under the control of the Ministry of
Finance and does not have to be vetted in detail by the Diet (parliament),
will rise by 10.8 per cent to Y45,199bn.
In contrast public spending will fall marginally from original plans
reflecting a sharp drop in tax revenues.
The supplementary budget, which is to be debated by the Diet, was drawn up
to implement the Y10,700bn emergency economic package announced by the
government in August.
Apart from the FILP the other main stimulus will come from higher spending
by Japan's 3,300 local councils, which are expected to increase their
spending by between Y3,000bn and Y5,000bn.
The supplementary budget will cut planned public expenditure by Y728bn to
Y71,489bn, in a signal from the finance ministry that despite the economy's
weakness it will keep a tight rein on official spending and borrowing.
Senior ministry officials said that given the sharp fall in projected tax
revenues the budget would have a marked reflationary effect.
Tax revenues are expected to fall Y4,900bn below the level planned in the
original budget approved in the spring. However the spending is broadly
being maintained. The government plans to cover the revenue shortfall by
borrowing an additional Y2,256 through issuing construction bonds which are
linked to public investment.
It plans to carry over a Y1,531bn surplus from last year's accounts which
normally would be devoted to paying off government debt. The Bank of Japan's
interest rate cuts this year have reduced government interest payments
allowing a Y895bn cut in public spending.
The supplementary budget could mark the start of an important shift in
Japanese policy away from debt reduction towards investment in public works.
It provides for an additional Y1,962bn to be spent on public works, Y88.5bn
to help small and medium sized enterprises and a Y156.9bn subsidy to the
housing and urban development corporation.

FT  31 OCT 92 / French fume over smoking curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE, a country renowned for its smoke-filled bars, Gauloises and
pipe-chewing detectives, will severely restrict smoking in public from
tomorrow.
Smokers will be allowed to light up only in areas expressly set aside for
them - at present, smoking is allowed everywhere except where expressly
forbidden. Individual offenders will face fines of up to FFr1,300 (Pounds
155), rising to FFr6,000 for restaurants or companies that fail to provide
proper ventilation or to set smokers well apart.
Similar measures have been proposed by the Italian cabinet presided over by
Mr Giuliano Amato, an acknowledged smoker, and will be considered by
parliament.
Why is France doing this to itself? Some 40 per cent of the adult population
of France smokes, more than in most European countries, and France even
invented the word nicotine. Jean Nicot, a 16th century diplomat, introduced
tobacco to Catherine de Medicis, French queen at the time, as a cure for
migraine.
A survey to be published in today's Le Parisien newspaper said 71 per cent
of adults polled intended to abide by the law. Some 27 per cent said they
may break it.
Everybody knows the ban is unworkable outside areas such as government
offices, airlines and railways - where the cleaners on the Paris Metro sweep
up three tonnes of cigarette-ends a day.
The restaurant trade is a bastion of resistance. It has asked for a two-year
grace period while its members find the money to install smoke extractors -
indicating a measure of compliance - but few are prepared to insult their
smoking clients.
'If one of my guests calls the police, it's quite simple - I will pay the
fine in the place of the smoker and let him go,' promises Mr Alain
Dutournier, proprietor of the celebrated Carre des Feuillants in central
Paris. 'It is a smokescreen, an idiotic law,' fumes Mr Joel Robuchon, owner
of the Jamin, another top Paris restaurant. 'Some of my clients have said
that if they can no longer smoke cigars, they will no longer come.'
The Patronat employers' organisation says the ban is socially divisive,
because privileged people with private offices - not public places - can
smoke as much as they like, while those who work in open-plan offices will
have to go to a special smokers' area.

FT  31 OCT 92 / MI5 was told exports to Iraq 'were for military purposes'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH intelligence was told in 1987 that equipment exported to Iraq by a
UK machine-tool manufacturer was intended for military use and probably
passed this information to other western security agencies, an intelligence
officer said yesterday.
Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, may also have been given a
contemporaneous report on the situation, an officer of MI5, the UK's
internal security service, indicated to an Old Bailey court yesterday.
The officer, hidden behind a screen, remained anonymous throughout the
proceedings, but is the first member of the intelligence services to have
given evidence in open court rather than in camera as in previous trials.
Called 'witness B', he was visible only to the judge, jury and leading
lawyers. Gaps in the screen through which he would have been seen by others
were hastily covered with brown wrapping paper and tape.
Giving evidence in the trial of three former Matrix Churchill directors, who
are accused of breaching export regulations, the officer explained how he
obtained information about the Iraqi defence procurement programme from Mr
Mark Gutteridge, an employee of the machine tool manufacturer.
The contacts, usually made in Coventry hotels, started at the end of 1986,
with the MI5 officer seeking political, military and economic intelligence,
he told Mr Geoffrey Robertson QC, for Mr Paul Henderson, one of the
defendants.
Individual Iraqis brought to his attention by Mr Gutteridge included Dr Safa
al-Hobobi, a director of the Nassr arms factory in Iraq, Dr Fidel, an Iraqi
intelligence officer, a Mr Anis Wadi and a Mr Hanna Jon.
In October 1987, Mr Gutteridge told him that contracts being worked on by
Matrix Churchill included computer software and cutting gear specifically
designed for the production of shells and projectiles. 'Do you remember
telling Mr Gutteridge that his report would be seen by the prime minister?'
Mr Robertson asked.
'I may well have said that,' the officer replied.
Earlier, the officer had said this kind of information would be passed on to
MI6 and then, presumably, on to other western intelligence agencies.
When Matrix Churchill had its export licence revoked by the Department of
Trade and Industry, Mr Gutteridge had got upset. He had thought this was a
consequence of the information he had given to MI5.
The MI5 officer wrote in his personal notes that - 'with my nose growing
ever larger' - he had persuaded Mr Gutteridge this had not been the case.
Mr Henderson, Mr Trevor Abraham and Mr Peter Allen all deny breaching export
controls by deceiving the DTI into thinking the exports were for civil
rather than military use.
The trial continues on Monday.

FT  31 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Oil prices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's decision by Shell Oil to cut its US workforce by 20 per cent
underlines the tough conditions for oil companies. Overall, Shell is better
placed than most, yet the management of the US subsidiary still felt enough
heat to act before the Anglo-Dutch parent stepped in. With the oil majors
having to pay dividends and finance massive capital expenditure programmes
through the recession, cost control and improved productivity are the
obvious ways to control cash flow.
A weakening crude oil price only makes matters worse. The market seems
bemused by the recent fall below Dollars 20 a barrel, given that there is no
obvious over-supply. In part this may reflect scepticism that November's
Opec meeting will give a positive lead.
Indeed, with tensions between the Gulf producers growing, there is a risk
that Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia will continue to pump near full capacity
into the spring. A sustained fall below Dollars 18 might start to threaten
some capital projects.

FT  31 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: British Airways
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by the market's calm reaction investors are remarkably sanguine
about Bill Clinton's threat to block BA's investment in USAir. Perhaps his
comments really were just end-of-campaign rhetoric which will quickly be
forgotten once the race for the White House is over. But if the British
airline's meticulously laid plans ultimately unravel - and one senses a
growing air of worry at BA - its shares are almost certain to suffer in the
short term.
There is little doubt that rival US carriers such as Delta, United and
American have cleverly exploited the USAir issue. Their specific objections
to the BA deal hardly stand up on close inspection, but they have played the
jobs and level playing field cards for all they are worth. Naturally they do
not stress that BA's support will effectively underpin a competitor which
they would be much happier to see going out of business. The real lever,
though, is the bilateral negotiation between the US and UK governments over
access to the UK market. Talks were suspended yesterday until November 10,
but it remains far from clear that the American side will be satisfied with
the gradualist 'open skies' plan currently on the table.
From BA's point of view, the Dollars 750m which it is splashing out on USAir
may only be justified if it can retain and consolidate its strong profitable
position on the North Atlantic routes. Given the sums involved, moreover, BA
can hardly abandon the condition which effectively gives it a blocking
minority on key issues. Assuming Mr Clinton wins, there is still some tough
dealing ahead. BA shareholders can only hope that the company has squared
the Democrats as effectively as it has lobbied the Republicans.

FT  31 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by Thursday's Mansion House speech, the gradualists are still in
charge at the Treasury. Having been too optimistic about recovery for two
years, policy makers now think that the recent fall in sterling and cuts in
interest rates are enough to give the economy a good kick. Interest rates
will be reduced further, but no chances are to be taken with inflation.
Of course, part of that can be discounted as rhetoric to support sterling on
the foreign exchanges, but the chancellor may once again have too complacent
a view of events. Confidence has been hit badly in the wake of sterling's
departure from the ERM, and businesses are once more vigorously cutting
staff and capital expenditure. Sentiment in the housing market remains very
poor - depressing consumers and encouraging them to save rather than spend.
Allied to this is the heavy debt burden which both groups still carry. All
of this implies caution about the prospects for the UK stock market.
Analysts, who are often over-optimistic about earnings growth, expect
dividends to grow by less than 2 per cent this year, and perhaps 3 to 5 per
cent in 1993. Even these figures are based on the questionable assumption
that the economy will grow by some 1.5 per cent next year. The recent rise
in the market discounts much of the devaluation boost.
Overall dividend figures also hide as much as they reveal. Sectors such as
the utilities and some consumer groups have good cover and can manage real
dividend increases. In some capital goods sectors, though, more dividend
cuts are on the way and cover will remain low until the mid-1990s. While the
chancellor may protect some construction projects, prospects for private
sector construction remain grim. Capital goods shares have been hit badly
this year, but there is little reason to expect much recovery. Despite
devaluation, defensive stocks may still be the best bet.

FT  31 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Going Dutch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reed International will have to work hard to live up to the 20 per cent rise
in its share price since the merger with Elsevier was announced last month.
An interest in the Dutch publisher's recession-resistant earnings from
scientific journals is certainly attractive. But Reed makes no secret of the
fact that there is limited scope for cost-saving. At least a lower tax
charge should recoup within a couple of years the startling rewards earned
by the advisers. Vague promises of synergy hardly justify the rates of
growth which the market now seems to be anticipating.
A stronger credit rating for the merged group may increase the temptation to
embark on a spree of debt-funded expansion. The Official Airlines Guide
looks almost certain to be the first target. Even a bid for OAG, though,
will leave Reed Elsevier with plenty of spare borrowing capacity to swallow
up smaller targets in Europe. On the evidence of yesterday's pro-forma
figures, the combined group could raise up to Pounds 1bn from banks or the
bond market and still maintain comfortable interest cover of four to five
times.
The novel structure of the merger is meant to avoid the pitfalls of
Anglo-Saxon style takeovers and the decision-making vacuum which can result
from continental-style mergers. Nothing, though, can guard against the kind
of boardroom bloodshed which has followed other, initially friendly,
international mergers involving UK companies. One can only hope the two
sides are as agreed on strategy as they claim.

FT  31 OCT 92 / GPA faces borrowing talks after fundraising effort fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA GROUP, the Irish aircraft leasing group which aborted its international
public flotation in June, has been forced to begin negotiations with banks
on its borrowing arrangements after failing to raise new funds from the sale
of 18 aircraft leases.
This latest failure to raise money has caused the unravelling of the
financial strategy that the group put together with its shareholders,
lenders and aircraft suppliers in the aftermath of its shelved Dollars 800m
(Pounds 490m) flotation.
Mr Tony Ryan, GPA's chairman and founder, said: 'We are conducting a matrix
of wide-ranging negotiations with a significant level of interdependence and
this will take time to complete.'
GPA faces heavy financial commitments on aircraft that it has ordered.
Its debt is believed to have risen significantly since it issued its
prospectus for its failed flotation when it had borrowings of Dollars 2.7bn
against shareholders' funds of Dollars 1.2bn.
Its latest fund-raising efforts have been hit by investor fears that it
might breach its banking covenants, and negative comments about the group
published in the US.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US investment rating agency, yesterday lowered its
rating on GPA's commercial paper to A-3 from A-2 and placed the rating on
credit watch with negative implications, suggesting a further downgrade is
possible.
These factors led GPA yesterday to postpone its plans to raise Dollars 752m
this month from its second issue of securitised aircraft leases, known as
ALPS.
This in turn has delayed the group's Dollars 350m convertible preference
share issue which GPA had hoped to complete by the end of the year.
GPA confirmed it was renegotiating its borrowing facilities but declined to
give details.

<TEXT>
FIGHTING erupted yesterday between government forces and former Unita rebels
near Luanda's international airport leaving more than a dozen dead,
including three Portuguese nationals, AP reports from Luanda.
The state news agency, Angop, said rocket-propelled grenades and heavy
machine guns were used in the hour-long clash between Unita soldiers and the
police garrison at the airport. Angop reported at least 13 dead.
Meanwhile heavy civilian and military casualties were reported in the
central city of Huambo, although a senior government army officer later said
fighting had halted in the city and the two sides had opened negotiations
mediated by United Nations monitors.
The latest clashes have intensified fears of a new outbreak of Angola's
16-year civil war that ended with peace accords last year between Unita and
the once-Marxist government.
Tension has mounted since Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader, rejected the
results of the country's first multi-party elections held on September
29-30. As results showed Unita losing to the governing MPLA party, Mr
Savimbi threatened to lead his men back into battle.
'The war in Angola has practically already started,' Mr Aldemiro Conceicao,
government spokesman, told Portugal's TSF radio on Thursday night. 'It's all
on a razor's edge.'
The fighting in Huambo appears to have been the worst since the May 1991
peace accords.
In the voting for parliament, the MPLA won 53.74 per cent to Unita's 34.1
per cent. But President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos fell less than a point short
of the 50 per cent needed for a first-round victory in the presidential
race. Mr Savimbi has refused to say whether he will agree to contest a
second round.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Experts cool on Treasury think tank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL leading monetarist economists responded coolly yesterday to the
prospect of being invited to join a new Treasury committee to feed insights
into the government's forecasting process.
They said they might find it difficult to co-operate with the panel unless
the Treasury changed tack on economic management and emphasised techniques
to monitor the money supply.
Mr Bill Martin, a monetarist who is chief UK economist at UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew, said: 'I would probably not want to join the group, unless it becomes
clear that the panel is a definite effort to rethink policy and avoid the
kind of mistakes made over the past few years.'
Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University's economics department
said he was 'disgusted' with the Treasury's approach to running the economy.
He said the Treasury continued to pay too much importance to the value of
the pound, and should instead have 'embraced monetary targets as a
centrepiece of economic policy'.
Mr Paul Turnbull, another monetarist who is chief UK economist at brokers
Smith New Court, said he would want to find out exactly how the committee
would fit in with policymaking before agreeing to any invitation to join. Mr
Turnbull this week came top in an FT survey measuring economists' growth
projections in the recession.
Invitations to the panel are to be sent out shortly by Mr Alan Budd,
Treasury chief economic adviser. The group is intended to provide innovative
ideas to Treasury economists and thus help improve the accuracy of
government projections on the economy.
The panel of between six and 12 people is due to start up over the next few
months. The Treasury said it wanted people with a spread of opinions on
economics.
People on the committee are likely to be mainly from the City and academic
groups.
The average forecast of private-sector economists is that the economy will
contract by 0.8 per cent this year, according to the latest assessment by
the Treasury of City and academic projections. The consensus is that output
will grow 1.4 per cent next year.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBERTY has always been one of London's most idiosyncratic stores. It has
that inestimable quality that can neither be bought nor artificially applied
 -personality. Liberty has always been a one-off, part of London's folklore.
Speak to many Londoners and you will find that Liberty holds a special place
in their affections. John Lewis may be cheaper and more sensible, Harvey
Nichols swankier, Harrods bigger, but no other store offers that magic
combination which comes from a mock Tudor building, exotic merchandise and
quintessential Englishness. It is London's very own theme park. Like Earl
Grey tea, it may be oriental in origin, but it is today an integral part of
upper-crust life.
The roots of its quirkiness lie in its remarkable history and anybody
interested not only in the store as it is today but its extraordinary role
in the aesthetic life of Britain will be interested in The House of Liberty,
Masters of Style &amp; Decoration (published by Thames and Hudson, edited by
Stephen Calloway, Pounds 28, 224 pages), which is a history of the store and
the role it has played in the aesthetic life of this country.
Founded by Arthur Lasenby Liberty in 1875, it started life as an emporium,
the outlet for Arthur Liberty's many enthusiasms, in particular for oriental
textiles.
Arthur Liberty was passionately interested in the decorative arts, a great
believer in style and craftsmanship and, rather like Sir Terence Conran with
Habitat, determined to share his enthusiasms with the great British public.
In its heyday Liberty's was at the centre of this country's aesthetic life.
At the time of the Arts and Crafts movement Liberty became a major patron,
commissioning and selling on the shop floor pieces by such distinguished
designers as CFA Voysey, Leonard Wyburd and George Walton.
It nailed its cultural colours to the mast with its declaration in favour of
'fitness for purpose and the merits of simplicity in furnishing, not . . .
false taste and false luxury.'
It expanded from importing exotic Eastern textiles to commissioning new
ranges especially for the store and became the store that anyone with any
interest in the visual arts had to visit.
It would only be fair to say that while today Liberty no longer stands at
the cutting edge of modern design it has retained an adept feel for changing
tastes and moods. It also still manages to imbue the commercial realities of
retailing with a sense of excitement.
Every trip to the store is something of an adventure. Where will their
buyers have been this time? Indonesia? Yucatan? The Gold Coast? As one
enters the doors, a sense of excitement rises. What will one find today? It
is a sad comment on the state of retailing today that that alone makes
Liberty outstanding.

FT  31 OCT 92 / How To Spend It: Why Baccarat remains a cut above the rest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY OF those who have collected and loved glass will know the name of
Baccarat. Its wares have been sought after by tsars and princes, kings and
counts, ever since it was first created by royal - French, bien sur - decree
in 1764.
For those who are used to ogling Baccarat's expensive wares in London's
finer emporia, and wondering how and why any single glass could cost quite
so much, a sumptuous volume entitled simply Baccarat reveals all.
Baccarat's history is long and honourable, an industrial adventure that
began in the little village of Baccarat in the Vosges Forest in eastern
France and took its wares to the finest tables in the world.
What this beautifully illustrated volume reveals is the role that
innovation, creativity and design play in the development of any great
company. Just as Arthur Lasenby Liberty forged creative partnerships with
the movers and shakers in the Arts and Crafts Movement, and created pieces
that design students still study to this day, so Baccarat commissioned work
from designers such as Georges Chevalier, Salvador Dali, Robert Rigot and
Thomas Bastide.
Besides encouraging design innovation any great company needs to be alert to
changes in society, in the way we live and here Baccarat shows itself to be
very nimble-footed. As women went out into the workplace and as cosmetics
became increasingly important in their daily lives, so it started working
with the great beauty companies like Elizabeth Arden, for whom it produced a
stunning white opal crystal hand holding a gold and enamelled perfume bottle
with a rose-shaped stopper. For Guerlain, besides the famous 1912 Mitsouko
bottle with its 'gendarme's cap' stopper it made a butter-fly shaped bottle
in gilded cobalt-blue crystal with an emery-finished stopper.
For those who associate Baccarat almost exclusively with a sumptuous,
highly-decorative style, involving cut lead-crystal or ornate engraving this
book makes riveting reading. Some of its designs are indeed sumptuous, way
beyond the tastes of any modern home, but others are remarkable for their
austere simplicity. A look at some of the ranges produced in the 1930s shows
wine and cocktail glasses as timeless, as classically simple as anything
that was produced in the post-war years. Indeed, way back in 1855 Baccarat
produced a water jug that looks as contemporary as anything our finest
glass-blowers are producing today: a simple curving shape in white opaline
glass with a single strip of bright blue it is sends out loud and clear the
message that fine design whilst ideally of its time always in some way
stands above and beyond its own time.
The book seems to me an indispensable tome for those who care about truly
beautiful glass and its visual historical record of the finest work that
Baccarat has done is of interest to all who ever have to consider the every
day matter of which glass to buy and why.
Baccarat By Jean-Louis Curtis, published by Thames &amp; Hudson, Pounds 65.
An exhibition, Baccarat American Collection &amp; Bestiary, is on until November
7 at Harrods of Knightsbridge, London SW1. The works do not, to my mind,
represent Baccarat at its finest aesthetic hour, but they are of undoubted
historical and technical interest. If you have a taste to see what a 300
kilo crystal American Brown Bear sculpture looks like, now is your chance.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Motoring: Four wheels good, two wheels bad - The merits of
getting a grip on winter driving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS nothing like the first snowflakes of winter to turn a motorist's
thoughts to four-wheel drive. Tyres lose grip. Wheels spin uselessly. Cars
pirouette or slide slowly into kerbs.
Family cars with fairly narrow tyres fare better than high performance
models with ultra low profile tyres. Their treads, meant to resist the
severe abrasion and heat build-up of very fast driving, can be next to
useless in snow.
The really high performers also benefit year-round from all-wheel drive. It
has a wonderfully calming effect when driving them on roads that are merely
wet and winding, not covered with ice and snow. Strangely, many buyers who
really need all-wheel drive only when their local roads are snowy for a week
or two every winter go for the knobbly tyred, on-off road kind of 4x4s.
These are a compromise. To go well across country they must be high slung,
have suspensions with a lot of vertical travel and transmissions with two
sets of gears - one for the road, one for the rough stuff. If you think none
of these features is of much use for driving on normal roads, whether
snow-covered or not, you would be right.
If you are going to drive on rutted farm tracks, massive ground clearance is
essential. But if not, most buyers would be better served all year round by
one of a number of otherwise normal cars with part-time or full-time
four-wheel drive.
There are a lot of them about, with prices starting from around Pounds 7,000
for a small Subaru Vivio or Justy hatchback. They go from front-wheel to
four-wheel drive at the touch of a button on the gear lever knob.
One of the latest to reach Britain is the BMW 525iX Touring - 'X' because it
has an advanced and fully automatic four-wheel drive system. Routinely, the
power is split 36 per cent to the front wheels, 64 per cent to the rears.
But sensors monitor road speed and individual tyre grip. They can tell if
the driver is accelerating or braking, instantly varying the power
distribution to favour the tyres, front or back, left or right, with most
grip. Full ABS braking is retained.
The Pounds 27,350 525iX with manual transmission has the muscle and
refinement one expects of a BMW. Tyre grip was so good that brutal
acceleration on wet and muddy roads caused no wheelspin. As a bonus, it
clung to slippery bends as though stuck to the surface.
It would have been nice to have tried it on snow but I have not seen any in
the south east of England for two winters and I pray this one makes it
three. But four-wheel drive BMWs have been sold on mainland Europe for
several years. When I was driving a Renault Espace Quadra over some
exceedingly slippery alpine passes some time ago, the only car to overtake
me was a Swiss-registered BMW. I was puzzled why a car with only rear-wheel
drive was leaving me for dead. Then I glimpsed the 325iX badge on the boot
lid as it stormed by in a cloud of snow.
The BMW 525iX Touring estate car with manual gearbox gave me 24.5 mpg (11.53
l/100km) during a week of motorway and minor road driving. A 5-speed
automatic transmission is a Pounds 1,150 extra.
* * * Driving the new Pounds 39,995 Range Rover LSE to Paris for the motor
show earlier this month confirmed impressions received when I sampled it
briefly in Wiltshire (this column, October 3/4). It was splendid on the
autoroute, though a slight rumbling vibration at around 80 mph (129 kmh)
dictated an equally quiet cruising rate of either 75 mph (121 kmh) or 85 mph
(137 kmh). In the anarchy that prevails around Arc de Triomphe and on the
dreaded boulevard peripherique, its bulk, solidity and commanding outlook
were great assets.
The seats were comfortable, there was ample power to out-accelerate speeding
small fry and I have no doubt it would have kept its end up on an autobahn.
Due to its high gearing (only 2,750 rpm at 80 mph/129 kmh) the fuel
consumption was 16.3 mpg (17.3 l/100 km). That was much closer to Land
Rover's claim of a 17 mpg (16.6 l/100km) average than I had expected.
This time the pneumatic suspension made no heavy breathing noises; the
level-maintaining air compressor ran silently.
The ride on smooth motorways was beyond reproach and it brushed aside the
stretches of cobblestones still found in Paris. But I did not like its
wriggly restlessness on the country roads between my home and Dover docks. I
was surprised the cover had to be taken out before I could stow two golf
bags in their trolleys in the load space. It is not as big as it looks. But
the lengthened wheelbase provides rear seat legroom like a London cab's.
Land Rover says a lot of people buy a Range Rover instead of a BMW 7-Series,
Mercedes S-Class, Jaguar or Toyota Lexus. I am sure they do, but let us be
clear about one thing. A Range Rover is an alternative to a luxury executive
car, not a direct substitute. Whatever its virtues - and it has many - it
simply does not drive like one. For me, unless you intend to make use of its
off-road cap ability or at least pull a two-horse trailer, it loses much of
its point.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Gardening: Beating pests the natural way - Arthur Hellyer
discovers a friendly way of dealing with unwelcome visitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GREAT deal of natural biological control of insect pests goes on in the
garden quite naturally and without any particular help from the gardener,
except the obvious one of avoiding the use of chemical or other treatments
that might be harmful to the beneficial organisms.
This is now well understood, and the great reduction in the usage of garden
chemicals is partly due to the desire to preserve 'friendly' creatures -
such as ladybird larvae and lacewing flies - that are valuable scavengers in
the garden.
What is not so well known is that some methods of biological control
actually involve deliberately introducing organisms to the garden or
greenhouse.
One of the oldest of these is the white fly parasite, Encarsia formosa, a
tiny wasp which lays its eggs in the white fly scales that are attached to
the leaves of infested plants, sometimes in great numbers. The encarsia eggs
hatch into larvae which devour the scales, so preventing more adult white
flies appearing from them.
This parasite is not a native of Britain and must be artificially introduced
to the greenhouse in which there are white fly infested plants.
This is usually done by hanging up leaves that bear white fly scales already
infested with encarsia and leaving them to develop into adult wasps, which
will then carry on the good work.
In winter, due to lack of warmth and also of white fly scales to keep larvae
fed, this parasite usually dies out and has to be reintroduced the following
year. Of course, a parasite of any kind is dependant on its prey for its own
survival and so can never eliminate a pest altogether but, hopefully, it can
restrict it to tolerable levels.
A second predator that has been used with considerable success to control
the greenhouse red spider mites is called Pytoseiulus persimilis. It is
itself a mite, though of a different kind - one might say one that lives on
meat rather than on vegetables.
Both the adult stage of this mite and the nymph devour adult nymphs and eggs
of the greenhouse red spider mite. Again, if they do it too successfully,
they will automatically destroy themselves since they have no other food
supply.
More recently, a third predator has been added to this list of organisms
that can be used to control pests. This is a minute nematode - what
gardeners often refer to as an eelworm. Some are quite large but this one,
which feeds on the grubs of the vine weevil, is too small to be seen with
the naked eye. Unlike the other two predators this one is native to Britain
but is not present everywhere and most likely will have to be introduced.
The method of introduction is quite different. The nematodes are despatched
in a moist, inert carrier and on arrival are mixed with water and applied as
a drench to the soil that is infested with vine weevil larvae. These
nematodes are as exclusive as encarsia and pytoseiulus in their feeding
habits and present no hazard to any other organism, including human beings
and their pets.
This parasite is marketed as Nemasys by Defender, a company that can supply
other predators and parasites. The address is P0 Box 131, Ashford, Kent TN25
5TQ. Defender is a branch of Biological Pest Control, which supplies growers
throughout the UK and Europe.
Both the adults and the grubs of the vine weevil damage vines and many other
plants. The weevil eats the edges of leaves, giving them an unsightly,
notched appearance, but the damage done by the larvae is much more serious,
though largely unseen. They work underground, gnawing away at roots, and
they attack many other plants beside grape vines.
This pest has been on the increase since the withdrawal of effective soil
insecticides and so the introduction of the parasitic nematode is a real
step forward. It needs a temperature of above 14'C to be fully active. It is
effective outdoors until the end of September and under glass for a much
longer period, even throughout the winter if there is adequate heating.
With most methods of biological control it is advisable to supplement the
treatment with chemical control in certain circumstances.
Thus, with white fly one could use a pyrethrum spray or aerosol to reduce
the number of white flies before introducing encarsia formosa, but there
should be an interval of about seven days before the parasite is introduced.
The adult vine weevils are not directly attacked by the parasitic nematode
but can be reduced in numbers with a spray of gamma HCH or pirimiphos
methyl.
An excellent leaflet on these matters has been prepared by ICI Garden
Products and should be available at most garden shops or direct from ICI,
Dept. FF, Fernhurst, Haslemere, Surrey, GU27 3JE. Tel: 0428-645454.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Travel: Tea and cake - then the earthquake struck / Mark
Hodson got more than he bargained for when he visited Banaue, in the
Philippines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK HODSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE bus station in Baguio City, four hard-faced Filipino drivers sat
huddled around a table drinking beer. A sign on the wall said: 'No sleeping
on the tables.' On the radio, Bruce Springsteen was singing Born To Run.
It was 6am. The town of Sagada was eight hours away by bus along the Halsema
Highway, a narrow rock and dust track carved into the sides of the mountains
7,000 feet above sea level.
Our wooden-sided jalopy spewed out black fumes as it crawled up the first
hill. At the top, we watched the sun peer over the mountains and bathe the
rice terraces below with warm morning light. If the scenery wasn't
breathtaking enough, there was always the driving. On downhill stretches our
driver screamed around blind hairpin bends on the wrong side of the road
with his hand on the horn and his foot on the gas.
I had picked up a hint about the standard of driving in the Philippines
when, at the bus station in Manila, I was offered an insurance policy with
my ticket to Baguio. For around 25p I could relax in the knowledge that if I
were killed on the trip my family would receive about Pounds 5,000.
Strangely, it did not make me feel any easier, but as the odds seemed
generous I paid up.
Now we were in the heart of the central cordilleras, two days' hard driving
out of Manila, where rebel ambushes, earthquakes and falling rocks would
have made the idea of insurance ludicrous - and premiums prohibitive.
When we finally made it to Sagada, I found a lazy, one-street town in a
small valley and surrounded by pine forests and lush terraces. But for all
its beauty, this was bandit country - the last frontier between law
enforcement and the rich cannabis fields of the north, controlled by the
communist New People's Army.
I found a room in a guest house for Pounds 1 a night, and a cafe across the
road that sold home-made chocolate cake. In the evening, at one of Sagada's
two bars, I was cornered by a Filipino guide with one tooth who told me a
girl from New Zealand had been involved in a road accident that day.
A bus from Banaue, the next town on my itinerary, had veered off the road
and crashed down the side of a mountain. 'She is in the hospital here,' said
the guide. 'You can go and see her.' I asked if she was badly hurt. 'Oh,
yes,' he replied cheerily. 'She's dead.'
I nodded sagely, wondering how to make my escape when I was saved by the
bell. It was 9.50pm, said the barman; we had 10 minutes to drink up and get
back to our rooms before the curfew came into force. I went without
argument.
I was woken by the sound of pigs squealing beneath my window. I stumbled out
into bright sunshine where a young boy said: 'Good morning, you want to buy
some hash?' A gang of teenagers wearing bandanas, basketball shorts and
flip-flops swaggered up the street with rifles slung over their shoulders. I
asked the boy if they were rebels. He grinned: 'No man, that's the army.'
After breakfast at the Shamrock Cafe, I set off to find Sagada's hanging
coffins, a collection of unusual graveyards said to lie on the outskirts of
town. Along the main street, men in tribal skirts squatted outside thatched
huts sharpening long knives while families sold cakes and Coca-Cola from
their metal-walled houses.
I stopped several times to ask directions but the children just giggled and
the adults waved vaguely at the hills ahead. After an hour of aimless
wandering I was on the point of giving up. Then I looked up and saw them,
clusters of rough wooden coffins lodged in cracks and crevices high in the
sheer rock faces.
I walked further and found other unmarked coffins carved out of tree trunks
and placed in piles at the mouths of caves. These strange tombs were built
by local tribespeople who believed the dead souls would return to the
Earth's core. The custom has been abandoned and some coffins prised open,
possibly for the benefit of tourists, to reveal greying skeletons draped in
tattered cloth.
The trip to Banaue was by jeepney, a brightly-painted minibus converted from
an old American troop carrier. Just two jeepneys a day made the trip, one at
6am and the other at 6.30am.
We stopped three times on the way: once to buy breakfast of pancakes and
coffee, and twice at army checkpoints on mist-covered mountain tops. The
road into Banaue passed some of the most dramatic rice terraces in the
world. Whole hillsides had been carved into horizontal slices.
It has taken the people of the Ifugao tribe 2,000 years to build these
terraces, step by step from the ground up, using bare hands and primitive
tools. Engineers have come from around the world to study the sophisticated
irrigation system and marvel at the 12,000 miles of mud walls.
I spent two days in Banaue exploring the terraces, walking for hours in the
clear mountain air, losing my way and finding it again. On the afternoon of
the second day I went to a cafe in town. I was sitting with a cup of tea and
slice of cake, nursing my blistered feet, when the earthquake struck.
First, my cup started shaking on the table. I looked down and saw the table
shaking; then I looked up to see that the whole building was shaking. I ran
into the road to find the population of the town there already, looking very
worried.
The quake lasted about 15 seconds, maybe less. It seemed longer. There was
no structural damage, just a few vegetable stalls upset, pictures knocked
off walls. It had measured 5 on the Richter scale. At the epicentre, in
Baguio City, it reached 5.7 and left 25 people injured. I was told it was
the worst earthquake since one three years earlier which had measured 7.7
and killed 1,600 people across the region.
Two hours later the rains came, torrents of water battering the houses and
flooding the streets with mud. As the storm raged into the night, I cowered
in a cafe drinking beer with an English teacher from Hackney. Every now and
then a loud rumble would echo through the valley and we would freeze in
terror, tensed for another earthquake, then burst into wild laughter when we
realised it was only thunder.
Next day, life had returned to normal. The air had cleared, the ground was
drying out, people were laughing. I squeezed into a bus packed with farmers,
sacks of rice and live chickens and took a bumpy 10-mile ride higher into
the hills. The driver pulled up at a steep footpath beside the road and
pointed me towards Batad, my next stop.
It was a two-hour walk to the top of the hill. Below, a patchwork of
terraces stretched over the valley floor and up the sides of the surrounding
mountains like a huge green amphitheatre. In the middle lay Batad - two
dozen Ifugao huts and one concrete house dotted around a tiny church with a
rusted tin roof.
Two small boys in torn shirts led me down the hill, along the tops of dry
stone walls and through dusty back yards. We arrived at the concrete hut
where a woman called Christina showed me to my room. It was 20 pesos a night
and there were no other guests.
Rice is everything there. I slept with rice fields all around and in the
mornings I was woken by the sound of rice being pounded in mortars carved
from tree stumps. I spent my days on Christina's terrace watching children
wash clothes on the rocks while women prepared meals and their husbands
crouched around bottles of tupuy, a throat-searing rice wine.
In the evenings, the palm trees filled with fireflies. After dinner,
Christina's 10-year-old daughter and her friend would sing tribal songs and
dance in the glow of a kerosene lamp.
Spanish missionaries converted the Ifugao to Catholicism and on Sundays the
families went to church and sang haunting hymns that could be heard across
the valley. But these people still practise head-hunting. Although their
ancient disputes with neighbouring villages have long been resolved,
decapitation is still considered a legitimate way of righting a wrong. In
1977, a bus driver who ran over and killed a child was seized and summarily
executed.
Head-hunting is not the only tradition that has survived in Batad. The
villagers still worship Bulul, a rice god, and nail the skulls of
slaughtered pigs to the walls of their huts to ward off evil spirits. There
were some parts of the soul that not even the conquistadors could reach.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Travel: How to cope with India's railways - Practical
Traveller  Where, when, how much. David Pilling opens a series of travel
advisories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIAN Railways has enough track to wrap twice around the Earth and enough
red tape to entangle a considerably larger planet. However, it remains an
extraordinary way to explore the subcontinent - warts, beauty spots and all.
There are several options for the rail enthusiast. The first is simply to
turn up in Delhi or Bombay and book each leg of your journey as the fancy
takes you. This provides maximum flexibility but will thrust you into the
heart of railway bureaucracy. You will need a timetable (Trains at a Glance,
available all over India) and the patience of Mother Teresa.
Securing a reservation is always a problem. Try to go to the station at
least a few days in advance; if nothing is available, ask if there is a
tourist/VIP quota, or speak to the station superintendent. As a last resort,
buy an unreserved ticket for any class, get on the train and ask the
conductor about unclaimed reservations.
The hierarchy of carriage-classes is matched only by that of India's
stratified social structure. With few exceptions, what you want are first
class air-con or ordinary first class tickets for mail or express trains.
Anything else is likely to be very cheap, very slow and very uncomfortable.
Sleeper carriages are more spartan than in Europe; bedding is available but
you will need to ask for it. Better still, take a sheet sleeping bag.
An alternative to tackling this railway obstacle course unaided is to seek
the advice of Dr Swaminath Dandipani, who runs S D Enterprises (tel:
081-903-3411) from a small office in Wembley, west London. Dr Dandipani is
the sole UK agent for Indrail passes which facilitate unlimited nationwide
travel, including sleepers. A seven-day first class pass costs a humble
Pounds 77; 15 days is Pounds 94; 90 days: Pounds 274.
Dr Dandipani, who claims to have memorised the entire Indian rail timetable,
will sort out an itinerary with you. All reservations are telexed through
from London and neatly laid out on a computer printout. By all accounts the
system is remarkably efficient. Dr Dandipani's service includes a list of 20
or 30 practical tips, including a reminder to take your own toilet paper and
to drink 20 glasses of purified water a day.
The third option is to book a complete tour. Butterfield's Railway Tours
(0262-470-230) has operated for 17 years, using its own refurbished carriage
which is attached to local trains. The carriage, which accommodates up to 26
people, comprises two sitting rooms, a dining room, kitchen, washrooms and
lavatories. There is even a library. Roy Butterfield, who runs the Yorkshire
office, describes it as a 'home from home', but insists his company provides
a true picture of the subcontinent, shunning the more westernised version
favoured by some operators.
Butterfield's runs two itineraries: the Great Indian Railway Tour, which
covers, in a breathless 21 days, the 3,000 miles between Delhi and Cochin
via Agra (for the Taj Mahal), Lucknow, Hyderabad, Bangalore, and a host of
other cities and costs Pounds 775, flights not included; and, more leisurely
and luxurious, the South India Tour from Madras to Bombay, which works out
at Pounds 1,750 all inclusive.
More upmarket still are tours offered by Cox &amp; Kings (071-931-9106). The
Palace on Wheels, a sort of rolling re-enactment of the Raj, is run by
Indian Railways and takes in the justly-famous sights of Rajasthan. The
one-week schedule, which allows little time for exploration, costs Pounds
595, flights not included. Cox &amp; Kings runs its own trip from Delhi to
Calcutta on express trains, with stops including Agra, Gwalior, and
Varanasi, the holy city on the Ganges. All-inclusive price: Pounds 1,455.
Cox &amp; Kings and other operators, such as Abercrombie &amp; Kent (071-730-7795),
will organise bespoke tours incorporating train journeys. You might consider
routes such as Quilon to Madurai, which starts on the humid Kerelan coast
before climbing into the cool Cardamom hills; the toy train up to Ooty hill
station (where snooker was invented), or the narrow-gauge Darjeeling
Himalayan Railway. The latter is especially unreliable, but then that is
half the fun.

FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Profits advance 10% on flat turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REED International, the publisher, increased its interim pre-tax profits by
10 per cent to Pounds 94m despite what it said were very difficult market
conditions.
Turnover was flat at Pounds 758.6m (Pounds 760.8m) in the six months to
September 30. Reed said the increase in pre-tax profits understated the
underlying trading improvement because of changes in the timing of operating
profits and lower disposal gains.
Operating profit showed a double-digit improvement in three business
segments which bore the brunt of the economic downturn during the past two
years - consumer publishing, up 60 per cent; business-to-business, up 13 per
cent; and books, which rose 17 per cent.
Mr Peter Davis, chairman, said: 'Unfortunately I am not able to report any
signs of economic recovery. Only in US business advertising has there been
any upturn, but this is relatively weak and the improvements so far could be
reversed if there is a setback to business confidence.
'In the UK we must now be concerned that unless the government is able to
re-establish confidence in its economic policies, there will be a further
decline in a number of our markets, instead of the hoped-for recovery.'
Earnings per share rose 8 per cent to 11.7p (10.8p). The interim dividend
was increased by 5 per cent to 5p.
As a result of the proposed merger with Elsevier, Reed will change its
year-end to December 31, and its result for a nine-month period will be
announced in March.

THE BOARD OF Hoskins Brewery, the Leicester-based real ale brewer, yesterday
said it had almost amassed sufficient support to thwart attempts by rebel
shareholders to change the board.
And at yesterday's annual meeting the board commanded more than 60 per cent
of the support of shareholders who were voting on a number of issues.
But a vocal minority, led by Mr Richard Cattermole, denied Hoskins the 75
per cent support required to pass a special resolution authorising the
company to issue new shares to make selective acquisitions.
The dissidents want to remove Mr Barrie Hoar, chairman, and his brother, Mr
Robert Hoar, from the board.
Resolutions to replace the brothers, whose family holds 30 per cent of
Hoskins, with Mr Cattermole, head of Ryan Elizabeth, a pubs and hotels
operator, and one of his associates, will be put to the vote at an EGM on
November 18.
Mr Cattermole said: 'It is meaningless of Mr Barrie to boast of having
almost half the votes already since shareholders can change their minds
right up and at the EGM.'
The EGM is likely to be a bruising affair judging by yesterday's annual
meeting.
The brewery was accused of 'skullduggery' and 'unfair play' by some of the
dissidents when one of their members, Mr Norman Blyth, had his proxy vote
ruled out of order.
Although he is chairman of Caswan Properties, which has a 3.1 per cent stake
in the brewery, Hoskins said Mr Blyth had no written authorisation from his
company to cast his vote on its behalf.
Mr Hoar, who for a large part of the AGM was barely audible, was criticised
for selling nine pubs for Pounds 2.45m to Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries,
leaving it with its brewery and seven houses. The deal, however, eliminated
borrowings. Hoskins now has cash of about Pounds 750,000.
Hoskins reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 83,060 last year, but
extraordinary charges reduced the attributable gain to Pounds 16,625.

FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Booker buys cash and carry in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Booker, the food distribution and agribusiness group, is expanding further
in southern Europe with the acquisition of a cash and carry business near
Barcelona, Spain.
The deal follows last year's purchase of an interest in a food wholesaler in
Portugal. The group is keen to build up the business in southern Europe.
The purchase, for Pounds 2.2m plus stock, is of a one outlet operation which
in 1991 made pre-tax profits of Pounds 765,000 on sales of Pounds 42.4m.
Booker said that the management and systems were capable of supporting a
number of additional outlets.

FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Mountleigh in Pounds 124m Spanish disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KPMG PEAT Marwick, the international auditing firm acting as receivers for
the Mountleigh property group, has sold Galerias Preciados, Spain's second
biggest department store chain and Mountleigh's largest single asset, to a
group of Spanish investors for Pta21.2bn (Pounds 124m).
Mr Tim Hayward, the receiver, said Galerias accounted for about 25 per cent
of Mountleigh's assets; that meant that about a third of its total had now
been sold.
He was in no hurry to dispose of the entire portfolio. He was prepared to
wait for some recovery in the UK property market rather than sell too
cheaply those assets that were producing income.
Although Galerias had been sold for less than it was worth - with 29 stores
throughout Spain some analysts in Madrid were yesterday calling the sale
price a giveaway - Mr Hayward had accepted the best price offered. Serious
negotiations had been intiated with at least six other potential buyers
since Mountleigh went into receivership last May. Galerias has been bought
by a consortium lead by Mr Fernando Sada Gonzalez-Breto, Mr Justo
Lopez-Tello Camara, who each have 36 per cent stakes, and Mr Santiago de
Mollinedo Martinez, with 12 per cent.
The rest of the shares will be distributed among other as yet unnamed
directors. Mr Lopez-Tello, the best known of the three, is the majority
shareholder in Mantequerias Leonesas, an upmarket supermarket chain which
already has space in some Galerias stores.
The three men would not disclose who was financing their acquisition and Mr
Hayward was unwilling to say when he would be paid. Ironically, the biggest
creditor of Galerias is Mountleigh itself, having guaranteed loans to
Galerias worth about Pounds 85m in the last two years.
Mr Hayward said Galerias had made 'substantial' losses so far this year but
the buyers said they hoped to bring it back to profit within three years.
The group is thought to have incurred losses of some Pta3.8bn.
Their determination to hold the group intact will frustrate a number of
foreign retailers, including Marks &amp; Spencer, who had hoped to be able to
expand in Spain by buying some of Galerias' prime sites in major cities.

FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: 'Disastrous' write downs push Control Sec
to Pounds 192m net loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASSET write downs at Control Securities of nearly Pounds 250m were
'disastrous by any standards' according to Mr Sydney Robin, who took up the
role of temporary executive chairman of the property, hotels, brewing and
pubs group in April 'with some natural caution and reluctance'.
Mr Robin joined on the dismissal of Mr Nazmu Virani, former chairman and
chief executive, following his arrest on charges related to the BCCI
collapse in March. Mr John Kerslake joined as finance director six weeks
ago, and a shortlist for the job of chief executive has been drawn up
although an appointment is unlikely until the group's talks with its bankers
are successfully concluded.
The write downs covering the year to end March cut net assets from Pounds
293.5m to Pounds 37.6m and caused a net loss of Pounds 192.4m (Pounds 4.1m)
or 51.8p (1.1p) per share. The accounts were prepared on a going concern
basis, as the group cannot continue to trade without the support of its
banks and bondholders which are owed a total of Pounds 259m.
The group is presenting a business plan to its bank creditors on Monday. The
bank loans and overdrafts of Pounds 182m are secured on the group's assets
which are still valued at substantially more than that.
Control's shares were suspended a year ago at 16 1/2 p when the Serious
Fraud Office raided the company's offices. The group hopes to have them
relisted once the business plan has been agreed, possibly early in the new
year.
Mr Robin told shareholders: 'Let me emphasise that your company is not now
and has not been the subject of investigation by the SFO.' The group spent
Pounds 467,000 to establish that deals between the group, BCCI and other
parties had been on an arm's length basis.
Mr Robin said the group had been 'in public disarray' which had damaged the
trading businesses such as the Belhaven brewery.
Results for the year showed a fall in turnover from Pounds 130.6m to Pounds
97.9m, and a drop in trading profits from Pounds 36.1m to Pounds 24.4m,
insufficient to cover interest charges of Pounds 27.3m (Pounds 21.2m). The
group's property trading activities suffered in the recession but profits
from the brewery and the pub estate rose, while those of the Spanish hotel
operations were slightly down.
Exceptional costs, including write downs of property and investments,
including a Pounds 11.5m provision for the fall in value of the stake in
Stylo, the loss-making footwear group, amounted to Pounds 193.4m (Pounds
18.2m).

FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Meeting rallies Rank shares 12p
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Rank Organisation, the leisure group, gained 12p to 586p yesterday
after the company held a well-received meeting with analysts ahead of its
financial year-end today.
Rank said trading conditions had hardly changed since July, with the company
remaining cautious about any upturn. There were, however, signs of
improvement in the US. Rank's video distribution division, while still loss
making, had improved its trading levels from last year.
In the past, Rank has held a series of individual meetings with analysts
ahead of its 'close' season. This runs from the financial year-end to the
announcement of results, expected in January.
But the company decided to brief analysts, and release a trading update, at
the same time. 'We felt it was much fairer,' said Mr Nigel Turnbull, finance
director.
Mr Max Dolding, analyst at James Capel, said the meeting went well, although
little new information was provided. The broker is leaving its profits
forecast unchanged at Pounds 243.5m.
Despite falling through the year, Rank's borrowings are set to increase
sharply to about Pounds 1bn. About 60 per cent of borrowings are USDollars
denominated, rising at year end.

FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Gresham House problems mount with Pounds
1.5m deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRESHAM House, the investment trust with negative net assets after two years
of losses, watched its problems mount in the six months to June 30.
Gresham, unrelated to venture capital company Gresham Trust, reported losses
attributable to shareholders of Pounds 1.5m during the period, compared to
losses of Pounds 2.63m a year ago.
In a statement, Mr Alfred Stirling, chairman, said losses would continue
unless a refinancing, now under negotiation, could be concluded with banks
and financial institutions.
'Slow progress is being made and there is no certainty that it will be
successfully concluded,' he said. 'Failure is likely to prove fatal.'
Gresham's troubles stem from investments in property and unquoted companies,
two of the most dangerous areas for investment trusts during the recession.
The company has been forced to sell most of its non-property assets to pay
off debts, leading to a sharp fall in income.
Net income fell from Pounds 420,000 to Pounds 270,000. But interest costs
dropped from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 787,000. Exceptional losses totalled
Pounds 982,000. But there was no explanation as to how the losses were
incurred.
No one at Gresham's offices was available to comment.
Gresham is being sued for Pounds 1m for placing into receivership a
subsidiary. Court rulings have gone against Gresham, which plans to appeal
to the House of Lords next year.
There was a loss per share of 35.3p, an improvement on last time's 61.9p. No
dividend is paid. Group net asset value, which stood at minus 18p at
December 31, continued to deteriorate, Mr Stirling's statement said.
The shares fell from 3p to 1 3/4 p yesterday.

FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Reed merger terms adjusted - Pound's fall
fails to deflect proposed links with Elsevier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING'S plunge since Britain left the ERM has altered the terms of the
proposed merger between Reed International and Elsevier of the Netherlands,
which will create one of the world's biggest publishers.
Reed's indirect interest in the Dutch group, granted to reflect the UK
group's larger market value, will now be 5.8 per cent, rather than the 11.5
per cent suggested when the deal was first announced on September 17 .
Mr Peter Davis, chairman of Reed, said neither group had been deflected by
the recent currency volatility: 'We just kept our nerve, kept our heads down
and got on with it.'
The combined group, Reed Elsevier, will have a market capitalisation of
about Pounds 6bn. The merger, to take effect on January 1, will be on a
50-50 basis without any premium to either set of shareholders, and both Reed
and Elsevier will keep separate stock exchange listings.
The market welcomed yesterday's announcement, with Reed shares advancing 7p
to 582p, and Elsevier's shares closing in Amsterdam up Fl 2 to Fl 112.
The change in the size of the cross-holding means that for income purposes
one Elsevier share will have equivalent economic benefits to 7.69 Reed
shares, rather than the initial figure of 6.86. Both companies will pay
gross dividends on this 1:7.69 equalisation ratio.
A bleary-eyed Mr Davis said the final terms of the deal had been settled
yesterday 'after complex analysis by the professionals and then  - at the
end - a bit of horse-trading in the middle of the night'.
The merged group is forecast to make pre-tax profits of Pounds 430m in the
year to December 31 on turnover of Pounds 2.46bn, and have interest cover of
16 times.
Strong cashflow of Pounds 442m and low borrowings will allow Reed Elsevier
to make acquisitions. The merged company could have Pounds 1bn available and
potential purchases are already being jointly studied.
A bid will be submitted for Official Airline Guides, the business bought by
Mr Robert Maxwell from Dun &amp; Bradstreet for Dollars 750m in 1988, although
this is seen as a useful addition to the merged group's existing travel
information businesses rather than a strategic necessity.
Reed International has already identified business and professional
publishing as its top priority for the future, an emphasis which will fit
well with the Elsevier approach.
Acquisitions in professional areas such as the law in continental Europe are
now likely. In the past Reed has looked at such expansion but drawn back
because of lack of knowledge of particular European markets.
Reed said the merger would cost between Pounds 30m and Pounds 35m in
advisers' and listings fees, reflecting the fact that the enlarged group
will operate in the 43 countries. However, the group believes that a
combination of operational and tax savings will recoup that amount within 18
months.
The merged group will set up a combined treasury and finance operation in
Switzerland, although Reed will continue a significant operation in London.
Mr Nigel Stapleton, Reed's finance director, said he was confident that the
effect of the merger would be to reduce the group's tax rate by between 0.5
percentage point and 1 percentage point a year.
Mr Davis said there was scope for some cost savings, but emphasised that the
merger was not driven by these considerations. Areas of overlap which are
likely to be combined into single divisions are in US business magazines, UK
scientific publications and medical publishing.
Management links between the two companies are already increasing in number
in advance of formal confirmation of the merger and Mr Davis believes Reed
and Elsevier are similar in approach and culture.
'We are 85 per cent there in terms of culture, style and temperament,' Mr
Davis said yesterday.
As the shareholders of both Reed and Elsevier start to digest their merger
circulars the intensity of two-way traffic between London and Amsterdam is
already increasing.
'There will be contact at all levels. It's already much more than we
thought,' Mr Davis said.

FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Falling gold prices keep Monarch earnings
in red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER GOLD prices and reduced output kept Monarch Resources, the
London-quoted mining and exploration company with operations in Venezuela,
in the red in the first half of 1992. The pre-tax loss was USDollars 1.87m
or 12.8 cents, compared with Dollars 1.88m or 13.3 cents in 1991.
Gold production was 11,561 troy ounces, in line with the corresponding
11,723 ounces but well below the 13,771 ounces achieved in the second half
of last year. The drop was due to a reduction in economically available raw
material for the company's Revemin plant in Venezuela.
Mr Tony Ciali, chief executive, said Revemin also suffered from increased
costs, mainly due to inflation. This left the plant with an operating loss
of Dollars 437,000 in the period (Dollars 14,000 loss) and an operating cash
flow deficit of Dollars 50,000 (Dollars 509,000 surplus).
Management was urgently looking for new sources of material to feed the
plant, he added.
In July, Monarch raised Pounds 20m through a rights issue, principally to
fund the 24-month development of the La Camorra gold project in Venezuela.
Mr Michael Beckett, chairman, said development was on schedule and under
budget so far. A general manager started work in August.

Net asset value per capital share for Contra-Cyclical Investment Trust fell
to 26.2p at September 30, against 53.3p a year earlier.
However the figures per income share improved from 1p to 3.7p and for the
zero dividend preferred shares from 52.9p to 59p.
The trust, chaired by Sir Alan Walters, is paying an unchanged second
interim dividend of 2.25p making a maintained total for the year so far of
4.5p.
Net revenue for the six months to the end of September was Pounds 451,000,
against Pounds 681,000 for the period from February 26 to September 30 1991.
Earnings per income share were 5.64p (8.51p).

FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Exceptional gains boost OEM figures
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An increase in exceptional income has enabled Office and Electronic Machines
to raise its pre-tax profit from Pounds 14,000 to Pounds 267,000 for the
first half of 1992.
Turnover fell to Pounds 767,000 (Pounds 1.34m, including Pounds 615,000 for
discontinued business) and the operating loss rose to Pounds 390,000 (Pounds
341,000, of which Pounds 144,000 discontinued). The pension fund refund,
less reorganisation provision, contributed Pounds 587,000 (Pounds 273,000).
Mr Richard Noonan, chairman, said trading in retail operations was
marginally better in money terms and virtually unchanged in real terms.
It remained the case that the business was too small to be viable in the
present economic conditions. The operating loss of continuing business rose
partly because margins had suffered and costs had risen, and partly because
of the increased costs as the company explored various possibilities.
After a tax charge of Pounds 351,000 (Pounds 2,000) losses per share came to
1.4p (earnings 0.2p). The interim dividend is again 0.1p.

FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Weak prices leave Utd Energy in loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
United Energy blamed weak oil and gas prices and unfavourable exchange rates
for pre-tax losses of Pounds 52,000 for the six months to June 30, compared
with profits of Pounds 91,000. For the full 1991 year, however, there were
losses of Pounds 127,000.
The result was despite an increase in turnover from Pounds 160,000 to Pounds
834,000. The figures included only a partial contribution from AmBrit
International, which was acquired in February.
The comparable figure was assisted by exceptional gains of Pounds 185,000
and net interest received of Pounds 42,000 whereas in the period under
review there was a charge of Pounds 5,000. Losses per share came out at 0.2p
(earnings 0.8p).
Mr John Billington, chairman, said that the recent improvement in exchange
rates, firmer oil and gas prices and increasing production volumes made the
USM-quoted company cautiously optimistic.

Platon International, the maker of flow, level and pressure measuring and
controlling instruments, has started to recover, reporting a pre-tax profit
of Pounds 12,000 in the half year ended October 2 1992.
That compared with losses of Pounds 299,000 in the corresponding period and
with Pounds 248,000 in the preceding six months.
In the latest period a deficit of Pounds 200,000 was incurred in April and
May, but June-September produced a profit of Pounds 212,000. Prospects for
the second half looked encouraging, the directors claimed.
Orders received in the period increased by Pounds 1m to Pounds 4.7m. Sales
were up 20 per cent to Pounds 4.2m, with the UK ahead 12 per cent and Europe
28 per cent.
Gearing remained 'unacceptably high' at 98 per cent, but a number of cash
raising measures had recently been taken.
Losses per share in the half year were 0.1p (2.8p).

</HEADLINE>

French Connection, the fashion clothing group, returned to an operating
profit in the half year ended July 31, and the improvement has continued
into August and September.
The group was cautiously optimistic about prospects. The 1992 winter
collection had been well received by wholesalers and retail sales were
encouraging, said Mr Terence Wardale, the chairman.
In the half year the group cut its pre-tax loss from Pounds 4.99m to Pounds
535,000 and finished with losses per share of 4.9p (31.8p). Again there will
be no dividend for the full year.
There was an operating profit of Pounds 903,000 (loss Pounds 1.43m) on
reduced turnover, while exceptional charges fell to Pounds 777,000 (Pounds
2.74m), being closure costs of Western Jeans and Future Classics Pounds
473,000 and reorganisation in the UK and France absorbing Pounds 304,000.
Turnover was Pounds 22.5m (Pounds 25.3m), reflecting a reduction of Pounds
2.4m from businesses sold or discontinued.

FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Manganese dividend held despite Pounds
2.45m losses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MANGANESE Bronze Holdings, maker of black taxi cabs, suffered a full year
loss of Pounds 2.45m after the closure of the Darlington foundry in March.
This compared with a Pounds 949,000 deficit previously.
A loss, however, of Pounds 531,000 on continuing businesses in 1991 was
turned into a profit of Pounds 498,000.
The pre-tax loss was struck on sales up 2 per cent at Pounds 71.17m. The
group incurred a loss of Pounds 2.62m on discontinued operations.
As a result, the loss per share increased from 3.78p to 12.27p but the
company will maintain a dividend of 1p.
Mr Jamie Borwick, chief executive, said despite the recession the company
made substantial progress, adding what it needs most is more demand for
taxis.
'There are a lot of yellow lights on every street corner,' he said. 'Taxi
drivers are having to work much harder for the same money.'
Manganese Bronze makes 32 taxis a week, down from 45 this time last year and
60 in 1990.
Operating losses in the vehicles division were reduced from Pounds 1.33m to
Pounds 310,000 on sales of Pounds 40.71m; powder metals nearly doubled
profits to Pounds 1.14m on sales 26 per cent higher through organic growth
at Pounds 16.58m. The profits from two profitable foundries were offset by
losses at a bus and railway door business. The division moved from profits
of Pounds 177,000 into losses of Pounds 336,000.
Gearing was held to 19 per cent, up from 12 per cent, despite capital
expenditure of Pounds 2.7m, more than 1.4 times the depreciation charge.

of Tomkins' offer price.
Hanson, RHM's rival suitor, does not have any shares in its target. Hanson
was yesterday considering whether to increase its offer to top Tomkins or to
walk away.
Tomkins' shares, which fell heavily on Thursday were unchanged yesterday at
212p, only 12p above the price for the rights issue, launched to help
finance the acquisition.
Tomkins bought 2.59m shares at 260p, the level of its cash offer, and
another 3.37m shares at 269.54p, the maximum price it can pay in the market,
which includes the 9.54p dividend RHM has promised its shareholders.
Added to the 14,000 shares it already held, Tomkins has a 1.68 per cent
stake in RHM, the milling, baking and grocery products group, which has
recommended the Tomkins bid.

LOITERING WITH INTENT by Peter O'Toole Macmillan Pounds 14.99, 198 pages
FATAL CHARM by Alexander Walker Weidenfeld and Nicolson Pounds 18.99, 457
pages
PETER O'Toole's jottings cover his years from about five to somewhere in his
twenties, but not in any order. There are affectionate notes on his life
with his father, an itinerant bookie; about his unprofitable visits to
schools, his employment on a local newspaper, but not what he did there; we
have rough sketches of National Service in the Royal Navy, some notes on
rugby. He seems to have enrolled in RADA almost by accident. There are pages
about Adolf Hitler, whom he subsequently shot in the BBC's Rogue Male and
who was one of his early obsessions, like the knight Sir Yvain and the
wizard Merlin.
It is likeable enough, but there is hardly anything about the theatre, which
is what makes O'Toole interesting.
Alexander Walker's Fatal Charm: The Life of Rex Harrison is another matter.
A comprehensive account of Harrison's work on stage and film is strung
around his six marriages, one of which, and one of his incidental affairs,
led to a suicide.
Harrison, a splendid actor, was a less splendid citizen. With the wealth he
earned, he made himself increasingly 'upper-class' and increasingly
self-centred, with insistent demands on casting. He served with the RAF in
the war until the spring of 1944. At this period he left his first wife,
Collette Thomas, and began an affair with Lilli Palmer, whom he married six
months later. From here on his acting career was a virtually unchecked line
of film and stage success: his marriages, not.
An affair with Carole Landis ended with her suicide. Divorced from Lilli
Palmer, he married Kay Kendall, but she died of leukaemia after two years.
He played opposite Rachel Roberts and duly married her. She became mentally
unstable, and there were attempted suicides. They ultimately divorced and he
set up house with Elizabeth Harris and her three children. This was not his
scene; separation and divorce followed, and he settled down with Anglo-Asian
Mercia Tinker, who survived him.
Walker gives much authentic detail of Harrison's personal unpleasantness and
his dramatic success, most vividly recalled in his Henry Higgins in My Fair
Lady.

IT DOESN'T TAKE A HERO: THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF GENERAL H. NORMAN SCHWARZKOPF
written with Peter Petre Bantam Press Pounds 17.99, 526 pages
PJ O'ROURKE'S shorthand theory of American politics is that God is a
Republican, because he stands for rules and regulations and the ethic thing,
and Santa Claus is a Democrat, because he likes giving people what they
want.
What would the humorist make of Norman Schwarzkopf? God or Santa Claus?
Democrat or Republican? It is very hard to tell, and his autobiography It
Doesn't Take a Hero gives away few clues.
For now, the question is academic, at least if the hero of Desert Storm is
to be taken at his word. 'I don't want to be president' he has said
repeatedly. 'I did Washington five times. Each time I liked it less.' But
Schwarzkopf has not said he will not run, not in so many words. He has also
hinted, with uncharacteristic coyness, that there are some public positions
he would accept. But he will not say which. Nice one, Norm.
It is tempting after reading General Schwarzkopf's memoirs, skilfully
ghosted by Peter Petre, to imagine that, were George Bush consigned to
oblivion and Bill Clinton prove unequal to the task of leading the US out of
recession and self-doubt, Schwarzkopf might be called on to resurrect the
American dream by one party or another, or conceivably both. There are
precedents.
Not that the book suggests somebody who hankers after high political office.
On the contrary, Schwarzkopf betrays a healthy contempt for politics and
politicians whom he appears to regard mostly as meddlesome fools. But the
race for the White House gives this book an added edge. Whatever else it may
be, the book is not a distinguished military history, nor does it shed new
light on the two great events in which he played a part - Vietnam and the
Gulf War.
Schwarzkopf's views on the American experience in Vietnam, where he served
twice with great distinction, are curiously blinkered. His account of his
two tours of duty provide a great read but no attempt is made to ask why
America lost or what drove the Vietnamese in the south to revolt, which is
surprising for someone whose feel for Arab sensibilities was later to prove
vital in cementing the coalition which defeated Saddam Hussein. Schwarzkopf
emerges as a doer, never a doubter.
'My view of the Vietcong never changed,' he writes 'I saw them as
opportunistic brigands who oppressed the peasants, stole their money and
crops and bullied them into cooperation.'
This is an intensely personal autobiography of a tough, astute and ambitious
soldier with a strong streak of independence and even romance about him.
Someone who does not buck the system but bends it almost to breaking-point
to get what he wants; a maverick insider; a political ingenue savvy enough
to cut a deal with the best of them.
As he works his way up the ladder to four-star general Schwarzkopf provides
a fascinating insider's account of the Buggins' turn system of promotion in
the US army. He hates patronage but knows how to exploit it when he needs
to.
His childhood seems to have prepared him well for the loneliness of high
command. He travelled with his father, who was also a high-ranking soldier,
and learnt to deal with the pain and humiliation of his mother's alcoholism
with private anger and public dignity. He emerges as a thoroughly decent man
who has made his way with an attractive blend of homespun wisdom, steely
toughness and a certain charm.
There is a wonderfully evocative passage in which he describes how, in 1946,
his father was sent to help the Shah of Iran consolidate his hold on power.
The young Schwarzkopf slept under open skies on the roof of their villa in
Tehran, waking at dawn to the chants of the muezzin chanting the call to
prayer, punctuated by the sound of camel caravans and rug merchants tramping
past their door.
The book, as one would expect, provides a taut insider's account of what
went on behind the scenes in the preparation and execution of the campaign
to kick the Iraqis out of Kuwait. It is remarkably indiscreet and detailed
in places. Schwarzkopf, or his minions, must have been taking so many notes
of the great man's every exchange that it is surprising they ever got round
to winning the war.
While Schwarzkopf may not have thought too deeply about the political
meaning of the Vietnam experience, he certainly learnt the military lessons
of that humiliating defeat and, on a smaller scale, the botched invasion of
Grenada in 1983 in which he played a hitherto unrevealed but crucial role.
It was this: if American lives were to be risked in battle there should be
no corner-cutting. There would have to be enough troops and weapons to the
do the job with the minimum casualties. Nothing but the best for his boys.
His testy exchange with his boss General Colin Powell on February 20 as
pressure for an early start to the land war grew from a gung-ho political
establishment in Washington DC, and the weather forecast in the Gulf looked
inauspicious, gives the flavour.
Powell: 'We need to get on with this.'
Schwarzkopf, pleading more time to prepare: 'I'm not trying to be a
smart-ass . . . but what if we take lots of casualties?'
Powell: 'Don't patronize me with talk of human lives'
The book is at it strongest when Schwarzkopf is in action and here it sets a
rollicking pace: how, under enemy fire in Vietnam, he saves a black GI who
had stepped on a mine; how he knocks one of the US army's worst battalions
into shape; how he cajoles and flatters his insecure and ultra-sensitive
Islamic Saudi hosts into tolerating an infidel army complete with female GIs
and ghetto-blasters on holy soil.
It's all good stuff as far as it goes. An appropriate testament to a genuine
American hero. Whether it turns out to be his calling card for the White
House as a Republican or a Democrat, remains to be seen.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Books: Hitler's poodle fails to bark / Review of a new
biography of the Fuhrer's foreign minister, Ribbentrop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   by ZARA STEINER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RIBBENTROP by Michael Bloch Bantam Press Pounds 20, 528 pages
RIBBENTROP's ascent to power was amazingly swift for a successful importer
of foreign wines who patronised the arts and counted Jews among his best
customers and closest friends. Prodded by his domineering, ambitious and
much loved wife, he joined the Nazi Party in May 1932 and was almost
immediately recruited for a diplomatic career for which he had neither the
intelligence nor the social graces needed for success.
Ribbentrop was mocked by professionals, intrigued against by the Nazi
leaders with whom he constantly quarrelled and was disliked by subordinates
whom he bullied in the best Hitler-like manner. His pomposities and
formalities made him a heaven-sent subject for the cartoonist David Low.
Ribbentrop's inefficiencies as well as his rudeness, a disguise for a hardly
concealed sense of inferiority, estranged him from the senior officials at
the foreign ministry.
Apart from Wolfgang Michalka's authoritative Ribbentrop und die Deutsche
Weltpolitik, 1933-1940 (Munich, 1980), there are no full-scale studies of
Ribbentrop's life. Michael Bloch, known for his books on the Duke of
Windsor's wartime activities in which Ribbentrop played an important part,
has set out to fill this void using an array of printed sources and memoir
material. There are rumours of an unexplored collection of Ribbentrop
private papers but it would be surprising if Bloch's portrait would need
serious retouching. Readers will find scattered nuggets, including a
fascinating photograph of Ribbentrop and Hitler at the Berghof. There are
some trivial and comic inclusions but also others such as Ribbentrop's part
in the 1943 Soviet-German peace talks of more serious interest.
Bloch leaves us in no doubt that Ribbentrop's value to Hitler lay in his
condition of servitude. The defendant was being honest when he told the
judges at Nuremburg that he only reported to Hitler who in turn gave him his
orders. Even when pursuing ideas of his own, Ribbentrop would seek the
Fuhrer's assent, reversing course at the very first sign of disapproval.
Unwilling to take in the reality of the Final Solution, Ribbentrop left the
foreign ministry's dirty work in the hands of Martin Luther, a protege of
both Ribbentrops. But a personal rebuke from Hitler immediately ended the
foreign minister's period of 'wilful ignorance.' His instructions for the
rapid evacuation of foreign Jews provided the evidence for one of the
Nuremburg charges made against him. How different life would have been for
Ribbentrop had he never fallen under Hitler's spell.
Bloch argues that despite his servility, Ribbentrop could and did influence
Hitler's policies. His extreme anglophobia, the product of failure in
London, and his assurances that Britain would not fight fed Hitler's
misconceptions in the summer of 1939. Ribbentrop's mania for alliances found
fruition in the short-lived Nazi-Soviet pact and in the much sought but much
delayed Tripartite Pact of 1940. The foreign minister used his control over
the flow of information to protect the Fuhrer from unpleasant truths
compounding the latter's errors of judgment. Ribbentrop's powers of
persuasion were always limited by the fear of upsetting his leader. This
explains, for instance, why he did not press for a Russo-German truce after
Kursk. Even in the dock at Nuremburg, Ribbentrop's faith in Hitler's
judgment remained unshaken.
There is really little new to be said about Ribbentrop's role in the Nazi
debacle or about his inadequacies as Hitler's foreign minister. But the
limitations of this biography have more to do with its subject than with its
author who writes with considerable verve and a sharp eye for the memorable
anecdote and quotation. Bloch has tried, and with some measure of success,
to breathe new life into this wooden figure. It is Ribbentrop who resists
resuscitation.

RED MARS by Kim Stanley Robinson HarperCollins Pounds 14.99, 501 pages
NO shimmering light in the night sky has exercised the human imagination so
tirelessly as Mars. Al-Qahira, Ares, Harmakhis, Mangala, Nirgala, Aquakuh,
Huo Hsing are a few of the haunting names by which the red planet has been
known.
Only since the Mariner probes and the Viking lander missions of 1976,
however, has it been possible to speak accurately about the planet's surface
and geography. In a tiny but significant way, humankind has even begun to
modify the surface of Mars, as the photos of shallow trenches in the red
dust scooped out by the Viking landers demonstrate.
Now Kim Stanley Robinson has written the first novel about the prospective
colonisation of the crimson planet. Mars itself, in its many moods, is the
central character in this curiously absorbing book. If Mars is ever
colonised, then it will surely happen very like this. The novel's chronology
sets the first manned mission as early as 2020.
The sheer weight of detail concerning the geography, geology and climatology
of Mars which the author has assimilated is impressive, and the efforts of
the colonists to transform the planet's poisonous carbon dioxide atmosphere
and harsh extremes of temperature into an environment fitted to human life
are fascinating because utterly plausible.
Mars has, for instance, a canyon system as extensive as the entire US,
cliffs 20,000 ft high, and volcanoes three times as tall as Everest. The
planet's Great Escarpment is marred by old craters, overrun by lava, broken
into hummocks and karsts and ridges, channels caused by giant floods from
underground seas which burst onto the surface and flowed at rates ten
thousand times that of the Mississippi.
Kim Stanley Robinson has said that solitary travelling in wilderness
territory provided the inspiration for many of the descriptive landscape
scenes of this work, and it shows. Red Mars, the first volume of a planned
trilogy, is the product of a imaginative love affair between the author and
the Earth's nearest planetary neighbour.

THE GREAT ELEPHANT CHASE by Gillian Cross Oxford University Press Pounds
8.95, 193 pages
IN SPITE of the fact that there will be more than 6,000 new children's books
published in the UK this year, the majority of the authors who write for
this audience move about the world incognito. Newspapers seldom single out
their books for attention; and the winners of even the most prestigious
awards for children's literature are consistently absent from our television
screens.
Consider the case of Gillian Cross, whose last novel Wolf, a sparely written
and compelling psychological thriller for children of 10 and above, was the
winner of last year's Carnegie Medal, the most important literary prize for
children's books. It was the sixth time that one of her books had been on
the short list (of six a la Booker). This suggests that her work is of an
unusually high quality; and yet how many people have even heard of her?
The psychological thriller has been her hallmark - earlier books have
included Roscoe's Leap (1987) and A Map of Nowhere (1988); but she has also
written very successfully in other areas too. Chartbreak (1986) was a
contemporary love story, set in the world of a punk rock band; The Demon
Headmaster (1982) had troubling political overtones.
Her new novel, The Great Elephant Chase, is set in America in the middle of
the 19th century, and it is a pastiche of sorts, reminiscent of Twain and
Melville, a spirited, hectic tale full of frontier spirit and brisk, telling
detail.
The showman Michael Keenan has devised a sure-fire way of making money fast.
With the help of an Indian elephant, itself something of a marvel in that
part of the world, he is making his way west through the small towns of
Pennsylvania, selling bottles of a 'miracle-working tincture' to incredulous
crowds who gather to gawp at his marvellous beast. The trick is simple:
Keenan plants a 'crippled girl' in the crowd (in fact, it is his own healthy
daughter, Cissie); the elephant seizes her in its trunk to the accompaniment
of gasps of horror and amazement, and upends her in the air. When she lands,
she is in a faint - or perhaps even dead. Then Keenan steps up with a
spoonful of his miraculous cure - and the girl is restored to life. The
whole crowd seethes around him, desperate to buy.
Unfortunately for Keenan, he is being pursued by the sinister Hannibal
Jackson who, suspecting trickery threatens blackmail - unless Keenan will
agree to sell the animal. Keenan refuses, of course, and escapes by night.
Then disaster strikes. Keenan and Cissie's sister are killed on the
railroad; Cissie and the elephant survive. Jackson then re-appears, claiming
that Keenan had signed a paper before his death, selling him the beast.
Cissie refuses to accept that her father would do such a thing, and she
escapes - with Jackson and his fiance in hot pursuit. From this point on,
the book turns into a breathless chase west - by land and river; flatboat,
coal barge and paddle steamer.
Cissie travels with Tad, a young orphan whom her father had hired as an
elephant boy, and the twosome sweat it out together on the river like Tom
and Huck before him. And throughout the whole of their long, wearying
journey, Cissie, ever optimistic, cherishes the childish, magical hope of
reaching the woman she writes to every day, the mysterious Ketty who lives
somewhere way out west in Nebraska, in a white frame house with a cool,
green garden.
Daniel Defoe would have found much to admire in this book - the author's
careful attention to the fascinating practicalities of survival, for
example; and even the way in which the map that serves as the book's
frontispiece enables us to trace with our finger the fleeing travellers'
long and convoluted journey all the way from the imaginary town of Markle in
Pennsylvania to Pittsburgh; and from there down the Ohio river and the
Mississippi and the Missouri.
The provision of a map is an appetite-whetting device, of course; and it is
usually, as in this case, some kind of guarantee that the author has done
her homework. And the journey itself, while an arduous physical one, is also
a trek from childhood to maturity; from ignorance to self-knowledge. Gillian
Cross is an optimist at heart; but it is an optimism purged in the fires of
endeavour.

THE SECRET HISTORY by Donna Tartt Viking Pounds 15.99 (Pounds 9.99,pbk)
525pp
DONNA Tartt's first novel, The Secret History, is a frustrating, potentially
brilliant book whose every strength seems to be balanced by a flaw.
Throughout this dauntingly long work, wit is tempered by cloying pretension,
while narrative sweep is constantly caught up on verbosity. The result is a
novel that is hard to put down, but harder still to pick up once you do.
The story takes place on the Vermont campus of mythical Hampden College. The
narrator, Richard Papen, arrives from the wastelands of suburban California,
eager to study Classics. He soon finds himself part of an elite group of
eccentric students overseen by a puckish professor, Julian Morrow. The head
boy, Henry Winter, is an enigmatic, melancholy genius who translates Milton
into Latin as a pastime. Also in the group are the effete Francis Abernathy,
as well as Camilla and Charles Macaulay, twins who Richard soon suspects
might be maintaining their prenatal intimacy in bed. Finally, there is Bunny
Corcoran, a big, shambolic preppie who seems oddly out of place in this dead
poet's society.
Despite the glittering facade, everything is not as it seems with this
seemingly perfect squad of privileged young scholars. They have in fact been
up to some very nasty extra-curricular activities in the Vermont woods,
trying to recreate the Dionysian bacchanals they have studied. In the course
of their frenzy a heinous crime is committed, leading to all manner of
friction among them until, finally, one of their number is murdered by the
rest.
Despite a turgid first 100 pages, The Secret History soon develops an
undeniable momentum, though not of the sort one would expect - from the
opening line we know who the victim is to be. The novel's suspense stems
instead from figuring out why he gets it and then watching as guilt and
remorse set to work upon the survivors. Tartt gambles boldly by giving us
her story's climax up front - the result could have easily been a
200,000-word denouement. Instead, the book's drama comes from its
comprehensive depiction of corruption, followed by a complex study of the
dynamics of remorse. The more superficial question of whodunit is replaced
by the more profound one of why.
Unfortunately, the answer Tartt provides is marred by a fundamental
silliness. Bacchanals in the Vermont woods? Is she serious? If the author
believes she needs such a basis for her story, she would have been far wiser
to find its modern equivalent than in having her characters running around
in togas, trying to invoke the spirit of a Greek deity before hopping into
their BMWs and heading back to the dorm. It makes them seem preposterous and
undermines the otherwise powerful drama that ensues.
Tartt's book is also subverted by pretension and overwriting. Perhaps this
could be excused because her narrator is a callow, bookish undergraduate,
but 500 of lines like 'I thought (erroneously) that he dressed like Alfred
Douglas, or the Comte de Montesquiou' tend to get under the skin.
Erroneously? Then why mention it? To send us scurrying in admiration for our
biographical dictionaries? There is also an annoying tendency to pepper the
narrative with Greek and Latin phrases (which are dutifully translated for
us). It is a shame, because in other places Tartt writes like a peach,
especially in the latter stages of the book, where the nightmare of
inescapable remorse takes over Richard's life.
Most first novels are flawed and after a while the reviewer learns to take
these mistakes in stride. For two reasons, this is hard to do with The
Secret History. First, the flaws come from authorial condescension rather
than inexperience and uncertainty. Nobody likes to be talked down to,
especially by a 28 year old who has just sold her film rights for a half
million bucks. Second, and worse, the book's flaws work directly against its
strengths, robbing such an impressive talent of its sting. Let's hope next
time Tartt does not feel she has to try so hard to show us what a clever
girl she is. After all, the cleverest thing a writer can do is make the
enthralled reader forget she is there.

<TEXT>
WHERE IS Europe going? I spent a fascinating few days last week in Paris at
the congress of the European Federation of Financial Analysts' Societies, a
meeting originally planned to focus upon the integration of Europe's capital
markets but condemned in the event to rake over the half-dismantled debris
of the exchange rate mechanism.
Yet the view from Paris is very different to that from London. Per
Westerberg, the Swedish minister of industry and commerce, gave an
impressive exposition of the determination of a small non-EC country (but
aspiring member) to stay with the DM at any price and to retain
international credibility. 'Our currency must be defended by any means
necessary,' he said, not quite the attitude of our own Norman Lamont.
Elsewhere the French finance minister Michel Sapin was cocky and
triumphalist as he declared final victory in the battle of the franc. But
French companies, it should be said, were becoming quite apprehensive at the
thought of what the victory might cost them.
It is a short five months since the dream of convergence was unexpectedly
shattered by the Danish referendum result. Suddenly the politicians and the
financial markets were forced to look at the facts, and it was clear that
too many EC member states were not converging at all. Now the UK and Italy
are out in the cold and Spain hangs in the ERM only with the aid of a
devaluation, exchange controls and 15 per cent interest rates.
You can argue that the mid-September crisis was just the first step towards
a more or less complete breakdown of the ERM. Once the true consequences of
over-valuation of the DM become clear even France will be forced to stand
aside, leaving only a few small countries bordering Germany - and more or
less integrated into its economy - linked to the DM. The historical parallel
would be with the 1930s when France obstinately stayed on the gold standard
until 1936 but suffered grievous economic damage as a consequence.
A quite different interpretation, however, is that the ERM is actually much
stronger for having got rid of its weaker participants. Convergence among
the remaining nine members may now proceed much more rapidly, and effective
monetary union could be attained even more quickly than has been suggested
by the Maastricht timetable. The Bundesbank, on this line of reasoning, will
now be much more responsive to the needs of Germany's remaining partners
than it ever was to Italy and the UK which, with some justification, it
placed in the second rank.
However, the ability of Spain, Portugal and Ireland to stay the course must
be in doubt. Moreover the populations of the UK, Italy and Spain together
add up to nearly half the EC's 340m total. If Germany, France and the rest
go on to the monetary fast track there would be a clear risk of splitting
the EC in half, a division that would be accentuated if would-be members
like Sweden, Switzerland and Austria were subsequently admitted, helped by
their close-to-impeccable monetary credentials.
The prospects for the UK rejoining the ERM look pretty slim, and the
nationalists in the Commons (and the Lords) are enjoying a spell of
intoxicating publicity for their anti-Continental prejudices. After all,
life does not seem so uncomfortable outside the ERM club. What the Treasury
said only a few months ago was impossible has happened: interest rates (the
short-term kind, anyway) have been reduced outside the mechanism, and are
lower than in Germany. People have not yet been hit by higher prices and
higher taxes.
Nevertheless, I think that the UK will eventually rejoin the ERM for the
same reason that we originally entered in 1990, that life had become too
difficult outside. The big difference will be that whereas last time we
joined almost as a favour to the rest of Europe and at an exchange rate
which we barely bothered to notify, let alone justify, to the Bundesbank,
next time we shall enter on our knees and humbly accepting a string of
conditions. It is unlikely to happen in less than four years, and will
depend upon a substantial fall in German short-term interest rates, but
sometimes events can move faster than you expect. Suppose that there is a
further big fall in the value of sterling, and interest rates have to go up
sharply to prevent a collapse of confidence? It might be necessary to look
around for external support. Remember that after sterling was floated in
1972 it took just four years of economic mismanagement to take us to the
door of the IMF.
For the time being, unlike Italy, which is in a still worse economic plight,
the UK has been able to cut short-term interest rates. But we cannot reduce
long-term rates, which remain higher - in some cases substantially so - than
in Germany, the US or Japan. There is the risk of a public sector funding
crisis next year which foreigners will not be at all keen to assist in
solving; there are few natural overseas holders of sterling any more, now
that it carries no ERM badge of quality. City estimates of 1993-94's public
sector borrowing requirement are creeping up past Pounds 50bn, and that is
without reckoning the cost of the industrial or financial bailouts which are
becoming all too likely.
For the international financial analysts the UK has now become peripheral.
Global investors like to simplify their task by dividing the world into
blocs, and countries which stand outside them may have to bear a risk
premium. In the case of Italy this is already large, and Italian government
securities are coming to be regarded as junk bonds.
Britain is a long way further up the creditworthiness league table, but
analysts in Paris, Frankfurt and Zurich will note that Norman Lamont is
'rebalancing' policy away from the control of inflation and towards growth.
They will understand what that means in any language.

FT  31 OCT 92 / John Major and the recurring Tory nightmare: Philip Stephens
assesses the mutterings of backbench rebellion in the members' lobby at
Westminster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS 2.30 pm in the members' lobby of the House of Commons, the marbled
inner sanctum at Westminster where MPs and ministers gather on the threshold
of the debating chamber.
Sprawled on a green leather bench just outside the office of Richard Ryder,
the government chief whip, four of the Tory party's most ardent
Euro-sceptics are plotting against John Major. They are oblivious of the
steady stream of colleagues visiting the man charged with delivering the
votes of the Conservative party to its prime minister. Instead they are
noisily confident that come next Wednesday's crucial vote on the Maastricht
treaty, Ryder will fail and Major will be defeated.
Just a few paces away a loyalist knight from the shires is admonishing a new
boy - one of the 61 Tory MPs who first entered parliament after the April
general election - about the 'enemy within'. The 'venomous Thatcherites'
opposing Major, he declares gravely, are out to destroy the government and
the party. They must be beaten, once and for all.
A glance over their shoulders adds a third dimension to the surreal tableau.
Another Tory knight is negotiating with a television reporter over an
appearance on the evening news bulletins. This one, a member of the
executive of the powerful 1922 committee of backbenchers, is ready to offer
a soundbite telling the prime minister to listen more to his backbenchers.
The deal is struck.
As the bell rings to announce the daily prayer session with which MPs start
each day's political mud-slinging, a cabinet minister scurries by. He dodges
questions from the political reporters charting the latest twist in the
government's struggle with its own supporters. An anxious countenance
provides its own answer. A Tory Parliamentary Private Secretary, one of the
unpaid bag-carriers on the first rung of the ministerial ladder, breaks off
a conversation to head for the chamber: 'I'm going in. I want to pray. I
think it might help'.
He will not be alone on his knees during the next few days. Major has turned
next week's debate on the Maastricht treaty into an issue of confidence in
his premiership. A defeat at 10 o'clock on Wednesday evening would fulfil
his worst nightmare, stripping him of what remains of his clothing of
authority. He might well resign, forcing the second Tory leadership battle
in as many years. Like that of Margaret Thatcher, the defeat would not be at
the hands of the opposition, but at those of his own supporters. The
proximate cause - Britain's place in Europe - would be identical, but with a
bizarre twist. In 1990 the party would not be led by a Europhobe. Now it
would be deciding to reject her successor's pragmatic Europeanism.
The prime minister is gambling that the fever will abate. By the time the
Commons division bell sounds, the party will have come to its collective
senses. It will recoil from a course which would threaten an end to the
longest period in government since Lord Liverpool's premiership 180 years
ago.
They may well be right. The noisy cheers which greeted Major when he issued
a personal appeal to the backbenchers on Thursday night suggests that
loyalty still finds a place in Tory party politics.
Thatcher's demise was an occasional exception. More frequently the noise and
smoke of the party's private wars have left the antagonists bloodied but
still standing on the battlefield. The modern Conservative party has learnt
that the price of being divided is opposition. It is more than 70 years
since the struggles over Imperial Preference kept the Tories out of office
for a generation. It is 150 years since the repeal of the Corn Laws split
irrevocably the party then being shaped by Sir Robert Peel.
Lord Whitelaw, the elder statesman who steered Thatcher away from many a
disaster during her first years in Downing Street, is convinced the party
can be held together. He blames the present malaise above all on the
economic recession. Sterling's enforced departure from the European Exchange
Rate Mechanism was a significant national defeat. The plan for large-scale
closures in the coal industry during the recession was a bad mistake. But
with sensitive handling of his supporters Major can retrieve it. 'He needs
now to calmly and quietly assert his authority . . . But let us never forget
that it was this prime minister who won the election for us'.
Part of the problem is simply the arithmetic. Large Tory majorities during
most of the 1980s allowed the luxury of occasional rebellions. They
accommodated the irreconcilable anti-Europeans who have never accepted
Britain's entry into the European Community; and the dozen or so
bloody-minded MPs who never need an excuse to rebel. Major has a majority of
just 21. So as Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman puts it, Tory MPs must
adjust: 'It isn't the case any more that they can vote as they like just as
a demonstration. It is very much for real.'
The new intake - most of them professional rather than part-time politicians
 -has still to adjust to the reality of life on the backbenches. They find
it hard to accept they have no executive powers, that they will have to wait
years rather than months to secure the most junior post in the government.
Over time they should settle down.
But Major meanwhile has to live with that arithmetic. A batch of headlines
on Thursday morning declaring him the victor in the battle over Europe may
not be enough. The Autumn Statement next month will bring further harsh
decisions. The economic recovery remains a distant prospect. The past few
weeks have left the Conservatives and the government in sickly shape. It
will take more than a single vote to restore them to health. Major's enemies
are not alone in drawing parallels between the ERM defeat and the crippling
blow which the Suez debacle delivered to Sir Anthony Eden's government in
1956. As Lady Thatcher returns to haunt her successor they recall that after
Suez Eden could never escape from the shadow of Winston Churchill.
The change in the mood at Westminster in six short months is breath-taking.
In April Major had defied the pundits, the opinion polls and the odds to
deliver a fourth election victory. He had confirmed his personal authority
over the party.
Now the Conservatives look like a party that has lost its way, lacking
ideological purpose, unsure of its will to sustain its prime minister in
office, fractious and rebellious. Britain faces the deepest political crisis
since the winter of discontent in 1978. But the question being asked in the
corridors of power is not whether the country, but whether the Conservative
party is governable.
Lady Thatcher scents blood. This week she took a break from the lucrative
international lecture circuit to encourage the rebels from her oak-panelled
office in the House of Lords. Her friends report she now regards her chosen
successor as a 'footnote in history'.
The Tory malcontents over Europe - the two dozen or so MPs who would belong
more properly to an English National Party - have been joined by the
disenchanted and dispossessed on the right of the party in challenging the
prime minister's authority. Parliamentary motions designed to undercut
Major's authority have attracted 60 or 70 signatures. The voice of the loyal
silent majority has been drowned by the critics. Many have exulted in the
national and personal defeat inflicted by sterling's ignominious retreat
from the ERM.
Fresh from its victories in driving David Mellor from the cabinet, in
obliging Major to put the issue of ERM re-entry firmly on the backburners,
and in forcing the U-turn over the coal industry, the executive of the 1922
has begun to behave like an alternative government.
Led by Sir Marcus Fox, a garrulous and straight-talking Yorkshireman with a
weakness for the media, the executive numbers 12 knights and one dame among
its 18-strong membership. In a careful coup last May the executive was
captured by the right. The constitution of 'The 22' is unequivocal as to its
role: 'To render every assistance to the government and party whips in their
efforts to carry on the affairs of the nation upon the sound basis of
Conservative principles'. However, its behaviour recently has drawn more
inspiration from its antecedents 70 years ago, when it was born of a
successful rebellion against Austen Chamberlain's coalition with the Liberal
Lloyd George.
Now Sir Rhodes Boyson, the populist MP for Brent North and one of those in
the forefront of the rebellion over pit closures, is unapologetic about the
executive's outspokeness. Boyson was elected to parliament in 1974. He
insists that the Whitehall cocoon has left Major's government out of touch
with the mood in the country - above all with the despair caused by the
'disastrous economic depression.'
'There is a greater divide between the government and its backbenchers than
I have ever seen'. Ministers 'had better listen to their backbenchers.'
The anonymity guaranteed by conversations in the members' lobby encourages a
right wing minister to offer a blunter assessment: 'Major bears full
responsibility for this crisis. If he falls it will be no one's fault but
his own'.
Others on the right speak of betrayal, a sense that during the leadership
election two years ago Major offered a false prospectus. They thought, in
Margaret Thatcher's phrase, the prime minister was 'One of Us'. He turned
out to be One of Them, more comfortable in the company of Chris Patten or
Kenneth Clarke than the likes of Thatcher or Norman Tebbit.
There is nothing new in a dislocation between a Tory cabinet and its foot
soldiers at Westminster. In government, the party has always been divided
into three distinct segments: the activists in the country, their
representatives at Westminster, and their representatives in Whitehall's
ministerial offices. The role of the cabinet frequently is to tame the
wilder instincts of the rest of the party.
But Major's opponents believe the gap had grown too wide. Many of the new
boys (and girls) are instinctive Thatcherites, true believers. In the words
of the left-wing, and semi-detached, MP for Aldershot, Julian Critchley, the
'loyal, dull and deferential' Tory party of old has been replaced by 'the
floor of the party conference brought inland and mustered at Westminster'.
The red faces on the platform during the outbursts of populist nationalism
at the Brighton conference earlier this month underlined the cabinet's
discomfort.
There is also a problem of ideology. The certainties of the 1980s - the
reflex confidence in markets, in privatisation, in liberalisation - have
been shattered by the harsh realities of the recession. But a Conservative
party reborn during the late 1970s as a party of ideas is finding it hard to
revert to its once traditional role as 'the stupid party'.
Major's best hope now is that the party retains enough good sense to pull
back from the brink. There are signs this weekend that the loyalist and pro
European majority is at last raising its voice. The Maastricht rebels show
signs of crumbling. Another interest rate cut is on the horizon. Economic
recovery would bind many of the party's wounds. The prime minister, however,
desperately needs a breathing space.
On the day he was elected leader two years ago a cabinet colleague described
Major as 'a symbol of our exhaustion'. He may yet be proved right - not so
much about Major, but about his party.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Markets: M and S sticks to its formula - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE late, great Sam Walton was asked how he built Wal-Mart from one
store in Bentonville, Arkansas, into the biggest retailer in the world he
often replied by recounting how he sold satin ladies' panties in the 1950s.
'I found that by pricing the item at Dollars 1 I could sell three times more
of it than by pricing it at Dollars 1.20. I might make only half the profit
per item, but because I was selling three times as many, the overall profit
was much greater,' he recalled in his autobiography.
That simple maxim was one of the prime reasons that Wal-Mart's sales grew in
five decades from next-to-nothing to Dollars 44bn (greater than the gross
domestic product of New Zealand). But it is a retailing truth practised - if
less spectacularly - by many other companies around the world.
This week, Marks and Spencer, the most notable exponent of the art in the
UK, proved that the formula still works even in the depths of a severe
recession which has left almost every other retailer reeling.
Interim pre-tax profits were a sparkling 20 per cent higher at Pounds
257.1m. Even when the effects of the previous year's exceptional charge were
stripped out, the company still showed an 11 per cent gain.
Because of the vast volume of goods that M and S buys across a relatively
narrow range, the company is able to operate on a very low gross margin of
about 34 per cent ensuring that its clothes are competitively priced.
But, because of exceptionally low operating costs, which stem from its
Pounds 2bn freehold property base and its efficiency, it is also able to
retain a high proportion of that profit at the net level.
So, for example, if M and S sold a pair of pants for Pounds 1 it would take
34p in gross profit and, after paying all staff and occupancy costs, would
keep almost 12p to reinvest in the business and distribute to shareholders.
When you multiply that sum by a factor of several million it is easy to see
why M and S single-handedly accounts for about 25 per cent of all the
earnings generated by the 34 biggest publicly-quoted stores companies in the
UK (excluding food retailers), and why its shares account for 30 per cent of
that group's total market capitalisation.
M and S clearly benefits from its colossal size relative to its competitors
in the clothing industry. Its 18 per cent market share is almost twice that
of its nearest rival, Burton Group.
A similar profit equation also holds true - although to a lesser extent - on
the foods side of M and S's business, which accounts for 40 per cent of
sales. Although it is a small player compared with J. Sainsbury and Tesco, M
and S sells very high volumes of very few lines.
But, although sheer size gives M and S tremendous economies of scale, it
also creates several strategic challenges: the most obvious being how does
it keep the growth momentum going?
Although M and S's latest results were undeniably impressive, its City
critics gathered ammunition from the fact that its UK food and clothes sales
were virtually flat while group sales - depressed by retrenchment in Canada
 -fell by 0.3 per cent to Pounds 2.64bn.
The recession is clearly the central factor, but the bears argue that in the
UK, M and S is close to saturation point. Its diversification into North
America has proved a bitter and costly disappointment. And while its organic
expansion into mainland Europe is progressing well it will still be several
years before it contributes a significant share of group profits.
Such concerns fuelled a 6 per cent fall in M and S's share price this week
to 322p as it began to lose some of its lofty premium to the market. When
the long-awaited consumer resurgence eventually arrives, the company's
shares may again suffer as investors move out of classic defensive stocks
into more cyclical retailing plays.
But M and S has confounded such doubters in the past and Sir Richard
Greenbury, the company's pugnacious chairman, delights in the challenge of
doing so again. Many people have regretted betting against the mighty M and
S.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Markets: Traders indulge in a little trick or treating -
Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AIR on Wall Street was thick with political rumours this week as stock
market traders indulged in a bit of early Hallowe'en 'trick or treating'.
They included rumours that President Bush had overtaken Governor Clinton in
the polls (he had not, but the gap had narrowed), that more damaging
evidence about Clinton's subversive anti-war activities in the 1960s would
be released (it was not), and that new, nastier revelations about the
Democratic candidate's past love-life were being prepared by the tabloids
(they were not, at least, not up to yesterday).
Stock markets are always vulnerable to political speculation during an
election campaign, never more so than in the final few days.
This year's election, however, has been particularly difficult for investors
to call. Apart from an especially fickle electorate, much of the blame for
this lies with Ross Perot. The Texan billionaire's influence on the race has
been almost impossible to track. His ratings rise after each debate
appearance and every 'teacher-knows-best' television commercial, only to
fall sharply after every paranoid complaint about armed attacks on his
house, computer-doctored photographs and Republican dirty tricks.
The markets are not worried that Perot will win, but they are worried about
the uncertainty his up-and-down candidacy brings to the race. Having
gradually become accustomed to the prospect of a President Clinton - and
even come to rather like the idea - equity investors are having to grapple
with the thought that a last-minute desertion of Perot supporters to the
Republican camp could let President Bush in through the back door.
This might explain why the stock markets did not greet the reports on
Wednesday and Thursday that Bush was rallying in the polls with much
enthusiasm. In normal circumstances, a sharp improvement in an incumbent
Republican president's standing in the polls would be a cause for
celebration.
But this is not a normal year. A Clinton victory was almost fully priced
into stocks about two weeks ago, and the market was poised to celebrate a
Democratic win. Bush's revival has threatened to upset those carefully laid
plans. The pharmaceutical stocks that institutions sold, on expectations
that a President Clinton would introduce drug price controls, may have to be
bought back. Construction, heavy equipment and transportation stocks, bought
in hopes of big increases in the country's infrastructure spending, may have
to be sold.
Judging by the erratic performance of stocks in the latter half of the week,
some investors were doing just that, frantically shuffling their assets in a
final attempt to position their portfolios for the big day.
The markets were not helped by the confusing array of economic statistics
released by this week. Ironically, the most politically-sensitive number -
the 2.7 per cent rise in third quarter gross domestic product - produced the
most subdued reaction.
While the President seized on the GDP report as evidence that the economy
was turning around, investors barely blinked. Few trusted the figures to be
accurate because GDP data is often substantially revised. Philip Braverman,
chief economist of DKB Securities in New York, and the king of the Wall
Street bears, may have summed it up best when he sneeringly labelled the
report 'pre-election statistical racketeering.'
The measure of the country's output may have looked good for the economy,
but most the week's other figures painted a bleaker picture. Consumer
confidence was down again, as were new home sales, durable goods orders and
manufacturing activity in the industrial Midwest, while jobless claims were
up.
The week's quarterly corporate earnings reports were also less than
promising. Chief among the disappointments were was car makers. General
Motors' Dollars 752.9m loss in the third quarter may have been slightly
smaller than expected, but turmoil in GM's top management - chairman Robert
Stempel was ousted on Monday and other managing directors are expected to go
soon - point to an uncertain future for the country's biggest manufacturing
company.
Ford may have a more stable management, but like GM it is suffering from a
serious decline in its European markets, which contributed to the Dollars
158.9m loss the company reported for the third quarter. The extent of Ford's
problems in Europe - where all the big economies are in trouble - surprised
the market, and led to a sharp downward revision in Wall Street's estimates
of fourth quarter earnings. As one analyst put it: 'It wasn't the size of
the loss. It was how they lost it.'
Monday    3244.11 + 36.47
Tuesday   3235.73 -  8.38
Wednesday 3251.40 + 15.67
Thursday  3246.27 -  5.13
Friday    3226.28 - 19.99

FT  31 OCT 92 / Markets: Private lives and public money - London Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'As Noel Coward might have said, cheap money is not as potent as cheap
music.'
Norman Lamont, Mansion House speech
The Scene is the terrace of a grand building in the City of London. It is
evening. Tall French windows at the back open on to a hall where - from the
sounds that drift out - a banquet is in progress. Elyot and Amanda enter
from the rear; he is wearing tails, she an evening dress.
Elyot: Something dreadfully depressing about bankers en masse, I always
think.
Amanda: Rather vulgar to be so openly unhappy.
Elyot: One should keep one's sorrows to oneself. Unless one can find someone
else to blame for them, of course.
Amanda: That's what I said to Norman only the other day. You're not jealous
that we're still chums, are you darling?
Elyot: Baffled, rather. No one else admits to being a friend of his, except
Robin. They bring out the worst in each other.
Amanda: Well, I think it's a match made in heaven. Just think of all those
billets-doux they'll be sending to each other now they've decided to come
clean with the world.
Elyot: Too common: 'Dearest heart, inflation's doing nicely, don't you
think?' 'Yes, sweetheart, whatever you say.'
Amanda: And: 'What a dear little forecast]'
They laugh conspiratorially. From the orchestra in the hall behind, we hear
the opening bars of 'M3 becomes you'. Amanda and Elyot hum along, before
breaking off and looking guiltily at each other.
Elyot: Extraordinary how potent cheap money is.
Amanda: Not as potent as cheap music.
They drift into each others' arms and start dancing slowly. The lights dim,
but we can still see them dancing in the gloom.
On the other side of the stage, the lights rise, revealing Greg, a
chisel-featured man in his mid-40s wearing a silk dressing gown, with the
word TOMKINS embroidered on the pocket. He is sitting in an armchair,
talking on the telephone.
Greg: Well, James, I think it's foolish of you to get so worked up about it.
Ranks Hovis McDougall - what a pretentious name] It's only a little bread
company, after all. (Pauses, to allow the other person to reply.)
Oh, don't be like this, don't be like this. You never used to do this when
we were together all those years ago. (Pause, during which Greg becomes
visibly irritated.)
No I don't think a one-for-two rights issue is 'going it'. Yes, I know our
shares fell 19 per cent on the news. Well, if that's the way you feel, I'm
not going to argue any more. But I'd advise you to think twice about upping
the stakes. My offer's quite breathtaking enough - and I'm young enough to
enjoy sorting out a bakery. (Pauses.)
Yes, of course you taught me everything I know. But really, you're far too
experienced and shrewd to be anything other than philosophical about it.
Now, if I may make a suggestion, isn't it time you thought again about ICI?
This week's results were simply ghastly, and I have a strange foreboding
about the plan to split the company. If I were you . . .
(His voice trails off as he disappears again into the gloom and the lights
pick up Elyot and Amanda on the other side of the stage. The music stops and
they drift apart, clapping soundlessly.)
Elyot: There's something wild about you tonight, something strained.
Amanda: Wild] Oh, Elyot, I've never felt less wild in my life. A little
strained, I grant you, but that's the current atmosphere; you can't expect
anything else. Devaluation is a very over-rated amusement.
Elyot: You say that because you had a ghastly experience before.
Amanda: There you go again.
Elyot: It couldn't fail to embitter you a little.
Amanda: The devaluation wasn't such a ghastly experience really; I hummed in
my bath for days. It was afterwards that was so awful.
Elyot: Well, I intend to make you forget about the economy altogether.
Amanda: How can I when I keep reading all those headlines? (She picks up an
imaginary newspaper and pretends to read from it.)
'British Steel to cut production 20 per cent. CBI reports further drop in
business confidence. Manufacturing Industry to cut 25,000 jobs a month for
rest of year. Lack of orders limits output.'
Elyot: Very flat, demand.
(A speech has started in the hall inside. We start to hear it more
distinctly, and Elyot and Amanda pause to listen to it.)
Speech: Economic confidence is an elusive quality; it cannot simply be drawn
like a rabbit from a conjurer's hat. I may be dressed as a magician, but I
am, in fact, just the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Amanda: Worse luck]
Speech: In judging whether we are on track to meet our inflation objective,
we will take account of the behaviour of the monetary aggregates, narrow and
broad; of asset prices, particularly house prices; other indicators of
inflationary pressure; and of course, the exchange rate. Prospective, not
current, inflation will be our guide.
We are moving from a largely rules-based system to one that is more
discretionary. The need for judgment is obviously greater outside the ERM,
which makes it all the more important that it is exercised in a consistent
way.
Elyot: Consistent? Or consistently political?
Amanda: Monetary policy is no use unless it is wise, and stern, and
undramatic. Something steady and stable, to smooth your nerves when you're
over-excited. Something tremendously Germanic, unflurried by scenes and
jealousies. That's what I want, what I've always wanted really. Oh my dear,
I do hope it's not going to be dull for you.
Elyot: After the last few weeks, dullness is all I crave. We'd better go
back in, or we'll miss the Governor's speech.
They leave through the windows. The orchestra strikes up 'Somewhere over the
Rainbow'.

portfolio will invest only in PIBS issued by the top ten societies. As of
October 21, the fund would have offered an 11.42 per cent gross yield
(yields will probably have changed since then). The minimum investment is
Pounds 20,000 and income will be paid quarterly. There is an initial charge
of 4 per cent but no further charges for four years. A Pounds 20 per quarter

FT  31 OCT 92 / Markets: Unit trust Peps take off - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unit trust personal equity plans seem to have taken off at last. In the
third quarter of this year, with new share issues flopping almost daily,
regular doses of dreadful economic news including Black Wednesday itself,
and end-of-year tax-planning still months away, sales of unit trust Peps
still managed to surge. Net inflow for the quarter was Pounds 319m, compared
with only Pounds 141m for the same quarter in 1991. The total value of unit
trust Pep funds under management is now Pounds 2.62bn, more than triple its
level of two years ago.
For September, the number of trusts continued its inexorable increase, from
1,423 to 1,428, while the number of unitholder accounts fell from 4.4m to
4.38m.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Markets: Hong Kong gets the jitters - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The extreme political uncertainty suddenly afflicting Hong Kong is reflected
in the performance of its stock market, which is measured by the Hang Seng
index. The index mounted a strong recovery at the beginning of this month
after a patch of volatility, as marketeers reacted favourable to a Sino-US
trade agreement. But since then some of the gains have been rubbed out as
sentiment was hit by the sparring match between new governor Chris Patten
and the Beijing authorities. The volatility seems likely to continue.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Markets: Sterling falters as base rate rumours grow - At a
glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Those who managed to switch from sterling into dollars in August, when the
rate was Dollars 2/Pounds , will have made a profit of more than 20 per cent
by now. The pound continued its decline this week as the markets speculated
that further interest rate cuts were on the way. Yesterday afternoon, the
pound had fallen to around Dollars 1.56. The bad news is that those planning
a US holiday will find that prices are no longer quite such a bargain.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Markets: In search of the perfect Pep - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK produced a breakthrough in the world of personal equity plans  -
the guaranteed Pep.
A lot of people have been disappointed with their Peps. Devised by the then
chancellor Nigel Lawson as a means of encouraging wider share ownership, the
first schemes were launched in 1987, just in time for the Crash and for five
years of meagre profits for equity investors.
In the early years of PEPs, unit and investment trust plans had very small
maxima, so most people were directed into 'managed' plans, in which
stockbrokers chose a limited number of shares. Performance has been mixed.
Unfortunately, many people leapt at the 'tax-free' element of Peps without
considering too carefully what those tax advantages might be. The exemption
from capital gains tax is handy for high net worth investors, but only
165,000 made enough profits to pay CGT in 1991.
The income tax exemption may also be not as good as it sounds. If a
portfolio yields a gross 4 per cent, a basic rate taxpayer saves just 1 per
cent in tax in the first year from the exemption. Even on a full annual
allowance of Pounds 6,000, that represents a gain of just Pounds 60.
That gain could be wiped out in one hour's share trading - and it can also
easily be swallowed up by charges. Small wonder that dissatisfaction is
widespread.
But the good news is that the industry seems to be trying to offer investors
better value. Over the last few months, a number of fund managers have cut
initial charges. One of the most recent was Murray Johnstone, which has an
initial charge of only 1 per cent on its unit trust PEPs, with no extra
fees; and an initial charge on its investment trust Pep of Pounds 35 plus
VAT.
Legal &amp; General joined the throng this week with a cut in its initial
charges to 3 per cent on a range of plans, with five profiles: recovery,
income, growth, worldwide and smaller companies. Each is based on an
individual unit trust except for the growth profile, split 50 per cent
between Legal &amp; General's equity and recovery unit trusts.
The annual charge on Legal &amp; General's trusts is 1.5 per cent, higher than
some other managers' plans. This could hamper performance over the long
term, which might cancel out the benefit of the lower initial charge.
How have the trusts performed? Over the one, two and three years to October
1, the Recovery fund has been in the top quartile (best 25 per cent) of the
UK growth sector. The smaller companies fund has been in the top half of its
sector over all the periods from one to seven years.
The equity income and worldwide growth funds performed less well: they have
below average performances over one, two, three, five and seven years. The
equity fund is in the middle with mostly above average performances, but a
poorer record over the last year.
But the more innovative element of Legal &amp; General's package is the
guarantee. This plan invests in the Recovery trust and Legal &amp; General
guarantees that, after five years, if your holding is not worth the amount
you originally invested, it will pay you the difference.
Most of the guaranteed products sold to date have had three flaws. The first
is inflexibility; the investor can be penalised if money is withdrawn before
the guaranteed date. The second concerns tax. In some cases, all the gain
has been subject to income tax; in other cases, higher rate taxpayers will
face a charge equal to the difference between the two tax bands (currently
15 per cent). Profits on conventional equity investments are subject only to
capital gains tax.
But possibly the biggest snag with a guaranteed product is lack of income.
Not only do most products pay no income at all during their lifetime, but
they usually aim to meet only the capital appreciation of the index. The
running yield on the market is currently around 4.7 per cent gross, which an
investor in the guaranteed product misses. That compounds into a net 19 per
cent or so over five years.
The Legal &amp; General plan gets round most of these problems. An investor can
sell his holding without penalty at any time, although the guarantee only
applies at the five year anniversary. All profit and income is tax free. And
the investor benefits from the yield on the trust, currently 3.71 per cent.
But life is never perfect. Most guaranteed products use futures or options
to track the index, so an investor is bound to get a performance close to
that of the market (minus the income). Legal &amp; General's Recovery trust
could perform badly and an investor's return could be well below average.
On the other hand, this is precisely the risk that investors take when they
invest in all other non-index tracking Peps.
The second snag is that the guaranteed Pep carries an initial charge of 5.5
per cent, rather than the 3 per cent on the rest of the range. There are no
other charges, however, and 5.5 per cent is not out of line with much of the
rest of the unit trust market.
We have not quite reached my ideal. That would be an index-tracking Pep with
no front end charges, a low annual charge and a guarantee. But, step by
step, we are getting there.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Interesting alternative to building
societies - Philip Coggan considers the advantages of bond funds which
invest in government securities and corporate debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST rates are falling rapidly and savers will inevitably be looking for
alternatives to the building society.
In the US, one option which is commonly favoured by investors is a bond
fund, which invests in government securities and corporate debt. Bond funds
make up a substantial proportion of the US mutual funds (the equivalent of
unit trusts) market.
In Britain, the market is much smaller. There is some Pounds 670m invested
in UK bond funds, out of a Pounds 50bn plus unit trust industry.
But unit trusts have high hopes that bond funds are a route to attracting
those investors who still have memories of the 1987 stock market crash and
are frightened of investing in equities.
Indeed, the graph shows that gilt and fixed interest funds have performed
rather better than their equity rivals over the short term. The average gilt
unit trust beat the average UK equity growth trust over the one, two, three
and five years to October 1. It is only over seven and 10 years that equity
funds pull ahead.
So what are the characteristics of a bond fund? A manager puts together a
portfolio of bonds with the aim of providing a steady income, and sometimes
modest capital growth. The investor hopes that the manager's skill in
handling this portfolio will justify the charges.
The prospect of charges may put off those investors who are aware that gilts
can be bought cheaply through the post office. But initial charges have been
falling across the sector, with Abtrust, for example, launching two funds
without any front-end charge in September. Fidelity, Guinness Flight and
Invesco MIM have all cut charges on bond funds this year.
A further potential disadvantage of gilt funds is that profits made by a
unitholder are subject to capital gains tax, unlike direct holdings in gilts
which are CGT-free. However, since few investors realise enough profits to
breach the annual Pounds 5,800 (after indexation) CGT allowance, this is not
a problem which will deter many.
Bond funds divide into three rough categories; those which invest in UK
gilts; those which invest in preference shares or other fixed rate
instruments; and international funds.
The process of choosing a fund thus involves several stages. First you have
to decide on the type of fund you want. Gilt funds are probably the most
straightforward, since there is no real credit risk - you can be certain the
government will repay its debts. If the fund is an onshore unit trust, then
the Investors Compensation Scheme would cover Pounds 48,000 of the first
Pounds 50,000 should the manager fail.
That is not to say that the bond fund cannot decline in price, either due to
managerial incompetence or perhaps a rise in interest rates.
With a preference or non-gilt fund, you also have a credit risk that the
company involved might fail; with an international fund, you have the
foreign exchange risk that other currencies might fall against the pound (it
may seem unlikely in the wake of recent events, but it could happen).
A further key factor is the yield. Do not be seduced into thinking that the
trust with the best yield is necessarily the best investment. The fund could
be investing in gilts with a high running yield, but which are trading well
above par value. So the high yield could be at the expense of capital loss
in the future.
The yields on onshore gilt unit trusts are shown each day in the Managed
Funds section of the Financial Times. For example, the Commercial Union
preference share fund (top of the UK sector over 10 years) yielded 8.67 per
cent gross on Friday morning; Abbey Capital Reserve (top of the sector over
five years) yielded a gross 7.26 per cent.
If you want a regular income, then you should pay careful attention to
dividend payment dates. Guinness Flight offers a portfolio which pays
monthly dividends, using three trusts - Premium Fixed Interest, EMU (which
invests in European bonds) and Global High Income. The average dividend
yield works out at 6.9 per cent, net of basic rate tax and expenses.
For non-taxpayers, offshore bond funds have the advantage that they can pay
income gross. The funds frequently invest in Eurobonds, which are not
subject to withholding tax. But Barlow Clowes illustrates the dangers of the
offshore route; investors may want to restrict themselves to managers with
household names, or in countries such as Bermuda, Guernsey, the Isle of Man
and Jersey which have investor compensation schemes.
Past performance is at best only a guide in fund selection and even then,
one should not assume that the top fund in the sector over one time period
will do as well in the future. Consistency is a very important factor. In
the UK gilt sector, the following funds have an above average performance
for the sector over one, two, three, five, seven and ten years; Aetna
Preference; Barclays Unicorn Gilt &amp; Fixed Interest; Invesco Mimstar Gilt &amp;
Fixed; Kleinwort Benson Gilt; Legal &amp; General Gilt and Swiss Life Fixed
Interest. Abbey Capital Reserve Account, Eagle Star UK Preference and
Whittingdale Short Dated Gilt have not been running for ten years, but all
have above average performances over all periods from one to seven years.
In the international fixed interest sector, few funds have been running for
more than five years. Abbey Worldwide Bond is top of the sector over five
and ten years and second over one and three years. S &amp; P International Bond
is top over seven years, and above average over all periods from one up to
ten years.
The final important factor to remember is charges. In the long run, a good
performance should outweigh higher charges but of course, future performance
is unknown whereas charges are clear at the outset. So, if two trusts have
similar performance records, the odds favour the one with the lower charges.
The bond fund sector is particularly active at the moment with two current
fund launches. Schroders is launching a global bond funds which will have an
estimated gross yield of 6.25 per cent. The initial charge is 3 per cent and
the annual charge is 1 per cent. There is a minimum investment of Pounds
1,000, or Pounds 25 a month for regular savers.
A new trust from Exeter Fund Managers, ExBal, will invest in a different
sector of the market - permanent interest bearing securities. These are
issued by building societies and tend to offer a higher yield than gilts,
although, of course, this reflects a higher risk. If a building society goes
bust, holders of PIBS would be behind depositors in the queue for repayment.
Exeter claims it can pick and choose the best PIBS, which will form around
60 per cent of the trust's portfolio. the remainder will be invested in zero
coupon preference shares of investment trusts, which will provide capital
growth and, via reinvestment, the prospect for a growing income.
ExBal will have an initial gross yield of 6.5 per cent. The initial charge
is 5.25 per cent and the annual charge 1 per cent. The minimum investment is
Pounds 750.
Meanwhile, Framlington has combined its trusts which previously were first
and third in the sector over three years. The combined trust is managed by
Alpha Global Fixed Income Managers, which says it manages the trust for
total return (a combination of income and capital growth).

FT  31 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Chasing the base rate / A look at
money market funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVERS who are reluctant to put their money into either gilts or equities,
but want better returns than a high interest building society account, can
turn to the money markets.
These are markets where banks and other financial institutions lend and
borrow money. Rates in these markets are normally very close to base rates
which means that funds based on the money markets can offer a very
competitive return.
There are a number of funds based on the money markets, some of which quote
interest rates every day in the second section of the Financial Times.
Some building society accounts may occasionally offer higher rates than
these funds. But building society savers can be attracted into an account by
high rates, only to suffer when rates are suddenly cut to much less
appealing levels.
A variety of funds offer money market rates:
Cash unit trusts
Your money buys units in the fund, and the value of the units (and thus your
holding) goes up in proportion.
There are more than 30 cash unit trusts but not all are targeted at the
private investor. For example, Govett MIS Cash, the second largest in terms
of fund size, requires a minimum investment of Pounds 100,000 and is used
mainly by brokers.
The largest cash unit trust, with Pounds 68m under management, is run by
Fidelity Investments. Recently renamed the Easy Access Cash Account,
Fidelity has aimed the fund at private investors, rebasing the price of
units in the fund to Pounds 1, with the unit price remaining a stable Pounds
1. This makes it immediately apparent to investors how much they hold. The
minimum investment is Pounds 1,000 and those who keep Pounds 5,000 are
issued with a cheque book (cheques must be for a minimum of Pounds 250).
On Friday, Fidelity's cash unit trust was yielding 8.8 per cent gross and
Morgan Grenfell's cash account, 9 per cent gross, both on a minimum of
Pounds 1,000. There are few banks or building societies offering rates as
high as this on Pounds 1,000.
Both these accounts operate like a postal account, with withdrawal slips,
provided and you should receive a cheque within three days of posting the
withdrawal slip.
Most cash unit trusts carry an annual management charge of 0.5 per cent,
which is deducted from the trust's income. The rates quoted above are net of
this.
The main risk with a cash unit trust is that your money could be invested in
a bank or financial institution that collapses. However, fund managers
screen banks carefully, and spread their investments between the banks.
Investors with cash unit trusts are protected by the investor's compensation
scheme.
Trust Funds
If you do not like the idea of buying units, a money market trust fund
operates almost identically to a bank account by holding your money in cash.
There are only a small number of trust funds and most deal at the wholesale
end of the market, that is with companies and charities.
Gartmore (which also manages a cash unit trust), offers a number of funds,
including a call fund and a seven-day fund. The minimum deposit is Pounds
5,000 and the interest rate being paid on the call fund on Wednesday was
8.98 per cent gross and 8.55 per cent gross on the seven-day account.
You can withdraw money by telephoning Gartmore which will transfer the money
either electronically, or if the amount requested is under Pounds 1,000, by
cheque. As its name suggests, the call fund allows instant access to your
money.
Anthony Myers, managing director of Gartmore, says that there are no charges
on the account because it is cheaper to run than a conventional bank
account.
These funds are covered by the Deposit Protection Scheme, which will refund
75 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000, that is, a maximum of Pounds 15,000.
Bank Accounts
The Big Four clearing banks - Barclays, Lloyds, National Westminster and
Midland - all offer money market accounts. Money can be deposited at a fixed
rate for a specific term. The interest rate is fixed but since these are
money market funds, the fixed rate you are offered will vary on a daily
basis. The maximum deposit is usually Pounds 250,000. Rates quoted below are
all gross.
If you have a minimum of Pounds 5,000 at Midland, you could have deposited
this on Thursday for six months at a fixed rate of 6.25 per cent or for one
year at 5.94 per cent. You would have needed a minimum of Pounds 10,000 for
a seven-day notice period fixed at 7.19 per cent gross, while with Pounds
25,000 you could have locked into a one month fixed rate of 7.31 per cent
gross or 6.13 per cent for five months.
Lloyds, which requires a minimum deposit of Pounds 10,000, was offering 6.12
per cent fixed for one month, 5.87 for three months and 5.37 for six months.
Rates for the same fixed periods on Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 49,999 were 6.5
per cent, 6.25 per cent and 5.75 per cent.
Barclays operates its main money market accounts offshore through Barclays
Bank Finance Company in Jersey. Fixed term deposits are for periods of one,
three, six and 12 months. The minimum is Pounds 5,000. On Thursday you would
have been offered a fixed-term interest rate of 6.13 per cent for one month,
5.5 per cent for three months and 4.69 per cent for one year.
Rates are higher on larger sums, for example, deposits of Pounds 25,000 to
Pounds 49,999 were attracting interest of 7 per cent for one month and 6.38
for three months.
The lower fixed term rates on longer term deposits are a reflection of the
banks' expectations that base rates are to fall further.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Test of strength for life offices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY OF the UK's insurers had reason to be very relieved when base rates
began to fall, suggests the latest survey of life office strength by Money
Management, an FT magazine for financial advisers.
Had 15 per cent interest rates persisted, the magazine believes many offices
might have found their liabilities exceeded their assets. That is a terribly
insecure position for a life office.
Assessing the strength of a life insurance company is as complex an exercise
as it sounds. But the exercise is also worthwhile, as it can help to spot
future strong performers.
The simplest measure is the free asset ratio. This subtracts total
liabilities from total assets, and then divides this by total liabilities.
This crude measure can then be adjusted to take account of how much offices
have reserved for terminal bonuses, or increased mortality because of AIDS,
or other factors.
Differences in accounting policy make direct comparisons of ratio from one
office to another very dangerous. But the trend for an individual office
tells an unmistakable story. Of the 41 companies surveyed, 21 saw their
ratios drop in 1991 and five stayed the same, but 15 did manage to rise.
This was in spite of the extremely poor year, 1990, when equity markets
ended lower than they had started. That delivered a substantial blow to life
offices' assets, and their free asset ratios. For example, Scottish Amicable
saw a drop from 27 per cent to 9 per cent, and Scottish Widows from 49 per
cent to 22 per cent.
Norwich Union dropped from 34 per cent to 14 per cent, and dropped still
further this year to 11 per cent. The office admitted at the end of last
year that it was suffering capital strain, as it decided to withdraw its
with-profits bond from general circulation, and also made a substantial
switch into fixed interest from equities and property.
What does this mean for policyholders? The question of strength goes beyond
the basic issue of whether your life office is going to go bust. Such things
do happen - the fate befell UK Provident Institution in 1986, only a couple
of years after it had been topping some performance tables - but they are
rare, and the industry is usually able to patch together some form of
rescue. In the case of UKPI, Friends Provident took over the funds, and
investors received returns which may not have been the industry leaders they
once hoped, but were certainly adequate.
Strength is more important because it defines an office's freedom for
manoeuvre. The more reserves an office holds, the freer its hand to invest
in more speculative investments and, potentially, deliver a greater profit.
If its free asset ratio is falling, it may need to bolster its strength by
switching to fixed interest. Particularly with indications that the
government is now 'going for growth', this could be totally against the best
long term aims of the fund managers.
Less adventurously, a strong office has more scope just to maintain bonuses
during years of poor investment returns, even if it is not going in for
aggressive countercyclical fund management.
One argument against 'strong' offices is that they are in reality 'mean'
offices which hold on to reserves rather than paying them to policyholders.
But a look at the highest pay-outs achieved this year suggests that this is
a fallacy. In lean periods, the strongest offices become the most generous.
Offices with high ratios include Pearl (48 per cent), General Accident (39
per cent), Commercial Union (38 per cent), AXA Equity &amp; Law and Royal London
(36 per cent). None of these has a traditional reputation for high endowment
pay-outs.
However, in the latest Money Management survey of 25-year pay-outs, CU are
in first place, with GA third, Royal London fourth and AXA Equity &amp; Law
ninth. Pearl, which aims to be competitive over shorter periods, is fourth
over 10 years.
Other offices, feeling the strain, have felt obliged to cut pay-outs,
leaving the stronger offices nearer the top of the pile. As life assurance
would appear to be for the risk-averse only in any case, then, the latest
guide to life office strength arises as an invaluable tool for any would-be
investor.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
J. SAINSBURY, which earlier this year wrested the crown from Marks and
Spencer as the UK's most profitable retailer, is likely to present an
encouraging set of numbers when it reports its interim results on Wednesday.
Analysts suggest that Sainsbury's will be able to stretch its profits by
about 16 per cent to Pounds 380m.
Associated British Foods, reporting its preliminary full-year results on
Monday, will highlight again the value of its purchase of British Sugar.
With milling and baking profits under great pressure in spite of ABF's 30
per cent share of the bread market, sugar will have contributed about half
of the group's profits. In spite of that profits are likely to be down
sharply from Pounds 332m the year before to about Pounds 290 to Pounds 300m.
British Petroleum, the UK oil group, announces its third-quarter results on
Thursday. Although its shares have outperformed the UK market since their
fall following the halving of the dividend in August, analysts say it is too
early for any of the strategy changes and cost-cutting measures announced
then by BP to be reflected in the results.
Forecasts for net income on a replacement cost basis range from Pounds 100m
to Pounds 170m, but most are between Pounds 100m and Pounds 120m, little
changed from Pounds 107m before the Pounds 1bn of exceptional items in the
second quarter of this year, or from Pounds 129m in the third quarter of
last year.
Unilever will continue its stately progress on Friday. Third quarter profits
are likely to be around Pounds 580m (Pounds 525m) for a nine-months total of
Pounds 1.48bn (Pounds 1.39bn), despite adverse currency translation.
Wm Low, reporting full-year results on Thursday, is one supermarket chain
which has lost its way. After the Scottish group warned a few months ago
that its operating margins were 'below expectations', analysts cut their
forecast to about Pounds 20m pre-tax against Pounds 23.6m a year earlier.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Pension fears increase nearly
threefold - Scheherazade Daneshkhu considers the rise in queries to Opas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENSION worries in the wake of Robert Maxwell's fraud have helped to push up
the level of inquiries to the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service nearly
threefold in the year to March.
Opas, which offers free advice to those with problems about their pension
said inquiries had risen from 7,240 last year (March 1990-March 1991) to
20,034 in the year to March 1992.
Apart from the Maxwell effect, Opas attributed the rise to the establishment
of the Pensions Ombudsman in April 1991. The Pensions Ombudsman refers cases
to Opas first.
In its annual report, Opas said the largest increase in inquiries this year
related to difficulties following the wind-up of pension schemes. These
queries accounted for 4 per cent of the overall number last year but
increased to 14 per cent this year.
'Much of this is due to the many employer insolvencies during the recession
but some resulted from employers choosing to discontinue their final salary
pension schemes,' said Opas. Some wind-ups involved instances of clear
malpractice.
One deferred pensioner contacted Opas after his pension, already nine months
overdue, had not been paid. Opas discovered that his employer had gone into
liquidation and the trustees had wound up the scheme. It then emerged that a
large proportion of the money from the pension fund had been invested in the
employer company and other ventures, when these were already in financial
difficulties.
Opas said the prospect of the employee receiving his pension was not good,
since the remaining assets of the fund were unlikely to be adequate even to
meet the existing pensions payment.
Margaret Grainger, president of Opas, said that for the individuals
involved, such cases were 'just as disastrous as for a Maxwell employee.'
Opas will be submitting recommendations to an independent review of
occupational pension schemes headed by Professor Roy Goode in the aftermath
of the Maxwell affair, but Grainger said: 'No amount of regulation will ever
stop the rogues.' She said Opas would not welcome over-regulation which
would increase the burden of costs on honest trustees, while failing to stop
the crooks.
The largest numbers of inquiries, this year as last, was about transfer
values and the level of benefits on leaving service. Many complaints were
about delays in the payment of transfer values.
In one case, an employee who left his public sector job in 1988 did not get
receive his transfer payment until 1990, when it was Pounds 3,000 below the
amount quoted to him when he left. After intervention by Opas, the scheme
authority agreed to improve the transfer value by over Pounds 3,000.
However, Grainger said many of the inquiries Opas hadreceived arose because
employees became worried after the scheme authorities failed to respond to
letters from them.
Don Hall, Opas chief executive, said that in the vast majority of cases,
complaints to Opas were made from people who did not understand their
pension policy.
For example, some complaints were from those who had been sold a policy
requiring annual premiums but thought they had bought a single premium
policy. The report emphasised the 'need for better communication so that
scheme members more readily understand benefits and how they are
calculated.'

FT  31 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Fidelity's alternative equity
strategy - Philip Coggan weighs the pros and cons of a new way of investing
in shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN

<TEXT>
MANY PEOPLE like the idea of investing in shares but are frightened of the
risks. They remember the effects of the 1987 Crash and are wary of a repeat.
So the marketing slogan of the moment is: equity investment with reduced
risk. One approach has been taken by the guaranteed funds (see page II),
which protect investors against falls in capital if they retain their
holding for a set period.
An alternative strategy was unveiled this week by Fidelity, the US fund
management group. Its new set of unit trusts - the Stabiliser Growth Range -
uses futures and options to try to reduce the risks involved in equity
investment.
Futures and options tend to be associated in the public mind with
speculation, and indeed they can be used for that purpose. But they also
have a use as a form of insurance against disaster.
Suppose an investor has shares in British Telecom. He believes that in the
long run, BT shares are a good investment but fears that in the short term,
the price might fall sharply, perhaps because of some bad economic news.
He could sell all his shares with the aim of buying them back if the price
falls. But that method would be costly and he would risk missing out on any
BT share price rise. Instead, he could buy an option on BT shares, giving
him the right to sell at, say, 360p. He would pay a premium of a few pence
per share to do so.
If the share price drops to 300p, he could exercise his option and sell his
BT shares at 360p. Alternatively, he could sell his option to someone else.
If BT shares are at 300p, an option to sell at 360p is obviously worth at
least 60p. This profit would offset the loss on his BT holding, and would
allow him to retain his shares in the hope of a rebound.
However, if BT shares increased in price, he could simply let the option
lapse. He would have lost the premium but he would have benefited from the
rise in BT shares.
By using such methods, Fidelity's aim is an investment which does not fall
as precipitously as the index in a bear market, but does not rise as quickly
as the index in a bull market. A rough guide might be that if the index
falls by 50 per cent, Fidelity's fund will drop by 15 per cent.
The bulk of the trust holdings - between 60 and 90 per cent - will be held
in cash, with the manager holding the rest in various combinations of
shares, futures and options.
There will be four funds, based in the UK, America, Europe and Japan
respectively. The UK fund will have a gross yield of around 5 per cent per
annum. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, with an initial charge of
5.25 per cent (1 per cent discount between November 2 and November 23) and
an annual charge of 1.5 per cent.
So will these new products appeal to investors? There are a few snags.
Unlike the guaranteed products, investors are not certain that their capital
is safe. They do not even have the comfort of knowing that their maximum
loss is, say 50 per cent. Of course, the same is true of investors in all
conventional unit trusts - but that is precisely the problem Fidelity is
trying to address.
One really has to rely on the manager's skill to ensure that the assumed
benefits of the trusts - in terms of reduced risk - will accrue. Fidelity
has been running the funds for institutional investors for 15 months - with
some success. The Japanese fund, for example, has shown a modest rise even
though the Tokyo market has fallen.
The tax position of investors is the same as on any other unit trust - that
is any gain is subject to CGT and any income subject to income tax.
Fidelity funds are thus more tax-efficient and flexible than most guaranteed
products, with investors able to invest and withdraw at any time.
It will be interesting to see whether the idea takes off. Fidelity says:
'Our aim is to give investors most of the benefit of equity investment
whilst enabling them to sleep at night' - but it is important to remember
that these funds can lose money. Investors could be forgiven for waiting to
see how the trusts perform over the next year or two before backing this
relatively new concept.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Tax-efficient ways of topping up
income - Planning Your Pension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 90 per cent of employees will retire on substantially less than a
full pension, yet only one in ten takes positive steps to improve their
position.
The most tax efficient method of topping up a lacklustre occupational
pension is through the company's own additional voluntary contribution (AVC)
scheme or through a free-standing AVC (FSAVC) available mainly from life
offices.
AVCs and FSAVCs can only be taken out by employees who are members of an
occupational scheme. If you are self employed, or an employee in
non-pensionable employment, you can invest in a personal pension.
Traditionally, AVCs have appealed to those employees in the run-up to
retirement, but FSAVCs in particular are now being sold to younger people.
These employees should remember that normally AVC and FSAVC funds are locked
away until retirement. If you want a tax efficient investment but need
easier access to your money, you should look at Tessas and Peps.
AVCs and FSAVCs benefit from most of the tax breaks granted to occupational
and personal pensions, namely full tax relief on contributions, tax free
growth of the fund and, with some AVCs, tax free cash.
Employees can contribute up to 15 per cent of salary to their main pension
and AVC combined. Since most schemes require employee contributions of about
5 per cent, this leaves plenty of scope for top-up provision. Employers
cannot contribute to your AVC.
Some employees will be caught by the earnings cap, restricting main pension
and AVC contributions to 15 per cent of a maximum salary of Pounds 75,000
for the current tax year. The cap applies to employees who joined a new
occupational scheme set up after March 14 1989 and for new members who
joined an existing scheme after June 1 1989.
Before considering an AVC, it is important to understand how a company
pension works.
Under a typical final salary scheme your pension builds up at the rate of
1/60th of final salary for each year of service up to a maximum of 40/60ths
or two-thirds final salary (subject to the cap, where applicable).
A minority of occupational schemes are run on a money purchase basis, where
contributions are invested to provide a fund at retirement which is used to
purchase an annuity. If you are in one of these schemes (known as
contracted-out or contracted-in money purchase schemes) the provider will
advise you the need for AVCs although you should always seek a second
opinion from an independent source.
There are several reasons for a pension shortfall:
Career breaks due to periods of unemployment or time out to have children.
Pension transfers following a job change tend to reduce the value of the
benefits.
Poor accrual rates - for example where a scheme builds up at the rate of
1/80th per annum rather than 1/60th - can leave a pension shortfall.
Employees in the public sector should note that under their '80ths' scheme
the tax free cash lump sum is in addition to the pension. This makes it
equivalent to a private sector '60ths' scheme where the tax free cash is
deducted before the pension is calculated.
Integrated schemes include the value of the state pension in the two-thirds
maximum. If you want to receive the state pension, on top of your two-thirds
final salary pension, you will need AVCs to achieve this.
Non-pensionable earnings: company schemes commonly base an employee's
pension contributions and final pension on basic salary and do take into
account overtime, bonuses, commission etc. If these form a significant
proportion of your total remuneration you may need AVCs to bring your
pension more in line with your earnings.
Early retirement: if your company pension scheme assumes a normal retirement
age of 65, and you plan to leave early, you are likely to suffer an
actuarial reduction in your pension for each year of service missed.
Company AVC schemes
By law, with a few minor exceptions, all occupational schemes must offer
AVCs. This is usually the simplest and cheapest option. Tax relief is
awarded immediately at the individual's highest rate while the
administration is handled by the employer, who may also absorb any
provider's charges involved.
Most company schemes - whether run on a final salary or money purchase basis
 -delegate the AVC arrangement to an insurance company or building society.
Generally, the AVC provides a money purchase fund at retirement but some
schemes, particularly in the public sector, provide 'added years'. Added
years provide extra pension which, in the public sector is index linked.
Until April 1987, employees who wished to take out AVCs had to commit
themselves to a fixed contribution for at least five years. Now, in theory
at least, there are no restrictions. Moreover, in the past if you overfunded
your scheme you lost your contributions but since 1989 excess contributions
have been refunded, less a tax charge.
The benefits you can take under a company AVC scheme have changed over the
past five years. Where AVC contributions began before April 6, 1987 the
whole fund can be taken as tax free cash. This means that the pension from
the main scheme is not reduced to provide the tax free lump sum. However,
where contributions started after this date the whole of the accumulated
fund must be used to purchase an annuity - there is no tax free cash.
FSAVCs
Free standing AVCs were introduced in October 1987 to provide a more
flexible alternative to the in-house scheme. Most of the features for AVCs
apply to the free standing variety but there are important differences. In
particular since the contract is between the employee and the provider, the
employee has to bear all the charges. Also, while basic tax relief is
awarded at source, higher rate relief must be claimed through the end of
year return.
On the plus side, however, is privacy. Unless you are contributing over
Pounds 2,400 to your FSAVC, your employer is not involved. FSAVC providers
reckon this is useful if you are quietly planning for early retirement.
But probably the most important advantage of FSAVCs over the in-house
variety is investment scope. Traditionally employers have provided
deposit-style building society accounts where the contributions build up tax
free. Deposit-based AVCs are ideal for an employee with just a few years to
go to retirement and seeking maximum security, but they are not so good for
longer term investments.
Some of the big occupational schemes run a choice of AVCs - often a deposit
account and a with-profits or unit-linked option - but for many employees
this choice is only available through FSAVCs.
There are now about 100 providers of FSAVCs offering almost 250 funds on a
with-profits, unitised-with-profits and unit-linked basis. The choice is
complex and should not be made without the help of an independent pensions
provider.
Under a with-profits fund, the life office provides a guaranteed minimum sum
at retirement to which annual bonuses are added. These bonuses, which smooth
out the investment performance, cannot be taken away once they have been
awarded.
Under a unit-linked or unit trust AVC, the performance of contributions
mirrors the performance of the underlying fund. Few of these funds offer any
form of guarantee and performance can be volatile.
Over the past five years with-profits funds - and the more recent unitised
with profits funds - have performed well against unit-linked and unit trust
AVCs. But bear in mind that with profits bonuses will be cut back over the
next few years while equity returns are unlikely to repeat the generally
poor performance of the period since the 1987 crash.
Top with profits AVC performers in the latest survey from the FT's sister
publication Pensions Management are Clerical Medical, Co-operative
Insurance, and Prudential. Top unit-linked managed funds were run by
National Mutual Life and Scottish Mutual.
FSAVC Funds have not been running for long enough to give meaningful
performance results but projected figures, which show the impact of charges
on a fund's growth, will reveal that on projected unit linked results, fee
charging Professional Life does well while Equitable Life, Rothschild Asset
Management and Skandia Life also offer consistently good returns.
Finally, if you are considering taking out a FSAVC, check for flexibility
just as you would under a portable pension. In theory, you can take the same
FSAVC from job to job and a well-designed plan will allow you to to switch
from FSAVC to personal pension to cover periods when you are in
non-pensionable employment.
If you are in doubt about your long term employment plans follow the golden
rule of flexibility and pay single contributions rather than commit yourself
to a regular plan.

WATCHDOGS closed in on the secondhand endowment market place this week.
The market for unmatured endowment policies has boomed in the last three
years. Making a market in these complicated products is a new discipline
requiring complex actuarial calculations, and does not fit easily into any
regulatory category. It was in danger of slipping through a loophole.
Have the regulators found the right balance? Fimbra, which regulates
independent advisers and brokers, now insists that when a secondhand policy
with more than five years to run before maturity is sold, any projections of
how it will perform in future must conform to the growth rates prescribed by
Lautro, the life assurance regulator.
This puts projections for secondhand policies on the same footing as
projections for policies at the beginning of their term, which makes sense.
However, Lautro rates are not known for their subtlety - they allow two
different projections, on annual growth rates of 7 per cent and 10.5 per
cent.
The machinations of a with-profits policy tend to be complex which these
projections could miss. Terminal bonuses are under great pressure, while
reversionary bonuses could also be under threat.
It therefore makes sense to quote potential maturity values given a range of
assumptions on future bonuses - for example that they are maintained at
their current level, or drop by 10 per cent, or drop by 50 per cent.
What some market makers now seem likely to do is abandon quoting any
projections at all. Instead, they will quote a price and provide background
information on the bonuses paid on the policy to date.
The ruling will save investors from being misled, but may divert them from
being given any useful guidance.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS MACDONALD, Directus Ltd
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asda directors have been buying small numbers of shares consistently over
the past year. The latest transaction by Patrick Gillam, the chairman,
results in his holdings being doubled.
At Ewart, the Belfast property company, there was an attempt to oust three
directors; from the board; this failed, with directors showing their
confidence with a stock purchase.
Another Northern Irish company, McLaughlin &amp; Harvey has, along with most of
the construction industry, seen a sharp fall in its share price. Charles
Yuill, a non-executive director has purchased stock for the third time in
five months.
Rhino Group, previously known as JMD, is being run by the duo who were in
charge of the video hire company, Cityvision. They are using it to build a
national chain of home entertainment stores. The shares were acquired in the
placing and open offer.
Apologies to CrestaCare, where last week's share purchase was incorrectly
noted as a sale.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Ray of hope for home owners / A look
at the options for dealing with mortgage arrears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FAINT light for home-owners glimmered this week from the Lord Chancellor's
office - the number of repossession proceedings reaching court has declined
slightly in the last quarter.
The rash of job losses over the same three months suggest that this has
little to do with any improvement in the economy. Rather, lenders are
exercising more discretion before opting for the last resort, repossession.
Lenders are prepared to accept that what is an acceptable lowered mortgage
payment today may not have been acceptable two years ago, when repossessions
began to multiply.
However, the Lord Chancellor's figures do not include those who voluntarily
surrender their keys and leave the house. This move never made any sense, as
you remain liable for mortgage repayments on the house whether or not you
happen to occupy it. Therefore, those in trouble with arrears may as well
continue enjoying their house until the last possible moment.
Many more people may now be in arrears, but at least the options facing them
are much broader than they used to be. This is particularly the case if you
do not have an endowment mortgage.
If you have a repayment mortgage, you can lengthen the term, which may not
have a great effect on outgoings, or switch to repaying interest only.
Interest can also be deferred for a period, which makes sense if your
shortfall in income is likely to be temporary.
If there has been a build-up of arrears, some of the outstanding interest
can be capitalised, so you then resume paying interest on a higher amount.
Those stuck with endowment mortgages could as a last resort sell the
endowment to a marketmaker, which will be easier the longer the policy has
been in business, and then make repayments on a capital repayment, or even
interest-only basis.
All of these measures can be executed more smoothly if you stay in regular
contact with the lender. Borrowers are often nervous to do this, but
repossession is such a severe problem for building societies now that they
will be quite as keen as you are to avoid resorting to taking control of the
property.
Most of the big lenders have organised free debt counselling for borrowers
in trouble, and it is foolish not to ask about this possibility.
Then there are the mortgage rescue schemes. Most of these have been
introduced in the last year, and none should be regarded as an easy option.
They typically involve selling the property back to the lender, or to a
housing association. You would then become a tenant (or perhaps part-owner
part-tenant) and pay a rent, for which housing benefit might be available.
These schemes may not be available in many cases, and the Council of
Mortgage Lenders suggests they should only be consided by families who have
suffered a severe reduction in income and have no entitlement to income
support. But they are better than repossession.
Those still nervous about talking to their lender could look at the
following, recommended by the Council of Mortgage Lenders: SHAC (the London
Housing Aid Centre) 189a Old Brompton Road, London SW5 0AR, (tel:
071-373-7276) offers advice on housing problems in the Greater London area.
National Debtline (021-359-8501) offers confidential advice.
The Child Poverty Action Group, 1-5 Bath Street, London EC1(071-253-3406)
offers help on welfare benefits.
Freeline Social Security (0800-666555) may be able to help with queries on
your precise income support and housing benefit entitlements.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Laurentian policies under Lautro's
eye - The probe into whole-of-life and mortgage endowment plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICIES sold by Laurentian Life, the life assurance company, have fallen
under the scrutiny of the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory
Organisation (Lautro).
Lautro has sent in a firm of consulting actuaries - Tillinghast - to review
a sample of 3,000 policies on suspicion that some people may have been sold
unsuitable policies.
The problem centres on 'factfinds' which are client questionnaires drawn by
the agent. The adviser gathers information about the client's financial
circumstances to gauge his investment needs and enters this information on
the factfind. He is then in a position to recommend the most suitable type
of product for the client.
The review at Laurentian by Tillinghast followed a preliminary investigation
of several hundred policies by Lautro earlier in the year, which raised
doubts that best advice had been given to customers.
Recent Lautro reviews of several insurance companies, including Scottish
Widows, have found that the amount of information on the factfind has been
insufficient to justify any kind of advice being given.
Lautro has been active in monitoring the techniques of tied agents,
following concern in the industry that unsuitable long-term policies are
being recommended for the rich commission that is earned on their sale. An
inadequate factfind would suggest that the adviser was more interested in
selling products, such as whole-of-life policies, to earn commission than in
finding out what his client's needs were.
Paul Stott, head of communications at Laurentian Financial Group, said that
the only policies under investigation are whole-of-life and mortgage
endowment policies. Lautro is concerned that these may have been sold to
young people with no dependants.
Laurentian has two main sales outlets; Laurentian Milldon, a wholly-owned
member of the Laurentian group, with about 550 salesmen, and Laurentian
Financial Advisers. Laurentian Milldon had been the company's only tied
agent outlet until earlier this year, when Laurentian's direct sales force
set up Laurentian Financial Advisers as a separate company within the group.
Laurentian says that if the review, which is due to be completed by the end
of November, shows that any clients have been wrongly advised, it will offer
an alternative policy or compensation in the form of a refund of premiums.
Lautro says that in cases of mis-selling, compensation is not necessarily
the answer.
'We want the investor to have the right type of policy, said Mike Abrahams,
chief enforcement officer at Lautro. He added:'That need not mean
compensation.' It is up to the company and the individual to reach agreement
in cases of mis-selling but if an impasse is reached, the investor can take
his case to the Insurance Ombudsman.
Paul Stott said it would be highly unlikely that the company would be asked
to check any more policies. However, Mike Abrahams said: 'Where we have
cases in which doubts have been raised about best advice, we ask that a full
review be taken by independent actuaries. Depending on the results of the
review, we may ask for a full review of 100 per cent of the business during
the period concerned.'
Policies sold before 1988 are exempt from Lautro's scrutiny since that is
the year when the Financial Services Act, which established the
self-regulatory authorities, was implemented.
Barry Sherlock, chairman of Lautro, said in Lautro's recently published
annual report that more cases than ever before were going through the
disciplinary process. Lautro has also been using its power to fine, which
was granted to it last year.
The tighter Lautro measures on the selection, training and supervision of
salespeople have been biting, with the number of tied agents falling by
14,000 in the year to June 1992. There has been a further fall of 8,000
since then. Kit Jebens, chief executive of Lautro, said the decrease was
also a reflection of the recession.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Jim Slater's share guide - An
intriguing book from a former stock market guru
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY private investor would like to know how to pick profitable shares.
Americans lap up tomes with titles like How to Get Rich without Trying; in
Britain, books on the subject are comparatively rare.
So a book* by Jim Slater, one time stock market guru, is bound to intrigue
any private investor with a good memory.
The business media have a tendency to build up heroes who have the 'Midas
touch'. In the 1980s, it was retailing stars like Sir Terence Conran and
George Davies; back in the late 1960s, the heroes were financial
wheeler-dealers like Slater.
Many of these heroes fall from grace and such is the case with Slater. He
was once a finance director of Leyland Motor and occasional newspaper share
tipster. He later formed the conglomerate Slater Walker which went
spectacularly bust in the mid-1970s. In the ensuing crisis, he became, in
his own description, 'a minus millionaire'. So anyone who reads his book for
profit is entitled to ask one question: if he is so smart, how come he made
such a mess of things? And there is another angle. Readers might not recall
that, back in the 1970s, Slater was prosecuted under section 54 of the
Companies Act 1948, which prohibited companies from financing purchases of
their own shares. After acquittal by Guildhall magistrates, the DTI appealed
and Slater was eventually convicted on 15 charges, and fined Pounds 15 for
each.
The publicity for the book refers only to Slater Walker as the 'legendary
financial conglomerate' and Slater himself skates over his history in the
text. There are two references to Slater Walker, both anodyne. There is also
one paragraph which begins 'I managed to anticipate the two bear markets of
1973-74 and 1987.' A few people might raise their eyebrows at the first
claim.
Slater has rebounded. By the late 1980s, he was once again being ranked
among Britain's richest people. His views on investing must be worth
consideration.
And provided the reader regards the book with a cautious eye, there is
plenty of useful material. Although Slater deals with turnround situations
and shells, the main focus is on growth stocks.
He cites 11 key criteria for selecting growth stocks which are worth
repeating;
a positive growth rate in earnings per share in at least four of the last
five years
a low price earnings ratio relative to the growth rate
the chairman's statement must be optimistic
strong liquidity, low borrowings and cash flow
competitive advantage
something new
small market capitalisation
high relative strength of the shares compared with the market
a dividend yield
a reasonable asset position
management should have a significant shareholding
One key ratio, Slater says, is to divide the price-earnings multiple by the
estimated growth rate for the earnings per share. So if the p/e is 15, and
the expected eps growth rate is 20 per cent, then the ratio is 0.75. Slater
dubs this ratio the PEG (price earnings growth factor) and says you should
look for shares where the PEG is not more than 0.75 and preferably under
0.66.
He illustrates the criteria with examples and dissects a few balance sheets
to help investors spot companies with debt, or cashflow, difficulties.
In a recession, finding stocks with strong growth rates, healthy finances
and low share prices, is a difficult proposition. It will require research.
Even then, you could get it wrong. Referring to Body Shop Slater says that
in July 1992, with the shares at 278p, the prospective PEG was 0.85,
'relatively attractive for a leading supergrowth share.' The shares are now
179p.
So the book is not a surefire guide to riches, any more than buying shares
in Slater Walker was. On the other hand, it is lucid, contains plenty of
detailed analysis and general advice for those who want to invest in shares.
And it fills a gap in the market.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: A step ahead of the trackers - Diary
of a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PICKING while watching an index can be profitable. As a private
investor, I welcome the introduction, earlier this month, of two new FT-SE
indices.
The FT-SE mid 250 Index comprises, as its name suggests, 250 large to medium
size UK companies which rank, in market capitalisation terms, below the 100
companies included in the longer established FT-SE 100 Index. The new FT-SE
350 index combines the companies in both indices.
In recent years there has been a rapid growth in 'tracker funds' where some
unit trusts and other institutional fund managers have 'tracked' an index,
buying shares in companies that are included in that index. If the market
suddenly falls, at least tracker fund managers can tell their clients that
their performance has not been very much worse than the index.
In the US, tracker funds account for more than 25 per cent of institutional
fund investment and in the UK an increasing number of pension funds have at
least part of their assets in funds which track an index.
This has meant, for example, that shares in companies that are removed from
the FT-SE 100 Index tend to suffer a further drop in their share price as
tracker fund managers sell them. Similarly, there is sometimes a useful
'bounce' in the price of shares in companies which are promoted to the
index.
For example, in October 1990 Dalgety's share price increased by 6p when it
was announced that it was being included in the FT-SE 100 to replace the
then-suspended Polly Peck; while Burton Group fell 6p on being demoted.
Companies are removed from the FT-SE 100 Index when their market
capitalisation has fallen by so much that it appears they are no longer
likely to be regarded as one of the largest UK companies. Others are
promoted as their share prices rise, increasing their market capitalisation
to the level of acceptance within that index.
Some companies that are removed from the index never recover - like British
and Commonwealth and Maxwell Communications. Others manage, eventually, to
bounce back into the index or at least remain profitable and well regarded.
The current constituents of the FT-SE 100 Index range from Glaxo in first
position with a market capitalisation of more than Pounds 23bn to BET at the
bottom, with a capitalisation of more than Pounds 900m. It takes a
substantial number of shares to change hands in companies of this size for
the share price to rise or fall sharply.
But look at the lower reaches of the new FT-SE mid 250 index. While S G
Warburg is in first position, with a market capitalisation of over Pounds
1bn and likely to be promoted into the FT-SE 100 Index, there are a number
of companies at the bottom end, like AMEC, Simon Engineering, Laura Ashley
and Leigh Interests, which have market capitalisations of less than Pounds
150m. It would not take huge amounts of buying and selling to affect their
share price.
Even more interesting is the reserve list of companies which are being
monitored by those responsible for compiling the index with a view to
including them should any of the existing members have to be removed.
It seems to me that this reserve list provides opportunities for profit by
the astute private investor. If a company on the reserve list is promoted to
the index it ought to attract the attention of tracker fund managers who
will have to buy shares in it to match the index. Inclusion in the index
also brings extra attention to the company which ought also to be initially
helpful to the company's share price.
The organisers of the FT-SE mid 250 index stated, after their quarterly
review meeting on September 9, that the following companies were on the
reserve list for possible future inclusion in the index: Betterware, EIS
Group, Cray Electronic, Waddington, Wagon Industrial Holdings, Temple Bar
Investment Trust, Daejan Holdings, TT Group, Renishaw, Scholl, American
Trust and Davis Service Group.
Not all of these companies will necessarily make the index, but I will
certainly be keeping an eye on them and following the details of their
market capitalisations as listed on the share price pages of the Financial
Times. I am hoping to spot the companies next in line for promotion in the
hope that if they make the index their share price will rise by a useful
percentage.
Initially, such share price rises may not be too great as there are not many
tracker funds following the FT-SE mid 250 index. But as the number of such
funds grows, so the opportunities of making a profit increase.
The existence of this new index ought also to bring more attention to
companies already in it, such as Pentland Group and Photo-Me, in which my
personal pension scheme already has holdings and harbours hopes that they
will progress.
However, it should be remembered that not all companies included in an index
may stay there. A company could be badly managed and initially have its
share price sustained by a small number of fund managers following an index,
rather than looking too closely at the underlying value of the company. At
least the FT-SE mid 250 index focuses more attention on some companies where
growth may well out-perform the average. But why buy shares in all 250
companies when you can pick and choose the best. A tracker fund will have
the excellent performance of a few considerably diluted by the poorer
performance of the rest?

FT  31 OCT 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Spanish recipe for
recession-proof success - A restaurateur from humble beginnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN PRESSDEE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BOTTLE of Taittinger costs just Pounds 19.95 in a most stylish restaurant
in Wales' capital city. The list of over 120 Riojas, vintage Vega Sicilia
and vintage ports shows the Iberian connection. The wine cellar contains
over 25,000 bottles, and there are 200 cases of en primeur claret in
Bordeaux. This is a very serious business.
The menu offers a wide choice of fish which regularly includes sea bass,
oysters, lobster, turbot, parrot fish, baramundi and cod. Prices start at
Pounds 3 for a simple meal of a burger and jacket potato and rise to about
Pounds 15 for baked sea bass.
Here shoppers may sit alongside the local tycoons, and enjoy the food and
atmosphere. Le Monde, in St Mary's Street Cardiff, owned and run by Benigo
Martinez, is a smooth, sophisticated and highly successful operation.
Martinez, who has just turned 50, is the son of a fisherman from the village
of Carino in Galicia in north west Spain. His little empire includes a
three-restaurant complex in Cardiff, with Champers and La Brasserie below Le
Monde, La Braseria, 40 miles away in Swansea and the recently revamped
Caesar's Arms at Creigiau, north of Cardiff.
Last year turnover was around Pounds 4m, a far cry from the Pounds
150-a-week the Blue Anchor pub took before Martinez turned it into Casa
Martinez in 1974. He employs over 100 and is looking for just one thing in
the recession - expansion.
In 1964 Benigo Martinez (known to all as Martin), came to Cardiff to work in
the Model Inn, a pub-steak house.
His first venture in 1970 was a late night drinks bar, the Club Incognito,
which catered to late night revellers for over a decade. He started
expanding in 1974 when he converted the old Blue Anchor into a wine bar,
Casa Martinez. A little later he revamped the adjacent pub, the Royal Oak,
into a similar theme bar called Matisse. Both were late night disco
drinkeries, financed by a bank loan of a little over Pounds 20,000, and
takings approached Pounds 400,000 after two years.
As other cheaper dives entered the late-drinks trade, Martinez identified a
market niche left open when the sherry-and-steak Berni Inns fell from
fashion. In 1981 Casa Martinez was inexpensively transformed into a Spanish
style bodega called Champers.
Champers is crammed with paraphernalia from Spanish villages and has the
warm atmosphere of a Mediterranean taverna, filled with the aroma of food
cooked on an open grill. Steaks are served sizzling on an iron slab, with
relish and jacket potato. The Spanish wines are plentiful and cheap.
Martinez piles the many bargains on the bar, including champagne, at prices
below the retail in nearby wine shops.
It took almost a year to popularise the steak theme, and two years to reach
again the turnover the clubs had enjoyed. By 1983 the style was established
and popular and Matisse became La Brasserie, with French decor and wines.
In the 1980s Martinez noticed a growing demand for fish. The success of
Harry Ramsden's fish and chip empire, inspired a calculated gamble to
introduce the dish to a stylish 'all black' restaurant with a nightclub
atmosphere, Le Monde, which cost more than Pounds 100,000.
The success led to a wider range of fish and cooking styles: seafoods
grilled on a large parilla became familiar large fish baked entirely buried
in sea salt, a speciality of his home village. These dishes brought a
theatrical style of presentation.
In spite of the surge in the number of customers, Martinez has held prices
at a modest level. A fat sirloin sells for under a Pounds 10, most fish
costs Pounds 6-Pounds 8 and house wine, from Maufoux, is only Pounds 6.95 a
bottle. Over 100 dozen are sold weekly, and 350 cases of champagne are
slurped annually.
Although turnover soared mark-ups remained modest, particularly on wine,
averaging 48 per cent. Few restaurants would survive on such slim margins -
most aim for 60-65 per cent. The prices and efficient service means seats
are turned over two and a half times in an evening. This rises to almost
four on a busy weekend. At an average of Pounds 20-Pounds 25 a head the seat
yield is healthy.
The high turnover means that the relative level of fixed costs is low. The
highly professional level of service, brings a wage bill of over Pounds
20,000 a week but this amounts to only 25 per cent of turnover. Fixed
overheads are 12 per cent, leaving a healthy bottom line of around 10 per
cent. The level of profits has encouraged the group to expand while so many
others are winding down.
In 1986, Martinez snapped up a run-down pub in a prime spot on the main
approach route to Swansea, the second-largest city in Wales and turned it
into La Braseria following the same formula.
Three years ago the group redeveloped Le Monde at a cost of more than Pounds
500,000. The all black decor seems to hold some strange attraction for the
capital city of the rugby fraternity. It is rarely other than packed.
The latest venture is Caesar's Arms in the tiny and remote village of
Creigiau. The previous owners struggled on takings of around Pounds 1,500 a
week. Martinez rebuilt the pub at a cost of Pounds 100,000 adding a heated
terrace. The rural formula, with al fresco dining is drawing a clientele
from the wealthiest outposts of Cardiff and the villages around it.
Martinez says he has provided what the market has dictated. Perhaps he never
believed he would be as up-market as Le Monde. and Caesar's where weekly he
sells several hundred oysters, over 100 lobsters and over ten stone of sea
bass and dover sole.
Martinez runs a tight ship with regular stock controls. He could step into
any of the jobs at any of the restaurants and believes that personally
overseeing the operation is a vital ingredient to its success. His working
week is rarely less than 80 hours.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Pensions allowances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY WIFE and I recently surrendered a single pension policy held in our joint
names. The difference between the premium and the surrender value is several
thousand pounds, will my wife's half affect her over 65 age allowance?
Without her half of the profits her income does not exceed her 'personal
allowance' limit for the age allowance. Therefore, although she would not be
liable to pay tax on her half of the profit directly would she indirectly
have to pay tax on whatever position exceeds the age allowance limit?
Yes: the whole of your wife's share of the chargeable gain is taken into
account in calculating her age-allowance clawback, so there may be an
effective 12 1/2 per cent tax charge. You will be eligible for topslicing
relief in calculating any 15 per cent higher rate liability, but there is no
topslicing for age allowance clawback.
If you provided the funds to pay the premium, it may be that section
547(1)(a) or section 674A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988
requires the whole of the chargeable gain to be treated as your own income.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Charity at one remove
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I PROPOSE, in certain circumstances to leave a large proportion of my estate
to my brother, in trust for his use and enjoyment during his lifetime, and
eventually on his death to be divided among several nominated charities. In
view of their ultimate destination, will these funds escape inheritance tax
(a) on my estate and (b) on my brother's?
If you leave any funds to your brother on your death, then this will be
charged to inheritance tax subject to the available nil rate band of up to
Pounds 150,000.
Similarly if you leave funds in trusts for your brother, an inheritance tax
charge would arise. It would be normal to set out the terms of the trust in
your will so that your brother may enjoy the income during his lifetime.
You may wish to ensure that the trust enables the trustees to advance
capital to him at their discretion. In this type of 'Life interest' trust
you need to carefully consider who will be the trustees because if your
brother is a trustee, this could lead to all the capital being appointed to
him.
The trust deed should state that on your brother's death, the funds would be
left to nominated charities and this event would be free of inheritance tax.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax on life policies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I UNDERSTAND that life policies retained by the original policyholder to
maturity are exempt from CGT by virtue of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains
Act 1992.
However, on the recent maturity of two Scottish Widows life policies taken
out by me in 1969 and 1972, the company issued to me copies of a certificate
of chargeable event which they had sent to the Inland Revenue, showing an
amount of chargeable gain in each case. Does the issue of such a certificate
mean that they are chargeable to CGT?
The two policies were paid up by me in 1977. Would this make them liable to
CGT.
The gains shown on the certificates are chargeable to income tax, not CGT,
under sections 547 and 550 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
However, the rate of tax cannot exceed 15 per cent; it may effectively be 12
1/2 per cent (on part or all of the gains) if you were born before April 6
1927. If the gains plus the rest of your income of 1991-92 do not take you
beyond the basic rate limit (and you were born after April 5 1927), there
will be no tax to pay on the gains themselves.
It was the fact that you made the policies paid-up within their first ten
years which brought the maturity proceeds into the income tax net, in
accordance with the rules now reenacted in section 540(1)(b)(i) of the
Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
Furthermore, although the gains do not attract CGT in themselves, their
existence could increase the potential CGT Liability on any chargeable gains
in excess of the exempt amount (Pounds ,5500), but we gather that you did
not in fact have any gains liable to CGT in 1991-92.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Age-old question - in or out of Serps?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLIER this year the Financial Times paper repeated what I have heard
before, namely that women over 40 and men over 45 are better off opting back
into Serps. I took this up with my financial advisers but they say the FT is
working from the wrong premise and that the ages are 46 and 53 for women and
men respectively.
The article was merely quoting the opinion of one actuary in one insurance
company on the optimum ages for contracting-out. As your adviser has
explained there are differences of view based on the method used.
There are other considerations such as the nature of your own arrangement.
Some schemes provide better benefits than others. There is also a political
risk in Serps. It has been cut once and the escalating cost to Government of
providing future Serps benefits without corresponding increase in revenue
(it is pay as you go) could well lead to further cut backs. If you are
already in a good scheme of your own there is a strong case for keeping it
going. You are building up a fund of real money which many experts believe
will provide a more secure guarantee of future income than paper promises
from the state which can be altered by any future Government in a tight
financial corner.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Germany's magic debt mountain -
James Morgan asks how 17m industrious Prussians and Saxons could have built
a national debt of Dollars 15,500 a head / As They Say In Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS unfortunate that the economic history of the late German Democratic
Republic is something of a minority interest. As a result the east German
origin of many of our current discontents is not fully appreciated. Some
newspapers went as far as carrying Chancellor Kohl's remarks about debts
last Monday at his party conference in Dusseldorf but none reeled in
astonishment at the disclosure that east German debt would reach DM400bn -
or Dollars 265bn.
How 17m industrious Prussians and Saxons can create liabilities of this
magnitude is one of the great untold stories of our time. By comparison,
Latin Americans of the 1970s and Anglo-Saxons of the 1980s seem mere pygmies
of the debt creation industry. One of the causes is to be found in the
casual approach of the West towards East Germany and the astonishing manner
in which nonsense was accepted as truth.
It started in 1976 when the World Bank misguidedly attempted to create
comparable national income figures for every country in the world. Through a
series of heroic assumptions about production and purchasing power, East
Germany was given a figure for income per head which put it above Britain.
Realising the absurdity of this result, the Bank never indulged in the same
exercise again. But the damage had been done. Thus in 1977, a book appeared,
Socialism with a German Face, by Jonathan Steele of The Guardian. It was
partly inspired by the World Bank's statistical error and failed to reflect
fully the visual and olfactory evidence of the bankrupt slum that was East
Germany.
Steele concluded: 'The emergence of the GDR as a viable state against all
odds ought to be an intellectual warning that from the most inauspicious
beginnings worthwhile results can come. Socialism in the GDR is as much a
part of the socialist tradition as any of its other national manifestations
elsewhere in the world.' Which is hard luck on socialism.
So there was a certain predisposition to believe that the GDR had pulled off
a sort of mirror image of the the western Wirtscahftswunder. Having gained
this reputation, East Germany could not only borrow abroad but could also
falsify its statistics unchallenged even though they were rubbish. Had they
been true, the GDR would have appeared as some kind of spruced-up
Switzerland by the time it collapsed in 1989.
Shortly after that, I spent a fascinating couple of hours with Professor
Hilmar Kruger of the faculty of the business management of Humboldt
University in (East) Berlin. He told me how productivity figures had been
rigged in the super new robot-run plants in the GDR. In reality these were
expensive investments that never paid off. But the statistics showed huge
profits. This was achieved by counting, into the production of the robots,
the assumed output of the employees who were displaced and found work
elsewhere.
Once false revenues had been magically created they were then snatched from
the enterprise by a measure called 'the centralisation of profit.' That
meant all industrial profits were remitted to the government which in turn
used them to balance what was a fantastically unbalanced budget.
This of course left enterprises without funds, so that shortage was made up
by loans from the Staatsbank der DDR, the East German central bank. As a
result, every East German enterprise bore a crippling level of debt -
DM130bn at unification.
When the Treuhandanstalt, or privatisation agency, came to sell off the
enterprises that debt could not be written off and was assumed by the
Treuhand. Unpaid interest piles up and it will almost double to DM250bn by
the end of 1994.
Many of the problems could have been dealt with had East Germany been better
understood in 1990. But instead a conspiracy of silence had wrought its
fearful work.
The West German government refused to criticise. Bankers who knew what was
going on kept their mouths shut for fear of rocking the Ostpolitik boat. The
West German public took more interest in the economy of Nicaragua than that
of East Germany. And today we are all paying the penalty.
But should we? The old East German debts were owed to the Staatsbank der
DDR. Therefore they were the Staatsbank's assets. Now, guess who took over
those assets at the time of unification. That's right - Treuhand. In other
words Treuhand owes the money to itself. I am sure there is an explanation
as to why taxes have to be raised in Germany to pay off the debt, but I know
I won't understand it. Nor do I understand why German, and, pari passu,
European, monetary and fiscal policy has to be torn apart by so-called debts
that result from East German fiscal juggling and statistical fraud.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Eating Out: Count on Snow this winter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEBASTIAN SNOW left school at 16 with five O levels and the encouragement
from his careers master that he might make a good estate agent.
Melissa, his wife of 18 months, abandoned a Politics, Philosophy and
Economics course after two years and then swapped a city secretarial job to
work behind the bar at Chelsea Arts Club.
They eventually met working at 190 Queensgate, a fashionable London
restaurant and, in December last year, opened their own place. In spite of
recession, it became profitable in its sixth month and turnover will exceed
Pounds 600,000 by the end of its first year. Their business plan, which was
rejected by five different banks, projected a breakeven figure of 60 covers
a day - today they serve more than 100.
Life is not all rosy. The hours are long and hard and Sebastian described
married life as 'a business partnership but we live together.' Melissa wakes
Sebastian at 7.15am so that he can get to the kitchen and he welcomes
Melissa back at 1 or 2 in the morning after she has checked the till and
locked up.
Sensibly, in terms of fashion, health, cost and his relatively limited
experience, Snow's cooking eschews the sauces and reductions of haute
cuisine for the more rustic food of the Mediterranean, in particular
Provence and northern Italy, where he spent school holidays.
Bruschetta, brandade crostini, a gratin of mozzarella, aubergine and
tomatoes, braised knuckle of pork with sage, chartreuse of partridge with
cabbage and a daube of ox cheeks with mashed potatoes are just some of his
dishes. All are interesting, well prepared and sensibly priced with most
main courses under Pounds 10. But for me at the moment the cooking is not
punchy enough, although this may change as Snow gains in experience.
The wine list too would benefit from more professional counselling. Prices
are not excessive - nothing more than Pounds 20 - but it is not exciting
enough given the increasing number of good value wines on offer in London
and there is too little by the glass. Most personally, I would welcome an
off switch on the cassette player.
Nevertheless I have enjoyed my four meals there - not only for the food and
friendly service but because this restaurant is more than a sum of its
parts.
Both Snows have thrown their combined experiences into it. Although he
started cooking 14 years ago he floundered for a long while. A chef he
worked for seven years ago remembers that Snow had trouble butchering a
duck. Then in 1988 he went to work for Antony Worrall Thompson and he was
transformed.
Since, he has combined confidence with a desire to learn. Financial rewards
have helped - as a sous chef at 27 he was earning Pounds 25,000 pa - but the
chance to wear a chef's jacket with the name of his own restaurant
embroidered on it seems the biggest thrill.
Melissa's most salutary work experience - as assistant manageress of a plush
restaurant that went into receivership after just three months - left her in
no doubt that as well as looking after her customers she must take care of
staff, too.
Such common sense proved invaluable when they decided to open their own
restaurant. When it came to selling their homes to finance the purchase she
insisted on keeping some cash for a 'rainy day'. And their ideas on decor
have coincided neatly, successfully and economically: rag-rolled walls, pots
of lavender on tile-topped tables, generous jars of olive oil infused with
garlic and rosemary and a large, colourful mural to brighten the basement.
An artistic family helps - the eye-catching photos of a girl picking
lavender are of Melissa's sister, taken by her photographer brother.
The gratitude that residents of Shepherd's Bush and Brook Green must feel at
the Snows' arrival, as well as office workers who make up a good lunchtime
clientele, is more than matched by the Snows' gratitude at the opportunities
the restaurant trade has offered. A meritocratic industry, it can repay,
even in a recession, those who can see through the early, poorly paid years
of the necessary apprenticeship.
The Snows recognise this. Partners in their own successful business they
realise that, because of their choice of career, they lost touch with many
friends who, during the 1980s, pursued more conventional, and at the time,
more financially rewarding careers.
Today this prospering business is theirs and they hope to make long-term

FT  31 OCT 92 / Wine: He also waits who only stands and serves . . . -
Jancis Robinson goes in search of that elusive animal, the prefect wine
waiter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE old days the perfect wine waiter was just like the stereotype wine
waiter - francocentric, heavily accented, impenetrably aloof, his role to
reduce customers to Bateman cartoon fodder with the drop of an eyelid.
Except that the best did actually know something about wine.
But just as wines have been changing, so have restaurants and their
customers, and there is now an entirely new breed of wine waiter.
These guys, just for starters, may not even be guys. But whether male or
female, will almost invariably be young, enthusiastic, knowledgeable in a
truly international sense, and completely, almost unsettlingly, unfettered
by tradition. Fishcakes with Cabernet? You got it. Cloudy Bay with chilli?
You got it. Etcetera.
So what does make the perfect wine waiter nowadays? He, or she, has to
combine a pleasant modesty with flexibility. He has to satisfy the everyday,
non-wine-fanatic customer by reliably recommending good buys at the cheaper
end of the list. But he also has to be able to hold his own with the
increasing number of wine maniacs who now roam the world and enjoy torturing
sommeliers with tricky questions and absurd boasts.
He has to satisfy his employer by generating sufficient profit from the
declining number of bottles ordered, especially at lunchtime. Finally, so
that he can be fielded at any time for the role of wine waiter in a sitcom,
he should have a strong French accent and an Inspector Clouzot moustache.
I know the very chap. Gerard Basset, posing as a Frenchman working
(extremely hard) at Hampshire's famous country house hotel, Chewton Glen. So
perfect is he that he has just, very nearly, been voted the Best Sommelier
in the World.
At what are, effectively, the sommelier Olympics, held every three years,
Gerard Basset was beaten into second place by one point, by talented
Philippe Faure-Brac of Paris. Faure-Brac is very French, and is expected to
make as much of his new title as his countryman who won it back in 1983 and
has virtually built a business empire on it.
But Basset surely cannot be French. Quite apart from his natural modesty and
caricature French accent, there is what he says. For example: 'England is
fantastic - a far better place to learn about wine than France. The more I
learn, the more I realise I don't know. A lot of sommeliers forget to
respect the customer.
'The only customers I'm not overkeen on are the French. I used to try to
sell them wines from new regions such as California. Now I say, 'Unless
you're open-minded, don't bother'.'
Perhaps on the other hand, he really was born in St Etienne (fork left for
Cotes du Forez) in 1957 and fell in love with England via a football match
in Liverpool, unlikely as this may seem. Other talented French sommeliers
have deliberately chosen to make British hotels such as the Manoir, the Inn
on the Park, the London Intercontinental and the Lanesborough their base for
learning about wine, because the chances to learn about non-French wines are
so much greater (even if the matching of specific wines and foods is largely
ignored in the UK).
Certainly the World Sommelier Championship, held this year in Brazil,
requires truly non-chauvinist wine knowledge.
The questions Gerard can remember from the written exam on the Friday
included pairing the names of 10 of Italy's arcane Supertuscans with their
producers, and ranged from California wine nomenclature, through the
Luxembourg appellation system to the role of vitamins in grapes. The
practical part of this qualifying round involved serving a Brazilian
Cabernet Sauvignon correctly.
This reduced the 35 finalists to five who had to perform in public on the
Saturday, describing and recommending wines (and spirits) from an 800-bin
list they had only half an hour to study, and answering such nasty questions
as: 'What do you think of Michel Lynch 1986?' (Some contestants were so
nervous they managed to stumble out an appreciation of this wine, which did
not exist at that time.)
Basset is lucky. Both his employers at Chewton Glen and his fiancee Nina
Howe (an AA hotel inspector) actively support his dedication to a series of
vinous title fights. Priestlike, he studies theory religiously each morning
before furthering his practical mastery of wine waiting at work.
His next ambition is to pass the Master of Wine exams, the highest academic
qualification in the wine trade. Nina will continue to test him with mystery
glasses served during their two evenings a week together, since the MW also
involves practical as well as theoretical exams. And they have advertised in
the local paper for someone to coach him in the necessary essay writing.
He says, rather touchingly, that his aim is to motivate others to become
sommeliers by helping to change their arrogant image. 'But you know,' he
said conspiratorially, 'the worst are some of my young French staff.
'One of them, a 19-year-old, told me off the other day for decanting a Pinot
Noir. So I waited until after service and asked him to explain exactly why I
shouldn't. And do you know the only reason he could give me? 'Because, in
France we don't'.'

FT  31 OCT 92 / Food: A culinary oasis in a sea of drabness - Grand hotel /
Coming soon, good food in Warsaw, hopes Giles MacDonogh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN YOU walk through Warsaw's small diplomatic market with Kurt Scheller,
executive chef of the Hotel Bristol, you quickly realise what immense power
a man in his position can wield.
Everywhere hands reach out to offer foods otherwise unavailable in the
Polish parts of the city. But Scheller looks deeply unimpressed as he
strides through the stalls piled high with tins of caviar and dried
mushrooms, occasionally stopping, only to turn up his nose at cream-coloured
smoked salmon, a few eels, some uneven bundles of white asparagus, an
undersized leg of lamb, or some poor Polish cheese. He, more than anyone, is
aware of the problems of running a quality dining room to the east of the
old Iron Curtain.
The Bristol is closed for the time being; it was due to reopen tomorrow, but
when I was there few of the hotel's staff thought they would meet the
deadline. Now, I hear, it is to open in December. Now franchised to Lord
Forte, the Bristol was Warsaw's smartest hotel before the last war and had
the good fortune to survive the destruction of 78 per cent of the city by
the Germans by virtue of the fact that it was their military HQ.
After the war it was run by the state hotel chain, Orbis. Predictably,
standards dwindled and nothing was done to make the place suitable for
international visitors. Forte's first move was to gut the hotel so that
bathrooms could be installed in all rooms. Some of the old interiors will
then be put back to please the local equivalent of the Ministry for National
Heritage.
Had the Bristol been in Western Europe, Scheller might be the happiest of
chefs, seeing his dream rise about him. With a team of 50 (10 of them
non-Poles), Scheller will have a smart cafe complete with pavement terrace;
an upmarket Italian restaurant; and a main dining room serving 'new Polish
cooking' to play with. And this does not include the usual panoply of
banqueting rooms.
Scheller's vision is troubled, however, by problems with the supply chain:
can he rely on Poland for raw materials or must he import everything from
the west?
Scheller's experiences had not been without their comic side. He told me a
story about a roguish farmer who brought him a chicken which, he said, was
the best in Poland. Scheller cooked the super chicken for four hours, but
the beast was still unbearably tough. The next time the chicken farmer
turned up Scheller kicked him out. Others brought him ducks the size of
geese covered with impenetrable layers of fat.
In the main, the rivers, lakes and ponds were so polluted as to render the
pike, carp and zander untrustworthy.
The hanging of meat had disappeared under communism and, although beef was
cheap and plentiful; the meat was impossibly tough.
One glimmer of light had come from an unlikely source: a fellow Swiss who
for one reason or other had come to Poland to farm. Here he was producing
eggs, milk, cream and cheese as well as fruit by ecological methods.
Scheller had signed a contract to take all the small farm's produce but it
fell well short of his requirements.
Meantime, the farmers in the three villages closest to the Swiss had been
impressed by the prices fetched by his produce and had asked him to act as a
consultant. The result is that all three villages are now supplying Scheller
with the best dairy produce.
Scheller has also been having second thoughts about the 'new Polish cuisine'
he had intended for his main dining room. Some ideas lent themselves to
adaptation: the traditional stuffed carp could be rendered as an aspic with
carp and pickled vegetables. Others were simply too rustic to please the
businessmen most likely to use the restaurant. Regional recipes had proved
very hard to come by.
Poland's shifting borders after the second world war had made a nonsense of
Polish provincial cookery. The few remaining practicioners of Pomeranian,
Silesian or East Prussian cookery were more likely to be across the borders
in Germany; huge population transfers had dealt a fatal blow to local
folklore; the departure of the nobility had meant that the secrets of the
great aristocratic kitchens were lost to the modern Poles.
Where they could be traced from old manuals they proved essentially derived
from France anyhow.
Kurt Scheller is an intelligent and hard working man and I feel certain that
he will get it right on the day. In the run up to the launch, however, my
heart goes out to him in his kitchen: it cannot be an easy job injecting a
feeling for quality into a people starved of such considerations for more
than 50 years.
It will take a long time before Poland becomes the pleasant place it must
have been before the war. Until then, it is likely that the Bristol will
remain an isolated instance of excellence among the omnipresent drabness.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Cookery: In praise of perfect pasta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PASTA IS a natural choice when time is of the essence
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and, since it frequently is, pasta tends to feature on many household menus
at least once a week.
Whether this is gastronomically depressing or good tidings may depend on the
shopping. For there are some extraordinarily nasty confections sold in the
name of pasta and pasta sauces, a few that are good, and one or two gems.
To my mind, Cipriani is by far the best brand of pasta available to British
home cooks. A great deal more appetising than the so-called fresh pasta
generally on sale, it is better than the home-made pasta of all but the best
home cooks. Cipriani's range of shapes is limited, but this dried pasta is
exceptionally eggy and light, and it cooks quickly.
Pasta this good does not need dressing up. Melted butter, a grinding of
pepper and a smattering of freshly grated Parmesan is enough. Or fruity
olive oil warmed and infused with crushed garlic. Those prepared to indulge
in a little more culinary effort, however, may care to consider making the
sauce recipes I give below.
Easier still, in theory at least, is unzipping a can, jar or tub of ready
made sauce - if you can find one that passes your tastebud test. Sauces made
by Italians for the Italian market and imported here are probably the best
bet.
I like, rather than rave about, Cipriani's latest canned pasta sauce:
Amatrice, the consistency and nuggets of smokey bacon are as they should be.
Althea's tomato sauce is excellent, pure and barely cooked so it is
remarkably light and fresh tasting. Equally suitable for cold pasta dishes
and hot ones, this could be used also for dressing courgettes, leeks and
other cooked vegetable salads.
I also recommend La Truffata by L'Aquila, a smoothly pureed blend of porcini
and white truffles, small spoonfuls of which make a rich treat simply
stirred into thick hot cream. This is good for saucing escalopes of veal as
well as pasta.
Last but far from least, look out for pesto by Roi. Most ready-made versions
of this lovely sauce bear little relationship to the real thing; none holds
a candle to this.
Made by a small Ligurian producer steadfast to tradition, it includes
nothing but basil, extra virgin olive oil, garlic and pinenuts. No cheap
substitutes. No extras. Not even salt - as the soil in which Ligurian basil
grows seasons the herb with salt enough.
What about Parmesan and Pecorino Sardo? Surely they are classic ingredients
of pesto? Quite so, but they are absent from the jar for the simplest and
best of reasons. In Liguria, I am told, cheeses are never incorporated into
pesto until the day of serving. If added ahead, they say, the sauce may
ferment in storage.
Stockists: London stockists of Althea (A), Cipriani (C) and Roi (R) products
include: The Knightsbridge Pantry (A, C and R); Tom Conran's (A, C and R);

where L'Aquila truffle oils (concentrated and light) and whole truffles may
also be available. For your nearest stockist ring L'Aquila Importers:
071-837.5555.
TAGLIARDI WITH LEMON AND HERBS (serves 2-3)
The important thing here is to steep the herbs and lemon in olive oil for
12-24 hours before using so the oil becomes impregnated with their flavours.
8 oz green tagliardi; 1 lemon; 1-2 tablespoons chopped lemon thyme leaves;
2-3 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary; 3 tablespoons fruity olive oil.
Grate all the lemon zest, mix it with the herbs and olive oil. Cut half the
lemon into thin slices, discard the pith and cut the flesh into small
triangular wedges. Add these to the oil mixture and leave to steep
overnight.
Just before serving, place the aromatic mixture in a flameproof casserole
over low heat. When warm, add the juice of the remaining half lemon. Swirl
to mix and remove from the heat. Quickly add the freshly boiled and drained
pasta and toss to mix, adding sea salt and pepper to taste.
Serve alone or hand round also a little bowl of freshly grated Parmesan -
but be cautious: too much Parmesan is a mistake. Its savoury richness may
detract from the sharp clean taste of citrus and herbs.
PASTA WITH ORIENTAL LEEKS (serves 2-3)
East meets West in this light and pretty dish.
6 oz penne or other small pasta shapes; 6 oz leeks (cleaned and trimmed
weight); 1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger root; 1 slightly heaped tablespoon
sesame seeds; a couple of spoonfuls each of olive oil and chopped coriander
leaves.
Slice the leeks across as finely as possible to make ribbony shreds. Chop
the ginger and coriander, and toast the sesame seeds.
Warm the oil in a flameproof casserole. Add the ginger and leeks and stir
for half a minute or so until glistening. Cover and soften gently for 2-3
minutes. Then add the sesame, coriander, cooked and drained pasta and a
seasoning of salt and pepper. Draw the dish away from the heat, toss to mix
well and serve.
POOR MAN'S FUSILLI (serves 2-3)
Fried breadcrumbs, which add agreeable crunch to this recipe, are sometimes
called poor man's Parmesan, hence the name of the dish.
6 oz fusilli or other pasta shapes; 2 oz breadcrumbs; 2 garlic cloves,
finely chopped; 2-2 1/2 oz celery leaves and tender young celery stalks,
finely chopped; a handful of chopped parsley; the grated zest of a lemon; 1
1/2 oz unsalted butter or 3 tablespoons olive oil.
Heat half the butter or oil in a flameproof casserole. Stir in the crumbs
and fry, stirring now and then, for several minutes until golden and crisp.
Remove and keep hot. Melt the rest of the fat and fry the garlic and celery.
Draw the casserole away from the heat. Add the cooked and drained pasta and
the parsley and toss to mix. Add the lemon zest, a seasoning of salt and
pepper, and the savoury fried crumbs. Toss again and serve without delay
while the crumbs are still crunchy.

Clothes often denote one's role in life. Would we be better off without

ACUTE embarrassment. That awful knotting of the muscles of the solar plexus.
The cold sweat. The desperate search for a route of escape, knowing there
can't be one. The rapid rehearsal of multiple excuses; anything to deflect
the pitying, amused, slightly startled glances of fellow guests. It's the
stuff of nightmares, but this is reality. I have come in the wrong clothes]
Yes, I have arrived for the party in a suit and tie when all my fellow
guests are in dinner jackets. But was there? wasn't there? a little note in
the corner of my invitation, 'lounge suit' or 'black tie', or (much the
smartest) 'don't bother to dress'? Hiding behind a large Appeal court judge
who looks me up and down and turns his back on me I swig my dry, oh so dry,
sherry, and take a surreptitious peep at my invitation card. Nothing. Thank
goodness] It's not my fault. I have been tricked, deceived by my hostess's
carelessness. I can explain.
But then the awful truth dawns. These people, all these loud confident
people in their black ties and these loud confident women in their
extraordinary asymmetrical dresses, they know without being told. They are
all instinctively wired for the nuances of dress appropriate at the time,
the place, the hostess. They know by instinct. And now they know I do not
belong. I am not one of them. And they are so kind, so understanding. I wish
I could die.
But next time. Ah, next time I will get it right. I will dig out my 1954
dinner jacket, brush off the verdigris, hunt desperately among the screws
and paperclips for my studs and arrive - yes, once again to find everyone
else in pastel polo-necked sweaters and pale, pale trousers sipping Campari
and orange from long thin glasses.
Getting it wrong. That's what clothes are all about. It must be just about
as old as Adam. (My dear, did you see Cain's fig leaf? At this time of day]
Really I don't know what will become of the fellow. And isn't Abel dishy?)
A huge amount of human time and attention has been devoted to the
demarcation of social groups and to the devising of indicators of status,
wealth or profession. The courts of the Manchu emperors had hundreds of
grades of hierarchy signified by buttons or tassels or rosettes on those
amazing hats or on the sleeves or hems of their grotesque robes.
Men were executed for getting it wrong. It is a process of natural
selection. The chap who doesn't know his tassels isn't the sort of chap to
make an 11th Grade Mandarin. Not reliable. Won't toe the line. Bad genes.
Off with his head.
In any hierarchical institution knowing one's place is essential if the
machinery is to work. Institutions function with roles which have designated
tasks allotted to them, regardless of who may be occupying the role. The
subtle differentiation of uniforms and their trimmings come to represent the
ordering of the institution, so any tampering with even the smallest part of
the signal system threatens to dismantle the whole complex edifice. Hence,
the seemingly ridiculous resistance of the judges to abandon their wigs and
all their 18th century paraphernalia. Take away one curl from a red judge's
topknot and it seems as if British Justice will collapse.
But there is more to it than silly traditionalism. The wig denotes the role.
Beneath the wig hides the man, or, aha] the woman. Inside the role lurks the
human being, the quirky, passionate, vulnerable, prejudiced and all too
human being.
That man (or woman) under the wig had odd ideas, eccentric intuitions and
deep feelings, but not the judge. He and she (but not His or Her Honour the
Judge) has sexual longings, despairs and hatreds. She had a father who
abused her (but not the judge) who happens to look just like this nasty
fellow in the dock. He (but not the judge) had a daughter who left home and
was the spitting image of this girl up before him now. The institution need
the role, the role needs the clothes, the clothes must cover up the human
being.
Uniforms defend the institution against the vagaries of the human heart.
Only those with supreme confidence in the rightness of their own personal
vision can afford to care nothing about clothes. They are usually madmen,
geniuses, or, according to P G Woodhouse, peers of the realm, especially
earls.
In my own calling clothes are curiously important. I am, after all, a 'man
of the cloth'. I may deride the nobles of the splendid courts of eastern
emperors in all their meticulous finery, but sartorial signals of hierarchy
litter the ecclesiastical wardrobe both in and out of church. In church we
all dress up like Welsh wizards, wear funny hats (if we are top persons) and
embroidered duvets.
We keenly eye the exact length of lace on the surplice or cotta worn by the
cleric in front of us in the procession as a sure indicator of it's wearer's
theological position or status. Buttons down the front of cassocks are High,
but not as High as birettas (a hat, not 007's gun); but high collars are
Low. Grey stocks are liberal; a white-knotted tie and soft shirt is Oxbridge
agnostic/radical. Sandals are social-gospel Franciscan; brown suede shoes
socialite HTB charismatic. Fun, isn't it?
The arrival of women on the scene has added delicious complications. They
have to have specially cut shirts and stocks, and the pin-striped assistants
in the ecclesiastical outfitters perspire pinkly as they circle those
glorious but unfamiliar contours with their trembling measuring tapes. But
within those limits the uniform remains austerely unchanged.
The cultural shock of seeing earrings swinging above the cassock and
high-heeled shoes peeping out under the hem has been considerable. But it is
soon dispersed by the recognition of the uniform which designated a familiar
role - the vicar. The uniform is unisex, androgynous.
Here is not just a man, not just a woman, but a minister of the church, yes,
in many places now a priest, whose private feelings, sex and personality are
veiled to give place and power to the role. That accounts for the lubricious
shock-horror which always accompanies the disclosure in the tabloids that
sex still goes on under the cassock. But it equally accounts for the fact
that the ministry of women clergy is readily accepted once it has been
experienced. What it will be like when we see a mass of auburn curls under a
mitre I am not sure.
There are dangers too. Tyrants put their subjects into uniform as prisons do
and give them numbers not names. It is a form of depersonalising control, a
step towards robotics. Wearing a uniform is a sign of submission as well as
membership. Individual choice of bright colours or personal style are, like
laughter, a sign of freedom. Tyrants and authoritarian institutions forbid
them.
Men and women in professional roles in hierarchical institutions can easily
get eaten up by their roles. The judge becomes judicial at home, the
schoolmaster a domestic didact, the priest a professional Good Man whose
implacable saintliness becomes intolerable to his spouse who longs for some
good red-blooded lust or rage to prove the man is still alive inside the
cloth.
As some great civic services I sometimes let my eye wander along the rows of
judges, mayors and generals, the lords lieutenant, sheriffs, bishops and
archdeacons in all their amazing, dotty, ceremonial robes, and think what
fun it would be to invite them all to a party in a sauna. What human truths,
what unexpected delights would come bubbling to the surface in the tranquil
steam? And what fun to write in the corner of each invitation 'Don't bother
to dress.'
Well, why not? After all that's the kind of invitation God has extended to
all of us from Adam onwards.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Fashion: In hard times it pays to be a second-hand rose -
Sasha Jensen scours the racks and rails for some designer bargains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SASHA JENSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE price of a new autumn wardrobe seems liable to cause irretrievable
damage to your bank account then perhaps you should consider buying
second-hand.
Not only does it make economic sense; it also fits in with these
recessionary times. Whereas it used to be smart to buy a glamorous, glitzy
and dramatic suit, nowadays it is much more subtle to create a less
manufactured, more individual look.
Many clothes these days are designed to look second-hand before they leave
the shop. Seams and stitching have been purposely carved to create a warm,
worn feeling. Besides which, designer pieces can be given a lift and new
life by mixing them with second-hand items.
There are a few second-hand shops in London which specialise in only the
very best high fashion designer labels. But second-hand clothes shopping is
difficult - you have to know where to go and how the system works. It is not
the same as buying something from a store that has several different sizes
of the same outfit. If you see a design you like it is a matter of chance
whether it comes in your size or not.
Second-hand clothes shopping is a business in itself. The name of the game
is recycling. People with clothes to sell bring them in to the shop hoping
to receive a decent price for their once-loved garments. Shop managers
inspect the garment for any marks or stains. If the item has been worn
before, it must be cleaned.
Most second-hand clothes shops operate a cash-on-sale policy. Mark-ups vary.
Some managers will discuss with the customer how much she/he wishes the
articles to sell for and then agree a mark-up.
The most important feature of the second-hand trade is the quick turnover
that it demands. Clothes can change hands from one owner to the next in a
matter of minutes. The best buys are usually found by those who pop in often
to their favourite shops.
Pandora, at 16-22 Cheval Place in Knightsbridge, is a good place to start
looking for top designer labels at second-hand prices. Its clothes range
from cat-walk couture to Levi's 501's and T-shirts, from hats to two-piece
suits.
The shop has a clear, organised layout which makes it easy for the shopper
to find her way around. Clothes are organised according to particular
designers, types of material or season of the year.
There is a section for Chanel, for example, a silk group with blouses and
skirts, a rainwear and coat section (with names such as Valentino and
Georgio Armani), a waistcoat section and many more.
Pandora has been in business for more than 40 years and has a wide circle of
customers; buyers and sellers.
'The customers rummage through their wardrobes and bring anything they think
is in good condition and is worth selling and will no longer be missed,'
says manageress Fay Hutchcroft. This keeps the shop constantly busy. As the
larger department stores move into autumn shades and patterns, so does
Pandora.
Items available this month included a Karl Lagerfeld tweed two-piece suit
(last season's); a Nichole Farhi navy blazer and skirt that you might wear
to work; a Nichole Farhi wool and fake fur coat which is in other shops this
year but is half the price at Pandora.
Designs, at 60 Rosslyn Hill, Hampstead, north London, is a second-hand shop
which caters for everything that looks designerish but does not necessarily
sport a known label. The clothes are all in excellent condition with blue
tickets for the new clothes and white for the nearly-new ones.
There are lots of blazers and coats. This month, for example, there was a
beautiful tweed, black check jacket with matching trousers by YSL (Pounds
199.00); a Donna Karan silk trouser suit (Pounds 199.00); Giorgio Armani
herringbone tweed jacket (Pounds 169.00). There are some cheaper buys by
names such as Whistles and Joseph. There are waistcoats and skirts, shirts
and trousers - a whole rail for each. Designs also stocks some exciting
evening wear: gowns for balls, frocks for dinner parties and cocktail
dresses for elegant Hampstead soirees.
Sometimes clothes brought in in the morning are sold by the afternoon.
Manageress Dominique Cussens says that with the recession there is much less
stigma attached to buying second-hand. 'Why spend Pounds 100 on a Next suit
when you can quite easily have your always-dreamed-of high quality Yves St
Laurent suit for Pounds 150?'
The Dress Box, Cheval Place, Knightsbridge is next door to Pandora's. This
small but captivating shop specialises in haute couture clothes and big
designer names. It is sophisticated and more expensive than most.
'Many people don't even realise that we are a second-hand shop until they
see the shoes,' says Michael Lynn, the manager. Most of the clothes are in
remarkable condition. Some look as if they have never been worn at all.
Nothing over one year old is accepted and everything is impeccably cleaned.
Alterations can be made.
Pamela, of 93 Walton Street, London SW3, has been around for 20 years and is
a legend in the business. Pamela's policies for selling clothes are much the
same as those of The Dress Box: designer labels only, not more than 18
months old, kept no more than six weeks and the prices depend on the seller.
Some clients have a price in mind, others rely on the shop's advice. At
Pamela you are likely to find all the currently fashionable labels:
Valentino, Chanel, YSL (which usually lasts no more than half a day once on
the racks), Ungaro and plenty more.
It is round about now that the second-hand shops are at their busiest, when
those who wish to sell are sorting out their wardrobes and deciding what can
go and what should stay while those who are looking to buy come nosing
around for bargains. So, if your wardrobe needs a lift and you cannot afford
full retail prices, there is no time to lose.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Sport: A 90-minute act of penitence - Soccer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST week I did penance. I refereed a football match. It was cold and windy
and it rained hard. I was sworn at and my decisions were disputed, often
with good reason. Still, it could have been worse. It did not hail and
no-one hit me.
After the game most of the players came up and thanked me. There is no
contradiction in this. They moaned at me non-stop for 90 minutes but they
knew that without me the game could have been much worse (and, under the
rules of the Southern Olympian League, it would not have counted.) That is
why I refereed. Next time my team plays at home I shall be playing, one of
my team-mates will referee and I will moan at him when opposing forwards
beat our offside trap.
The most depressing aspect of the refereeing was not the abuse, it was the
inescapable reminder of my own fallibility and powerlessness. I started well
enough. I blew my whistle hard and waved my arms emphatically for every
decision. I was a man who had done this before, at least five times. I was
in control and could afford to let the game flow. (Although, the SOL Minor
division E is not known for dirty play). When things go well, says David
Ellery, a top international referee, 'you are like a conductor of an
orchestra just making things flow.' That was me. The Leonard Bernstein of
Clitterhouse playing fields.
But discordant notes began to creep in. I was 40 yards away, my lenses
smeared with rain - refs can't win, either it's 'get glasses' or 'you blind
four-eyed git' - when one team stopped obviously thinking the ball was out.
The other team carried on. By the time I noticed, it was too late. Suddenly,
the throw-in I missed had turned into a long ball upfield had turned into a
cross into the penalty area had turned into a goal and oh-dear-me I'm
pointing at the centre spot, filled with doubt and guilt.
Worse, is the abuse of trust by the players. There are always some who try
to undermine the referee's fragile self-confidence; claiming every throw-in,
arguing with every free kick. I am here for their benefit trying to stay
unnoticed while they play football. Suddenly they want to fight instead. Our
creative midfield player is taking the law into his own feet and kicking and
shoving his robust opposite number. It is difficult not to feel betrayed.
In some respects I have it easy. Our solitary fan offers me his advice:
'Send him off.' At least I am not the object of relentless scrutiny from
television cameras, synchronised abuse from 30,000 fans and sly comments at
post-match press conferences by managers.
Nick Hornby, author of Fever Pitch, a book about life as an Arsenal fan,
includes among his conditions for a great game: 'Outrageously bad refereeing
decisions: I prefer Arsenal to be the victim . . .Indignation is a crucial
ingredient of the perfect footballing experience; I cannot therefore agree
with match commentators who argue that the referee has had a good game if he
isn't noticed. I prefer to notice them and howl at them and feel cheated by
them.'
Ellery says: 'The crowd doesn't bother me. It is easy to block out 40,000
people, by the time you hear their reaction you've given a decision.'
But he accepts that the linesman, trapped on the touchline close to the
crowd, takes more abuse, especially from determined hecklers, the strange
cases who pepper every soccer crowd and use the match as 90 minutes of
psychotherapy.
At Arsenal two years ago, when Liverpool were the visitors, the opening
kick-off was lofted down the wing. Two players collided and the ball bounced
off the field. The linesman indicated a Liverpool throw. The match was five
seconds old, the ball had been touched thrice and a smartly-dressed
middle-aged man behind me was on his feet and bellowing. 'You got that
(swear word) wrong you (swear word swear word) linesman. You'll feel a right
(swear word) when you see that on the (swear word) video.' He sustained this
rage without a break until half time, when I moved seats.
At Luton last season, I watched a game against Everton, listening to a man
in a suit berating officials. One stretch of dull play was interrupted by a
throw to Luton, his team. This did not deter him. 'Linesman]' he shrieked.
'You're holding the flag in the wrong hand.'
'They pay their money,' says Ellery. 'If they want to spend Pounds 9 to
scream at me that's fine.'
But what about the players? If my division E amateurs give me such a hard
time what about professionals whose livings depend on the result?
'Some games are continuous battles between players and yourself,' says
Ellery. With players 'complaining about decisions. Plus there is the
increasing over-reaction to foul tackles, the diving and the conning.'
Even top referees are amateurs - although even at SOL level it is considered
good manners for the home team to give them Pounds 20 or so in expenses.
This gives professional footballers and managers another stick to beat them
with. 'Bringing in professional referees would be one of the best things to
happen in football,' said Joe Kinnear, the Wimbledon manager. 'They would
appreciate how players feel and react if they worked at it seven days a week
and their livelihoods depended on it.'
So why do referees do it? Are they power mad? 'I would be worried by anyone
who wanted to control 22 people,' said Ken Ridden, the Football
Association's director of refereeing.
Ellery renounced playing for refereeing at 13. 'I wasn't a gifted player.
Because I was young I got some publicity. At university it provided a small
source of income to an impoverished student. I enjoyed the physical
involvement and set myself high targets.' He has met those targets, even if
they are not measured in winners medals.
'I get a greater buzz because of the atmosphere, the crowd and the standard
of play. You get a great buzz being on the field with great players in your
own right.'
Ellery referees 40 professional games a season. He is a house master at
Harrow, the prestigous public school in north London. He says the refereeing
gives him a break from the pressures of his job and his work keeps his mind
off football. But he is incorrigible. On his free Saturdays he even referees
school rugby games.
Next time I'm down to referee at Clitterhouse I think I'll give him a call
to see if he is free.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Sport: Dreamers go back to work - The new season facing the
Olympic stars / Basketball
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REMEMBER the 'Dream Team'?
The superstar American basketball players who dazzled the world on their way
to a gold medal in the Barcelona Olympics are back at work. The 'Dream' is
just a distant, if happy memory of three weeks in Spain, and the 'Team' is
no more, just a collection of individuals preparing to face the rigours of
the 82-game National Basketball Association season that opens this week.
The memory of the Olympic gold has faded fast.
The way the Dream Team has been treated since the Games suggests that the
Olympics and professionalism remain awkward bedfellows.
The swimmers, divers and gymnasts who captivated audiences in August are
still celebrated. In contrast, after a brief flurry of chat-show
appearances, the basketball stars returned to their traditional summer
pastimes of golf, fishing and more golf.
For amateur competitors, Barcelona was the peak of their careers. The same
cannot be said for the Dream Team, for whom the Games were as much about
spreading the basketball gospel and selling sneakers as they were about
personal athletic achievement.
It is too early to tell if the Olympics will effect the performance of Dream
Team players. The Olympics meant they had barely two months' rest, so
fatigue could be factor later this season: perhaps in the playoffs next
spring.
A few players enter the season carrying injuries from their Spanish
adventure. Patrick Ewing, the towering star of the Knicks, is suffering the
most. He damaged his ankle at the end of last season, carried the injury
through the Olympics and has yet to recover fully. A weak ankle is not
something a 7ft, 240lb athlete wants to nurse through a long season that
gives teams little more than 24 or 48 hours' rest between games.
Ewing has other problems - such as remembering his teammates' names. The
Knicks' management was busy during the off-season. Only two of last season's
starting five have survived the shake-up, and nearly half a dozen back-up
players have been replaced.
The key signing is Rolando Blackman. He is reknowned for his defensive
qualities, Michael Jordan - the league's best player - says Blackman is the
toughest defender he has ever faced, and he is a scoring threat from long
range. Ewing's strength means opponents have to pack their defence under the
basket to stop him. The one thing the Knicks lacked last season was someone
who could exploit the space Ewing created and score with shots from
distance. Blackman could be the missing ingredient to turn the Knicks into
the championship contender New York has dreamed of since the early 1970s.
Two others who will have to learn the names of new teammates are Christian
Laettner, the Dream Team's token college player, who is starting his
professional career with the lowly Minnesota Timberwolves, and Charles
Barkley, who has moved from the under-achieving Philadelphia 76ers to the
Phoenix Suns.
True to form, Barkley was the bad boy of the Olympics. He elbowed a tiny
Angolan opponent and then joked that he was scared his victim might have
been carrying 'a spear somewhere'. In spite of his thuggery, Barkley is a
great player and could make the Suns contenders.
At the time of the move Barkley was unusually restrained. He said: 'Phoenix
is not a bad place. I could play golf every day.'
But he sounded a note of caution: 'The only thing that worries me is the
people out in Phoenix. They are so excited. They're already ordering
championship rings. Slow down]'
Barkley started his Phoenix career in typical style: thrown out of his first
exhibition game for excessive violence.
Among the other Olympians, Larry Bird, the lanky, lumbering genius who
played for Boston, has retired because of a bad back. Jordan returns to lead
the champion Chicago Bulls, chastened only by the embarrassing experience of
being called as a witness in a drug and money laundering trial, and
admitting to the court that over the course of one weekend a year ago he
lost Dollars 57,000 at golf and poker to the defendant.
Probably the biggest short-term impact of the Dream Team, was the lift it
gave to Earvin 'Magic' Johnson. Delighted as he was to win a gold medal,
Johnson won something more in Barcelona - the confidence to return to the
NBA after retiring last year when he found he was HIV positive.
Although there are still doubts over his ability to cope with the physical
demands of the league's schedule, Johnson will once again lead the Los
Angeles Lakers this season. He has, however, agreed to take it relatively
easy. If all goes well, he should appear in 50 or 60 games, bringing that
special magic which the NBA missed so much last season.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Sport: Breakfast with a champion - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS

<TEXT>
GARY Player was face down on the floor of his hotel room. He had one hand
resting in the small of his back while the other supported him as he did
one-arm press ups. His mouth was no more than an inch or two from the carpet
as he talked. 'When you do a one-arm press up you have got to have your
belly button and your nose on the ground at the same time.' Up and down went
the figure on the floor as if it was the easiest exercise in the world. 'You
must keep your back straight otherwise it does not do you any good.'
Then Player sprang to his feet, a blob of colour in his cheeks betraying the
exertions. He will be 57 tomorrow but he looked ten years younger. He sat on
the edge of his bed and peered critically at the breakfast that had just
been brought to his room. He did not like what he saw. 'Did I ask for butter
and white toast? I was sure I wanted wholewheat toast. And cornflakes and
sliced banana.' He sighed. 'At least they did not bring me coffee.'
Food is a fetish with Player, not the quantity but the quality. 'Many people
eat so much junk food they might as well poison themselves,' he said. 'I
avoid animal fats, bacon, sausages, ice cream. I eat meat once every three
weeks. Same with butter. If I do not stay fit I cannot play golf. I have a
beer every two months and a whisky every three months. I drink herbal teas.
At 50 I vowed I would start to lose weight, not put it on. And I have done
that. I weighed 165lbs in 1965 and 150lbs last year.'
On his visit to London his face was tanned from a brief stay at a coastal
resort in South Africa. His black hair, with its high parting, was neatly
combed. He looked dated, like a 1950s film star. His dark brown eyes were
clear, his hands as leathery as a worn saddle.
Player was on his way to the US for a long tilt at the US Senior tour, which
has proved such an attraction for so many golfers once they pass their 50th
birthday. Player, Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus once formed the Big Three
in golf and Player was by no means overshadowed by the Americans. He is one
of only four men to have won the US Masters, US Open, US PGA and the Open
titles at least once. In all, he has won nine major titles. Somehow, though,
the overriding image of him is of a small, determined man who has had to
fight for everything.
Player has such a positive view about life he could almost be Norman Vincent
Peale reincarnated. Nothing is ever wrong in Player's world. There is some
merit in everything. Every golf course he has ever played on has something
good about it. He once said that the flagsticks on a certain course were the
finest he had ever seen.
Aphorisms and homilies and plain old wives' talk all tumble from Player's
mouth. In crises he quotes Psalm 23 to himself, particularly the section
about walking through the valley of the shadow of death. He reads and
rereads the Book of Proverbs.
'There is no gain without pain' is one of his favourite sayings.
'If you don't stay fit you can't perform' is another.
'Don't write me off' has practically become his battle cry.
'Golf is a friend-making machine,' he says.
'It's funny isn't it that the harder I practise, the luckier I get.'
If this suggests a man who sees his life as a series of challenges that he
has to overcome, then that is not far from the truth. Indeed he admits as
much. 'When I go to the first tee I am getting into the ring,' he has said.
'I am climbing through the ropes. There is no difference between me and a
champion boxer.'
Player has been travelling for 33 years and estimates he has covered 8m
miles. He has won nearly 200 tournaments around the world. He has always
been a driven man; he remains a driven man. 'I employ 150 staff worldwide.
That is quite a pay cheque for a little old country boy,' he says. He has a
design company building courses around the world, owns farms in South Africa
and has horses in training. A company of his makes golf clubs bearing the
legend 'The Black Knight'.
Much of the success or otherwise of these ventures rested on the shoulders
of this man in a blue blazer and flannels sitting in an hotel room near
London airport. 'When I first started travelling we had 32 pieces of
luggage, an English nurse and we needed three taxis to get us all around.'
He smiled and stood up. His breakfast lay untouched. One suitcase and a big
bag of clubs stood near the door. Another aeroplane was waiting. Another
journey was about to begin.

WHILE WE await the last week of the American election, John Humphrys, the
BBC's Washington correspondent two decades ago, presents in The Fading Dream
(Radio 4, Wed) a sketch of the electorate as he now sees it. In Seattle,
that once knew 'the highest quality of life' in the land, beggars sell
ten-dollar charity vouchers to buy drink. In a two-square-mile quarter of
Los Angeles, there are eight rival gangs of armed youths. Two-thirds of the
State are against immigration, including, no doubt, the blacks who harass
the Koreans.
Further east, the citizens of Sinclair Lewis's 'Main Street' fight the
prospect of a five-lane main street through the middle of their community.
At Ellsworth Base, South Dakota, the guardians of the ICBMs must soon seek
new jobs when the base is closed. Four-fifths of the people reckon
themselves worse off than under Reagan. It sounds very different from the
television views of the campaign.
Looking elsewhere for serious commitment to current affairs, I found that
Tuesday afternoon's Radio 4 play, The Legs that Came in from the Cold by
Karoline Leach, was unexpectedly about radio-active material and based on a
true story. Casual thieves bluff their way into a reprocessing plant and
steal a van-load of 'metal rods', that are in fact plutonium. Their boss
realises what he has got and offers a media story. No one cares but a
pacifist group, Rainbow Peace. The 'rods' have meanwhile been dumped on a
council site, removed for recycling and made into table legs. It is quite
fun, but not truthful enough. Serious commitment to current affairs, no.
Director, Nigel Bryant.
Conscience takes me to Radio 5 now and then, and I had a look round the
week's evening rivals to homework. At 6.30 yesterday was Greywing, closely
descended from Superman. Nigel puts on this grey kit to do good deeds in.
This week, tipped off by girlfriend Judy in the local radio station, he
saves the local ice-cream king from sabotage by a rival. Colin Swash
directed.
At 7.15, Pie in the Sky by David Campton, read by Philip Hawthorn. A girl
gourmet, Buster, is kidnapped to a new planet, to tell the inhabitants how
food tastes and smells, pleasures they lack. She fights back with a battery
of hot items like curry and horseradish. At 7.15 daily from Monday to
Thursday came a four-part tale, The Water Horse, by Dick King Smith, read by
John Gordon Sinclair. The eponymous creature was found in its egg by
Kirstie, who took it home and put it in the bath, where it hatched - and
demanded its keep.
At 9.30, also on Monday, we had the first part of a thriller for those that
have finished their homework, or indeed their elders. Run Man Run, adapted
from a novel by Chester Himes, is set in Harlem in the 1950s. Black Jimmy
(Eamonn Walker) is cleaning a diner on the night shift when a drunken white
cop, looking for his stolen car, breaks in, shoots two of his mates and
wounds him. He recovers in hospital, but the cop is still after him, to make
sure he doesn't tell about the shootings. Three more parts to know what
happens.
For the grown-ups, there was John Arden's Armstrong's Last Goodnight on
Sunday, on Radio 3 - quarrelsome matter, between Scottish King James V and
English King Henry VIII at the top level, between the fighting Borderer John
Armstrong and his neighbours at a lower. To summarise a complex tale, rich
in extraneous incident, Armstrong was treacherously betrayed to the young
king by Sir David Lindsay, for supposed help to the English. The king had
promised him friendship, but had him hanged. Arden's wordy script is in
Lowland Scots. I found its 200 minutes dull on the Chichester stage in 1965,
and its 120 minutes dull on radio. Adaption by Bennett Maxwell, direction by
Stewart Conn.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Arts: Attendance up prices down - Nicholas Powell talks to
dealers at Paris's contemporary art fair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING at Paris's huge annual contemporary art fair, the FIAC (Foire
International d'Art Contemporain) officially totalled FFrs 400m in 1989,
dipped to FFrs 300m a year later and in 1991 came to only FFrs 200m.
Attendance at this year's 19th FIAC, which closes tomorrow night, was huge,
and prices the lowest in years. Yet most of the 162 dealers will consider
themselves lucky is they cover costs.
Andrew Kalman of London's Crane Kalman Gallery, one of five British dealers
present and a first timer at at the FIAC, sold seven works, including three
by London based South African artist Jenny Franklin and two by Mary Newcomb,
both virtually unknown in Paris.
Leslie Waddington of Cork Street's Waddington Galleries meanwhile was more
upbeat, reporting a turnover of nearly Pounds 600,000 - three times what he
expected - by the middle of last week. 'We have been utterly amazed to get
out of London, which is dead and depressed, to discover people who look at
paintings and are ready to spend money, too' he said.
Twenty-five Italian galleries were guests of honour of this year's FIAC:
Galleria Annunciata of Milan showed 23 drawings, museum worthy (if not
exactly contemporary) by the futurist Carlo Carra, dated 1910-15 priced at
FFrs 120-150,000. Sperone of Rome showed the most recent work of Mimmo
Paladino - five unusually small canvases mounted in box-like frames
resembling medieval altar pieces for FFrs 200,000. Artiaco from Naples
brought recent work by arte povera artists such as Anselmo - two huge
granite blocks strung perilously over a canvas on steel wire - and Penone.
Germany's 15 galleries shone by the pluck and the quality of their
exhibitions: Springer from Berlin showed the harsh, photographic work of
Deiter Appelt and steel sculptures by Prague-born Vladimir Skoda.
Sfoir-Semler from Keil juxtaposed works by Scottish sculptor Ian Hamilton
Finlay, former Cobra painter Lucebert and the first wire sculptures by
Gunter Haese to be seen on the market for a long time.
Denise Rene, France's most active champion of abstract art since the war,
organised a display of works, full of moving parts, flashing lights and
optical illusion, by the op artists she first promoted when they were
unknowns in the 1960s and '70s such as Vardanega, Schoffer, Boto, Demarco
and Garcia Rossi. Nearby, Galerie Gmurzynska from Cologne had an array of
drawings and oils by Russian futurists Malevitch, Souetin and Tshashnik.
The recession is at least encouraging galleries to back younger talent.
Willy d'Huysser from Brussels gave the work of Glasgow-born Calum Colvin,
famous elsewhere in Europe but not in France, its first airing in the
country. Paris's Gutharc Ballin mounted a one man show of large abstract
figures in bright velvet and wood by British artist Stephen Hepworth. Aline
Vidal from Paris showed melancholy photomontage works by the German Edmund
Kuppel at FFrs 25-50,000 alongside sculptures and drawings by a little known
35 year old Frenchman, Jean-Marc Andrieu, for FFrs 5-50,000. Air de Paris, a
gallery from Nice, showed work by Philippe Perrin - a French artist whose
offerings included paintings of Sarajevo done in blood at FFRs 4,000 each.
Leading contemporary dealer and FIAC veteran Holly Solomon from New York
said she had once again made exciting contacts with collectors and curators.
'Four years ago there were runners making a fortune selling from one stand
to another. But I sell to collectors, not speculators and my prices have not
dropped because they were never inflated. The market has not gone to pot.
Now is the time to buy. If you have the money,' she said.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Arts: 'Assassins' on song
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST, the very good news. The Donmar Warehouse in Covent Garden has
re-opened and looks immaculate. This is the second theatre in London's West
End to emerge from refurbishment in the last few weeks. The other is the
Criterion in Piccadilly Circus, which will concentrate on bringing the best
of the London fringe to the centre of the capital.
Donmar, which seats only around 250 people, will spread its net wider. Under
the artistic direction of Sam Mendes, it will maintain informal links with
the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theatre, and will also
bring in other comapnies, domestic and foreign. To have two theatres
resurfacing in central London at a time of prolonged economic depression is
a gratifying sign of evolution: the West End is adapting to the need for
smaller places with better shows.
The only slightly less good news is that Assassins, the musical by Stephen
Sondheim and John Weidman, is not at all the disaster that that some New
York critics suggested. One can see why it flopped off-Broadway last year.
Since the subject is the tendency of Americans to try to assassinate their
President in the name of liberty, it was perhaps tactless to put it on
during the first week of the Gulf War when patriotism was at its height.
Assassins remains a macabre piece even in peacetime, but it does have
merits. For a start, it is a considerably better musical than (say) Kiss of
the Spider Woman. The music is distinctive and disciplined; the words are
meant to be heard and make sense. This is a cerebral show, not an expensive
B-movie.
The theme beneath the subject is clever. It is that over time there have
been a lot of assassination attempts on American Presidents, some
successful, some not. Is there something in the American idea of freedom
that includes, even invites, the freedom to shoot the President? And what is
it that binds this band of would-be assassins? Certainly there is not much
in the conspiracy theory.
John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated President Lincoln, was an actor.
Initially he was part of a small conspiratorial group, but in the end he
acted alone. And so it went on; subsequent assassins had scarcely the
suspicion of a group behind them. Even Lee Harvey Oswald, who shot President
Kennedy, seems after manifold investigations to have been a loner. John
Hinckley, who tried to kill President Reagan, had previously thought of
having a go at President Carter and Senator Edward Kennedy. He was trying to
impress the actress Jodie Foster, whose movie Taxi Driver he had seen 15
times.
Assassins goes through the lot of them. The unifying idea is that trying to
shoot the President is a way of drawing attention to yourself. 'Murder is
small', says one of them: assassination puts you in the history books. Among
the best episodes is Charles Guiteau who wanted to be ambassador to France
under President Garfield. When the President ignored him, Guiteau shot him.
In the musical, Guiteau (Henry Goodman), who had an evangelical bent, climbs
to the gallows singing a wonderfully cheerful song about looking on the
bright side and 'I'm going to the Lordy'.
There is also Samuel Byck (Ciaran Hinds) who planned to incinerate President
Nixon by crashing a jumbo jet on the White House. 'It's going to make the
news,' he tells Leonard Bernstein in a marvellous telephone call.
One could go on. It is all very American, down to the inevitable where were
you on the day that Kennedy died, and full of musical in-jokes. But what's
wrong with that? Sam Mendes directs; the musical director is Jeremy Sams.
Who could ask for more - or at least much more?
Donmar Warehouse until January 9. (071) 867 1150

FT  31 OCT 92 / Arts: Sir Kenneth MacMillan - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR KENNETH MacMillan, principal choreographer of Royal Ballet, collapsed
and died backstage at Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, on Thursday. He was
aged 62.
One of the most influential as well as the most challenging of modern
choreographers, MacMillan sought throughout his career to extend the
boundaries of classical dancing so that it might reflect the psychological
climate of his time. He gave ballet, and especially the repertory of the
Royal Ballet, a new seriousness, and an emotional honesty rare in an art
which he found to be often no more than 'window-dressing' when he started
his career as a young dancer with the Sadler's Wells Ballet.
Kenneth MacMillan was born in Dunfermline on December 11 1929. His childhood
was, as he said, emotionally distressing, and dancing became a means both of
expression and of escape. He applied for admission to the Sadler's Wells
Ballet School, and his first stage appearance was in the production of The
Sleeping Beauty with which the Sadler's Wells Ballet reopened the Royal
Opera House, Covent Garden, in 1946.
MacMillan's professional experience came initially as a member of the
Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet which Ninette de Valois established at this
time as a nursery for talent. Here MacMillan was recognised as a gifted
classical dancer and a performer of fine romantic presence, and he moved
between this 'second' company and the Opera House troupe, memorably seen in
Balanchine's Ballet Imperial as well as in roles created for him.
But he became increasingly unhappy as a dancer, and in the early 1950s he
made his choreographic debuts in workshop performances. These revealed
undoubted talent, and it is not without significance that his earliest
choreography, Somnambulism, dealt with dreams and emotional unease. His
first professional work, Danses Concertantes, was seen at Sadler's Wells
Theatre in 1955. A dazzling display of inventiveness by a young man
intoxicated with movement, it told of an outstanding creative gift.
There followed a series of commandingly assured pieces for both halves of
what was now the Royal Ballet. Yet even in these early productions MacMillan
was seeking a way towards a more expressive movement language, and a style
that reflected the psychological awareness of the current cinema and
theatre.
The Invitation in 1960, which dealt with adolescent sexuality and marital
unhappiness, identified the seriousness with which MacMillan could explore
the human condition, and his skill in finding dance imagery to expose
feeling. The Rite of Spring (1962) showed his ability to handle large
forces; and with his celebrated realisation of Romeo and Juliet in 1965,
MacMillan displayed a mastery of that full-length creativity which was to be
recognised as central to the identity of The Royal Ballet.
In the following year MacMillan was invited to become director of the ballet
company at the Deutsche Oper in West Berlin. He was joined there by Lynn
Seymour, whose outstanding lyric and dramatic gifts were admirably attuned
to MacMillan's ideals. He was to make many roles for her during the two
decades of their artistic association, including Juliet, and in Berlin she
sustained both the classical repertory which he re-staged, and his one-act
creation Anastasia.
In 1970 MacMillan was invited back to London to assume the directorship of
The Royal Ballet. The next seven years were not easy for him. He was both
administrative director and chief choreographer, though he invited several
other creators to work for the company.
The failure by certain sections of the press to understand the full-length
Anastasia which he produced in 1971 wounded him, and some of his work at
this time was given a mixed reception - even Manon, which has won a lasting
place in the repertory, was initially misunderstood. Nevertheless, under his
guidance, the Royal Ballet was a strong, secure ensemble.
In 1977 MacMillan retired from the directorship in order to concentrate upon
creativity, and his staging of Mayerling in the next year was proof that,
freed from the weight of administration, he was able to produce a new
grandly-scaled work of exceptional power.
His shorter ballets throughout this time asserted his continuing concern
with shaping a dance language that could touch the most serious concerns of
the human spirit. Works as varied as Requiem; Song of the Earth; My Brother,
My Sisters; Valley of Shadows and Winter Dreams told of MacMillan's rare
imaginative force in devising movement. With the full-length Isadora of 1981
he essayed a bravura portrait of modern dance's Earth Mother in the
framework of a daring staging. With Prince of the Pagodas (1989) he paid
tribute to the ideals of Petipa's classicism which were the bed-rock of his
own craft.
In all his work MacMillan was guided by a notable sense of integrity. He
would not, could not, compromise either his talent or his beliefs about the
nature of ballet and his duties towards the Royal Ballet. He understood
choreography in the larger context of the theatre, and wanted ballet to be
clearly part of that theatre. His ability to clothe the psychology of his
characters in ravishing, or searing, or haunting movement, was always
theatrically vivid. His fascination with movement, and with its expressive
potential, was a constant of his creative life. As an analyst he could probe
unerringly into a personality; it was our ballet's good fortune that he
could show what he discovered in such vital dance terms.
His works were staged and admired around the world - during the 1980s
MacMillan was an artistic advisor to American Ballet Theatre - and they
remain one of the most potent examples of 20th-century ballet's expressive
ability. His last ballet, The Judas Tree, produced for the Royal Ballet in
March of this year, characteristically showed how MacMillan could find
increasingly powerful means of exploring the psyche through a dance language
of exceptional precision and expressive force.
Kenneth MacMillan was married to the Australian painter Deborah Williams,
and they had a daughter, Charlotte.
It is assumed that Sir Kenneth's death occurred as a result of a heart
attack. He was at the Royal Opera House for the revival of Mayerling, which
was receiving a magnificent performance from a cast headed by Irek
Mukhamedov. As the curtain calls began, Jeremy Isaacs, General Director of
the Opera House, came on stage with Anthony Dowell, director of the Royal
Ballet, to announce Sir Kenneth's death. The audience stood, heads bowed for
a silent tribute, and left without speaking.
I met Kenneth MacMillan at the time of his first professional ballet, Danses
Concertantes, in 1955, and thereafter our friendship was an abiding joy for
me. His creative career was charted with sympathy and admiration in these
pages: Andrew Porter offered most perceptive appreciation of his work from
the very first, and as his successor in the 1970s I also hoped to convey the
significance of the innovations, the intense perceptions, that marked
MacMillan's choreography. There was an understanding between us, though,
that MacMillan never discussed his work: criticism was unguided by anything
save an interest in the way he extended the boundaries of classic dance as
an expressive language for the theatre.
As a choreographer he was, in his most searching works, custodian of a gift,
his genius, which took possession of him. He made what he made because he
had to. Superb theatre-craft was consciously his, and an unfailing ability
to shape new and stimulating movement, but the creative drive was
deep-seated and mysterious. Talking about The Judas Tree after its premiere,
he said to me 'I sometimes don't understand all that I've put into a ballet
until I've seen it on stage three or four times'.
Standing in silence in the Opera House on Thursday night, sharing the
tangible sense of shock that affected the audience, I remembered so much
about MacMillan. His marvellous ability to grasp the new; his iron
integrity; his humour, and his delight in the improbable and the ludicrous;
his faultless eye for a dancer and his lifelong devotion to the classic
dance. And, centrally, his great joy in his family life. His profound and
compassionate understanding of the human condition gave his choreography
abiding truth. His creations gave a new maturity to ballet in our time. They
are a vital part of our national heritage, and of the dance of our century.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Arts: A masterly 'Wozzeck' revived - Max Loppert enjoys the
ENO production of Berg's opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID Pountney's English National Opera production of Wozzeck, new two years
ago, is revived this season under the supervision of Nancy Duguid. It proves
once again an altogether masterly piece of opera-staging, full of ripe
singing-acting performances and sharply defined theatrical images, and
everywhere stamped by a confident clarity in stating and fusing both music
and drama which is even now a rarity in accounts of Berg's opera.
Down to the control of body-language - natural (but horribly down-cast)
movements for Wozzeck, Marie and the child, for everyone else a set of
precisely planned physical variations on themes of urban dehumanisation and
horror-comic dementia - the production team manifests a concern for
theatrical distinctness of vision that tells in every detail. The flat
planes, corrugated-iron surfaces, boxed-in apertures and split-level
division of Stefanos Lazaridis's single set, brilliantly imagined and
achieved, function simultaneously as space and symbol; the influence of
Grosz and Dix (socially critical cartoon-images of scathing grotesquerie)
and also of the early surrealists is apt, and fully absorbed.
One watches and listens enthralled but (as it were) at a remove: on the
simplest level, should not this of all operas harrow the spectator's
emotions more fiercely than it did mine at the Coliseum on Thursday?
Sometimes the actual events of the opera seem distanced - the brutality of
the Doctor, enacting his examination on the upper level, fails to land its
solar-plexus punch - while at other times the very sophistication of the
stage technique (as evidenced in the beautifully coloured water-visions of
the murder scene) seems to place an extra layer of 'art' between Berg's
already elaborately wrought structure and his audience.
No production of this miraculous, unrepeatable masterpiece offers
everything; and Pountney's deserves the highest praise for his determination
to 'translate' Berg's theatrical language, in all its forcefulness and
economical fluidity, onto this (for Wozzeck) inhospitably large stage. Most
of the original principals have returned for the revival: fine in 1990, they
show themselves still finer now, deeper, sharper-edged, more emotionally
robust. Donald Maxwell in the title role, singing with extraordinary
musicality and an encyclopaedic (but never self-consciously applied) range
of tone-colours, dominates the performance in a way only the best Wozzecks
can. In doing so, indeed, he provides the strongest argument for Pountney's
production style: he acts as its pivotal point.
Kristine Ciesinski, physically so much in the skin of Marie's desperate
lusts and also her searing, hopeless guilty outbursts, has refined her
singing still further - the voice spreads less and displays its natural
warmth even more. Alan Woodrow (a superbly powerful Captain) and Richard
Angas (an insidiously fascinating Doctor, albeit with unclear words) are
also welcome revenants; among the newcomers Ian Caley makes a great deal
more than one expected him to of Pountney's operetta-cliche Drum Major (the
single weakest element in the staging), and Alasdair Elliott's Andres is
lyrical and unforced.
The conductor, Richard Armstrong, is apparently less careful about letting
through the words of the Blackall-Harford translation than his predecessor,
Mark Elder, and less preoccupied with supply-shaped orchestral playing, but
even more gripped by the dramatic intensity of the music. The D-minor
Interlude burst over the theatre as it must, with shocking ferocity. Wozzeck
is never going to be anyone's idea of an operatic Good Night Out; to those
whose ambitions for the medium are more elevated, this ENO revival merits a
vigorous recommendation.
Revival sponsored by Peter Moores Foundation; in repertory until November 26

FT  31 OCT 92 / Arts: A chest for wild thoughts - Alannah Hopkin reads the
young Samuel Beckett's only novel, which is being published posthumously
next month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALANNAH HOPKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE APPEARANCE of Beckett's first novel, Dream of Fair to middling Women,
has been welcomed by Beckett scholars. There was a ripple of excitement when
the actor Barry McGovern read extracts from it last week at its launch in
The Dublin Writers' Museum.
It is published in Ireland with a print run of 8,000 by The Black Cat Press,
a small Dublin-based company, founded by a cardiologist and Beckett-expert,
Eoin O'Brien, who is also the novel's co-editor. Eoin O'Brien is best known
in literary circles for The Beckett Country, a collection of photographs and
texts illustrating the Irish origins of Beckett's work.
He was chosen as co-editor of the novel by Beckett's literary executor,
Jerome Lindon, and worked closely with Edith Fournier, a lifelong friend of
Beckett and sometimes his translator. Beckett had strong misgivings about
all his early, pre-war works. O'Brien says that the decision to publish
Dream of Fair to middling Women was not taken lightly, but its appearance
today 'is at Samuel Beckett's own behest, expressed to me in talks on the
subject between 1975 and 1989.' Samuel Beckett died in late 1989.
Beckett's English language publisher, John Calder, licensed this one
hardcover edition to The Black Cat Press, chiefly so that the editor could,
says Calder, 'bring out a very special edition according to his own
specifications.' Calder will be distributing the book for Black Cat in the
UK.
The 'special edition' is at first glance a rather plain 241-page hardback in
a dark green jacket; its specialness lies in the quality of its typesetting
and proof-reading, both formidable tasks as Beckett uses idiosyncrasies of
punctuation and spacing and writes in at least seven known languages; he
also coins neologisms at a rate exceeded only by James Joyce in Finnegans
Wake. 'Verbal exuberance' is a recurring phrase in critical assessments of
the work.
In fact, the non-specialist dipping into Dream could quite easily suspect
that it is an undiscovered work by Joyce. And yet, while it is undoubtedly
under his influence, the 26-year-old Beckett often prefigures the mature
writer: 'Doubt, Despair and Scrounging, shall I hitch my bath chair to the
greatest of these?' Lines from the poetry fly by; Belacqua is the main
character, as in More Pricks than Kicks, and the location is Beckett's
Dublin. At times it reads like the footnotes from Watt.
And these are more than echoes. Beckett called this useful outpuring 'the
chest into which I threw my wild thoughts,' a chest which he later
plundered, seeing no immediate prospect of the novel as it stood gaining
publication. Some of the stories from Dream were assembled with others and
published as More Pricks than Kicks. O'Brien claims that it also served as a
starting point for later works such as Happy Days and Krapp's Last Tape.
Eoin O'Brien believes that the book will have an appeal beyond the coterie
of specialists, pointing to Dream's 'youthful zest,' which he hopes will
attract younger readers. John Calder sees it as a clever student
showing-off, great fun to read, and very much a young man's book. Some of it
is very funny, some of it is quite rude. It is a book without much in the
way of restraint, whereas later on he became very restrained.
James Knowlson, Director of the Beckett International Foundation at Reading
University, and Beckett's official biographer, is among those who welcome
the publication of this early work, while admitting that it is uneven: 'Very
brilliant in parts, and not so good in other parts.'
Like many first novels, even the great master's is to some extent
autobiographical, with thinly disguised portraits of friends and
acquaintances. Knowlson thinks that he can identify most of them; all will
be revealed in two years' time when the biography appears. Meanwhile stand
by for a barrage of speculation and learned commentary when Dream of Fair to
middling Women becomes available in the UK later this month (about November
10, price Pounds 18.99).

FT  31 OCT 92 / Arts: Why things happen - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST Second Stride production, Why Things Happen, demonstrates with
marvellous authority why this company is among the most remarkable
theatrical troupes in Britain. No local company has worked more consistently
to combine diverse theatrical elements into its productions; and Why Things
Happen plunges us at once into the kind of mysterious and satisfying web of
feeling that can only occur with Second Stride. The director, as always, is
Ian Spink; the writer is Marty Cruickshank; the designer is Antony McDonald;
the music (largely by JS Bach) is arranged and directed by Judith Weir.
There are just three performers - a director, a dancer, a musician - and
much of the time in Why Things Happen we experience speech, dance and music
as discrete acts. Each clearly affects us on a different level of
consciousness, and so we become aware of the many layers of feeling within
ourselves: a quintessential Second Stride feat. But there are also
connections. The director (Timothy Walker) is the central figure. He
interviews the musician (Charles Mutter), who speaks of the Bach sonata, its
importance to him, his attitude to rehearsing and performing it, and its
internal structure. And the director also has a complex, adult, fragmented
relationship with the dancer (Joanne Leighton). To complete the third side
of the triangle, she dances at times to the Bach, with both spontaneity and
formal concentration.
Meanwhile, in words, the director addresses concerns of his own - his
mother's letters, nuclear physics, a whole collage of quotations, the hairs
on his legs. How do all these things connect? Of course, they don't - except
that they reproduce the complexity of ordinary human existence, the way in
which, in our daily lives, our minds run simultaneously on numerous tracks
at once. Why Things Happen lasts some 75 minutes, and the first 55 of which
are on a very high poetic level. Watching, listening, feeling, you are
bewildered, stimulated, gratified. The pleasure begins in rhythm and
elegance. As in several Spink theatre pieces since 1983, the strange
modernist ordering of spoken material into arrays of soliloquy, dialogue,
exposition and quotation has a rhythm and humanity that evoke the poetry of
TS Eliot.
The last 20 minutes decline, not in elegance but in tension. There is a
pointlessly elaborate scene-change - McDonald, though among our most
remarkable designers, is too fond of clutter - and the ending steers too
close to sentimentality. But nothing breaks the work's mini-layered spell
Spink's choreography for Leighton is always shaped in handsome, rigorous
phases; and she dances with a movingly strict absorption. Though she is not
always yet a natural speaker, all three performers have been directed to
give eloquent, unmannered performances.
Numerous meanings pour forth as you watch. By one light, the woman is a
symbol of private life, the violinist of pure art. But the dancer is herself
both mistress and muse to the director. And both of them have their private
needs, their unfaithfulnesses to each other, and their independent artistic
integrity. The director half withdraws into abstracted concentration upon
other issues, but half becomes a latter day Othello, contemplating his need
to kill her. This latter thread turns into a treatment of 'Each man kills
the thing he loves.' And, as the director talks of the internal composition
of the atom, his words - though apparently irrelevant - actively cast light
on everything we have heard: the organisation of the Bach; the structure of
a private life; the interaction of independent elements; the way that huge
energies are powerfully yet perilously contained within a single unit.
AT THE ICA, until October 31, and on tour until November 14.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Arts: Etruscans with a love of wine women and song - An
ancient people who are now politically correct
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ETRUSCANS are politically correct. Since their Roman conquerors were
brought into disrepute by Mussolini's fetish for the style and ambitions of
Julius Caesar, they have appealed to modern Italians as natural ancestors.
So most Italian universities have chairs of 'Etruscology', and so Giovanni
Agnelli of Fiat regularly dips into corporate funds to stage Etruscan
jamborees both at home and abroad.
The show now on in Paris extends Italian partisanship further: Jack Lang,
the French Minister of Fun, introduces Etruscan archaeology as a substratum
of modern Europe - giving the Etruscans another dimension of political
correctness, at least in the eyes of Europhiles.
The Etruscans are open to claims of this sort by the peculiar nature of
their survival. They were the first victims in the laboratory of Roman
imperialism: the Romans effectively purged the world of Etruscan literature,
without which it is very difficult to form clear ideas about Etruscan
culture. We rely on the archaeological remains, supplemented by no more than
a few vague comments by ancient writers indicating that Etruscan society was
characterised and eventually undermined by its love of wine, food, sex and
music.
So it is easy to idealise these people (as DH Lawrence and others have done)
and easy to overlook some features of the archaeological record which spoil
the ideal. Ironically, archaeological evidence points to the Etruscans as
the inventors of fascism: certainly the first fasces - a double-edged axe
carried as a symbol of authority - is Etruscan, not Roman. If Mussolini had
known this, the present popularity of things Etruscan might be diminished.
But as it is, the juxtaposition of the Etruscans at the Grand Palais with
Picasso is testimony to their attraction: the Etruscan throngs, when I was
there, considerably outnumbered those for Picasso.
The spirit of Europeanism has enabled an impressively discreet gathering of
Etruscan material from around the continent. For the Etruscans did connect
with peoples over the Alps and along the French and Spanish coast; and most
importantly, they introduced the Celtic world to wine drinking and wine
production. German chieftains in Bavaria, Gaulish princes by Marseilles -
Etruscan market research revealed these as the targets not only for
shipments of proto-Chianti, but also some finely-wrought vessels with which
to celebrate and share the new beverage.
The Etruscans make a satisfying show. One of their painted tombs has been
reassembled here, and the sort of lifestyle its paintings depict -
banqueting, dancing, aristocratic conviviality - is amply documented by
selections of fine jewellery and fine vases. Such things were pouring out of
Etruscan tombs from the late 18th century onwards and it is not surprising
that they had an impact upon modern European taste. At just the time when
rich young men and women were making the 'Grand Tour', the Etruscans were
yielding souvenirs in abundance. So although Britain was, in ancient times,
entirely peripheral to Etruscan activity, Britain is the only other place in
Europe which has the place 'Etruria' on its map. Josiah Wedgwood was
responsible for this: impressed by the quantity and quality of vases coming
out of Etruscan tombs, he called his new factory 'Etruria' and began to
imitate Classical designs.
The exhibition gives almost half its space to charting this belated Etruscan
influence, and rightly so. But visitors should not be too deluded by the
apparent direction of 'scientific progress' implied by the displays. The
implication is that early students of the Etruscans were fantasy-mongers
whose fantasies have now been replaced by sober scholarship. The truth is
otherwise. At least one of the contributors to the catalogue has written
glowingly of Etruscan artefacts which were, in fact, Made in Italy not very
long ago.
A scientific archaeology of the Etruscans is impossible: most of the objects
on display here were excavated with all the skill of a dog recovering an old
bone, and clandestine explorations continue to thwart proper research in
Italy. We can decipher the Etruscan language as it appears in inscriptions:
but without any significant literature, this language has failed to reveal
much about those who used it. Great areas of knowledge about the Etruscans,
such as their political organisations or their internal history, remain
entirely mysterious.
And perhaps they always will, and perhaps it is better that way. So long as
the Etruscans stay inscrutable, Jack Lang can wax about the 'spontaneity' of
their art, Giovanni Agnelli can write tenderly as though they were his
great-grandfathers, and they can challenge us all to try our luck and see
what we make of them.
The Etruscans and Europe is at the Grand Palais, Paris, until December 14,
then moves to the Altes Museum, Berlin in the New Year.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Savers: enemies of the State - Dominic Lawson demands a
purge of those who are sabotaging the Party's plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN STALIN'S Soviet Union the economy did not always go according to the five
year plan. But it was, of course, impermissible to blame that on the plan
itself. To do so would imply that the Communist Party under the leadership
of Comrade Stalin was capable of error, an admission that would undermine
the state.
When things did go wrong in a very noticeable way, someone else had to take
the blame. These people were called Wreckers. That was the generic term. The
specific details of the Wreckers varied from five year plan to five year
plan. They could be Mensheviks or Z ionists or on one more than usually
paranoid occasion Doctors.
Perhaps the time has arrived for the British Government to come up with a
similar excuse. Like the old-style Communist Party it finds it absolutely
impossible to admit of any error in its conduct of economic policy, let
alone apologise for its mistakes. But the problem is, the public need
someone to blame, they need a victim.
The British government did, in its way, come up with some suitable Wreckers
in the aftermath of the Exchange Rate Mechanism debacle. They were called
Germans. Unfortunately we could not coerce the Germans into confessing that
they had deliberately wrecked the British economy.
Norman Lamont was unable to lock Helmut Schlesinger, the governor of the
Bundesbank, in a cell to apply the torturer's time honoured persuasive
techniques of sleep deprivation and electric shocks. No, like Stalin's NKVD,
the British government must find its scapegoats among the more vulnerable
indigenous population.
They will be called the Savers. It is they who will be declared to be the
deliberate saboteurs of the otherwise impeccably conceived and executed five
year plans of the Politburo, otherwise known as Her Majesty's Treasury.
The Savers have been coordinating their subversive campaign to wreck the
economy for well over a year now. When the Treasury press office first put
out their statement that 'the green shoots of recovery are clearly visible'
early in 1991 the Savers deliberately cut back on their spending.
Some of them used the obviously spurious excuse that they had been made
redundant, and did not know where the next penny was coming from. Others,
even more outrageously, said that although they were in work at the time,
they feared they might be laid off in the near future, and would therefore
save a greater proportion of their earnings. They did this in the clear
knowledge that such a high level of saving would further delay the economic
recovery of the Motherland.
Some of the Savers, when captured and interrogated, will scream that they
thought they were carrying out the policies of Major, the Supreme Leader,
who had declared that inflation was the 'number one enemy of the
Motherland'.
These snivelling excuses will not be accepted by the courts.
The recent cuts in interest rates, ordered by the proper political
authorities - in contrast to the capitalist US where such things are decided
by a totally undemocratic financiers' cabal - have met with a strong
reaction from the Savers. They have wickedly decided to use this windfall -
given to them by their generous government - to pay their mortgages and
other outstanding debts. The result has been to nullify the new and
unanimously acclaimed 'strategy for growth'.
This has been a slap in the face for honest English shopkeepers, many of
them Party members, who have been patiently sitting behind their counters
waiting for customers to come in and spend all their money. Patriotic
shopkeepers will be expected to hand in to the appropriate authorities the
names of Savers who try to disguise their treachery by making occasional
shopping forays. They can be detected by Stakhanovite shop assistants
prepared to ask boldly and unconventionally the question 'Can I help you sir
(or madam)?.' If the response is: 'I'm only browsing' or 'just looking',
then a citizen's arrest may be made.
Meanwhile, to those subversives who speculate that members of the cabinet
are among those diverting their state-financed income to reduce their
personal borrowings, the government's response will be: 'All bank overdrafts
are equal, but some bank overdrafts are more equal than others.'

FT  31 OCT 92 / Private View: Man who plays jester at the court of Du Pont
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON HIS business card it says 'Strategic Thinking'. But Michael Geoghegan
likes to describe himself as the court jester, the man who can tell home
truths in the throne room without getting his head chopped off.
He is the Irishman at the court of EI du Pont de Nemours, the US corporate
giant which has sales of nearly Dollars 40bn and employs 144,000 people in
chemicals, man-made fibres, polymers, industrial, consumer and medical
products, oil, gas and coal.
His job, rare in corporate America, is to tell the bosses of Du Pont's
fibres division what is going on in the world outside their office windows
and to alert them to the dangers of Darwinian extinction.
Qualified in chemistry, business administration and social science, Dr
Geoghegan (pronounced 'Gaygan') enjoys displaying his eclectic knowledge. 'I
know some of the leading thinkers round the world, and six or seven Nobel
laureates personally,' he said immodestly. But he also has a knack for the
sweeping pronouncement - 'there is no recession' - and a Joycean flair for
caricaturing the rituals of the American managerial class.
After 25 years with Du Pont he still speaks with the heavy accent and
finger-jabbing insistence of the man in the Dublin pub. If you are slow to
take a point, his voice rises to a passionate squeak.
Not surprisingly for one educated by the fearsome Christian Brothers and in
the quasi-monastic surroundings of Garbelly College in western Ireland,
Geoghegan makes much use of the clerical analogy. Business is like the
Church, and just as hidebound: middle managers are 'the priests in an old
hierarchy', corporate planners 'monks serving the priesthood of the
management'.
He can be elliptical. When I first asked him to explain what he did, he
rattled off a discourse in which geopolitical change, the 'core / shell'
concept, Schumpeter, thermodynamics, the transistor and quantum mechanics,
biotechnology and multimedia communication all made an appearance.
I asked him to be more precise. 'Take nylon chemistry,' he said. 'As the
social system becomes more aware of the consequences of nylon in the general
social system we will begin to modify the kinds of chemistry we do.'
I don't understand, I said.
'OK. You take Tienanmen Square,' he said, somewhat mysteriously. 'What's
happening over there is a function of the technology. We do certain
chemistries and they have ecological balances which affect the social
system. You cannot do chemistry today that pollutes the local ecological
system.'
What's that got to do with information technology?
'That's how they found out] We've always had problems in ecology, but what
happens when you find out about it? You see, that's the whole point.'
But what's different now?
'People get concerned about their own self-interest because they're now
aware.' Because they watch more television, you mean?
'Exactly]'
Geoghegan's message is that economies are stagnating because companies have
not learned how to manage the consequences of the information technology
explosion. Wealth, he says, is today based on information not mass, on
complexity not volume. Sand is turned into silicon chips.
Companies are confused because customers armed with computer terminals can
design and demand the products they want.
'There's a whole new milieu caused by free switching. We threw free
switching into the world. This has made every individual their own designer
but businesses are trying to hang on mightily to their own theory.
'General Motors says: 'I'll tell you what car to buy.' So they make the
wrong car, cheaper. They keep failing and they don't know why. Ross Perot
put it very well: what it takes to get ahead in General Motors has got
nothing to do with how to build a better car. Of course not]'
Information is too widely disseminated to be controlled by the bosses, and
so the old hierarchy is redundant. 'You're not telling people what to do any
more; you're giving them intellectual and physical resources so they can do
what is possible.'
But, I interrupted, what you are describing is known to the marketing
manager and the production manager, too. What can you add?
'What you just said isn't true. In the social theory of the corporation
people act in order to get promoted. The organisation, like Du Pont, is a
totalitarian system. It is based on infantile behaviour. You please the
boss, and so forth. There are very clear but unstated, undiscussable,
camouflaged sets of rules about getting ahead.
'But if you continue with that social theory you will make investments which
move you further from what's happening in the world.'
You mean people are investing in themselves all the time, not in the
company?
'Of course] They've been talking to each other mostly all their lives. So
there's a little game going on in the village and they make decisions in
their own interest. They have a natural blindness to what is happening in
the world. Martin Luther was a real problem to the Catholic Church. So was
Galileo. The system will act to conserve its own structure - who is allowed
to talk to whom about what.
'A lot of people knew we were coming to the end of this and went on a
massive greed binge in the Eighties. It's not surprising CEO salaries went
through the roof because intuitively there was this feeling: We're coming to
the end] They used to think they were running the company. Now they know
they're not.'
The management consultants, gurus and quacks, saw what was happening and
profited handsomely from the panic, Geoghegan said. 'The Harvard Business
School put out a lot of bullshit. The Sloan School talked about
'empowerment' - you know, all these tons and tons of books of management
stuff.
'Why do you think that happened? Because they thought: 'If these guys are
shaky and sick, my God we've a goldmine] So feed 'em all this bullshit.' And
they lapped it up. How do you keep your job? Answer: a good line in bullshit
and a pulpit.'
What's the most unpopular thing you've ever said to the top management of Du
Pont?
'Oh, that buying Conoco was not a good idea. (Du Pont bought Conoco in 1981
for Dollars 7.6bn, one of the biggest US acquisitions of its time.) You
could see the price of oil was going to go down. Maybe we should have paid
Dollars 5bn for it.'
You must be seen as a busybody by a lot of the people there.
'I wouldn't say busybody. People would say that I am, you know, very
intelligent, whatever the hell that means, and they sort of sense I am up to
something. But I am very threatening to any specialised group because I talk
about a change of agenda. The higher up I get the less I seem to have a
problem.
'I'll tell you what drives me. I've been in Du Pont when we had what I call
'ego space': plenty of wonderful problems to solve. We now have a
contraction of ego space. Seeing the scarcity, people get nasty, aggressive,
territorial. It's unpleasant. So that's the problem.
'Some people are artists. I am a kind of composer. I have to orchestrate the
process of redesigning the social structure of the company.'
Is the fact you're a foreigner useful?
'I think it helps. You know, I think having an Irish accent helps. Maybe
they think I'm a little nuts. Maybe that helps too - what the hell]'
And your religious education?
'Extremely important. Because if you're brought up as a rigid Irish Catholic
and then you have to dismantle all that, you know what it means to transform
your belief system.' (Geoghegan regards himself now as more of a Buddhist or
Taoist.)
Are you still an Irishman?
'My genetic code says Yes. But that doesn't mean anything. I'm of the
cosmos. Nationalism is a disease.
'Because I emigrated I have some idea how social structures work. Believing
is seeing. It's not the other way round. What you believe, you see.
'I've had the chance to see there are these different ways of looking. So
it's no accident I have taken on this task. There's no way a vice-president
of Du Pont could do what I'm doing. It's not in his karma.'

FT  31 OCT 92 / Hawks and Handsaws: Every word counts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I WAS IN Toronto the other morning, eating my breakfast, reading the papers,
when my eye fell upon an article celebrating Black Monday, in October 1987,
and wondering what series of events, what doomsday scenario, would trigger
the next great stock market crash. I enjoy such articles, for they remind me
that my own investments, though insignificant - they account for
0.000000000000 0000000000000000002 of global net wealth - need to be
husbanded just as carefully as those of Carl Icahn.
Icahn, the New York corporate investor, was one of the gurus consulted for
the article. 'I think in the next year or two you'll see another crash that
might make 1987 seem like kindergarten,' said Icahn. Reason: herd behaviour
by US pension fund executives, many of whom have 50 to 70 per cent of their
funds invested in the stock market. 'The fellows who run these funds run
them like cookie-cookers,' said Icahn, 'and when they all go for the exits,
you're going to see apocalypse.'
He says that Dollars 3.8 trillion worth of funds are concentrated in just a
few hands. 'It's the same type of guy. They live in the same type of house,
drive the same type of car, have the same type of Harvard degree. They're
not bad people. They're bright people. But they've never been through a bad
crash. 1987 was not earth-shaking.'
The guru who gave me greatest pause for thought was John Templeton, chairman
of Templeton mutual funds, who pointed to the possibility that stock market
apocalypse could be triggered by real apocalypse. A nuclear war, he said,
could 'have a depressing effect for quite a while.' Alternatively, there
might be a media-induced panic reminiscent of Orson Welles' War of the
Worlds caused by 'the enormous increase in the quantity of information going
around the world simultaneously.'
Think about it. The number of bits of information now circling the globe
simultaneously is estimated at 57 tril tril zil. That is a lot of
information. And most of it is useless. Or excessively duplicated. Or just
plain stupid. So here is an idea. To help counteract the possibility of
media-induced apocalypse, I think it behoves all of us who toil in the media
vineyard to reduce our word-counts substantially. Diminish the number of
bits of information flying wildly through the ether by 98 per cent of 57
tril tril zil.
This week, I spoke to political leaders on both sides of the Atlantic. They
told me numerous things. Things to make your ears pop. But instead of
bombarding you with everything they told me, I have edited their words to
the essence, so as to reduce the quantity of information flowing mindlessly
round the globe:
John Major: 'Good evening, Michael. Thankyou very much for telephoning me.

you.'
Norman Lamont: ' - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 -Indubitably so, Michael, indubitably so.'
George Bush: 'Hiya, Mikey, nice of you to call. Of course it'll be a

Bill Clinton: ' - - - inhale - not] - - - - - - - - - - -  - - - - - .'

 -- Dollars 250m - - - crazy, crazy, crazy - - - - - - - CIA, FBI - - - - -

garbage swirling round the globe could be cut to a trickle. Remind me to
have a word with - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - .

FT  31 OCT 92 / The Financial Times Guide To Post-16 Education 2:  Results -
who makes the grade? / Andrew Adonis and Gillian de Bono analyse the largest
yet study of post-16 education in England and Wales and find that high fees
do not guarantee the best

PARENTS want results. There is more to a good school than exam success, of
course. But parents rightly want to be sure that the schools to which they
send their children are capable of delivering the grades.
The FT-1,000 is the most comprehensive survey yet published of post-16
education and A-level achievement, the results that matter for entry to
higher education. The tables on the following pages give a mass of
information - not just raw exam results - on nearly 1,200 schools and
colleges across England and Wales from both the independent and the state
sectors.
At the very top, the message is stark. Judged by average results, private
schools sweep all before them. Of the top 200 schools, 177 are in the
independent sector. The top state school, The Judd School, Tonbridge, comes
63rd.
Private schools and exam success are far from synonymous, however. For the
FT-1,000 reveals the best of the state sector to be highly competitive with
many independent schools - even on the basis of average results, which,
given the highly selective entry policies of the leading private schools,
discriminate against the state sector, particularly comprehensive schools.
Take schools ranked between 250 and 350 - which gain average A-level results
per pupil of three grade Cs and send most of their leavers on to higher
education. Thirty-four are to be found in the state sector (19 grammar, 13
comprehensives and two sixth form colleges). Of the next 100, 46 are in the
state sector. Conversely, of the schools ranked in the last one hundred, 23
are private.
Nor do state schools charge parents Pounds 70,000 for three A-levels - the
going rate for 11 years at a mid-ranking prep and independent day school -
let alone the Pounds 140,000 needed to fund a decade in the boarding sector.
It is important to look beyond bald national figures to the position
locality by locality. Most parents, after all, are not looking for a school
somewhere between Truro and Newcastle: they want their children to be
educated fairly close to home. For that reason, the tables are arranged
county by county, to show the choices at a glance.
Unsurprisingly, grammar schools lead the state sector: 24 out of the top 30
state schools are grammar schools, while the top two comprehensives -
Hasmonean High in London and Wolverhampton Girls' High - are, respectively,
a religious foundation and a school which has opted out of local authority
control.
In Buckinghamshire, six of the county's grammar schools - led by Wycombe
Royal Grammar and Dr Challoner's High, Little Chalfont - outperform Stowe,
the famous public school, which charges day fees of Pounds 8,200 a year. In
all, the county has nine state schools performing above the FT-1,000 average
for all schools and colleges in the survey.
Lincolnshire and Kent are also notable for their large number of
high-performing state schools. Of Kent's top 20 schools, ten are in the
state sector, and the county's leading state schools are a match for all but
three of its independent schools.
Moreover, success is not just a function of formal academic selection.
Hertfordshire and Berkshire achieve the best average scores of the state
sector - indeed, they are the only two counties in which the state sector
exceeds the national average for all institutions in the survey. Yet they
have few grammar schools. Berkshire has nine comprehensives performing at or
above the average for the survey - including Windsor Boys, a bike ride away
from you-know-where.
The ranking in this survey is made on the basis of a computed FT score,
which gives approximately equal weight to the quality and grades in each
subject entry and the total quantity of grades achieved by each A-level
student. The score has been scaled so that a score of 1.00 represents the
average performance in 1992 of all schools and 6th form colleges in the
FT-1,000. The table opposite enables you to convert FT scores into average
A-level grades attained.
Comparing the sectors, the average FT score for independent schools is 1.14,
and for the state sector 0.89 (1.07 for grammar schools, 0.84 for
comprehensives and 0.89 for sixth form colleges). Westminster, at the top,
scores 1.77; the lowest score is 0.29.
The FT score is an important corrective to the rank ordering. This is
particularly true of schools and colleges in the middle of our listing. One
third of all institutions gain an FT score within ten per cent of the
national average, embracing those ranked between 353rd and 712th. The range
of scores attained by the top and the bottom hundred institutions is twice
as great.
The tables also include a 5-year FT score, based on results achieved between
1987 and 1991, to enable this year's score to be set in a broader context.
With the marked improvement in overall A-level performance this year, a
school's 5-year score ought to be somewhat lower than its 1992 score - about
0.03 down - for it to be treading water.
There is, however, an interesting discrepancy in the differential
performance of the two sectors: the state sector's overall 1992 score is up
only slightly on its 5-year score, whereas the independent sector's 1992
performance is 8 per cent higher. Almost certainly this reflects the success
of the state sector in increasing its staying-on rate.
Our last survey of the independent sector showed single-sex schools leading
the field. The FT-1,000 reveals a similar pattern among state grammar
schools, but a quite different picture among comprehensives. The average FT
score for state grammar schools is, respectively, 1.10 for boys schools,
1.07 for girls schools, and 1.02 for co-ed schools. For comprehensives, by
contrast, the respective figures are 0.83, 0.86 and 0.84. These disparities
will doubtless be a rich source of controversy.
Value for money is another theme emerging clearly from the FT-1,000. The
average annual per capita expenditure in state secondary schools is around
Pounds 2,500; the average day fees for private schools in our survey are
Pounds 4,943. In much of the state sector, the taxpayer evidently gets a
very good deal.
It is often alleged that there is little relationship between results and
spending per head in state schools. Our research shows that certainly to be
the case in the private sector. Four of the top ten day schools charge below
average fees, including Twycross House, a small school in Warwickshire,
where parents pay just Pounds 2,925 a year, a third less than the national
average. Collectively, private schools in Cheshire, Leicestershire,
Warwickshire and Greater London have the best A-level results in the
country, yet day fees are typically below average in all four counties.
In the state sector, education by mortgage appears largely to have replaced
education by ability. The relationship between school performance and house
prices is marked. The two top performing counties in the state sector -
Hertfordshire and Berkshire - have house prices respectively 45 and 51 per
cent above the national average.
Conversely, achievement does not go hand-in-hand with mortgages in the
private sector. Greater Manchester and Leicestershire combine top notch
results with house prices only a few hundred pounds above the national
average.
The FT-1,000 embraces most of the independent sector and more than 650 state
schools and colleges. The institutions listed are self-selected, but we are
confident they include most of the high-achievers across the country.
Independent tutorial colleges are also listed, but not included in the
ranking because a large proportion of their students were re-taking exams.
Further education and tertiary colleges - increasingly important providers
of post-16 courses - are also included in the listing but not ranked. Given
that many of their students combine A-levels with vocational courses, with
much of their intake studying only part-time, the FT score would
discriminate against them unfairly. Instead, they are given an FT score
based on quality alone (their score per entry), which is only loosely
comparable with the score for schools and sixth form colleges.
The FT survey of the independent sector published earlier this year included
A-level General Studies results. Many head teachers objected to this,
arguing that General Studies is comparatively easy, widely used as a 'top
up' A-level, and one often disregarded by university admissions tutors.
Persuaded by these arguments, we have omitted General Studies results from
the survey.
The tables indicate the proportion of pupils in each school / college
studying for A-levels in maths, science and modern foreign languages. The
overall proportions are broadly the same for both the state and independent
sectors. But the difference between boys and girls schools is marked. Taking
just the top 50 state schools, an average of 49 per cent of pupils in boys
schools study at least one maths or science course, compared with 39 per
cent in girls schools.
The tables also give stay-on rates post-16 - a useful corrective to raw
results, although stay-on rates are not a uniform guide to the selectivity
of the sixth form, particularly for institutions with highly selective
admissions policies at 11 or 13. Several independent schools in the top 100
had stay-on rates below 60 per cent, lower than many comprehensives with a
far wider academic mix.
A number of heads expressed concern that our stay-on rate does not include
pupils entering the sixth-form to take vocational courses, nor those leaving
to take A-levels elsewhere. Parents should note these points when
considering a particular school. They should also note that despite the
'type' given, some schools do not have a single identity. John Hampden
Grammar School, High Wycombe, for instance, has an open door sixth-form
admissions policy for pupils from local non-selective schools. The head
says: 'A high percentage are not going to gain the higher grades; they work
hard, and we - and they - are pleased with their Cs, Ds and Es.'
A-levels, it should be stressed, are not the only courses worth studying
post-16. Further Education and Tertiary Colleges have a long tradition of
teaching BTEC and other vocational courses, and some schools are joining in
too. The college sector will gain greater autonomy next spring, when local
authority administration is ended and each college becomes a self-governing
trust financed from fees, a state funding council, and its own
entrepreneurial activities. Doubtless many will seize the chance to market
themselves aggressively.
Tutorial colleges, a much neglected aspect of post-16 provision, cater
largely, though not exclusively, for re-takes. They teach in small groups
and their fees are high. But their results are generally impressive, and
most stress that their doors are open to first-timers, not just those who
did not make the grades first time.
Roy Chapman, Headmaster of Malvern College, recently lamented the discovery
of 'a pernicious viral disease which is the product of the late-20th
century: league table fatigue.'
The FT-1,000 is more than a league table. But even if it were not, there is
no evidence of widespread fatigue among consumers. On the contrary, parents
remain anxious to find schools which deliver the goods. Parents and pupils
need to weigh all information at hand with care - just as do readers of the
FT's companies and financial indicators. The possibility of
misinterpretation is no justification for suppression. If it were, viral
infections of a more deadly kind would take hold.

HOW TO READ THE TABLES
FT score: A-level grades were awarded UCCA points on the scale A=10, B=8,
C=6, D=4, E=2; AS-levels were counted as half an A-level (ie. A=5 UCCA
points). The FT score is a weighting of the average UCCA points per entry
(the quality of grades attained) and the average UCCA points per candidate
(the quantity of grades attained), with 1.0 the average score achieved
across the FT-1,000.
An FT score of more than 1.0 denotes above average A-level results, less
than 1.0, below average.
Further Education, Tertiary and Tutorial Colleges have been given scores on
the basis of average UCCA points per entry only. Since this is not directly
comparable, they have not been ranked.
5 year score: 1987-1991 A-level results compared with the average results
for 1992.
Type: I = Independent School; IT = Independent Tutorial College; C = Local
Authority Comprehensive; CO = Opted-out Comprehensive; G = Local Authority
Grammar; GO Opted-Out Grammar; CHG = Church Grammar School; CHC =
Church Comprehensive School; SF = State Sixth Form College; ISF =
Independent Sixth Form College; FE = Further Education College; T = Tertiary
College; f = member of a sixth form consortium.
Religion: ID = Interdenominational; CE = Church of England/Wales; RC = Roman
Catholic; NC = non-conformist (protestant); J = Jewish; GO = Greek Orthodox
Boys % = for analysis, coeducational schools are deemed to have at least 25
%of pupils from each sex.
Boarders %: percentage of pupils that are full or weekly boarders. To be
classified as a boarding school, more than 50 per cent of the pupils must be
boarders, of which at least half are full boarders
Stay on rate: percentage of fifth formers that stayed on to study A or
AS-levels in the sixth form last year
Passes/pupils: average number of A-level passes per candidate
Science/Maths, Modern Languages: percentage of sixth formers studying
A-levels in these subject groups.

it
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT-1000 survey is the result of six months' research. A total of 2,700
schools and colleges in both the state and independent sectors were sent
detailed questionnaires. In addition, the Independent Schools' Information
Service (ISIS) supplied compatible data on 500 (the majority) of its
members.
Every school and college was telephoned to confirm receipt of the
questionnaire and a second abbreviated form was sent out to those that had
not replied by our original deadline. FT researchers sent out a total of
5,500 questionnaires and forms, and made more than 7,500 telephone calls.
By our final deadline, details of nearly 1,400 schools and colleges had been
entered on our data base. Respondents were then sent data checking sheets to
enable them to verify their entry and amend A-level grades where there had
been a successful appeal to the examining board. The FT-1000, which includes
1,200 schools and colleges and is the most extensive listing of its kind yet
published, includes all those respondents with at least ten A-level
candidates who submitted full details of their 1992 A-level results.

FT  31 OCT 92 / The Financial Times Guide To Post-16 Education 18: Forest
goes for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAN SUCCESSFUL schools expand without jeopardising their characters? And if
you want single-sex education for adolescents, but think co-ed better at
sixth-form level, how can schools provide both without forcing pupils to
change institution at 16?
Forest School, an independent school on the Essex/London border, offers a
model for dealing with both issues successfully. For Forest has expanded
rapidly without losing its soul and it keeps the sexes apart at the 11 to 16
age range while integrating them in the sixth form.
In barely a decade, Forest School doubled in size - expanding from 550
pupils in 1974 to 1,100 a decade later. It went co-ed in the process, but
did both - grow and admit girls - with no significant increase in the size
of the 'original' school. Since the mid-1980s it has grown to 1,200 on the
same basis.
The trick? In 1981 Forest's governors built a separate girls' school on the
same campus as the existing boys' school and created a federation to unite
its three schools - the third being a junior school, originally a boys' prep
school, but now admitting girls into a new section.
The three schools have their own classroom blocks, but share sports and
specialist teaching facilities for music, computing and the like. In the
senior schools, pupils are taught separately up to GCSE but together in the
sixth form. A-level pupils from both schools share a sixth-form centre. The
senior schools also have a boarding house with 23 boarders and room for up
to 60 - 'a selling point with parents worried they might have to move away,'
says David Tudor, deputy Warden.
Across the three schools, the balance is 800 boys to 400 girls. One
governing body covers all three. But the schools are not just separate in
name: each has its own teaching staff, headteacher and distinctive ethos. A
'super-head', the Warden, presides over the three.
'We provide an appropriate teaching environment for boys and girls of
different ages and enable each pupil to experience the friendless and
familiarity of a small community while enjoying all the benefits which come
from membership of a large school,' runs the prospectus. Warden Andrew
Boggis, just appointed from an Eton housemastership, is more succinct: 'We
run with nature.'
Nature and the market go hand-in-hand, it seems. Mr Boggis's predecessor but
one, the brains behind Forest's transformation in the late-1970s, saw a
clear niche. Ilford County High for Boys and Woodford County High for Girls,
the two local state grammar schools, both of which achieve results on a par
with Forest's, are single sex and unable to absorb all the local demand. Of
the other private schools in the area at the time, one was fully co-ed,
another single-sex, and a third (Brentwood) only admitted girls into the
sixth form. Brentwood has since imitated Forest and opened a girls' school
on its campus for 11- to 16-year-olds, though without a separate head
teacher.
Apart from nature and a niche, three factors were crucial to Forest's
success. First, it practised 'subsidiarity' long before the Eurocrats
hijacked the concept. The three head teachers have real autonomy in managing
their schools: they have their own teaching staff and premises, and far more
discretion than the deputy heads of a typical 1,200-strong state school.
Second, the school had enough space and resources to expand. It was not well
endowed with either: the campus is 27 acres, and part of a playing field was
used to build the girls school. The new school and related extensions cost
Pounds 4m at today's prices, which was partly met from reserves, the rest
coming from two appeals to parents.
Third, the school expanded its effective catchment area at the same time as
it doubled in size, to ensure that academic standards were not diluted. It
did so by copying from Haberdashers' Aske's, the thriving Hertfordshire day
school, the practice of mass bussing. Forest's catchment area now extends
across north and east London, from Islington to Chelmsford, though the
school estimates it still recruits 'somewhat more' from the vicinity than it
did pre-1980.
Was it worth it? Talking to pupils, the sense of belonging to the smaller
unit has not been lost, and most like the balance between single-sex and
co-ed.
Forest also holds its own on the fees and results front. 260th in the
FT-1,000, it gains average A-level results of three Cs, much the same its
local independent sector competition. It stresses traditional values - John
Patten would love the prospectus: 'A Shakespeare play has been performed
annually since 1960' - but an easy formality reigns, and pupils are
encouraged to take on extra-curricular activities. As to fees, its Pounds
4,449 a year for day pupils is the going rate locally for those opting-out
of the state sector. Around 35 of each year's 150 entrants have a greater or
lesser degree of financial assistance, either from the government's assisted
places scheme or from school scholarships.
No two schools are alike, and Forest's experience cannot be transplanted.
But its achievement represents two fingers to those who think it takes
bureaucrats to plan school provision.

FT  31 OCT 92 / The Financial Times Guide To Post-16 Education 19: Bristol -
where opportunity takes many shapes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and GILLIAN DE BONO

<TEXT>
BRISTOL exemplifies the UK's education system at its most thriving. Few
cities have as much to offer post-16 year olds. An FT survey of Bristol's
schools and colleges found pupils and parents alive to the opportunities; it
also found institutions, whether in the independent or state sectors, keenly
aware of the pressures of the market.
Bristol's results in the FT-1,000 survey speak for themselves. Eight of the
city's ten independent schools outperform its entire state sector.
Nonetheless, the best of Bristol's state schools and colleges perform
creditably, given their mostly non-selective admissions.
Bristol has a particularly strong college sector. The top state institution
is a Further Education College - Filton College, in the north of the city
but drawing from across and beyond Bristol. Nearly a third of Filton's
A-level passes this year were at grades A and B. A quarter of this year's
16-year-old intake are students who were previously in the independent
sector.
St Brendan's, a Roman Catholic sixth form college, gives priority to
Catholic families, but has four feeder schools and draws widely beyond.
South Bristol FE College runs the sixth form for a consortium of south
Bristol schools. For the more vocationally-oriented, Brunel FE College -
housed in a bleak former orphanage - offers a wide range of BTEC and other
courses, and has superbly run and equipped engineering, technology and
science facilities. The colleges market themselves as half-way houses
between school and work or college.
Avon county council runs Bristol's state schools. Under the local management
of schools policy, all have budgets of their own and their heads are growing
used to running their own shows as never before. Only two grammar schools
have survived in a sea of comprehensives, but catchment areas,
euphemistically dubbed 'areas of prime responsibility' by the education
authority, appear to be more important than formal admissions policies in
forming the character of individual schools.
Comprehensives in the wealthier suburbs and surrounding villages - such as
Nailsea, Backwell and Chew Magna - have excellent and well-deserved
reputations. Their clientele is largely middle-class, and they are no more -
and may even be less - socially representative than Bristol's independent
day schools, all of which take a high proportion of pupils on bursaries or
the government's assisted places scheme. A sample of sixth formers in one
successful 'comprehensive' found that the parents of almost half had moved
into the school's catchment area to get them into the school.
Bristol's high-achieving state schools are all oversubscribed, but unable to
expand because of capacity ceilings imposed by Avon. Cotham grammar school,
on the edge of affluent Clifton near the city centre, has its eyes on a
vacant college down the road as a sixth form centre; Backwell, on the road
to Weston-super-Mare, would consider selling off a playing field if it could
use the proceeds to expand. But neither has got any joy from cash-starved
Avon, which is struggling with surplus places in other schools.
Even in the less leafy areas, schools are battling to get results. Marlwood
school, which embraces the working-class suburb of Severn Beach, gains third
place among Avon's state schools - evidence that catchment areas are not
everything. Hartcliffe school, in the middle of the council estate hit by
this summer's riots, has expanded its intake from six to 17 primary schools
in recent years. In the mid-1980s its post-16 stay-on rate was 10 per cent;
now it is more than 50 per cent - 'and that's not just the recession,' says
the head.
There are numerous school / college federations across the city and beyond.
Some, like that in south Bristol, involve pooling sixth forms; others, like
that between Brimsham Green, King Edmund and Chipping Sodbury schools, allow
sixth formers to move between institutions for different courses.
Others are 'magnet' arrangements: Cotham, for example, is part of a north
Bristol consortium for vocational education, embracing 16 schools and Brunel
FE College; it also has outstanding music facilities, and is a county centre
for A-level music.
Bristol's independent sector is large and flourishing - despite the
recession. Almost all the private schools are single-sex (unlike virtually
all the state sector), and most are long-established city institutions.
Clifton College is the best known school but its social cachet and superb
facilities come dear: at Pounds 7,700 a year for day pupils, its fees are
twice those of the city's leading independent day schools. and its results
are no better than theirs.
Three of the independent day schools - Bristol Grammar, Bristol Cathedral,
and Queen Elizabeth's Hospital (QEH) - do their admissions jointly. Parents
express a preference between them, but applicants sit the same exam and all
three schools' fees are all within a few hundred pounds of each other (at
around Pounds 3,500).
The three main girls independent schools - Redland High, Colstons' Girls and
Red Maid's - run a similar system. 'Our position owes a lot to tradition and
expectation - and our very good value for money, which is due to the
competition,' says Mrs Judith Franklin, headmistress of Colston's, whose
fees are Pounds 3,360 a year.
All six hail from the old direct-grant tradition. Says Dr Richard Gliddon,
head of QEH: 'This schools doesn't have any social pretention; we are not
aping the big public schools; we're an old city grammar school.'
The independent sector gains from the widespread view that Cotham's apart,
state schools in the city - unlike those in the suburbs and beyond - do not
churn out the results. Cotham's is massively oversubscribed, and every year
the independent sector picks up a number who fail to get places.
Bristol also has an independent A-level tutorial college. The foremost is
run by Mander Portman Woodward. It is not cheap - Pounds 1,925 a term for
two A-levels - but with a maximum class size of seven, it offers intensive
tuition for those who didn't take well to a school regime. Some even prefer
it to school first time round.

FT  31 OCT 92 / The Financial Times Guide To Post-16 Education 20: Breaking
the exam taboo gives intriguing results - The most extensive survey of
A-level results including state schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MARKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1978, early in my 14 years as an elected parent governor of a Brent,
North London, comprehensive school, I asked if the governors could see
details of the school's examination results. 'No', I was told, 'they were
far too open to misinterpretation.'
Such secretiveness persisted until 1980, when the UK government proposed
that schools receiving public funds would be required to publish their
examination results, subject by subject and grade by grade.
At once an unholy alliance of producer interests - the Headmasters'
Conference arm-in-arm with the National Union of Teachers - went to the
Secretary of State and implored him to think again. But, buoyed up by a 1979
election promise by Margaret Thatcher, the government held firm.
Unfortunately, however, it failed to collect this data centrally and make it
widely available. All that the 1980 Act required was that schools should
keep a copy of this data and make it available for inspection. They were not
even required to send a copy to anyone on request, even if payment and
postage was offered.
So when, in 1981 and 1982, my colleagues and I tried to conduct a census of
the examination results of all the schools in the country, we failed. Nearly
a third of schools and local education authorities (LEAs) refused to send us
the information which legally they were required to make available. And
another third only cooperated when we promised them anonymity.
Now, a decade later, the wheel has come full circle. Next month the
Department for Education will publish A-level and GCSE results for all the
state schools in the country. And today the FT publishes, in rank order, the
A-level results for more than 1,000 schools - roughly half independent and
half state. This is nearly all the leading independent schools but less than
20 per cent of state schools with sixth forms. It is to date the most
extensive comparison of national results.
What do they show? First, that the exact ranking of a school is not
important. A shift of 50 or even 100 places up or down makes little
difference to the average results for pupils, especially in the middle of
the table.
Nevertheless, some striking differences do emerge. An average pupil at a
school in the top third - with three A-levels at grade B - performs much
better than one from a school in the bottom third - two A-levels at grade D.
That is the difference between being received with open arms at almost any
university in the country and a severe struggle to find a place on a degree
course of any kind.
It is also striking how much the tables are dominated by independent
schools. There are only four state schools in the top 100 (three grammar;
one comprehensive) and 70 in the top third (49 grammar; 21 comprehensive).
By contrast, in the bottom third of the 1,100 there are 258 state schools.
There are also disproportionately large numbers of single sex schools among
the high performers - both state and independent - with many of the top
independents being wholly or predominantly day schools rather than boarding
schools of the traditional kind. Many of these high-achieving independent
day schools were partly state funded direct-grant schools up to the mid
1970s until such schools were abolished by the last Labour government.
Even more interesting for parents are the tables for different localities.
Here the picture varies dramatically from area to area. In some counties an
appreciable number of state schools, predominantly grammars, produce results
which are better than or just as good as those from local independents. But
in many areas, mainly urban but some rural, independent schools predominate
and only a handful of state schools - again predominantly grammar - have
comparably good results. In many parts of the country, however, there are
few schools of either kind which appear in the top third of the table; in
these areas the state schools tend to be largely comprehensive.
These differences appear to confirm earlier studies which emphasise the
unevenness of access across the country to schools with good A-level
results. As Alan Smithers and Pamela Robinson, of University of Manchester's
education department, found last year, 40 per cent of pupils with three
A-levels come from independent and grammar schools which have only 11 per
cent of the cohort. They concluded that: 'For many of the school population
A-levels is very much a minority sport and for them there is virtually no
mainstream post-16 education' (their emphases).
The Financial Times data also confirm other evidence that there may be
important benefits when schools of different types coexist and compete in
the same locality. For example, two studies of the public examination
results of 70 per cent of schools in the country showed that the examination
results of pupils at comprehensive schools which co-existed with selective
grammar schools in the same area were about 5 per cent higher than those for
pupils at comprehensive schools in wholly comprehensive areas.
Even more interesting is the listing by the Financial Times of school fees
alongside the results. Even a cursory glance shows great differences in the
results achieved for a given level of expenditure. For example, the top
ranking independent school achieves roughly one grade D for each Pounds
1,000 of day fees, compared with a grade B for the same amount of money at
another school with lower fees in the top 20.
Moreover, the results attained by state schools appear in a different light
when viewed against an average expenditure per pupil in state sixth forms
which is half the average day school fee (Pounds 4,940) for the independent
schools in the table. The highest ranked state school achieves roughly one
grade A or B per Pounds 1,000 while a state school in the middle third of
the table achieves roughly one grade C per Pounds 1,000.
These disparities become even greater when boarding fees are included. For
example, the top independent wholly boarding school achieves slightly better
than one grade E per Pounds 1,000.
Soon somebody will divide results per pupil by costs per pupil and compile
tables based on a value for money index for schools, like the price/
earnings ratio for shares. It should, but probably will not be done by
Professor Stewart Sutherland and his revamped Her Majesty's Inspectorate,
the Office for Standards in Education.
But who better than the FT to break the taboo and publish the data. After
all: 'No FT, no comment.'

FT  31 OCT 92 / Miyazawa warns of prolonged economic downturn in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE economy is in the middle of a prolonged and severe downturn, Mr
Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, warned yesterday, as the country's
leading banks disclosed a 54 per cent rise in their non-performing loans.
The economy, on the edge of outright recession, is facing 'dire straits', Mr
Miyazawa told the Diet, the Japanese parliament, which reconvened yesterday.
Meanwhile, the leadership of the ruling Liberal Democratic party is consumed
by a power struggle, provoked by the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal over
illegal political contributions.
With the full scale of the economic downturn still becoming apparent, the
forces of recession and growth within the economy are finely balanced.
The Ministry of Finance said the bad loans of the leading 21 banks rose to
Y12,300bn (Pounds 62bn) in the six months to September from Y7.9bn in March.
The banks responded by unveiling long-awaited plans for a body they will
fund, which from next year will start the lengthy task of clearing up the
bad loans. The joint body is designed to allow the banks to start writing
off some of their losses by taking over their bad loans.
Senior bankers acknowledge that the system is plagued by bad debts which
will take years to sort out. The weakness of the banking system may limit
the economy's capacity for growth.
The momentum of the downturn was confirmed by sharp falls in half-year
profits at a wide range of companies including retailers and heavy
engineers, and losses at JVC, the leading consumer electronics manufacturer,
and Japan Air Lines, the nation's top airline.
A continued fall in job offers, a sharp drop in overtime last month and low
growth of summer bonuses suggest that personal consumption will become
increasingly depressed this autumn.
Housing starts rallied in September with a 10.4 per cent rise, but the
market remains deeply depressed with a 41 per cent fall in starts on the
construction of condominiums. Recession is being avoided only by a series of
government measures to pour money into the economy.
The cabinet approved a supplementary budget, to be debated by the Diet,
which will implement a Y10,700bn emergency economic package announced in
August. There will also be a 10.8 per cent increase in a special
Y40,000bn-a-year investment programme, which lies outside the budget itself,
and a Y3,000bn-Y5,000bn increase in spending by local authorities.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Bernard Ingham - former Downing Street spokesman, devoted Thatcherite
and virulent Euro-sceptic - may be asked to advise the European Commission
on how to bridge the information gap between Brussels and the people of
Europe.
Bad-mouthed by Europe's politicians and misunderstood by its citizens,
Brussels yesterday confirmed that it had a list of 'well-known European
communicators' to whom it might turn for advice.
It was a sensible idea, Mr Bruno Dethomas, the Commission's chief spokesman,
said, with the air of a man announcing that King Herod had been appointed to
advise the Mothers' Union on childcare.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, believes that member states, not
the Commission, should bear the burden of remedying the EC's deficit
d'information.
An external working group would assess whether the Commission's hands-off
policy could be improved.
Mr Dethomas said the Commission had not yet issued formal invitations to
join the working group, but judging from the short-list of candidates there
could be some interesting confrontations.
For example, Sir Bernard, who writes a plain-speaking column for the
rightwing Daily Express, would be sure to take issue with Mr Jacques
Seguela, the left-leaning maverick French advertising executive, and adviser
to Mr Francois Mitterrand on presidential election campaigns and the Oui
campaign before the Maastricht referendum.
A prominent Spanish newspaper editor - possibly Mr Joaquin Estefania of the
daily El Pais - may also be asked to join the group.
Sir Bernard was on holiday yesterday. However, when asked by the Financial
Times a fortnight ago what he thought of Commission information policy, Sir
Bernard was as blunt as ever. 'Do they have one?' he boomed.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLLING news continued to encourage President George Bush but failed to
depress the hopes of his rival, Governor Bill Clinton, yesterday, with less
than 100 hours left before election day.
As both leading candidates in the presidential race wrapped themselves in
the mantles of popular former presidents, Mr Ross Perot invoked only himself
and flatly predicted he would carry all 50 states on Tuesday.
The now controversial CNN/USA Today daily tracking poll of 'likely voters',
taken on Thursday and published yesterday, had the two leading candidates
statistically inseparable, with Mr Clinton on 41 per cent, Mr Bush on 40 per
cent and Mr Perot down to 14 per cent. The two previous surveys had given Mr
Clinton two and three point leads.
The likely-voters poll has been criticised by Mr Clinton, among others, for
not taking sufficient account of first-time voters. In its parallel
measurement of registered voters it put the Democrat ahead by six points, at
42:36:16.
Four other polls yesterday put Mr Clinton's lead at between two and nine
points. An average of all recent polls by the New York Times, excluding
those published yesterday, divides 43:36:16.
Mr Bush, addressing a Kentucky Fried Chicken convention in Tennessee, again
conjured up former president Harry Truman and assailed what he called Mr
Clinton's 'trample down economics'. Under this policy, he said, dreams of
small businessmen would be crushed under government bureaucracy.
He went from Senator Al Gore's state later yesterday to Missouri and on to
Wisconsin, where he will spend today on a train.
Dog-tired and fighting a cold, Mr Bush said on television yesterday morning
he was not quite sure where he would be going next. When asked about his
opposition to the 1964 civil rights act, he looked bemused but admitted 'a
mistake', which Mr Clinton, he charged, never did.
Mr Clinton began his day by flatly denying he had committed marital
infidelity. Mr Clinton's main theme, however, was his middle class values.
In a day even more frenetic than Mr Bush's, he spoke in New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, and Georgia. Today he moves from Georgia to
Wisconsin and back to New Jersey.
All are critical 'battleground' states.
The consistent evidence that his popularity is falling did not deter Mr
Perot who predicted he would win every state. He also said he would accept
no pay for being president.
Mr Perot said he would modify the diplomatic service. Ambassadors, he said,
were 'as relevant as dinosaurs,' because heads of state talked on the phone
to each other all the time.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Tory motion placates rebels: Ashdown recommends support as
government woos Euro-sceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday averted a confrontation with its own backbenchers
by tabling a motion for Wednesday's Maastricht debate aimed at bringing Tory
Euro-sceptics back to the loyalist fold.
The move switched the political spotlight to the opposition parties amid
reports that the Liberal Democrats were under fierce pressure from Labour
and several of their own MPs to oppose the government.
Late last night Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, acted to end
speculation over his party's stance by announcing that he would be
recommending support for the government to his parliamentary colleagues.
'The Liberal Democrats will vote in favour of Britain's future in Europe,'
he said.
However, Mr Ashdown's position is likely to come under fire at the party's
Scottish conference today when delegates will debate an emergency motion
urging the party to take any action necessary to bring down Mr John Major's
government.
Labour is also attempting to bring the maximum pressure to bear on the
Liberal Democrats, warning that their credibility as an opposition party
will be in tatters if they are seen to shore up Mr Major when he is
critically vulnerable.
The nationalist parties and the Ulster unionists have yet to state their
positions, though most are expected to oppose the government.
The government's motion, which avoids any use of the word Maastricht, is
clearly intended to maximise the difficulties for Labour. It also makes it
extremely hard for the 20 Liberal Democrat MPs to justify opposing Mr Major.
Far from confronting the Conservative rebels, as had been widely expected,
the wording emerges as a highly defensive case for resuming treaty
ratification in parliament.
The text reminds MPs that a 244 majority in May committed the Commons to
proceed to the committee stage of the bill. It stresses Denmark's
clarification of its intentions and progress on defining 'subsidiarity'.
The motion underlines the importance of a 'leading role' for the UK in
enlarging the Community and using membership to develop jobs and investment.
It ends with an invitation to the government to proceed with the bill in
order to 'consider its provisions in further detail'.
The initial response of several Conservative Euro-sceptics was extremely
cautious. While some diehards, such as Mr Richard Shepherd and Mrs Teresa
Gorman, remain determined to vote against the government, other opponents of
the treaty, such as Mr William Cash, were reserving their position last
night.
Their final stance looks likely to be settled at a meeting on Tuesday
evening when they will attempt to agree a common approach. Speculation is
mounting that they may opt to abstain rather than oppose the motion.
Labour dismissed the motion as chiefly aimed at persuading the maximum
number of Liberal Democrat MPs to back Mr John Major and 'save his bacon'.
A senior Labour official said an amendment would be tabled next week with
wording intended to appeal to Tory Euro-sceptics by putting back the
committee stage until after the Edinburgh summit.
At the same time, it would underline Labour's own argument that the debate
constitutes a confidence vote in Mr Major and the government.
Labour MPs are doggedly backing their leadership's line of outright
opposition. But their stance provoked an attack from Mr Michael Heseltine,
the trade and industry secretary, who accused Mr John Smith of abandoning
his principles and emulating Harold (now Lord) Wilson.
'We have a sort of Harold Smith in charge of the Labour party,' he told a
BBC radio interviewer.
Speaking in his Huntingdon constituency, Mr Major commended the motion as
ensuring that Britain did not isolate itself from the European mainstream.
He said that the Euro-sceptics 'don't represent the majority of the
Conservative party and they don't represent the maj-ority of the people of
this country'.
Tory party officials are confident of winning the vote next week, but Mr
Major plans to continue his battle for hearts and minds of backbenchers with
further meetings.

RH MACY, the bankrupt New York-based department store group, yesterday
posted a net operating loss of Dollars 330m for the year ended August 1,
compared with operating profits of Dollars 274m a year earlier and said it
would unveil details of a five-year reorganisation plan on Thursday.
The company's net loss for the year was Dollars 1.25bn, including Dollars
989m in extraordinary items, against a net loss of Dollars 150m, including
an extraordinary gain of Dollars 113m.
Sales in the year fell to Dollars 6.45bn from Dollars 6.76bn.
Macy attributed the decline to the disruption caused by its Chapter 11
filing in January, and to the California riots earlier this year.
Macy said that its reorganisation plan included '21 specific merchandising,
expense and organisation initiatives aimed at strengthening our business.
'Among other things, the plan will change the way we buy, allocate and sell
merchandise. It will also detail the steps we are taking to reduce costs ,
which will result in significant annual savings.'
For the month of September, Macy's comparable store sales fell 4.7 per cent.
The company said the results were an improvement over earlier months.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE who either live or work in the city might like to know that a large
new shop entirely devoted to selling serious, high-quality music recordings
has just opened.
Music lovers who regularly visit the Royal Festival Hall on the South Bank
will probably already have come across Farringdons shops in the Festival
Hall. Farringdon's also has branches in High Holborn and one in Cheapside
which is closing down and has already stopped selling classical music. The
City shop is its latest venture.
Now that quaffing champagne in the lunch-hour is seriously demode (let alone
too expensive) the ardent music-lover, of which the City seems to have an
extremely large number, will be able to spend a more sober, less- fattening,
lunch-hour listening to music in one or other of the store's 'listening
posts'.
Besides the recordings of classical music, Farringdons Records will be
organising a whole host of music-related activities. This week there was
Julian Lloyd-Webber in conversation with music critic Andrew Stewart. On
Thursday 19th November Franz Welser-Most will talk with Martin Kettle of The
Guardian. Other lunch-times will feature music played by students from the
Guildhall School of Music.
The new store is at 64-72 Leadenhall Market, London EC3V 1LT.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Ambulance software was a first, company admits
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SYSTEMS Options, the small, Hampshire-based company that developed the
London Ambulance Service's troubled computerised dispatch system, had not
written large command and control software before the LAS contract, its
managing director admitted yesterday.
It has developed fire service department software for several counties,
including Hampshire, Staffordshire and Cleveland.
The software, costing about Pounds 2,000 a module, manages personnel records
and the location of water hydrants. One of its biggest contracts was for the
Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.
Command and control (C2) software lies at the heart of any computerised
dispatch system and is the key to its speed and efficiency.
A number of UK software houses have built C2 systems for the police or
military customers and all agree that they are complex and difficult to
develop.
Mr James Pedroza, managing director and co-founder of Systems Options, said
there was no alternative to developing C2 software from scratch for the LAS.
'Nobody has ever tackled a system that large before,' he said.
'The reason we were able to do it was our experience in geographical
information systems (software which enables, for example, vehicles to be
located on a computerised map) and in connecting personal computers to
mainframe computers.'
The LAS deals with an average of 2,300 calls a day, compared with a few
hundred for ambulance services elsewhere in the country.
Mr Pedroza, 45, started Systems Options in 1984 with a number of colleagues
after they left Wootton Jeffries - a well-regarded UK computing services
company now no longer in existence - where he was in control of software
development. Before that, he taught mathematics at a South American
university.
Systems Options remains virtually unknown to the rest of the computing
establishment.
Mr Pedroza said it was a technologically oriented company chiefly interested
in developing systems for local government.
It has no sales force and obtains sales leads principally through personal
recommendations.

OKI ELECTRIC, the Japanese electronics company, yesterday reported a Y19.3bn
(Dollars 156m) parent company pre-tax loss in the six months to September,
suspended its interim dividend payment, and appointed a new board of
directors in an effort to turn around the company's business.
Mr Nobumitsu Kosugi, president, resigned yesterday to take responsibility
for the company's poor financial performance. He was replaced by Mr Jun
Jinguji, a former executive at Nippon Telegraph and Telephone who has been a
senior director at Oki since 1985.
Oki suffered from poor sales in all principal product areas:
telecommunication equipment, data processing systems, and electronic
devices.
Total sales declined by 8.5 per cent to Y261.8bn.
Oki is one of the smaller electronics companies to remain in the race to
produce high-capacity memory chips, but is widely expected to quit the
business because of the escalation of development costs as the technology
becomes more sophisticated.
The company posted a net after-tax loss of Y8.7bn. For the fiscal year as a
whole, Oki expects to post a pre-tax loss of Y25bn and net loss of Y16bn.

LOSSES at Sparbanken Sverige deepened sharply in the first eight months,
underlying the severity of the crisis in Sweden's banking sector.
The savings bank group made an operating loss of SKr6.5bn (Dollars 1.1bn),
against a SKr2.5bn deficit a year ago, after loan losses climbed 62 per cent
to SKr10.4bn. It anticipates a full-year loss of SKr8.5bn, with loan losses
soaring to SKr14.5bn. The figures are worse than those estimated in April
when the government announced a SKr7.3bn bail-out of Forsta Sparbanken.
'The increased loan losses and the reduced operating income are due to the
major deterioration which has occurred in the Swedish economy,' said the
bank. It warned it might eventually need state help to maintain an 8 per
cent capital ratio.
Sparbanken Sverige is being formed from the merger of 11 savings banks,
including Forsta Sparbanken and Swedbank.

JAPAN AIR LINES, the leading Japanese international carrier, is facing
deepening losses after reporting a pre-tax loss of Y4.4bn (Dollars 35m) in
the first half of the financial year.
JAL has been hit by a combination of rising investment costs, falling
business demand for international travel, a low growth in general tourist
demand and a domestic market which has been flattened by the downturn in the
Japanese economy.
The loss in the six months to September compares with a Y10.26bn pre-tax
profit in the same period last year. The airline made a pre-tax loss of
Y6.4bn last year, its first since 1985 when its business slumped after a
major accident in Japan. JAL made a profit of Y24bn in 1990.
JAL said its net after-tax loss was Y3.6bn, or Y2.02 per share, against a
net profit of Y2.66bn, or Y1.57bn a share, last year.
Sales fell by 4.7 per cent to Y549.59bn, with the fall in consumer demand
amplified by a slump in cargo traffic reflecting the economic slowdown in
Japan and the US.
The airline in June unveiled a restructuring plan aimed at cutting costs and
raising revenues particularly through increasing its share of the Japanese
market from about 24 per cent to close to a third. This strategy appears to
be bearing some fruit with the number of passengers carried rising by 2.4
per cent to 7.94m. However revenues from domestic services were unchanged at
Y140bn.
JAL is cutting back on recruitment to slow employment growth and considering
cuts among its least profitable international services, a move which would
be a significant reverse for the airline which has expanded aggressively
over the past decade.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Rao tries to defuse farm protests: Reformers fear challenge
to economic liberalisation programme

<TEXT>
MR P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, yesterday pledged to
increase state subsidies for farmers in an attempt to defuse a serious
challenge to his government's economic reform programme.
The move is a response to protests from farmers over cuts in fertiliser
subsidies, a key element of the reforms.
The promise of cash for small farmers highlights the increasing difficulties
the government faces in implementing reforms which hurt special interest
groups favoured by India's complex network of state support.
Some economists fear that Mr Rao's programme could grind to a halt if he
pays too much attention to complaints from such groups. As well as the
farmers, there has been criticism of the economic liberalisation from
state-owned financial and industrial corporations, groups of civil servants
and trade union leaders.
Moreover, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a leading opposition party which
is orchestrating protests against Mr Rao's economic policies, has called for
a nationwide strike on Tuesday.
However, finance ministry officials denied yesterday's promise to small
farmers represented any departure from the reform programme. Rather, it
reflected an admission that the fertiliser cuts may have been implemented
too hastily. Also small farmers, many of whom can barely afford to feed
their families, are widely recognised as needing support.
The farmers' anger was first roused last year when the government launched
its reforms and raised the state-controlled prices of fertilisers by 30 per
cent, the first increase in a decade.
This summer, ministers ordered the complete decontrol of the prices of two
types of fertiliser - phosphate and potash products, prompting increases of
up to 300 per cent.
The price of nitrogen-based fertilisers, the most widely used, was cut by 10
per cent to soften the blow, but it was not enough. Demonstrations broke
out, including one in the town of Ramkola, northern India, in which four
people were killed.
Mr Rao has tried to appease the farmers through the promise of a Rs5bn rural
infrastructure loan and a Rs3.4bn subsidy for the purchase of potash
fertilisers. Yesterday, at a meeting with farmers, he promised to increase
grants for small farmers from Rs3.5bn last year to Rs5bn.
However, encouraged by opposition parties, farmers may demand more.
Acknowledging this danger, Mr Rao yesterday urged a farmers' delegation to
work in their fields and avoid politics.
The Reserve Bank of India has asked a judge to arbitrate in a Rs5.06bn
dispute arising from the securities market scandal between ANZ Grindlays,
the Australian-owned bank, and National Housing Bank, a Reserve Bank
subsidiary. If Grindlays were to lose the dispute, it would become the
second foreign-owned bank to suffer a substantial scandal-linked loss,
following Standard Chartered Bank of the UK which has admitted losing
Rs8.9bn.

Television South West Holdings has turned round from a loss of Pounds 1.88m
to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.47m in the first half of 1992, and is paying
an interim dividend of 2p.
However, the retained loss went up from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 3.61m as the
company provided extraordinary charges of Pounds 4.52m arising from the
cessation of broadcasting on December 31 last. They covered decreases in
property values and equipment Pounds 3.86m, and additional redundancy and
pension costs Pounds 1.21m.
While turnover remained static at Pounds 18.7m, reflecting the state of the
economy and national advertising revenue, costs were reduced by Pounds 2m.
Sales in the second half were expected to be maintained.
Earnings per share for the period were 4.2p (losses 4.8p).

writes Martin Dickson.
The settlement, approved by a Denver court, is with shareholders of
MiniScribe and the company's bankruptcy estate.
The settlement is understood to bring to at least Dollars 140m Coopers'
payments for MiniScribe related claims, since it has already agreed to pay
Dollars 40m - Dollars 50m in a suit brought by bondholders in Texas.
Coopers neither admitted nor denied wrong-doing in the Denver settlement.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Women in Christian bondage: Truth of the Matter / Philip
Crowe describes the taboos which divide women from the priesthood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP CROWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a curious fact that the creator of Narnia, C S Lewis, who filled his
imaginary land with such an amazing assortment of creatures, had a phobia
about insects. Into a vivid paragraph describing this, 'The works, that is
the trouble, all on the outside,' Lewis gratuitously drops this sentence:
'In the hive and the ant-hill we see fully realised the two things that some
of us most dread for our own species: the dominance of the female and the
dominance of the collective.'
In spite of, or perhaps because of, this dread, Lewis was fatally attracted
to extremely dominant women, but with women as with insects, he was capable
of rationalising his phobias with startling clarity. He wrote a brief essay
called 'Priestesses in the Church', a diatribe against the ordination of
women priests.
This month, 72 years after the debate officially started, the Church of
England hovers on the brink of a momentous decision.
The arguments in favour of women being ordained priests are not only clear,
but overwhelming. Discrimination against people, solely on the grounds of
race or gender, is generally held to be a bad thing, which the church
resists everywhere except in the church. Men and women are equal in the
sight of God, but unequal in the life of the church. Justice for women
everywhere, but not in the sanctuary.
The practical arguments, too, would rapidly convince any personnel manager.
An organisation which resorts to desperate expedients to meet its core
commitments, while ignoring over half its available people, must be either
strange or incompetent.
Yet opposition to the ordination of women, among women as well as men, is
passionate, vociferous, and deep-seated. Of course the opposition is similar
to that prejudiced resistance to women which has afflicted London clubs and
company board rooms.
On the surface, it is rational: 'We couldn't possibly admit women - we have
no toilets for them.' But what is going on beneath the surface? As with
Lewis, there are undercurrents of dread.
Society in general sorted out this issue long ago. We are, in theory at
least, an equal opportunities society. The church as usual comes lumbering
up to the finishing line puffing and panting long after everyone else has
gone home. But what society states in theory, and what happens in practice,
are not the same.
True, we have had our first woman prime minister. Was she not the best man
in the cabinet ? Is there any way of distinguishing, except by voice, the
speeches of a female politician from those of a male?
The language of public discourse is the language of power, the male
language. The women who get on are the women who perform best as imitation
men, in a society where human beings are called Man, the only respectable
God is male, and the only direction is upwards, towards success.
Female language is the language of weakness, of vulnerability, the language
of fulfilment and of relationships. No, this is not a tired piece of
stereotyping. The point is that we should all be bilingual. The language of
public discourse should be both masculine and feminine.
If the church were to ordain women to the priesthood, it would be inviting
and welcoming this bilingual discourse at the very heart of its life. The
fact that it has been such a long and hard struggle may mean that the church
will understand, more deeply than society, what it means to be both male and
female.
But why is it such a desperate struggle? Where does such passionate
opposition to women priests come from? The former Bishop of London once
remarked that if he saw a woman in the sanctuary, he would want to hug her.
His predecessors would have behaved with marginally less subtlety.
There is some extraordinary correspondence dating from the 1930s, a Bishop
of Durham, no less notorious for the extreme liberalism of his views than
his current successor, laying down precise rules about where a woman may
stand in church if she is to read the scriptures. The sanctuary is, beyond
question, out of bounds.
Social anthropologists argue persuasively that gender issues are not simply
about physical differences. They are also an indicator of social
differences.
Sanction-laden rules about what constitutes appropriate behaviour are a
means of identifying social boundaries. They preserve the identity of the
group.
Within the church, boundaries marked by gender have contracted so much that
the few which remain are invested with dreadful significance. The last
remaining preserve of the male priest is the authority to speak those most
powerful words of remembrance, of forgiveness, and of blessing. The male
priest is the representative of the very tradition which gives him
authority. If the gender of the priest can be changed, nothing is sacred. If
the tradition is flouted, we no longer know who we are.
Worse still, we no longer know who God is. The male priest, representing
Jesus the man, evokes powerfully the image of the male God, and that image
has dominated Christian worship and teaching for generations. More than 100
drawings of God, done for me by children in a village primary school,
contained only one hint of the feminine, a wonderfully colourful figure with
two heads, the male smoking a pipe and the female a cigarette.
Just below the surface lurk questions of human sexuality. The Christian
church has maintained a tradition which holds that even an ideal sex life is
inferior to no sex life at all. This tradition tells that the ideal priest
is male and celibate. An elderly lady said recently to a woman deacon, 'You
won't help with Communion, will you, when . . . you know . . . it's that
time of the month.' And there is something shocking about the idea of a
pregnant woman celebrating the Holy Communion.
All the rational arguments barely conceal deep and primitive fears which
bear all the classic features of cultural taboo.
Earlier this year, the men in a church choir hissed at a newly-ordained
woman deacon as she walked through the chancel and in to the sanctuary. She
was the first woman ever to do so in that church. Had she turned into a
pillar of salt, it would have been less than they hoped for. The sound of
their hissing evoked in her a primitive kind of horror.
It is these primitive fears, these cultural taboos, which are recognised in
Christian faith as 'elemental spirits' from which people are set free by the
liberating truth of the gospel. If the church decides not to ordain women as
priests, it will not simply make injustice an official part of its own life.
It will also declare itself to be in bondage to primitive fears. No doubt
the Church of England would still have a great deal to say; but would it
have any credibility at all?

FT  30 OCT 92 / Grip relaxes on French flagship: Paris still has effective
control at Rhone-Poulenc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Paris government's announcement that it will sell a stake in
Rhone-Poulenc, the flagship of the French chemicals sector, marks a
significant step in the gradual relaxation of the state's grip on industry
over the past decade.
The sale, expected by the prime minister's office to take place this year,
will be the first time the Socialist government has let its direct
shareholding in a public sector company fall from a majority to a minority.
Its direct voting rights in the group will fall from 77.5 per cent to around
45 per cent as a result of the sale and the dilution of state voting rights
caused by the related decision to enfranchise Rhone-Poulenc's non-voting
shareholders.
Yet the government will still exercise effective majority control because
the shares owned by Credit Lyonnais and AGF, the state-owned bank and
insurance company, will bring the total public sector stake up to around 65
per cent, after the operation.
The state expects to collect around FFr4bn (Pounds 477m) from the sale, said
Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, industry minister.
That would bring total public sector share sales this year to FFr14bn,
including stakes in the oil groups Total and Elf Aquitaine, and the bank
Credit Local de France, just short of the government's FFr15bn target.
As with the rest, the proceeds from the Rhone-Poulenc sale will be used to
fund job creation measures and to pump capital back into other state
companies.
The Rhone-Poulenc move was being seen by analysts yesterday as a step
towards full privatisation for the chemicals group and possibly others.
The right-wing opposition, likely to win legislative elections in March, has
an ambitious privatisation programme. Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, Rhone-Poulenc's
chairman, is well placed to ensure Rhone-Poulenc, which needs fresh capital,
benefits. He was picked for the job by the former Gaullist government and is
close to former French president Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, head of the
centre-right UDF.
Even if the right fails to win the election, the Socialist administration
has already said it is prepared to start selling majority stakes in state
industry from next spring.
The other important feature of this sell-off is that Rhone-Poulenc's
existing non-voting shareholders - just over a quarter of the total - are to
be given votes for free.
This will surprise and possibly delight non-voting shareholders in other
public sector companies, such as BNP and Credit Lyonnais, the first and
second largest state banks, and the aluminium group Pechiney. Like
Rhone-Poulenc, these companies issued large amounts of non-voting
certificats d'investissement (CIs) and a range of quasi-equity instruments
before the government last year relaxed its freeze on the issue of ordinary
equity in public sector companies to the private sector. These investors
will now expect, like their counterparts at Rhone-Poulenc, to be
enfranchised for nothing.
On the surface, the enfranchisement of Rhone-Poulenc's non-voting
shareholders looks like another stage in the government's policy of getting
state companies to behave as much as possible like their private sector
competitors, against which they compete for scarce finance on world capital
markets.
However, some analysts point out that the implication of allowing non-voting
shares to acquire votes at no charge is that voting rights in French public
sector companies are worthless. They argue that the state will always hold
the whip hand, even if it only has a minority stake, as it does, for
example, at the oil group Total, where the government retains the right to
nominate the chairman and vet important international accords.
This could also be the case in full sell-offs, in line with the previous -
and possibly future - Gaullist administration's tactic of trying to leave
privatised companies with a decisive 'hard core' of institutional
shareholders loyal to government policies. Mr Fourtou, for one, is a keen
advocate of a hard core for Rhone-Poulenc, on the grounds that it insulates
the management from the search for short-term profits at the expense of
long-term strategy. This is a classic concern of industry policy on both
sides of French politics.

<TEXT>
The EC Commission is to try to simplify the transitional system for
collecting and accounting for value added tax and excise duties in the
single European market, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
The system, which comes into force from next January 1, is designed to adapt
current VAT procedures to the abolition of border controls. It has been
widely criticised for imposing new administrative burdens on European
business.
But Mrs Christiane Scrivener, EC tax commissioner, said yesterday Brussels
would publish a new directive aimed at eliminating certain technical
difficulties with the system. The directive will tackle VAT problems which
might arise from 'triangular trade' in the EC. For example, a Belgian
company ordering Spanish goods for delivery to a French subsidiary will not
have to register for VAT in France. Instead the French subsidiary will be
directly liable. The transitional system should be replaced with a
definitive scheme from January 1997.

ALMOST 60 per cent of all public works contracts in Italy are awarded on a
discretionary basis, according to a parliamentary study out yesterday.
The study was prompted by public concern over corruption in public works
contracts as a result of the Milan municipal scandal. Investigations by
Milan magistrates have revealed systematic abuses, with tenders rigged and
commissions handed out to the political parties for up to 5 per cent of the
contract value.
The discretionary nature of most public works tenders is regarded as a big
encouragement to corruption. The evidence in the study is expected to speed
efforts towards a more transparent and competitive system of tendering.
The study examined public works contracts worth L48,291bn (Pounds 22bn). Of
this, L28,582bn concerned projects where the contracts had been awarded on
the basis of private treaty, concessions or uncompetitive tenders 'which
failed to comply with the basic requisites of publicity'. Among the worst
offenders were government bodies and big state companies.

FT  30 OCT 92 / France cuts repurchase rate to 10.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday proved that it has emerged unscathed from last month's
currency crisis when the Bank of France announced it was bringing its 5-10
day repurchase rate back down to 10.5 per cent after temporarily raising it
to protect the franc.
The bank raised the repurchase rate, the interest rate charged to borrowers
of last resort, from 10.5 to 13 per cent at the height of September's crisis
to stave off attacks on the French currency from foreign exchange dealers.
Yesterday's decision to reduce the repurchase rate indicates that the Bank
of France and the French government, are confident that the currency is now
safe from the threat of market pressure.
The decision to lower the rate has been welcomed by France's banks, which
faced a steep increase in their own borrowing costs because of the increase.
The rise in the repurchase rate, which was not accompanied by an increase in
base rates, triggered an immediate jump in overnight money market rates.
If the repurchase rate had not returned to its original level the Bank of
France and the government, which is usually consulted on rate changes, would
have faced pressure from the banks to raise base rates to alleviate the
financial pressure on them.
The government, up for re-election next spring, would have been reluctant to
countenance an increase in base rates, given high real interest rates are
one of the chief causes of the sluggish state of the French economy.
Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said yesterday he would 'take
initiatives' as part of an EC effort to promote economic growth but gave no
details. Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, minister for industry and foreign trade,
said Europe should take joint action to reduce interest rates and promote
big public infrastructure investments.
