FT  29 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Maxwell asset talks likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME OF the companies which hold assets taken from the Maxwell company
pension funds may be prepared to discuss returning them, said Sir John
Cuckney, chairman of a government trust raising money for pensioners.
Asked by the social security select committee if those who profited from
dealing with Mr Maxwell - or assisted in the fraud - were providing funds to
pensioners, he said: 'I have been approached by those who may be the target
of legal action as well as those who may begin legal action themselves who
are wishing to open up a dialogue.'
He said that had proper standards of corporate governance been maintained in
the City, Mr Maxwell would not have been able to steal the money.
Sir John appointed to seek contributions from the City and individuals to
pay compensation to Maxwell pensioners, told the Select Committee on Social
Security that so far, just under Pounds 6m has been raised in 14 weeks.
That sum is greater than those raised in the early weeks of disasters such
as the Piper Alpha explosion and the Hillsborough stadium disaster.
Some 600 individuals and companies have been approached for contributions,
he said. Funds raised are enough to meet pension liabilities for roughly the
next three years.
Sir John said that some companies which had dealings with Mr Maxwell have
avoided making contributions because to do so might imply some guilt on
their part.
Sir John said he had begun to act as an intermediary between lawyers and
liquidators for parts of the Maxwell empire contesting each other's claims
for assets.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Bottomley defends stance on tobacco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, yesterday defended the
government's reluctance to impose a ban on tobacco advertising, in spite of
the publication of a government report which concludes advertising does have
a positive effect on consumption.
Mrs Bottomley told the commons select committee on health that the
government saw tobacco advertising as important, but a statutory ban was 'a
very serious step to take in a free country,' as it would have grave
implications for commercial freedom of speech.
She said the UK had already reduced the proportion of smokers from 45 per
cent of the population to 30 per cent, second only to the Netherlands in
Europe, and had set a target of 20 per cent in the Health of the Nation
white paper.
A range of measures would be deployed to reach that target, including
possible strengthening of the current voluntary arrangements limiting
tobacco advertising, and maintaining high prices for tobacco products.
Mrs Bottomley said Britain was attempting to persuade other EC countries of
the importance of pricing in reducing tobacco consumption.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Benefits freeze 'considered'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAPERS suggesting that ministers are considering freezing certain social
security benefits or uprating them by less than the rate of inflation were
published by Labour yesterday, as part of the opposition's pre-emptive
strike on the government's public spending plans.
The documents, released by Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security
secretary, discuss the presentational difficulties for the government of
being tougher on those who are sick or disabled than on those who are able
to work.
The cabinet will today have its first opportunity to discuss the spending
plans drawn up by the public expenditure committee chaired by Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor. Ministers will be able to discuss the options
thoroughly, but are unlikely to make firm decisions until next week's
meeting.
Social security ministers insist that the Tories' manifesto commitments will
be met. In strict terms, these are limited to uprating child benefit and the
basic state pension in line with the rate of inflation.
Some benefits, such as invalidity benefit, currently have to be uprated in
line with inflation, though this link could be broken if the government
brought forward legislation to do so. Others merely have to be reviewed each
year, though the means-tested ones usually are raised.
The documents suggest that in his meetings with Treasury ministers Mr Peter
Lilley, the social security secretary, will want to point out the
presentational problems 'of benefit freezes affecting the poorest to raise
tax allowances for those in work'. Mr Dewar said that the papers, dated
around the end of last month, show that the question of benefit freezes had
been on the agenda, and called on Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to say
in advance of the Autumn Statement if the idea of under-indexing had been
discarded.
'It would be a political blunder, even by the standards of this chancellor,
to hit those on benefit - the sick and the unemployed - in an effort to bail
out the Treasury,' Mr Dewar said.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories postpone new curbs on unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday postponed the bill containing further measures
directed against the unions - even though the legislation covered pledges
made in the Conservative general election manifesto.
Ministers had originally planned to bring the bill before parliament in the
autumn but do not now expect to introduce it until early next year.
The delay to the bill follows the massive show of public support for the
mining unions over the pit-closures programme. The Trades Union Congress has
been prominent in the campaign which led to the government's U-turn over the
collieries.
The bill was expected to threaten union finances by outlawing the automatic
deduction of dues from salaries. It was also due to contain measures to
force unions to give seven days notice of strikes and to give workers
greater freedom of choice over which union to join - a move that is seen as
a further threat to the TUC.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, denied that the legislation
proposed by Mr Michael Howard, her Thatcherite predecessor, had been delayed
because of its political sensitivity.
She said at the Institute of Personnel Management's annual conference in
Harrogate the postponement was due to difficulties in drafting additional
clauses to implement a European Community directive on maternity benefits
agreed at a meeting of EC employment ministers last week.
Mrs Shephard said that drafting the legislation should not take 'too long'
and confirmed that the bill would be considered in the current session of
parliament. That means it should be enacted by this time next year at the
latest.
Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, urged the government to use the
extra time to think again about whether the bill was necessary. 'It would be
better never than late,' he said.
Mrs Shephard also confirmed that the government does not believe wages
councils, the statutory bodies which set pay rates for more than 2.5m
workers in low-paid jobs, have a permanent place in the labour market. The
delay in bringing the bill forward gives ministers a further opportunity to
decide whether to include the abolition of wages councils in the
legislation.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said the proposals would make
the government 'even more unpopular' at Westminster.
The measures might well, however, be an issue that could unite Tory
backbenchers.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Extent of Euro rebellion hangs on
motion - David Owen takes soundings among those Conservative MPs who could
be crucial to the prime minister next Wednesday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCALE of Mr John Major's task in securing a Commons majority in next
week's vote on the Maastricht treaty was underlined last night by
indications that as many as 50 Conservative MPs are currently minded to
oppose the government. Telephone interviews with scores of Tory MPs suggest
that this level of opposition could conceivably materialise if the
government insists on tabling a substantive motion vowing to press ahead
with examination of the bill implementing the treaty without delay.
A revolt on this scale would leave the government staring defeat in the face
 -although past experience suggests the number is likely to be considerably
whittled down by the time the division bell rings.
Nevertheless, if the prime minister continues the confrontational route on
which he embarked this week, he will be relying heavily on his ability to
shepherd several of these potential rebels back to the fold.
The alternative is to bow to backbench pressure, either by tabling an
anodyne technical motion or agreeing to delay detailed consideration of the
Maastricht Bill.
If the motion which eventually appears is interpreted as a vote of
confidence in the government, the prospective rebellion would probably
evaporate almost to vanishing point.
As the government ponders tactics, those most likely to face the tender
mercies of the whips are the potential waverers: backbenchers who have
hedged their rebellious instincts.
Into this category fall Mr Paul Marland, MP for Gloucestershire West, Mr
Roger Moate, Faversham, Mr John Townend, Bridlington, Sir Rhodes Boyson,
Brent North, Mr Michael Lord, Suffolk Central, and others.
Some of this group indicated this week that a concession on timing could be
the key to securing their support for a substantive motion, although others
may be satisfied by the news of Denmark's attempt to break the impasse over
its ratification of the treaty.
Mr Townend said he would be 'unlikely to vote for' a substantive motion,
while Sir Rhodes said he would 'find it very difficult' to give the
government his support. Mr Lord said he would 'have to see what the wording
is'. He added: 'All I am interested in is: are they going to bring the bill
back. If they do, I shall vote against it.'
Among the group, Mr Moate - who abstained when the Maastricht Bill received
its second Commons reading - may prove the most intractable to sticks and
blandishments. 'At the very least I would abstain, but my inclination would
be to vote against,' he said.
Government business managers will take heart from their memories of fizzled
backbench rebellions of the recent past - notably in July when not one Tory
supported a Labour amendment to extend a moratorium on stamp duty on house
sales.
Indeed, there is already evidence that potential rebels are beginning to
back away from confrontation.
Mr Den Dover, MP for Chorley, yesterday said he would support the
government. On Tuesday, asked how he would react to a substantive motion
vowing to press on with the Maastricht treaty as quickly as possible, he
said he was 'inclined to vote against'. He said the switch was 'because of
the Danish position being clarified'.
Mr James Hill, MP for Southampton Test, also pledged this week to back the
government. A month ago he told the FT: 'If there is any thought of
bulldozing through the same thing again, they will find a lot of people like
me hesitating.'
He said in explanation: 'I suppose I have been reading a lot more about
Maastricht.'
It is clear that many implacable opponents of Maastricht are prepared to
back Mr Major next week, either out of personal ambition or because they are
unwilling to risk precipitating a situation in which the government could
fall.
One new MP said: 'I am crying out for this measure to be brought down but I
am not sure this is the right time to act. It is nothing short of insulting
to bring it forward now.' Another more experienced hand said: 'We are not in
the business of trying to get rid of the government.'
Mr Major, however, must be privately dismayed at the depth of the resolve of
experienced MPs like Mr Peter Griffiths, Portsmouth North, Mr Bill Walker,
Tayside North and Mr John Wilkinson, Ruislip-Northwood, all of whom were
adamant this week that they would oppose a substantive motion.
Mr Walker, who abstained on the bill's second reading, said: 'At the general
election, I stood on a platform that I would oppose Maastricht. I will not
let my constituents down.' Mr Wilkinson said: 'Her Majesty's government is
hell-bent on committing hara kiri.'
The prime minister must be even more concerned at the determination of newly
elected MPs like Mr Warren Hawksley, Halesowen and Stourbridge, and Mr
Walter Sweeney, Vale of Glamorgan, to oppose a substantive motion.
Mr Sweeney said: 'I am very sorry I did not vote against the government in
the second reading in May. I felt rather pusillanimous when the Danes voted
against (Maastricht) in their referendum.'
If the other hardliners keep their nerve, and the 22 Tory rebels from the
second reading remained opposed, a vote on a substantive motion would be
desperately close, even assuming the least determined of the 50 were brought
into line.
It cannot be presumed that all of the 22 would continue to defy the
leadership. In May they did so safe in the knowledge that Labour's
instruction to its MPs to abstain would ensure a convincing government
majority.
But none of them has yet publicly promised to back the government this time
around.
Sir Trevor Skeet, MP for Bedfordshire North - seen by some as a potential
waverer - said yesterday: 'On a substantive motion, I am against it, exactly
as I was last time . . . The prime minister does not require the vote at
all. This is very provocative.'

FT  29 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Loyalists step up their fightback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY loyalists and Euro-enthusiasts intensified their fightback against the
Euro-sceptics yesterday as they sensed that the tide of opinion at
Westminster was turning their way.
The campaign gained momentum, both behind the scenes and in front of the
cameras, as loyalists insisted that colleagues who had been prepared to vote
against the government were being won over by the argument that to do so
would reduce Mr John Major's chances of securing a successful outcome to the
Edinburgh summit in December.
As part of the rallying behind the government, 32 Tory MPs have put their
signatures to a letter in today's Times newspaper.
It expresses fierce opposition to the anti-Maastricht stance of some of
their colleagues who represent only 10 per cent of the party they say, but
whose stance is 'undermining the position and policy of the Government and
the standing of the Prime Minister. This plays directly into the hands of
the Opposition and does Great Britain considerable damage'.
Further loyalist letters are being prepared for publication, and
parliamentary motions in support of Maastricht are likely to be tabled.
Ministers themselves have intensified their efforts to persuade. Mr Douglas
Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday saw three groups of 'soft Euro-phobe'
MPs, to bring them round behind the government, and to encourage them to be
more vocal in highlighting the benefits of the agreement.
Leading loyalists have now begun queueing up to enter the broadcasting
studios and contest the assertions of the Euro-sceptics.
Sir Michael Grylls, the chairman of the Tory backbench trade and industry
committee, said that the prime minister's stance on Maastricht 'has been
vindicated by the Danish decision to press towards ratification. It fulfils
John Major's pledge in July to bring the Bill back to the Commons when the
Danes had clarified their intentions.
'No one, from whatever party, can now argue that there is any reason for
further indefinite postponement.'
He went on to emphasise the importance of the single market for the
prospects of British economic recovery, a line reinforced by Sir Michael
Angus, president of the CBI. He warned a meeting of Tory backbenchers that
failure to ratify the treaty could cost inward investment and jobs.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Criminal Justice Bill may be
altered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday indicated its readiness to amend further the
Criminal Justice Bill following protests from bankers that the bill's
provisions on insider dealing and money laundering could restrict them
unfairly.
Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said the government
did not want to undermine financial services in London. He said the bill,
which was published on Friday, could be amended to take account of
legitimate concerns.
'I am certainly prepared to listen. I have no interest in imposing on the
City legislation that is going to disrupt legitimate business,' said Mr
Nelson in an interview with the Reuters news agency.
Mr Nelson accepted that the consultation period leading up to the
introduction of the bill last week had been too short to respond to all
concerns. He said the government had faced the threat of infraction
proceedings by the EC.
The latest protests at the bill were made on Monday by the British Bankers'
Association. Lord Inchyra, the director general, said the association was
concerned that senior bankers could inadvertently fall foul of the law.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Political Notebook: A question of confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE present climate at Westminster it is hazardous to anticipate how Mr
John Major's government will behave during the next few hours, let alone
over the following week.
For the beleaguered prime minister the medium-term now extends to the day
after next. His cabinet sorely lacks a Lord Whitelaw to provide the calm
wisdom which saved Lady Thatcher from so many catastrophes in her early
years as prime minister. So it would be folly to predict with certainty now
the shape and outcome of next week's debate on the Maastricht treaty.
But Downing Street has at last begun to clear away the debris under which it
successfully buried the government over the weekend. The risible threat that
Mr Major would call a snap general election if he lost the vote has been
lifted.
The naive among the prime minister's advisers have realised that while he is
perfectly entitled to stake his own future on a single (and constitutionally
unnecessary) vote, he cannot bind his party, nor his cabinet, to the same
mast.
The conventional wisdom now is that a defeat next week would wound Mr Major
seriously, probably mortally, but somehow the Conservatives would soldier on
in government under a new leader.
Mr Major's colleagues have begun to acknowledge that it is not enough simply
to berate the Euro-sceptics on the Conservative back benches. They have to
win back the hearts if not the minds of a deeply disgruntled but basically
loyal group of Tory MPs whose votes will make the difference between victory
and defeat on Wednesday.
By calling them together for friendly chats in small groups before his
semi-public appeal to the parliamentary party later today at the 1922
Committee, the prime minister has at last started playing to his strengths.
Mr Major wants a substantive motion on Maastricht, one that will demonstrate
to recalcitrant backbenchers that his authority has been restored and to his
EC counterparts that he remains a reliable player in the European game.
Most of his cabinet colleagues share that view. Mr Kenneth Clarke is the
most forceful in arguing for a showdown with the rebels. That has led many
on the right to accuse him of plotting to ensure Mr Major's downfall.
Anyone who has listened to the prime minister's passionate defence of his
European strategy knows that on Maastricht he needs no encouragement from
declared Europhiles.
So the option favoured by most at today's cabinet will be a motion which
faces down the rebels without deliberately inflaming the waverers  - in
spite of the risk that hardened Euro-sceptics will then back a wrecking
Labour amendment.
But the present atmosphere at Westminster - increasingly reminiscent of the
final days of Lady Thatcher - means that outcome cannot be regarded as a
foregone conclusion.
If Mr Richard Ryder announces that his whips will not be able to whittle
down the number of Tory rebels to below 30, Mr Major will be forced into
another retreat and to opt for an adjournment motion. One (pro-European)
cabinet minister has taken to quoting Winston Churchill: 'It is no use
committing suicide if you are going to regret it in later life.'
Against that, Labour's U-turn on Maastricht should encourage the prime
minister to gamble. Many of those Tories who have been threatening to defy
the whips know now they have a qualitatively different decision to make.
There are perhaps a dozen Tory dissidents who could not care less who is in
Downing Street. But the more sophisticated dissidents regard the only
realistic alternatives - Mr Clarke, Mr Michael Heseltine or Mr Douglas Hurd
 -as less acceptable than the present incumbent.
With Mr John Smith ready to shrug off his European credentials in favour of
political opportunism, there will be intense pressure on the Tory side to
maximise Labour's discomfort. The opposition's demand for still further
clarification from Denmark before the legislation can be considered in the
Commons looks as convincing as Downing Street's threat of a general
election.
Mr Smith has accepted that the only way that Labour can credibly vote
against next week's motion is by stating that it has nothing to do with
Europe and everything to do with confidence in the government. But that
means the Conservative party also now has a simple choice: does it have
confidence in its own government?

FT  29 OCT 92 / Power struggle starts to affect government: The LDP's search
for leader of a key faction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT began late last year as a financial scandal at an obscure trucking
company called Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin. Two weeks ago it claimed the career of
Japan's most powerful politician, Mr Shin Kanemaru. This week the struggle
to succeed him could begin to hamper seriously the government of Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa as the Diet, the Japanese parliament, reopens tomorrow.
The battle to succeed Mr Kanemaru as head of the Takeshita faction, the
biggest LDP grouping, comes at a particularly delicate time for the
government as it attempts to revive a rapidly flagging economy, waits
anxiously for the outcome of the Gatt world trade talks and ponders what may
lie in store if the US elects a Democrat president.
A majority of the LDP leaders have thrown their weight behind Mr Keizo
Obuchi as Mr Kanemaru's successor. They face determined opposition from Mr
Ichiro Ozawa, architect of the LDP's 1990 election victory who became used
to wielding power as Mr Kanemaru's right-hand man.
The struggle is far from over.
Much depends on how Mr Ozawa pursues the fight. Although he is in a minority
in the 109-member faction as a whole, he claims a majority among its 67
representatives in the lower house, the most powerful part of the
legislature.
The creation of a new party is out of the question. The New Liberal Club,
which broke away from the LDP in 1975, returned to the fold ignominiously
defeated after 11 years.
The risk of starting a new Ozawa faction within the LDP is that it might be
marginalised. Since the 1960s, when the LDP was made up of about 10
factions, the party has been dominated by four very large groupings all
named after their current leaders or founders - Mr Takeshita; prime minister
Mr Miyazawa; Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister; and Mr Hiroshi
Mitsuzuka, the party's former policy research chairman.
Long-running and vicious personal feuds have been a hallmark of LDP politics
from the party's foundation in the mid-1950s. The significance of this
dispute is that it comes at a time when political leadership and stability
will be at a premium on foreign and domestic issues.
The power struggle could delay and complicate the Diet's main task, to enact
the emergency Y10,700bn (Pounds 54bn) public spending package announced in
August.
The authority of Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, will not have been
enhanced by his public siding with Mr Ozawa. The opposition parties may yet
threaten to delay passage of the measures until Mr Takeshita agrees to
submit to questioning in the Diet.
Mr Kanemaru's authority was vital in forcing an often unwieldy and fractious
bureaucracy to pull the package together. The Ministry of Finance wanted to
delay announcing a package until late September. Officials were ordered to
bring it forward.
When Mr Kanemaru gave his approval to the package in mid-August, that
endorsement quelled LDP criticism of the Finance Ministry. There is no one
of his stature and authority to exert that kind of discipline over
policymaking at a time when government spending is crucial to encourage
domestic economic growth.
The debate over Japanese fiscal policy and public spending, in which many
LDP politicians have already called for higher borrowing and income tax
cuts, could become unruly.
In the 1980s political and economic disciplines worked in tandem in Japan.
Tight control of public spending exerted discipline over the LDP factions
because there was less scope for interest groups to bid for subsidies and
spending projects.
The Takeshita faction's unity and authority was central to the introduction
of the controversial 3 per cent consumption tax in 1989.
The combination of a rise in public spending and a decline in political
discipline could encourage interest groups to outbid one another in offering
political support in return for government help to see them through the
downturn.
On international issues too, it could become more difficult for the
government to agree clear responses swiftly.
The election of a Democrat President Bill Clinton would spell a period of
unsettling uncertainty in Japan over the direction of US foreign and trade
policy. US diplomats say Mr Ozawa and Mr Kanemaru played a vital role in
drumming up Japan's contribution to the Gulf war effort and passing the
peacekeeping bill last year. Their familiarity with the Washington
establishment may be lacking at a vital time.
A deal between the US and Europe to cut agricultural subsidies through the
Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)talks would also put the LDP on
the spot over the domestically contentious issue of opening up the Japanese
rice market.
Mr Kozo Watanabe, the trade minister and an Ozawa supporter, had hurriedly
to return home and cover his tracks at the weekend after suggesting Japan
would have to respond positively to a Gatt deal.
It is thought that only someone of Mr Kanemaru's stature would have the
authority to push through measures to liberalise the rice market for the
sake of a Gatt agreement.
As a senior western diplomat in Tokyo put it: 'Mr Miyazawa started as prime
minister by trying to manage the Diet and the party without the Takeshita
faction and he failed, that is why he had to rely upon Kanemaru and Ozawa.'
The alliance supporting Mr Miyazawa is held together only by a common
determination to stop Mr Ozawa. The grouping will soon have to address a
range of issues - not least a delicate cabinet reshuffle - which could test
its unity. If the alliance members start squabbling among themselves Mr
Miyzawa's job will become doubly difficult.
Westerners have two contrasting views of Japan's leadership. One is that
Japan is blessed with highly effective institutions such as the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry, staffed by far-sighted bureaucrats.
The other is that Japanese politics is bedevilled by near-paralysis because
no one has the authority to pull together conflicting ministries,
politicians and interest groups.
Over the next few weeks Japan's politics could swing - possibly quite
sharply - towards paralysis.

MR Kim Woo-choong, the chairman of the Daewoo business group, yesterday
indicated that he would accept a possible presidential nomination by South
Korea's newest political party.
But officials of the New Korea party (NPK) remained divided over whether to
offer him the candidancy.
Opponents to Mr Kim's nomination argue that the NPK's chances in the
December election would be hurt if he is the candidate.
There is strong public distrust of Korea's main conglomerates, of which
Daewoo is the fourth largest, because of their close ties with the country's
former military rulers.
However, the NPK, which was formed only a week ago by a conservative
splinter group from the ruling Democratic Liberal party, may have no
alternative but to accept Mr Kim.
Several other potential candidates, including Mr Park Tae-joon, the former
chairman of Pohang Iron and Steel, have refused to become the NPK candidate.
Mr Kim would become the fourth main candidate in the presidential election
if he receives the NPK nomination.
The NPK could play a pivotal role in the forthcoming campaign by helping to
split the conservative vote and possibly delivering the election to Mr Kim
Dae-jung, the leading opposition leader.

<TEXT>
KENYA'S first multi-party elections for 26 years are expected to take place
by mid-December following President Daniel arap Moi's dissolution of
parliament yesterday.
President Moi did not give a date for the poll. Under the constitution
elections must take place within 90 days of a dissolution and the government
must set the date for the elections six weeks in advance of voting.
However, opposition politicians in Nairobi said that they thought it
unlikely that Mr Moi would choose to delay the exercise beyond Christmas.
The ruling Kenya African National Union's (Kanu) main challengers will be
the two wings of the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD) and the
Democratic party of former vice-president Mr Mwai Kibaki.
The split in FORD was ostensibly over internal party elections, but behind
the dispute lie tribal divisions and personality disputes.
The bickering between the two factions has played into Mr Moi's hands,
eroding FORD's initial popularity and enhancing Kanu's electoral prospects.
Altogether at least 10 parties have been formed and there is little hope
they will unite before the elections.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Japan's dissidents form breakaway faction

<TEXT>
A POWER struggle within the largest faction of Japan's ruling Liberal
Democratic party (LDP) intensified yesterday, threatening to distract the
government at a time when decisions are needed on crucial economic and
international policy issues.
The split within the Takeshita faction widened yesterday when Mr Tsutomu
Hata, Japan's finance minister, established a 'policy study group' within
the faction, in a move that could herald a long and destabilising campaign
to take control of Japanese policy-making and a political reform programme.
The formation of the new group followed the formal appointment yesterday of
Mr Keizo Obuchi as chairman of the faction, which was run by Mr Shin
Kanemaru, the disgraced godfather of Japanese politics, who resigned
recently after violating political funding laws.
After his appointment, Mr Obuchi said that he would try to reunite the
faction, but Mr Hata and Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a former LDP secretary-general and
the most powerful member of the new group, said his selection had breached
the faction's rules because it was announced before a consensus had been
reached.
The factional friction of the past two weeks has distracted the government
and raised the possibility that it will be unable to reach conclusions on
sensitive political issues, such as the opening of the rice market to
foreign producers or aid to Russia.
There is also concern among Japanese executives that the wrangling within
the LDP and attacks by opposition parties will delay the passage of an
emergency economic package at a parliamentary session beginning tomorrow.
Mr Hata said the package was unlikely to be obstructed, but opposition
parties are demanding that evidence about recent scandals be presented to
parliament.
Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister and the founder of the
faction, is likely to be asked to explain his alleged links to gangster
groups.
The creation of the new faction grouping is an attempt to undermine the
authority of Mr Takeshita, who favoured the appointment of Mr Obuchi.
It is likely that the policy study group will become a faction unless Mr
Hata or Mr Ozawa or a compromise candidate is appointed to the post of
chairman of the faction.
For the next few months, the two senior officials are likely to work within
the existing faction to sign up members for their own faction, which could
become the most powerful within the ruling party.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Australian dollar falls to five-year low
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian dollar fell more than half a US cent to a five-year low of
69.78 US cents yesterday, reflecting renewed international concern about
Australia's economic prospects. The decline in the currency followed a fall
in the annual rate of inflation to a 29-year-low of 0.8 per cent, the lowest
in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
Mr John Dawkins, the Labor treasurer (finance minister) said lower inflation
would not lead to a further cut in official interest rates, which have been
reduced 12 times since January 1990. However, there was speculation that the
government may cut interest rates from the present rate of 5.75 per cent in
an attempt to boost economic activity before the next election, due by June.
The Australian currency was also weakened by a recent downgrading by Moody's
Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, of the long-term debt of
Victoria, Australia's second most populous state.
The Australian dollar has fallen by more than two US cents in a week, in
spite of extensive intervention by the Reserve Bank of Australia, which has
attempted to smooth currency market fluctuations. Some dealers said the
currency could fall to 68 US cents over the next few weeks, compared with a
recent peak of just over 80 cents in September last year. The currency has
fallen by about 13 per cent on a trade-weighted basis over the same period.

SYRIA and Iran yesterday appeared to have persuaded Shia Moslem Hizbollah

After shifting a mechanised battalion to the Lebanese-Israeli border on
Tuesday night, the Israelis said they would take no further action unless
Hizbollah attacked them again.
No Katyusha rockets have been fired since Tuesday, when Syria convoked the
'security committee' established under Syrian and Iranian patronage in 1990
to end the war between Hizbollah and Amal, the rival Shia Moslem militia.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Gentle party chieftain pushed into limelight: Kanemaru's
successor is no 'godfather'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the position of 'godfather' became vacant in the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP), the gently-spoken Mr Keizo Obuchi was pushed forward
by the political pack and found himself awarded with the title of Japan's
Most Powerful Politician.
Mr Obuchi may have taken the title from Mr Shin Kanemaru, who has just
resigned, but he doesn't quite have the credentials to make the title stick.
Japan's 'godfather' must be a bruiser, able to coerce the party's unruly
factions into line, a tough backroom operator and a benefactor with enough
favours distributed among underlings that he can rely on their devotion.
Having gone to the right university, Waseda, and having followed his father
into politics, Mr Obuchi, 55, had a headstart on the competition. But his
unceasing service to Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister and
another Waseda man, has left him without the personal power base necessary
for a genuine 'godfather'.
The shadow of Mr Takeshita has loomed large over the career of Mr Obuchi,
who held the abacus when Mr Takeshita was reckoning whether he had the
numbers to take control of the party's largest faction in 1987.
It is part of Japanese political lore that the well-meaning Mr Obuchi was so
impressed by a Waseda colleague's oratory skills that he taped one of his
speeches and based his own first parliamentary speech, at age 26, on that of
his colleague. That colleague was Mr Toshiki Kaifu, prime minister until
late last year.
While Mr Takeshita looms over Mr Obuchi, the shadow of scandal is looming
over Mr Takeshita, and has its origins at the time he succeeded in wresting
control of the faction from another genuine 'godfather', Mr Kakuei Tanaka, a
former prime minister and a power within the party long after his
resignation from that post in 1974.
Outraged by the lack of loyalty shown to Mr Tanaka, an extreme-right group
sent their sound vans into the streets for a noisy 'praising to death'
campaign against Mr Takeshita, who was praised loud and often on the eve of
an election. One embarrassing piece of praise was that 'we should elect
Takeshita because he's very good at making money'.
The skill of fund-raising is more important for a 'godfather' than a prime
minister and, according to Japanese prosecutors, Mr Takeshita indirectly
asked a gangster group to use its good offices to ensure that the
right-wingers turned down the volume.
At the parliamentary session to open tomorrow, Mr Takeshita is expected to
be summoned to explain those gangster links, though his mastery of the
double and triple negative should ensure that he survives the questioning
with career intact.
If Mr Takeshita falls, it is unlikely that Mr Obuchi will remain Japan's
Most Powerful Politician, and an opening will be created for Mr Ichiro
Ozawa, a former LDP secretary-general and an ally of Mr Kanemaru.
With a friendship cemented by the marriage of their children, Mr Takeshita
and Mr Kanemaru had formed a powerful alliance, but both wanted the
leadership and Mr Kanemaru had the numbers.
Meanwhile, the party's four other factions have rushed to support Mr Obuchi,
recognising that he is unlikely to have the influence to push them around
and fearing that Mr Ozawa has the charisma, the contacts and the fiscal
skills required to make him a real 'godfather'.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Public-service tender bidders face EC curb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITEHALL has warned companies seeking contracts to provide public services
that they may not be able to cut the pay and conditions of staff who
transfer to the private sector.
The warning follows the government's acceptance that it must comply fully
with a European Community directive protecting workers' pay and conditions
when they change employers.
Until now the government has argued that the directive applies only to
workers in the private sector.
Companies bidding for contracts under the government's contracting-out
programme have usually sought to reduce wage bills by cutting staff or
reducing pay and conditions.
Although the EC directive makes it easier to cut staff than to reduce pay
and conditions employers may also be liable for redundancy costs.
The Whitehall advice is likely to discourage some companies from bidding
because the contracts will be less profitable - about 80 per cent of the
cost of public services is labour.
It will also make it more difficult for the public sector to achieve the
target of more than 10 per cent savings which the government is seeking
through contracting out services.
The government's interpretation of the EC directive - known as the acquired
rights directive - has been disputed for five years by the European
Commission, which is threatening proceedings in the European Court of
Justice for alleged infringement.
The Department of Employment is expected to give way to Brussels by amending
UK law. The Treasury is warning officials not to rely on 1981 Transfer of
Undertakings (Employment Protection) Regulations, which were meant to
implement the directive, but which exclude most public sector transfers of
staff.
In a letter to the Central Office of Information, which is negotiating to
contract out its photocopying services, the Treasury solicitor writes: 'I
cannot confidently advise you that either (the UK regulations) or the
Acquired Rights Directive does not apply.'
The letter adds that this is a cautious view and there are reasons for
taking a contrary view.
Williams Lea, the reprographics company which is negotiating for a
photocopying contract with the COI, has now amended its standard terms and
conditions to comply with those in the public sector. It is now offering to
match the Civil Service holiday and sickness entitlements, although it says
there was never any suggestion staff would suffer if it won the contract.
Whitehall officials are now testing the feasibility of contracting out more
services such as accountancy and information technology.
Progress in extending market-testing will be highlighted in next month's
white paper on the Citizen's Charter.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Coach and 56 minibuses drive through MoD books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTRY of Defence was at a loss to explain yesterday who was
responsible for buying a coach and 56 minibuses without authorisation.
The Pounds 682,000 paid for the fleet of vehicles came out of funds awarded
to MoD branches for meeting or exceeding their efficiency targets.
Other items of 'irregular expenditure' identified by the National Audit
Office, the watchdog that reports to parliament on the use of public funds,
included out-of-hours entertaining and recreational facilities.
The audit office originally estimated that Pounds 210,000 of the efficiency
award money in the 1990-91 financial year was spent without going through
standard financial controls. An NAO report today by Sir John Bourn, the
comptroller and auditor general, says subsequent investigations reveal the
total to have been Pounds 1.2m, or 13 per cent of expenditure under the
scheme.
The parliamentary public accounts committee has called a special meeting on
December 9 to question the ministry about the irregularities.
The audit office also found that the MoD's accounting systems were
'overwhelmed' by the volume of supplies sent to the Gulf in advance of the
allied ground offensive against Iraq last year. Following the recovery of
unused supplies 87 containers, possibly containing stores and equipment,
could not be accounted for. More than 7,000 containers were sent to the
Gulf.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Row over rise in drugs bill for NHS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW has erupted between the pharmaceuticals industry and the Department of
Health over the rapidly expanding National Health Service drugs bill, Paul
Abrahams writes.
The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry yesterday warned that
the rapid increase in the drugs bill had been caused primarily by government
policy. Measures taken against the industry could be highly damaging.
The NHS drugs bill increased by 11.9 per cent to Pounds 3.138bn last year,
the association estimates. Dr John Griffin, association director, blamed the
expansion on an increase in the number of prescriptions. The government had
set doctors targets for the number of patients they screened and this had
led to more prescriptions.
He added: 'Volume has been pushed up by government pressure. Now the health
department is screaming because of the bill the government created for
itself. The industry risks being penalised for the success of the
government's policies. The department is looking for a scapegoat and the
industry is an easy target.'
Scrip, an independent industry newsletter, said that in England the number
of prescriptions was 17.6 per cent more in July compared with the same month
last year.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, has warned she will be looking
at the annual Pounds 69 per head drugs bill.

DIRECTORS' basic pay net of inflation in the UK was the fifth-highest in a
European league for the year to July, according to a survey by Monks
Partnership, the independent remuneration advisers.
The survey covered 1,350 multinational companies in 16 European countries
including the UK and was based on a standard company director post in
subsidiary organisations with annual turnovers of about Pounds 30m.
UK directors' pay increases, at 7.9 per cent for the year to July this year,
were at the upper end of the European league compared with equivalent posts
in multinational subsidiaries across Europe.
The highest basic salary rises recorded were in Portugal, where they
averaged 19.1 per cent, and the lowest in France at 5.8 per cent.
Adjustment for average levels of inflation in each country kept Portuguese
directors at the head of the league with UK increases at 3.6 per cent net of
inflation.
The move towards homogeneity of pay, incentives and benefits among the
senior managements of European international companies was seen to be
gathering pace.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Seven-year audit limit proposed for accountancy partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARTNERS in accountancy firms should not work on the audit of listed and
public interest companies for more than seven years at a time, draft
guidance from the UK and Irish chartered accountancy bodies suggested
yesterday.
Firms should rotate partners periodically to maintain objectivity, according
to a consultation paper published by the joint ethics committee of the
institutes of chartered accountants in England and Wales and of Scotland and
Ireland.
The proposals echo recommendations made in the Cadbury report on the
financial aspects of corporate governance released during the summer. They
are open to comment until the end of the year.
More radical calls for the audit firm itself to be changed every few years
have not been taken up. Auditors strongly opposed this idea, arguing that
most fraud occurs just after a change because the new firm is unfamiliar
with the company.
Previous ethical guidelines have recommended rotation, but have not
specified a period. The new guidance makes it mandatory.
The committee says involvement with the same client over a long period might
lead to continuing acceptance of practices which are no longer acceptable,
excessive reliance being placed on directors' assurances and explanations,
an unwillingness to face tough issues and reliance on an out-dated approach
to audit.
It says rotation will provide the client with a fresh, objective scrutiny,
promote impartiality and help professional development.
The document says 'public interest independence' should be seen to be
achieved, rather than just be claimed as a result of professional training,
attitudes and procedures.
Mr Jock Worsley, chairman of the committee, said he needed 'little
convincing of the possible merit of rotation of partners and staff'.
In separate proposed guidance the committee lays down strict terms
concerning partners in accountancy firms who join a company which is an
audit client.
It says they should immediately inform their firm of their intentions to
move and take no part in the audit of their future employer. They should
sever all connections with the firm.
It does not suggest a 'quarantine' period between leaving the firm and
joining an audit client, but has asked for views on the subject.
In a third consultation document on changes in accountancy firms used by
clients, the committee says firms must provide accountancy information to
their successors even when there is an outstanding dispute on fees.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Ambulance chief quits over delays: Allegations of deaths -
Bottomley orders external inquiry into computer system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHIEF executive of the London Ambulance Service, Mr John Wilby, resigned
yesterday after claims that several patients may have died as a result of
delays in meeting emergency calls.
Announcing his resignation, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said
that the LAS would conduct 'an external inquiry' into its Pounds 1.5m
computer-aided system which was designed to allocate emergency calls more
efficiently.
She said the LAS would immediately establish a support system involving
'where necessary direct voice contact between the control centre and
ambulances' to act as an extra safeguard.
Mr Wilby last night defended the progress made by LAS's managing board in
modernising its services over the last two years, but acknowledged that
mounting public criticism had forced him to resign as a matter of honour.
He said: 'I am deeply conscious of the lack of public confidence which has
been expressed following service failures over the past few months . . . I
have decided that the honourable course of action is to offer my
resignation.'
Criticism by doctors and union officials about the confusion and
inefficiency of the emergency services provided by LAS has been growing.
According to union officials, the issue came to a head earlier this week
when the introduction of a computer system at LAS's central control in
Waterloo led to delays of up to three hours.
Some of Mr Wilby's colleagues suggested he may be an unwilling scapegoat for
government policy which it is claimed has led to underfunding and inadequate
staffing.
Mr Wilby began his career as an ambulanceman 22 years ago. He was appointed
chief executive of the LAS in August 1990 after holding a series of senior
regional posts. As director of the Scottish Ambulance Service he helped
co-ordinate emergency services after the Lockerbie disaster in December
1988.
Mr Wilby will be temporarily replaced by Mr Martin Gorham, deputy chief
executive of the South West Thames Regional Health Authority, until a
permanent replacement can be recruited.
Replying to charges from Labour that the LAS's problems were 'wholly
preventable', Mrs Bottomley said the system's failures had been caused by
'exceptional circumstances'. She said more thought would have to be given to
how the computer system's 'teething difficulties' could be overcome.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, urged the government to draft in
'outside managerial expertise' for the service.

FT  29 OCT 92 / FO paper sought secrecy on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Foreign Office was prepared to approve the export to Iraq of machine
tools which were later used to make armaments during the Iran-Iraq war,
provided the deal was kept secret, according to a confidential document
produced in court yesterday.
The document, written by a senior official in the Middle Eastern department,
confirmed that the Foreign Office knew that equipment to be exported by
Matrix Churchill, the Iraqi-owned machine-tool manufacturer, could be used
to make munitions.
It advised that the arms embargo would not be broken. The shipment would not
prolong the war since the Iraqis would use the tools as a substitute for
Soviet supplies - a view disputed by the Ministry of Defence.
However, urging secrecy, the document said that if the deliveries became
public, they would have to stop.
The document was produced during the Old Bailey trial of three former Matrix
Churchill directors accused of deceiving the Department of Trade and
Industry by pretending the equipment was for civil use.
Mr Alan Clark, then a trade minister, also urged Matrix Churchill and other
machine-tool makers to keep quiet about deals with Iraq, the court heard.
Export licences for some of the company's exports were frozen after
intelligence reports suggested they would be used for military purposes.
Mr Clark met Mr Paul Henderson, the Matrix Churchill managing director and
one of the defendants, and other representatives of the machine-tool
industry in early 1988 to discuss the problems of restoring the licences.
The licences were approved by ministers soon after.
A minute of the meeting, read out in court, said Mr Clark told them press
stories about the deals would jeopardise restoring the licences. When
someone expressed concern that the Daily Telegraph was showing a close
interest, Mr Clark said he would contact Mr Max Hastings, the editor, since
he was a personal friend.
Mr Henderson, Mr Trevor Abraham, a former Matrix Churchill commercial
director, and Mr Peter Allen, a former sales director with the company, all
deny breaching export regulations.
The trial continues today.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Big two to join power group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO big power generators, National Power and PowerGen, have applied to
become members of the trade group which has hitherto represented small,
independent power companies. They are expected to be admitted at a meeting
today.
Mr Michael Spicer, chairman of the Association of Independent Electricity
Producers, said yesterday that the admission of the two electricity giants
would alter the character of the group substantially but would strengthen
its voice. He stressed its one company-one vote rule would be kept.
The 100-member association represents industrial companies which produce
their own power and the growing number of independent power projects started
since the industry was privatised in 1990.
Mr David Porter, association chief executive, said he had written to Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, offering to contribute to
the government review of energy policy sparked by reaction to pit closures.
He said the group was concerned that the review should not bring more
government interference in energy markets.
Among the association's members are several new gas-fired power projects
which have been accused of creating the 'dash for gas', said to be taking
market share from the coal industry.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Airlines call for monopoly probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's smaller independent airlines have called on the government to
undertake an urgent review of airline competition and refer the proposed
take-over of Dan-Air by British Airways to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland Airways and Mr Richard
Branson, head of Virgin Atlantic, yesterday pressed their case with the
Office of Fair Trading for a referral to the MMC of BA's acquisition of
Dan-Air.
They also asked for the establishment of a consumer watchdog for the airline
industry called 'Ofair', similar to those already set up for privatised
utilities such as gas, water and electricity.
The OFT is expected to decide in the next 48 hours whether to refer the BA
acquisition to the MMC.
BA warned it would consider pulling out of the deal if faced with long
regulatory hurdles, but the OFT is coming under increasing pressure to refer
the deal.
Sir Michael and Mr Branson said the take-over raised significant issues for
the future of UK airline competition which could not be waved aside for
short term expediency. Sir Michael said that the UK's multi-airline industry
policy 'has never been under greater threat'.
Both chairmen warned that the transaction would result in considerable job
losses in the UK aviation industry, especially at Gatwick, Dan-Air's London
base.
Sir Michael claimed the BA rescue would lead to about 3,000 job losses,
including the 1,600 jobs expected to be shed at Dan-Air and at suppliers.
He argued that more jobs would have been saved if the troubled airline had
collapsed and other carriers had been able to apply for Dan-Air routes out
of Gatwick.
Mr Branson claimed that at least 1,500 jobs would have been saved at Dan-Air
if his earlier rescue proposal had been accepted.

<TEXT>
Industrial production in eastern Germany was down by 3.2 per cent in July
and August, against the same period of 1991, according to the Economics
Ministry, writes Quentin Peel. The figures continue to show large
fluctuations between months and sectors, and no sign of sustained economic
recovery.
For example, mining output was down 23.5 per cent over the full year, but up
by 14 per cent in August, compared with July. The best performances (on
unadjusted figures) were in consumer goods and food processing, where
production over the year was up 5 per cent. Construction activity was up by
4.7 per cent.
Meanwhile, Reuter reports engineering orders fell by 2 per cent in real
terms in September from a year earlier, according to the industry
association. It said third-quarter orders were 9 per cent below those in the
corresponding 1991 period. Domestic orders in September were down by 2 per
cent and foreign orders by 1 per cent. For the three-month period, both
foreign and domestic orders were 9 per cent lower compared to a year
earlier.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday followed up his ban on the
Communist-nationalist National Salvation Front by suppressing a 5,000-strong
parliamentary guard whose actions have caused disquiet among liberal
legislators.
The guard, formed after last year's failed putsch and answerable directly to
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, had been accused of
initiating an exchange of fire with the regular militia. On Tuesday, they
were sent to 'guard' the liberal Izvestia newspaper, which Mr Khasbulatov
has insisted must again become the official organ of parliament.
The guard has been withdrawn from Izvestia, but was reported yesterday still
to be in control of the Russian parliamentary building.
The two bans have raised the political tension still further in Moscow,
which is abuzz with rumours of coups, the formation of shadow cabinets and
the imposition of presidential power.
A group of liberally-inclined parliamentary factions yesterday appealed to
Mr Yeltsin not to introduce presidential power.
They argued that 'it would not be a strengthening of presidential power, it
would be an attempt to introduce, through the president, chaos and limitless
authority which would inevitably lead to civil war'.
Mr Khasbulatov, who was reported to have been taken ill last week, has
returned to work this week. His despatch of the guards to Izvestia came
after a decision by both houses of parliament to take back control of the
paper - which has Mr Yeltsin's backing to remain independent.

rise in 1995 would be 'last resort'

<TEXT>
MR THEO WAIGEL, the German finance minister, yesterday distanced himself
from Chancellor Helmut Kohl, insisting that a tax rise in 1995 was a 'last
resort' in the struggle to finance German unification and control the public
sector deficit.
He rejected outright any move to increase taxes before then, demanding
further drastic savings measures in the coming weeks to reduce a yawning gap
in government finances, even in 1993.
Mr Kohl also insisted yesterday that there could and would be no tax rises
for two years - in other words, before the 1994 elections - but gave
confusing signals on his willingness to make drastic cuts in state subsidies
to such sensitive sectors as coal-mining, agriculture and ship-building.
Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) closed its annual conference with
an overwhelming vote in favour of a resolution calling for big spending
cuts, increased efforts to boost economic growth in eastern Germany, and tax
rises in 1995. The resolution appeared to be a show of unity, but the party,
and the ruling coalition, remain deeply divided on how to bridge the
spending gap.
Immediate measures are required to trim next year's budget by at least
DM10bn (Pounds 4bn), and probably more like DM15bn, before it comes to the
committee stage in the Bundestag on November 11. First proposals must go to
the cabinet by next Wednesday. A meeting of the parties in the coalition is
scheduled for tonight.
The DM10bn is the saving needed to cope with the loss of revenue expected
from a 1 per cent decline in next year's economic growth rate. In addition,
a string of extra spending plans has been all but agreed to help the
collapsed east German economy, including an increase in investment subsidies
for small businesses.
The central exchequer is likely to face the cost of servicing east Germany's
DM50bn housing debt in 1994 and in 1995 the full burden of DM400bn to
DM500bn of accumulated eastern debts, including the debts of the Treuhand
privatisation agency.
Mr Waigel, who is leader of the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU)
in the ruling coalition, showed his extreme dislike of the idea of a 1995
tax rise without flatly rejecting it.
'Tax increases only come into consideration as a last resort, when all other
options have been exhausted,' he said,
'What is needed is a painful and unavoidable definition of new priorities.
The room for further borrowing has been played out. Top of the list must
come the exploitation of every possible measure for savings and reordering
of priorities.
'To have tax increases in reserve reduces the pressure to save on both the
central government, and the federal states.'
For his part, Mr Kohl insisted: 'When I say save, I mean save.' But he
underlined the difficulties in cutting subsidies in such areas as
shipbuilding and coal-mining - and flatly rejected the sort of policies
introduced by Mrs Margaret Thatcher in Britain. 'We are a social market
economy, not a market economy.'

FT  29 OCT 92 / Danube dam threatens to open floodgates of hostility: An
explosive project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE last weekend wave after wave of Slovak trucks have been lining up on
barges strung out across the Danube river near the village of Cunovo, a few
hundred metres from the border with Hungary. Round the clock they have been
tipping rock and concrete blocks into the swirling waters.
Less deadly than the exchange of tank and artillery fire in Yugoslavia, the
frenzied activity along this Slovak section of the Danube populated mainly
by ethnic Hungarians is nevertheless one of the most serious flashpoints in
the short history of post-communist Europe.
Hungary accuses the Slovak dammers of violating its sovereignty and has
invoked the emergency procedures of the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe. Acutely aware of the hot breath of reawakened
nationalist passions at home, it has also threatened reprisals against
Slovakia if the damming is not stopped. Only military action has been ruled
out.
Budapest is outraged because the international frontier runs down the middle
of the old course of the river and the Cunovo dam stops the river just short
of the Hungarian frontier. It diverts the main flow into an artificial
channel entirely within Slovak territory, leaving only a relative trickle in
the old channel.
Slovakia has responded to Hungarian protests about territorial violation by
accusing Hungarian nationalists of wanting to stop the dam in order to
damage the Slovak economy and exacerbate tensions between Slovaks and the
republic's 500,000-strong ethnic Hungarian minority.
The Hungarian aim, they add, is to create instability 'to better pursue the
policy of autonomy for Hungarian minorities and later restoration of the
Hungarian empire,' according to Mr Julius Binder, head of Hydrostav, the
Czechoslovak state company building the barrage.
Western politicians appear only now to have woken up to the escalating
dispute just 70km downstream from Vienna. 'The row has sparked a new,
utterly unnecessary crisis in eastern Europe,' said Mr Klaus Kinkel, German
foreign minister, earlier this week while supporting Hungary.
Yesterday, in London, attempts to settle the crisis with EC mediation
continued against the background of the broader talks between central
European leaders and the European Community represented by Mr John Major,
current head of the EC presidency, and Mr Jacques Delors, European
Commission president.
The dam is a time-bomb left by the former Communist regimes who operated
under the rules of 'proletarian internationalism' which turned state borders
into little more than administrative boundaries and historical relics.
The project goes back to 1977, when the two governments signed an agreement
on a complex of dams along the Danube designed as a monument to socialist
engineering and fraternal co-operation.
But when Hungary's democratic movement emerged in the 1980s, it coalesced
around opposition to the dam on environmental grounds. Ecologists argued
that the dam and hydroelectric project at Gabcikovo would destroy the last
remaining inland delta along the Danube and pollute drinking water supplies.
The fear was, and remains, that carcinogenic sediment will build up in the
reservoir and pollute the falling water table.
Hungary's last reformist Communist government pulled out of the
hydroelectric project under popular pressure and the conservative coalition
government headed by Mr Jozsef Antall then unilaterally abrograted the 1977
treaty last year. But Slovakia, anxious to phase out polluting coal-fired
power plants and Soviet-designed nuclear power stations, argues that it
cannot afford to lose electricity from Gabcikovo nor waste the huge
investment already made in construction.
The economic case has become more pressing as Slovakia approaches
independence, increasingly concerned about energy security and about its
economic future without Czech subsidies.
Mr Zdenko Pirek, the deputy foreign minister heading the Czechoslovak
negotiating team, says they have gone out of their way to take Hungarian
sensibilities into account. The Czechoslovak side is not diverting the
waters at this time to start generating electricity from Gabcikovo but to
prevent early flooding sweeping away existing construction work, they say.
There the two sides stand today, each marshalling its own legal and
environmental arguments in a campaign for international support, and
moderates on both sides privately hoping that the EC will help them find an
internationally binding face-saving formula.

   THE European Community and a group of central European countries
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Poland, Hungary, the Czech lands and Slovakia - yesterday agreed to
strengthen their political ties through a regular dialogue, particularly on
foreign policy.
The decision was taken at the first formal summit of the the Community and
the so-called Visegrad group of countries, soon to be expanded from three to
four members after the split of Czechoslovakia into two separate republics.
Though closer political consultations, including joint meetings of foreign
ministers, were welcomed by the central European leaders, they made clear
that they were hoping for more specific commitments on the timetable for
their future entry into the Community as full members.
Mr Joszef Antall, Hungary's prime minister, drew attention to central
Europe's broader economic and security concerns and called on the EC to
'retain a sense of solidarity and not treat the region as Europe's
backyard.'
Despite the collapse of the Soviet empire, Europe still needed 'a solid
political and military organisation like Nato and a continuing US military
presence.'
Mr John Major, the British prime minister and current president of the EC,
on whose initiative the meeting was held, went out of his way to assure them
of the Community's support for 'the tough political and economic reforms'
which they had undertaken.
Their meeting symbolised the EC's wish to work together with the central
European countries and to cement the new relationship it had forged with
them through association agreements signed last December.
All shared a common commitment to democracy and human rights and to free
trade across the whole European continent. They would 'eventually' become
full members, once they could face the competition from the more developed
western European countries, he said.
Though it was unlikely that a timetable for their entry into the Community
would be fixed in the foreseeable future, Mr Major said that clear criteria
for membership would be drawn up in time for the December EC summit in
Edinburgh.
Yesterday's meeting provided Mr Vladimir Meciar, the Slovak prime minister,
with his first exposure to international politics at the highest level.
It also allowed Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, to explain the
details of the customs and monetary agreements worked out between the two
republics which will become separate states on January 1.
Behind the scenes Czechoslovak and Hungarian negotiators worked with
Community officials to seek a solution to the increasingly embittered
conflict between Hungary and Slovakia over the Gabcikovo dam.
Later Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, said both new states would become full members of the bank
in the New Year.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Health warning on single market: Sutherland warns
subsidiarity must not go too far
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EC MEMBER states and the European Commission were yesterday considering how
best to act on suggestions by a high-level working group about the
implementation of the single European market.
The committee - headed by Mr Peter Sutherland, the former competition
commissioner - says in its report that the time has come to realise the
practical benefits of the single market.
In Strasbourg yesterday, Mr Sutherland warned that the principle of
subsidiarity - taking decisions at the lowest appropriate level in the EC -
should not be stretched so far as to undermine the single market. The
European Commission should retain a 'significant' measure of responsibility
for ensuring a level playing field, he said.
The six-person Sutherland committee recommends the establishment of a
'permanent framework' for contacts between different national authorities
dealing with the application of single market rules.
That solution was welcomed yesterday by Commission, member states and
interest groups as a way of avoiding heavy-handed centralised monitoring of
the single market.
But Mr Jim Murray, director of Beuc, the European consumers' organisation,
voiced general fears that the looser co-operative system which Mr Sutherland
proposes will be undermined if member states begin to put their own
interests above those of the Community. 'There's got to be a very clear
acceptance that there's a Community interest in all this and it's not just
an inter-governmental idea,' he said.
Senior Commission officials responsible for the internal market stressed
yesterday that if confidence between member states broke down, Brussels
would still have to step in. 'When it comes to such conflicts over
enforcement the Commission must be there to act as an arbiter if member
states are not willing to co-operate,' said one official.
The Commission argues that many of the committee's proposals run in the same
direction as current practice in Brussels. The report says, for example,
that greater consultation should take place before and after legislation
emerges, and that EC citizens should be given more information about the
benefits of the market. Both are issues which the Commission is already
examining, although officials admit that the Sutherland report would push
the Commission 'in a faster and more decisive way'.
Mr Sutherland also emphasised yesterday that much of the burden for
communicating and implementing the benefits of the single market would lie
with member states. National courts and the legal profession - which could
handle basic complaints involving cross-border transactions - were woefully
backward in their knowledge and application of EC law, he said.
A more fundamental concern is that member states will not act on the
committee's 'practical guide to the solution of a set of practical problems'
before January 1, 1993, when the barrier-free market is supposed to come
into force. As Mr Murray says 'there's no way this will be in place before
January 1, or any time within stalking distance of that date'.
Britain will try to press its EC partners for swift action. It has made
practical implementation of the barrier-free European market a particular
theme of its presidency of the EC, which will expire as the market is born
on December 31.
But although the report stresses that few of the proposals require
legislative action, the timetable is still extremely tight.
British officials are hoping that political resolutions agreed at the
November 10 internal market council will 'start the process', which may be
given further impetus by EC leaders at the Edinburgh summit a month later.
A short delay may not matter, because many elements of the single market
will not be in place on January 1, whatever the symbolic significance of the
date.
In addition, if the Sutherland committee's suggestions are implemented, then
their success will only be measured later, by the extent to which business
and consumers demonstrate their belief in the single market.
Mr Sutherland and his committee are adamant, however, that if their
suggestions are ignored and EC citizens' attempts to trade and move across
borders are blocked or disappointed, then the Commission and member states'
best legislative efforts will have been in vain.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Bosnian Serbs in accord on aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL peace mediators and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic
agreed yesterday that all Bosnian Serb aircraft should be put under United
Nations control at airfields around their base in Banja Luka.
The agreement came after one of the meditators, Lord Owen, former British
foreign secretary, bluntly accused Bosnian Serb forces of violating the UN
resolution banning flights over Bosnia-Hercegovina.
But the accord appears to amount to a concession to the Bosnian Serbs, as
the aircraft will not be moved out of Bosnia as planned earlier. Instead,
they will be stored and confined to hangars at the Banja Luka airfield under
the supervision of UN forces.
Mr Cyrus Vance, joint mediator with Lord Owen in the Yugoslav conflict,
said: 'We have reached a satisfactory solution.'
The agreement was reached after the two men held talks in Belgrade with Mr
Karadzic. Earlier the peace envoys met Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan Panic,
who had backed a plan for Bosnian Serb forces to hand over aircraft to the
Yugoslav federal army.
Their visit came as Serb forces claimed to have routed Moslem and Croat
defenders of Jajce, in central Bosnia. Bosnian army commanders yesterday
denied the town had fallen. The loss of Jajce would be another severe
setback for the Moslems, Bosnia's biggest ethnic group, who comprised 44 per
cent of the pre-war population of 4.35m. Serbs control some 70 per cent of
Bosnian territory and Croats about 25 per cent.
The fighting highlights how difficult it will be to gain compliance on the
ground with the new Bosnian constitution published by Lord Owen and Mr Vance
in Geneva yesterday. Aimed at preventing the division of Bosnia, it calls
for the central government to control foreign, trade and defence policies
but gives wide powers to 7-10 new regional governments.
It proposes extensive international involvement in the internal affairs of a
future Bosnian state, especially to enforce human rights.
The constitution would give foreign judges a majority on both a
constitutional court and a human rights court. The Geneva conference on
former Yugoslavia would appoint human rights ombudsmen and an international
human rights commission for Bosnia-Hercegovina with a wide remit to
investigate abuses.
There would also be international supervision of the melding of the three
Bosnian forces into a single national army, though the plan does not provide
for a long-term UN peacekeeping role.
The central government would have representatives from the four communities
(Serb, Croat, Moslem and 'other'). Parliament would have a lower house
elected by proportional representation and an upper house appointed by
provincial governments, broadly reflecting an ethnic balance.
Representatives of the warring factions met Mr Martti Ahtisaari, the Finnish
mediator for Bosnia, in Geneva to discuss the proposals.

<TEXT>
MR Arkady Volsky, leader of Russia's industrialists and considered the most
influential figure on the political scene after Mr Boris Yeltsin, yesterday
laid down his conditions for supporting the Russian president and economic
reform.
In an interview, the chairman of the Union of Industrialists and
Entrepreneurs said he believed that during November the cabinet 'must be
reconstructed', probably round a new prime minister; economic policy
'corrected' along the lines of a new programme which the union has just
produced; and a round table of political groups convened under the
chairmanship of the Russian president.
This should be done before the scheduled Congress of People's Deputies on
December 1, but after Mr Yeltsin's trip to the UK in early November. If it
were not done 'decisively and calmly', political chaos and a turn towards an
authoritarian system would be inevitable.
If these conditions were not fulfilled, M Volsky said his organisation,  -
which claims a membership of two thirds of Russia's enterprises and the
associated membership of unions of joint ventures and co-operatives  - would
'go into opposition' against the government. Since it also has the support
of the main trade unions and of many deputies in the parliament this is in
effect a threat to paralyse the government.
He said Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, should remain in the
cabinet but should no longer retain his current position because of his lack
of authority.
Mr Volsky said that Mr Yeltsin still fulfilled many of the functions of a
premier - and said: 'I tell him (Yeltsin) and I tell you, a prime minister
must have elementary power, not just ideas. If half of the decisions of the
president are not carried out, then you have to call in those responsible
and sack them. You can't have the village elder repealing the decisions of
the president.'
He refused to specify other changes, but said those who were 'incompetent or
dishonest' must go. He said: 'British bankers come and tell me they can't
continue with their ventures if such people stay.'
Mr Volsky insisted he was for the introduction of a market system on social
democratic lines - 'somewhere between socialism (not understood as
communism) and capitalism'. He rejected all descriptions of him in domestic
and foreign newspapers, including the Financial Times, as one who wanted to
introduce elements of the old system.
He claimed he had no political ambitions, though he admitted he had powerful
influence. This was underlined during the interview when he took a lengthy
phone call from Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister, and
when he said his next meeting was with General Alexander Rutskoi, the vice
president.
The main elements in his new programme, which would be presented to the
Russian president today and to Mr Gaidar at the weekend, are to prioritise
state spending on the provision of foodstuffs by, for example, taking
measures to stop the wastage of up to 50 per cent of the harvest; on the
provision of medicines, of which only 60 per cent of the needed amount was
available; and on funding military conversion.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Martonyi moderately optimistic over Gabcikovo dam
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hungary's chief negotiator, Mr Janos Martonyi, said yesterday he was
'moderately optimistic' that a way out of the impasse over the Gabcikovo dam
could be worked out by Hungarian, Czechoslovak and EC negotiators who are
now meeting in London. Hungary, which considers itself the aggrieved party
because the dam changes the flow of the Danube river and could alter the
international boundary with Slovakia, is pressing for ' a civilised European
way of resolving the conflict through international arbitration,' he added.
All sides cautioned, however, that the Slovak side has not yet agreed to
arbitration.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Labour sees EC debate as vote of confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE battleground for next week's crucial debate over Maastricht was staked
out last night as Labour confirmed that it would turn the occasion into a
confidence motion on Mr John Major.
The prime minister led senior cabinet colleagues in an intensive charm
offensive before his important set-piece address to the backbench 1922
committee tonight in a continued effort to whittle down the number of Tory
rebels.
But as government business managers promised a narrow victory next
Wednesday, the big guns of Euro-scepticism - most notably Lady Thatcher -
were sighted in Westminster rallying the undecided to the anti-Maastricht
cause.
A survey of Euro-sceptics conducted by the FT yesterday indicates that as
many as 50 Tory MPs could vote against the government if presented with a
motion calling on them to press ahead with ratification of the Maastricht
treaty. A revolt on this scale would leave the government facing defeat.
But if there is a widely held perception that the vote has become a
confidence motion in which either the government's or the prime minister's
survival are at stake the size of the potential rebellion would shrink
drastically.
Mr Major felt sufficiently confident to predict victory for the first time
yesterday, arguing that Denmark's blueprint for ending the impasse over the
treaty, revealed on Tuesday night, further justified proceeding to
ratification in the UK.
The prime minister's positive tone about the prospects for the Danish
proposals was embarrassingly undermined last night, however, by the leak of
an internal Foreign Office memorandum warning that Danish requirements were
'unlikely to be acceptable to EC member states'.
The paper, written last Friday before Denmark's final proposals were
released, said the UK faces 'a difficult negotiation ahead'. Whitehall
officials said last night that the paper represented 'first thoughts'.
They expressed the view that in the end EC countries would be realistic
enough to accept anything short of renegotiation of the treaty.
Earlier in the day, Mr Major's claimed justification for proceeding was
unanimously rejected by Labour's shadow cabinet who voted to oppose any
motion tabled by the government.
They said that criteria laid out by the prime minister in September for
resuming the ratification process - including European Community agreement
on how Denmark might proceed - had still not been met.
Broadening the context of the debate beyond the timing of ratification, Mr
John Smith, the Labour leader, insisted that the key issue now centred on
'the nature and style of the prime minister's conduct of government'.
The Liberal Democrats, however, decided to vote with the government if the
motion was specifically related to Maastricht.
Mr Major's upbeat victory forecast reflected undisguised relief within the
government that the Danes had clarified their position.
Labour's hardline tactics in insisting that the debate amounted to a vote of
confidence was also thought likely to drive some waverers back into the
government camp.
But the outbreak of optimism among Tory loyalists was tempered by the
immediate call from the Euro-sceptics - rejected by Downing Street - for
Britain also to adopt the Danes' demands, before ratification procedures in
the Commons were resumed.
The Euro-sceptic offensive was boosted from the House of Lords by Lady
Thatcher, who told friendly MPs that she had felt obliged to abandon her
self-imposed decision not to interfere with the Commons.
She was reported to be urging Conservative waverers not to join the 'roll of
shame' of those voting to proceed with the ratification process.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Bank chief hints at room for rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBIN Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, last night left
the way open for further cuts in interest rates, although he warned that
efforts to counter inflation were still high on the government's list of
economic priorities.
In a further indication of the government's shift in economic policy in
recent weeks, Mr Leigh-Pemberton said objectives had changed to put more
emphasis on 'opportunities for growth and opportunities for employment'.
Giving evidence to the Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee, Mr
Leigh-Pemberton acknowledged fresh fears that the recession was deepening by
saying the economy suffered from 'lack of life' and that inflationary
pressures were 'difficult to detect'.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is expected tonight in his Mansion House
speech to the City to sketch in further details of UK economic policy,
including new efforts to make Treasury policies more comprehensible.
Referring to the events of Black Wednesday - September 16 - when sterling
was forced out of the European exchange rate mechanism, Mr Leigh-Pemberton
said that with hindsight European Community nations should have considered
more seriously during the summer a broad ERM realignment to counter severe
currency turbulence.
Repeating the line of other UK government representatives, he said he had
been 'unaware' of any approach by the Bundesbank or the German finance
ministry during August or September that Britain should take part in a broad
realignment as a way to reduce the currency strains.
On the change of approach in UK policy since Black Wednesday, the governor
said there was 'no inconsistency' between laying the foundation for growth
and countering inflation.
But asked by Mr John Watts, the committee's chairman, about what he
understood to be the main objective of economic policy, Mr Leigh-Pemberton
replied: 'Sustained non-inflationary growth - in a word, prosperity.'
The governor stressed that it would be unwise for the government to bring
down base rates, now at 8 per cent, too quickly, on the grounds that this
might give financial markets the impression it was indifferent to the value
of the pound.
He said that the depreciation of sterling since Black Wednesday, coupled
with a 2-percentage-point reduction in interest rates in recent weeks had
laid the ground for an economic stimulus in the coming months.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Ford halts production at two plants for a week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD is to halt all car and van production at two of its three UK assembly
plants next week because of recession in the UK new vehicle market and
weakening continental sales.
There will be no production of Fiestas at Dagenham, Essex, or of Transit
vans at Southampton. For the rest of November, Dagenham will be on a
three-day week, while Southampton, where production was halted for the whole
of last week, will be on a four-day week.
The production cuts are the most severe that Ford, the country's leading
vehicle maker, has imposed since the summer, when it had to take urgent
action to trim output and excess stocks after disappointing sales in August
 -the most important month for new car sales in the UK.
The announcement of the latest production cuts in the UK came as Ford
disclosed in the US yesterday that it had returned to loss on its worldwide
operations in the third quarter with a deficit of Dollars 159m (Pounds
101m), compared with a net profit of Dollars 840m in the first half of the
year.
Ford's US automotive operations incurred a loss of Dollars 153m in the third
quarter, while its European automotive operations plunged to a deficit of
Dollars 479m with continuing heavy losses at Jaguar, Ford's UK luxury car
subsidiary, and a sharp fall at Ford of Britain.
Mr Harold Poling, Ford chairman, warned that the uncertainty resulting from
instability in European currency markets had led to lower sales in most of
Ford's European markets.
Combined west European new car and truck sales were running at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of only 14.4m in the third quarter of 1992 against a
sales rate of 15.1m in each of the first two quarters, the company said.
In the UK, Ford was forced to cut production at its Halewood Merseyside
plant in the last two weeks of August. This was followed by the start of
three and four-day working week in September at the Dagenham and Southampton
plants.
Production cuts announced yesterday will affect about 5,500 workers at
Dagenham and 1,800 at Southampton. Output of about 10,800 Fiestas will be
lost at Dagenham in the four weeks from November 2.
Ford of Britain is currently seeking to negotiate with the unions a cut in
lay-off pay to 60 per cent of the present level of basic wage until the end
of 1994.
Ford announced last month that it would cut a further 1,550 jobs by the end
of 1992 in the UK, and warned union officials that it had 'half an assembly
plant too much capacity'.
Elsewhere in Europe, Ford has cut production significantly in Belgium in
recent months, and this month it announced a programme of non-production
days at assembly plants in Valencia, Spain, and Cologne, Germany.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Bill Cosby seeks to buy NBC television network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bill Cosby, the comedian who broke racial boundaries in the 1980s on
prime-time American television, wants to buy NBC, the television network
that made him the best-paid entertainer in the US.
Mr Cosby's personal net worth is estimated at between Dollars 300m and
Dollars 400m (Pounds 185m-Pounds 245m) - and still rising. Last year alone,
he is believed to have earned more than Dollars 90m.
The Cosby Show, his situation comedy series portraying the upper-middle
class lives of a black obstetrician and his family, was the most successful
programme in the history of US television, so far earning Dollars 1bn in
syndication sales.
The approach to buy NBC was made a few days ago by Mr Cosby's long-time
agent, Mr Norman Brokaw, chairman of William Morris talent agency.
Mr Brokaw, whose previous clients included Marilyn Monroe, former President
Gerald Ford and Joan Crawford, said he took the Cosby offer directly to Mr
Bob Wright, the NBC president who came from General Electric, the company
that bought the network as part of RCA in 1986.
'I talked to Bob Wright, and he is not saying NBC is for sale, but that
doesn't stop anyone from presenting an offer. Bill Cosby would have an
interest in buying NBC and I have strongly registered his interest in buying
it,' Mr Brokaw said yesterday.
GE gave a terse 'no comment', the response it gave in recent weeks to
rumours of two other potential purchasers, Mr Marvin Davis, chairman of
Paramount, and Mr Barry Diller, former head of Twentieth Century Fox. Both
are friends of Mr Cosby.
Mr Brokaw would not comment on speculation that Mr Cosby might team up with
Mr Diller, who like the William Morris chairman started his career in the
talent agency's mail-room.
Although GE's willingness to sell NBC remains uncertain, the betting is that
the network could be available if the right offer in the range of Dollars
4bn were to be presented. It is widely known that Mr Jack Welch, the GE
chairman, likes his companies to be ranked as first or second in their
sector.
When GE acquired NBC six years ago, the network was ranked as number one
thanks partly to Mr Cosby. But last spring the Cosby Show ended its run on
NBC, which has now slipped to third place among the three US networks. In
its recent third-quarter results, GE said its broadcasting operations, which
include NBC, suffered a loss.
Mr Cosby got his first break on television in 1965 as co-star of the spoof
adventure series I Spy. 'Bill has always felt very close to NBC because they
gave him his first opportunity,' Mr Brokaw said.
His later series was a blend of middle-of-the-road comedy and ideologically
sound subject matter. This year Mr Cosby has embarked on a new series - the
relaunch of the 1950s quiz show You Bet Your Life. This show is the first Mr
Cosby has made with CBS rather than NBC.

FT  29 OCT 92 / (CORRECTED) Lloyd's drafts in help from outsiders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 30th October 1992) appended to this article.
THREE consultancy teams are working on initiatives to resolve some of the
most pressing problems at Lloyd's, the insurance market. All have been
appointed within the last few weeks by Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's new chief
executive.
Mercer Consulting, management consultants, has been invited to develop
proposals to resolve the problem of 'open years', which occur when
syndicates are unable to close their accounts due to uncertainty over future
claims. Names - the individuals whose assets support underwriting on the
market - who are members of syndicates with open years are unable to leave
the market. The number of syndicates with open years rose sharply this year.
Mr William Knight, of solicitors Simmons and Simmons, and LEK, the
consultants, are to examine how errors and omissions insurers - which cover
businesses on the market against legal awards for negligence - might aid an
out-of-court settlement of litigation between Names and their agents. New
litigation between the two groups is possible following the completion of
recent investigations into the losses at syndicates managed by Gooda Walker
and Feltrim agencies.
Another consultancy firm, First Consulting, is conducting a review of
operations at the Lloyd's Corporation, which provides administration and
marketing services for the market as a whole. Mr Middleton is keen to
improve the corporation's efficiency.
Both the Mercer Fraser team and Mr Knight will work alongside committees of
Names, chosen for their business experience. Mr Middleton and Mr Neil Shaw,
chairman of the Association of Lloyd's Members, are writing this week to
potential members. They are hopeful that the consultants can complete their
work before the end of the year. First Consulting is expected to report
within the next few weeks.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday launched a ranking
service for Lloyd's syndicates. Syndicate Stability Rankings awards one, two
or three stars to syndicates according to their financial stability. The
rankings take into account the syndicates' reported results for the last
four years.
CORRECTION
In a story headlined 'Lloyd's drafts in help from outsiders' in yesterday's
FT, reference was made to Mercer Consulting and Mercer Fraser. Both
references should have been to Mercer Management Consulting. We apologise
for the error.

Ekobank

<TEXT>
CREDIT SUISSE, Switzerland's third-largest bank, has rescued EKO
Hypothekar-und Handelsbank (Ekobank), one of the country's largest regional
banks.
Ekobank was ordered closed by the Swiss Federal Banking Commission last
Thursday but, following approval of the takeover by its shareholders on
Monday, its branches opened as Credit Suisse branches on Tuesday.
The takeover occurred in the context of a safety net established a year ago
by the Swiss Bankers' Association following the collapse of another regional
bank, Spar und Leihkasse Thun. The intention was to prevent another incident
that would harm the international image of Swiss banks.
Credit Suisse said: 'We are willing and eager to do our part to maintain the
rep-utation of the Swiss financial centre.'
Ekobank, based in Olten, had assets of SFr1.6bn (Dollars 1.1bn) at the end
of 1991, and employs about 100 people. It was owned, and its assets and
liabilities were totally guaranteed, by the local community. As part of the
takeover agreement, the potential liability of the community for future
losses is limited to SFr40m.
Credit Suisse said that provisions for Ekobank's bad loans were made as part
of the agreement on the takeover conditions, and it anticipated that no
further provisions would be necessary.

FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: Tampella cuts losses to FM317m
as sales slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAMPELLA, the Finnish forestry and engineering group, cut losses to FM317m
(Dollars 65m) in the first eight months, from FM807m in the corresponding
1991 period. Sales fell to FM3.91bn from FM4.49bn, reflecting disposals and
restructuring.
The group has also benefited from rationalisation and lower interest
payments thanks to a reduced debt load.
Tampella expects to remain in the red this year, following a loss of
FM1.16bn in 1991, but says its operating result will 'improve
substantially'.
The company also warns that 'stiff competition in the European markets is
expected to further reduce the foreign currency based prices of forest
industry products'.
Tampella was saved by the Bank of Finland in late 1991 as part of a broader
rescue of Skopbank. Fermenta, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, cut losses
(after financial items) to SKr127m (Dollars 22m) in the first eight months
from SKr470m a year earlier.
The result was struck after a sharp reduction in turnover to SKr358m from
SKr2.24bn, reflecting the disposal and winding up of many of the group's
activities.
The group said its result was no longer being dragged down by Independent,
the financial subsidiary it sold this year. Including extraordinary items
and minority interests, the loss for the period deepened to SKr413m from
SKr357m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JEAN-RENE Fourtou, chairman of Rhone-Poulenc, the French state-owned
chemicals and pharmaceuticals producer, yesterday said he hoped the group
would have a core of loyal institutional shareholders if privatised.
Mr Fourtou's remarks, following his election as French manager of the year,
are the latest evidence that the public sector is preparing itself for the
acceleration in the France's privatisation programme promised by the right
wing if, as is likely, it wins next March's legislative elections.
Rhone-Poulenc, already partly quoted, would be a prime candidate for further
privatisation as its profits are rising and it is eager for fresh capital to
reduce FFr32bn (Dollars 6.14bn) of debts, the legacy of a series of
acquisitions, climaxing with the takeover of Rorer, the US pharmaceuticals
company, two years ago.
The former Gaullist government was careful in its last privatisation
programme to leave candidates with decisive minority shareholdings in the
hands of investors loyal to government policies and to the companies'
management.
However, some economic liberals in the UDF, such as Mr Herve de Charette,
one of its vice-presidents, are now urging that future privatisations should
have more open and diverse shareholding structures.
If elected, the right is aiming to sell between FFr40bn and FFr60bn per year
of state company shares, starting with the banks and insurance companies.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Sweden to reform welfare system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S centre-right coalition government is preparing a far-reaching
programme to transform the country's famous cradle-to-grave welfare state by
exposing it to market forces and reducing the financial burden on the
taxpayer.
Mr Carl Bildt, the country's conservative prime minister, said he wanted to
create a 'welfare market'.
Full details of the wide-ranging plans are expected later next month as part
of a government 'convergence' strategy designed to bring Sweden in line with
the standards of the European Community, which it hopes to join at the start
of 1995.
The drive for greater freedom of choice in public services through an
extension of private initiatives will be extended across the entire Swedish
public sector.
Mr Bildt is extremely worried about the growing size of the government's
budget deficit, set to rise to around 10 per cent of Sweden's gross national
product by 1994. Nearly half the government's spending goes on its welfare
programmes.
Around 60 per cent of the country's gross national product is devoted to
public expenditure, the highest proportion of any country in the world. This
will be reduced in stages closer to the current EC average of around 46 per
cent.
The sweeping plans can be expected to arouse considerable resistance inside
Sweden's huge public services sector, especially from the trade unions.
However, a consensus has been developing across the political spectrum that
accepts the need to break-up the traditional bureaucratic system and
introduce greater efficiency with more choice for people and the contracting
out to the private sector - often in the form of co-operatives - of some
services.

LORD OWEN, the international mediator, yesterday accused Bosnian Serb forces
of violating the United Nations resolution banning flights over
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
During a visit to Belgrade with Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN mediator, Lord Owen
said: 'The Bosnian Serbs are in default. They have not agreed to observers
on the airfield in Banja Luka (the Bosnian Serb military headquarters in the
north-west) and they are still flying helicopters. We are going to have to
nail them down.'
The international mediators yesterday met Mr Dobrica Cosic, the federal
Yugoslav president, and Mr Milan Panic, the Yugoslav prime minister, who
have supported the plan for Bosnian forces to hand over their aircraft to
the Yugoslav army.
After talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Mr Vance said he
would meet Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and General Zivota
Panic, the army chief of staff, to work out the hand-over of 23 aircraft to
Yugoslav air-bases, which would be under UN supervision.
The visit came as Serb forces claimed to have routed Moslem and Croat
defenders of Jajce, in central Bosnia. Bosnian army commanders yesterday
denied the town had fallen. The loss of Jajce would be another severe
setback for the Moslems, Bosnia's biggest ethnic group.
The fighting highlights how difficult it will be to gain compliance with the
new Bosnian constitution published by Lord Owen and Mr Vance in Geneva
yesterday. Aimed at preventing the division of Bosnia, it calls for the
central government to control foreign, trade and defence policies but gives
wide powers to seven to 10 new regional governments.
It proposes extensive international involvement in the internal affairs of a
future Bosnian state, especially to enforce human rights.
There would also be international supervision of the melding of the three
Bosnian forces into a single national army.
The central government would have representatives from the four communities
(Serb, Croat, Moslem and 'other'). Parliament would have a lower house
elected by proportional representation and an upper house appointed by the
provincial governments, in both cases broadly reflecting the ethnic balance
in Bosnia.

FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Scapa in German textiles purchase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A subsidiary of Scapa Group, the Blackburn-based company which supplies
technical products and services to the paper industry, has agreed to buy
part of the technical textile business of Technische Textilien L'rrach, a
German company.
The Scapa subsidiary, P&amp;S Textiles of Bury, Lancashire, will pay a maximum
Pounds 1m. As part of the deal, the German company will become an agent for
P&amp;S, representing it exclusively in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and
non-exclusively in France.
Last week the UK group said it was in talks with the receivers of a German
company, F Oberdorfer, which might lead to Scapa acquiring the business and
assets of its German, Austrian and US operations.

THE TELEGRAPH group yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 30.3m for
the nine months to September 30, up from Pounds 27.5m previously.
Revenues increased by Pounds 15m to Pounds 176.2m despite the recession in
advertising. Operating profits rose to Pounds 27.9m (22.5m).
Mr Joe Cooke, managing director, said every quarter this year had seen an
increase in both turnover and profits.
'We think this is a very good performance in the economic context,' he said.
The share price edged up 3p before falling back to finish at 314p, up 1p on
the day. It has still not reached July's flotation price of 325p - on the
first day of trading the price fell to 283p and has been gradually climbing
back.
Earnings per share fell from 16.5p to 15.7p.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Record exports for SA fruit arm

<TEXT>
UNIFRUCO, the export marketing arm of South Africa's deciduous fruit
industry, overcame deteriorating market conditions to sell a record volume
of 40.5m cartons of fruit during the 1992 season.
Volumes were 15 per cent up on the 1991 sales of 35.2m cartons, while gross
proceeds rose by 18 per cent to R1.7bn (Pounds 366m) from R1.4bn in 1991.
Producer payments were up by 14 per cent to R978m from R861m.
Mr David Gant, chairman, said that although the South African products were
now competing on almost level terms, 'the business climate has deteriorated
dramatically since the beginning of the year and producers should take note
that marketing conditions are likely to be tough next year'. Positive
developments on the marketing side included re-entry into the markets of the
US, the Republic of Ireland, Finland and Denmark, and the opening of the Far
East to South African deciduous fruit for the first time from January 1
1993.
Mr Gant said good progress had been made with the implementation of the
co-operation agreement between the deciduous and citrus export industries
through the joint services company Fresh Fruit Services. Combining the
bargaining power of the two industries had already realised considerable
cost savings.
The season was one of mixed fortunes for the different fruits, though most
farmers produce more than one type and hence are likely to experience both
the ups and downs. In terms of crop size, apricots grew by 46 per cent,
peaches and nectarines by 64 per cent, table grapes by 19 per cent and
apples by 15 per cent. In terms of net payments to the producers, the best
performers were peaches and nectarines, up by 63 per cent; grapes, up by
31.5 per cent; and pears, up by 28 per cent. The general apple market,
however, collapsed towards the end of the season resulting in the dumping of
large amounts of competitive fruit at losses. Net payments for apples thus
declined by 2 per cent.
In terms of net payments to producers, the three largest crops are apples
(R414.5m), grapes (R289.1m) and pears (R203.7m).
Unifruco, the single channel marketing arm for South Africa's deciduous
fruit exports, is one of the main southern hemisphere suppliers to the
European market, principally during the European winter. It recently started
exporting exotic products, such as avocados, for which volumes were up by
300 per cent during the past year. Mr Gant said the first year of exports of
the Oak Village range of wines by the Vinfruco subsidiary had been 'fairly
successful'.

FT  29 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Nissan Diesel posts Y119m
half-year loss

<TEXT>
NISSAN Diesel, the leading Japanese truckmaker which is part of the Nissan
Motor group, yesterday announced a net loss of Y119m (Dollars 972,000) in
the six months to the end of September.
The sharp downturn in domestic and overseas truck markets, combined with
heavy spending on research and development, pushed the company into
operating losses for the first half of Y1.42bn, a swing of more than Y3bn
from its Y1.61bn operating profits in the first half of last year.
The company said it would be passing its interim dividend payment, which was
Y2.5 a share last year. It made pre-tax profits of Y533m but only due to
Y1.2bn from a sale of part of its securities holdings.
Nissan Diesel said it expected to make pre-tax profits for the year of
Y1.5bn, a fall of 55.3 per cent from last year, on a projected 8.5 per cent
fall in sales to Y345,000m.
The downturn in truck markets was confirmed by Hino Motors, the leading
Japanese truckmaker which said its pre-tax profits for the first six months
of the financial year were 59 per cent down at Y2.84bn.
Hino, part of the Toyota Motor Group, said it would maintain its interim
dividend at last year's Y3 per share.
Hino is managing to weather the storm better than Nissan Diesel. It managed
to limit its fall in sales to a 2.5 per cent drop to Y307.24bn. This was
largely due to a surge in exports which rose by 22.3 per cent, mainly with
higher sales in south-east Asia.
Hino is forecasting a full year pre-tax profit of Y6bn, down 40 per cent
from last year.
In a separate development Toyota, Japan's largest carmaker, said it was
cutting worldwide car production by 90,000 this year, from 4.78m units last
year. The company said the move was a result of a 150,000 drop in domestic
sales and tighter limits on exports to the US.
Japan exported 550,073 cars, buses and trucks in September, an 8.1 per cent
rise from the previous year.

FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Scotia will be an unusual flotation / A
look into the history of the drug company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTIA, a name that few in the City have yet heard of, will be one of the
more unusual drug companies planning to float on the London stock market
next year.
Until last month Scotia was the pharmaceutical subsidiary of Efamol
Holdings, a private company which has succeeded over the past 15 years in
convincing millions of people that evening primrose oil is a healthy dietary
supplement. Now Scotia Holdings is the master company and Efamol its
subsidiary selling nutritional products.
Dr David Horrobin, the founder and chief executive, has consistently
ploughed the income from selling Efamol evening primrose oil into
pharmaceutical research and development, with the long term aim of building
up an international drug company.
In its year to June 30 1992 sales of licensed pharmaceuticals at Pounds 8.3m
overtook nutritional supplements of Pounds 8m, and the group made a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 1.1m. Dr Horrobin predicts 'substantial growth' for Scotia
over the coming years.
Changing the name to Scotia is one sign of the plan to go public next year.
It has chosen Hoare Govett and Kleinwort Benson as broker and merchant bank
respectively.
The group already has about 200 shareholders, including 23 financial
institutions, and the shares are traded under Stock Exchange Rule 535. The
flotation is expected to value the group at between Pounds 120m and Pounds
200m, depending on market conditions.
Scotia is remarkable both for the type of drugs it is developing and for the
way it operates. It is neither a biotechnology business like Celltech and
Xenova, two other UK pharmaceutical companies likely to go public next year,
nor a fast-growing conventional drug company such as Medeva.
So far Scotia has concentrated above all on essential fatty acid molecules
(hence the name Efamol). These include the active ingredients in evening
primrose and fish oils. Dr Horrobin believes that the pharmaceutical
industry and medical science - focusing largely on proteins and genes - have
underestimated the significance of fatty molecules for human health.
Three of Scotia's first four licensed pharmaceuticals are based on fatty
acids: Epogam and Epogam Paediatric for atopic eczema, and Efamast for
breast pain. The fourth, Efalith, is a lithium compound for seborrhoeic
dermatitis, a common skin complaint.
Conventional drug companies are taking an increasing interest in Scotia's
products. The most important licensing deal is with Searle, pharmaceutical
subsidiary of Monsanto, which markets Epogam and Efamast in the UK.
The group has an amazing array of other drugs in development, based on fatty
acids and their chemical derivatives. The conditions they are designed to
treat include cancer, viral infections, diabetes, osteoporosis (brittle
bones) and Alzheimer's disease.
Critics often scoff at the idea that one group of compounds should be
involved in such a wide range of conditions. But Dr Horrobin says his
approach is fundamentally different to conventional pharmaceutical research.
Most drugs today are designed to stop the body producing too much of a
particular chemical, for example by blocking an enzyme or receptor. Scotia
takes the opposite tack: making up for the deficiency of a natural chemical.
Dr Horrobin takes the view that many disorders are related to a metabolic
failure by the body to produce enough of certain fatty acids. To illustrate
the point, he looks back to the time when Vitamin C deficiency was common
and caused a huge variety of different symptoms.
Another unusual feature of Scotia is the geographical spread of its
activities. For example, R&amp;D takes place at six separate facilities: in Nova
Scotia, Canada; Carlisle, Cumbria; Writtle, Essex; Guildford, Surrey;
Dundee, Scotland; and Callenish on the Isle of Lewis.
Scotia plans to move its corporate headquarters soon from Guildford to
central Scotland. It will then assume a consciously Scottish identity. This
will be one more distinctive feature for the company, since Scotland now has
virtually no pharmaceutical industry.
But Scotia is not totally unorthodox. It is preparing for flotation by
recruiting distinguished non-executive directors to its board, which is
headed by the veteran Scottish businessman Sir Ian Morrow. Sir James
McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, joined in August, followed this week by
Mr William Glynn-Williams, deputy managing director of Glaxo Pharmaceuticals
UK.

FT  29 OCT 92 / People: New role for Green at Argos
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mike Smith, the cerebral chief executive of the Argos catalogue store chain,
is relinquishing his role as chief executive of the company's main trading
subsidiary to concentrate his efforts on group affairs.
Trevor Green, 48, who is currently the main board director responsible for
business development, will become managing director of Argos Distributors,
as from November 1, with responsibility for day-to-day running of the
business.
Green (left) has worked at Argos for more than a decade, during which time
the company has been demerged from BAT Industries and successfully
established itself as one of the UK's best-managed independent retail
groups.
It is likely that Smith will now spend more time helping to develop Argos's
newly launched furniture chain, Chesterman, on which the company is pinning
great hopes.

When you want to sell British foods to the French - employ a Frenchman.
That, at least, is the philosophy of Food from Britain, the organisation set
up to help redress the UK's startling trade deficit in foods by aggressively
promoting British goods abroad.
FFB has just recruited Dominique Mine (above) to head its office in what is
the UK's biggest food and drink export market, worth more than Pounds 1bn
last year. French consumers are clearly developing a healthy appetite for
muffins and whiskys as their imports of such products have risen 13 per cent
in the first seven months of this year.
Mine, 35, was previously general manager of the European Duty Free division
of Remy-Cointreau group. He will now devote himself to helping British
exporters find new market opportunities and providing general promotional
help to UK-based producers.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Turkey steps up Kurd offensive: Eight-year conflict enters
decisive phase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY'S largest military operation against Kurdish guerrillas continued
yesterday, in what officials expect to be the decisive phase in the
eight-year conflict with the Kurdish Workers party (PKK).
Officials confirmed that at least 20,000 troops, backed by tanks and
armoured personnel carriers, were operating in northern Iraq, near the
border town of Zakho. Commandos, supported by aircraft and helicopters, were
also reported to be fighting rebel forces in mountain valleys near Hakurk,
close to the Iranian border.
The offensive is spurred largely by growing public demands for a strong
government response to the PKK's increasingly violent campaign for
independence. Since 1984 the conflict has claimed more than 5,000 lives,
with at least 2,000 people dying this year.
Since the withdrawal of allied forces from northern Iraq and the end of
relief efforts to help the Iraqi Kurds, the PKK has intensified attacks on
Turkish border positions.
In recent months rebel tactics have changed, with guerrillas attacking
Turkish positions in groups of 200 or more, and with increasing ferocity.
Last weekend, for example, rebels blew up a bridge, near the eastern city of
Mus, on the main rail line to Iran and reprisal attacks on Kurdish villages
supporting the government are more ruthless.
The Turkish military has long recognised that the PKK's ability to sustain
conflict depends on the organisation being able to infiltrate guerrillas
across the border. Ankara also realises that an estimated 150,000 troops in
the border region cannot seal the frontier, so it has put together a
diplomatic and military strategy to cut off the PKK in their sanctuaries.
Both Syria and Iran have offered support to Turkey. A security protocol
signed with Damascus was initially greeted with scepticism in Ankara, but
Turkish officials believe the Syrians are sticking to their promise to close
PKK camps in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley in Lebanon.
Overtures to Iran produced less concrete results. But this week, following
Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel's visit to Tehran, Iran announced it had
deployed a brigade-size force to man its border with Iraq, apparently to
block the PKK's retreat.
Turkey faces little international criticism. The US State Department this
week reiterated its backing for Ankara's fight against the organisation,
while urging it to ensure 'the political rights of all Turkish citizens,
including those of Kurdish origin'.
Western officials are keen for the government to use any military gains to
hasten its earlier promise of democratic reform; so far the worsening
violence has been used to stall human rights reform.
But the critical factor is the tacit co-operation Ankara has won from the
Kurdish Pesh Mergas in Iraq. Turkish and Pesh Mergas forces were yesterday
engaging the PKK in what one diplomat described as a 'loosely co-ordinated'
operation, following moves on Sunday by the Iraqi Kurdish assembly to issue
a final ultimatum to the PKK to withdraw from the border area.
But, as a senior Turkish Foreign Ministry official said: 'It's not easy for
the Pesh Mergas. Kurds are killing Kurds.' The PKK has already retaliated
with an intimidation campaign against truck drivers travelling to north
Iraq, in effect imposing an embargo on vital supplies to Kurdish-held areas.
Turkey's security presence is being strengthened on the main border road to
Harbur Bridge. But Ankara is in no hurry to see the PKK embargo lifted, as
it underlines how much the Iraqi Kurds rely on Turkish support.
Not surprisingly, there were reports yesterday that the PKK was negotiating
a deal with the Pesh Mergas to allow it to withdraw south.

FT  28 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares firm after speculative session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENSIONS regarding the timing of the next cut in domestic interest rates
tightened in the UK stock market yesterday morning, bringing an effective
rejection from the Bank of England of rumours of an impending two-point
reduction in its minimum lending rate. The rumours appeared to be founded on
an early fall in sterling, which was interpreted as an indication of a
flight from the currency ahead of rate cuts.
Share prices opened uncertainly, helped at first by overnight firmness in
the New York market. But with investment interest still thin - Monday's
retail business was worth only Pounds 773.1m - equities resumed their
downward drift and the FT-SE Index was 20 points off when the December stock
index futures jumped sharply as the interest rate rumours reached the equity
sector.
The rumours were remarkably explicit, claiming that the UK base rates would
be cut by two points before the end of the day, and without waiting for the
policy speech in the City of London tomorrow from Mr Norman Lamont,
chancellor of the exchequer.
The stock market turned round sharply, advancing to a gain of 16.4 on the
Footsie, although most of the buying came from marketmakers anxious not to
be caught on the wrong foot again. But the Bank of England took action in
the Treasury bill markets, which was seen to rule out a base rate move
during yesterday's trading session.
Equities quickly topped off, although London was sustained later by news of
unexpected 2.7 per cent growth in the third quarter's Gross Domestic Product
in the US. The final reading of 2,669.8 on the FT-SE Index showed a net gain
reduced to 8.2 points.
When the dust had settled, equity traders admitted that the sudden wave of
base rate speculation had changed little in terms of market perceptions.
Many strategists believe that the next cut in base rates may be held back
until the government's autumn economic statement, due on November 12. But an
earlier move is not ruled out by a stock market aware of the political
pressures bearing down on the government's economic strategy. 'If we don't
get the rate cut this week, then perhaps it will be next week,' said one
trader resignedly.
The speculative excitement boosted Seaq turnover to 550m shares yesterday,
compared with 456.3m on Monday. Once again, the institutions showed interest
in the second-line issues and remained selective in their purchases of
Footsie stocks.
The investment background remained gloomy, with the latest quarterly survey
from the Confederation of British Industry indicating continued pessimism.
There were further reports of staff cutbacks among the big London-based
securities firms where, despite the increase in equity business over the
past two months, profitability is still a serious problem.
Complaints that the existing securities trading system in London is
undermining the marketmaking function have revived, together with
predictions that some form of order-driven system could begin to evolve if
changes are not made soon.

   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE large deal provided a boost to an otherwise tranquil options market
yesterday, writes Peter John. While most dealers were rolling over positions
ahead of expiry of the October series, one marketmaker crossed the
equivalent of more than 19m BP shares,
The trade was so big that the SEAQ electronic trading system was unable to
report it in the normal way and had to carry a special announcement. It
represented a cross of 19,250 October 160 calls. Each call cost the
equivalent of 76p a share and provided the buyer with the right to purchase
underlying stock today at 160p a share - a total price of 236p. The business
was carried out by independent trading house Monument Derivatives and was
said to represent intra-market business rather than a fundamental change of
view.
Elsewhere, the most heavily traded stock options will all see their October
series expire today. The exception was bank HSBC which has seen sharp rises
in the cash market as a result of currency shifts. It was the fourth most
active stock option. Total option volume was 48,170 lots.
Meanwhile, the FT-SE 100 index contract for December opened weak and slipped
back quickly on the back of a weaker pound. Then, a rumour developed that a
2 per cent cut in UK interest raters was imminent. December picked up
sharply to close at 2,710, 40 points above cash and at a 20-point premium to
fair value.

FT  28 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: US active as Steel falls again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER session of heavy turnover in British Steel saw the shares continue
to weaken as worries over the group's dividend and trading prospects
persisted following the announcement on Monday of sharp cuts in production.
Turnover reached more than 45m shares, by far the largest traded share of
the day, with one leading US investment bank said to have bought a block of
21.5m shares at 51p and to have placed 13m of these at 52p a share within
minutes.
There were suggestions in the market that the bulk of the selling had come
from disenchanted US investors, who own about a quarter of the British Steel
equity and that this could mark the beginning of the end of their love
affair with the UK group.
New York has been the chief buyer of Steel shares in recent months as
worried British investors have been bailing out. The implications of any
sustained US unloading for the Steel share price would, said one analyst, be
'catastrophic - Steel would be sold down to 20p.'
However, the US fears were dismissed by others in the market, who pointed
out that the 30m shares equivalent sold in New York on Monday after London
had closed had indicated strong two-way activity. It was also suggested that
yesterday's large trade involved selling from a combination of both US and
UK institutions. Steel shares closed 3 1/2 lighter at 52 1/2 p.
Reed strong
Magazine publisher Reed International was a strong market ahead of the
announcement of first-half figures tomorrow and also on favourable comments
from two securities houses. The shares held up against the market's early
weakness and closed 5 firmer on the day at 586p.
Analysts are looking for profits of between Pounds 85m and Pounds 92m
against Pounds 85.3m last year and expect the group to announce the exact
terms of its planned merger with Dutch group Elsevier.
Meanwhile, BZW has put Reed back on its buy list, citing the group's
long-term potential to exploit benefits of scale, boost its strategic
position and produce above-average dividend and earnings growth.
Also, Lehman Brothers argues that the group is poised to offer 'solid profit
recovery in the short term and continued growth in revenues cash flow and
earnings over the longer term'.
Drug stocks busy
Internationally traded pharmaceuticals benefited from the strength of the
dollar against sterling and also from analysts' recommendations. Glaxo was
the principal gainer, with Hoare Govett telling clients that the shares had
unjustifiably lagged Wellcome's. Strauss Turnbull was also reinforcing its
positive stance and preparing an enthusiastic note on the sector.
Glaxo shares stood out against the falling market in the morning and
represented much of the strength in the FT-SE 100 index at the close. The
net rise of 19 to 803p represented 3.7 points of the Footsie's 8.2-point
rise.
Wellcome eased 9 to 1000p as buyers stayed away ahead of today's figures,
but SmithKline Beecham lifted 8 in the 'A's and 11 in the Units.
BAT Industries fell 17 to 875p as another broker decided that the shares
were overpriced.
Shell continued to regain some of the ground lost last week, edging up a
further 3 to 536p on 3.3m. The recent bout of profit-taking in Lasmo, which
is thought to have seen a line of 2m shares on offer and subsequently mostly
absorbed by the market, saw the stock ease 4 more to 178p.
HSBC maintained its position as the most active of the leading banks with
turnover reaching 12m shares. The stock price ran ahead strongly, closing a
net 19 higher at 504p, a penny short of its 1992 high, with big buyers in
Hong Kong said to have chased the shares up as the local market continued
its recovery.
BZW was said to have been behind the good showing by Lloyds, which moved up
7 to 460p, albeit in rather thin turnover of 1.6m. The UK investment bank
was said to have recommended a switch out of NatWest and into Lloyds.
NatWest shares fell sharply early in the session, slipping off to 373p, but
later rallied strongly to end a net 4 up at 383p in turnover of 3.6m.
Barclays Bank drifted off 3 to 342p with many banking specialists still
fretting over the possibility of a dividend cut after the bank has accounted
for the ever-growing list of bad debts and property losses.
TSB, still unsettled by the steep profits downgrade carried out by Smith New
Court, now thought to be the lowest current year forecast in the market,
fell 2 more to 140p.
Life assurance stocks performed well, with the exception of Prudential which
could manage only a minor improvement at 282p after Kleinwort Benson told
its clients to reduce overweight holdings in the stock. Transatlantic, which
encompasses the former Sun Life business, rose 15 to 204p.
Turnover began to pick up in the composite insurers with Guardian Royal
exceptionally busy on 5.6m shares traded and finally a shade better at 160p.
A buy recommendation on the insurance broking sector, said to have been
published by BZW, boosted JIB 14 to 161p and Lloyd Thompson 9 to 223p.
MicroFocus jumped 72 to 2340p in the wake of a buy recommendation published
by SG Warburg Securities, the company's stockbroker. Warburg said MicroFocus
can continue to achieve 25 per cent-plus annual dollar earnings per share
growth, that the shares remain undervalued versus US software companies, the
Standard &amp; Poors 500 index, UK growth companies and the FT Industrial and
500 share indices.
Racal Electronics rose 4 to 159p after the group announced its Racal Survey
division had won a contract worth a potential Pounds 1m year from Shell UK.
Graseby, formerly Cambridge Electronic Industries, dropped 11 to 146p
following hints that the company's stockbroker, Cazenove, had downgraded its
estimates.
Recent hints that the Government may well sell its remaining 21.8 per cent
holding in BT as soon as it is permitted (after the the payment of the third
installment of the second tranche of BT shares due in March 1993) brought
pressure to bear on BT shares. Both the 'old' and 'new' stock slipped 1 1/2
to 369 1/2 p and 264 1/2 p.
Downgrades were reported in Glynwed, with Albert E Sharpe, the Birmingham
stockbroker, believed to have reduced its profits estimates. The shares lost
7 to 206p. IMI was also said to have suffered at the hands of James Capel,
the shares retreating 4 to 230p.
Boots were the biggest casualty in the stores sector, the shares retreating
11 to 471p, on vague rumours of a pre-Christmas price war in the toiletries
market. US buyers were said to be preferring Grand Metropolitan, a penny
firmer at 399p, ahead of Pepsico.
Cadbury-Schweppes moved forward smartly as Nomura decided that its recent
underperformance made it look attractive on a 3-month view. The shares rose
5 to 460p. US buyers were said to be behind Kwik Save's advance of 14 1/2 to
734 1/2 p. UBS Phillips and Drew renewed its buy stance on Northern Foods,
the shares rising 6 to 263p.
Publishing conglomerate Pearson slipped 5 to 373p. The group's provincial
newspaper arm Westminster Press is hosting a large meeting with analysts
tomorrow.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: UK's turmoil weakens pound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING fell close to a three-year low against the US dollar yesterday as
Britain's growing political uncertainty turned the pound into a 'sell'
against most of the major currencies, writes James Blitz.
Now that Germany appears in the grips of an economic recession, the market
is starting to price in a cut in German interest rates and the pound may
show less volatility against the D-Mark in the next few months than it has
done in the period since Black Wednesday.
Yesterday, the pound fell two pfennigs against the D-Mark to close at
DM2.4225. But the biggest moves this week have been against the US dollar,
which looks set to rise against all European currencies as German and US
interest rates converge. Yesterday the pound dropped to Dollars 1.5640
against the dollar, later closing at Dollars 1.5790. It was down nearly a
cent on the day, and nearly 7 cents so far this week.
Sterling is mainly being weakened by the continuing turmoil in British
politics, in particular Mr John Major's threat to call a general election if
the government's attempt to ratify the Maastricht treaty is defeated in the
House of Commons. Rumours that UK interest rates will be cut by another two
percentage points also caused a sharp slump in sterling in Tokyo on Tuesday.
The quarterly industrial trends survey from the Confederation of British
Industry, predicting a continuation of the UK's recession, was the last
straw for investors yesterday.
Economists in the City of London are coming up with grim prognoses for
sterling exchange rates. Mr Ian Beauchamp, chief economist at Hambros Bank
in London, says that DM2.30 and Dollars 1.40 could well be the rates for
sterling at the end of this year. There is a strong consensus among
technical analysts that the fall through Dollars 1.60 on Monday was a key
point on the chart, and that the pound could be heading as low as Dollars
1.20 in 1993.
Otherwise, investors concentrated yesterday on whether the dollar could
break through DM1.55 against the D-Mark on the upside. It failed to, despite
indications that the convergence in US and German rates is a likely
prospect.
The dollar's first charge at DM1.55 came after Mr Otmar Issing, the
Bundesbank's chief economist, said that the margin between the Bundesbank's
Lombard and Discount rates left room for manoeuvre. Traders felt that there
could be room for an easing in the Lombard rate, perhaps at tomorrow's
council meeting.
The second dollar surge was provoked by the advanced third quarter GDP
figures in the US, which came in much better than expected at 2.7 per cent.
Forecasts had been for a 1.6 per cent gain. The dollar peaked at DM1.5455
against the D-Mark but closed at DM1.5340, down nearly  1/2 a pfennig on the
day.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Sterling trade easier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIQUIDITY problem in the sterling cash market continued to ease
yesterday after the Bank of England forecast a shortage of only Pounds 300m
at the start of its money market operations, writes James Blitz.
However, conditions in the D-Mark and French franc markets remained tight,
following hints from Bundesbank officials that another cut in official
German rates is unlikely at tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting.
There was extreme volatility in the sterling markets early yesterday morning
as dealers came in to work in London to find that the pound had slumped to a
low of DM2.4070 against the D-Mark. The currency's fall encouraged dealers
to believe that a base rate cut might not occur as quickly as expected, and
the December sterling contract slipped to a low of 93.37 in morning trading.
Two factors then firmed futures and eased rates. The first was the CBI's
quarterly report on industrial trends, showing that the UK economy is
sliding further into recession and raising speculation that the chancellor
will ease monetary policy to 'go for growth.'
The second factor was the Bank's forecast of a shortage of just Pounds 300m,
far less than expected. Dealers assumed that the Bank had provided liquidity
via foreign exchange swaps, selling sterling for foreign currencies.
However, there was little doubt that the shortages will continue to affect
the market until the Bank has built up its foreign reserves and pushed about
Pounds 5bn back into the market.
Money market rates generally closed easier yesterday, with 3-month money
closing at 7 3/4 per cent offered from a previous 8 per cent, and the 1
month down at 8 3/4 per cent from a previous 9 1/4 per cent. The December
contract closed at 93.60, pricing 3 month money in December at 6.4 per cent.
The December Euromark contract fell back 3 basis points from its opening
level, as dealers continued to assume that there will be no cut in German
official rates this week. At a close of 91.77, the contract assumes that
3-month money will be at around 8.23 per cent at the end of the year. That
prices in a cut in the discount rate by 50 basis points. The December French
franc futures contract closed unchanged at 90.91.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Survey of Aluminium (8): Victims of the deepening recession
 -Stockholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE a lot of low prices out there and it's pretty tough. That is the
view of Mr Colin Dawe, chairman of the UK Aluminium Stockholders
Association, who is predicting another year of tough economic climate and
low metal prices, writes David Blackwell.
Twelve months ago the ASA - along with every other industry - was hoping
that the recession was coming to an end. 'The stockists were the first in
and they should be the first to feel an upturn,' says Mr Dawe.
But while a couple of months early this year did appear to indicate better
times ahead, May and August were the worst months on record for aluminium
sales. 'Since the (UK general) election in April things have got even more
desperate and competitive,' says Mr Dawe. 'Clearly we are not getting out of
recession. The building, construction and transportation industries remain
deeply depressed, and there is no real sign of recovery.'
He especially cites the aircraft industry, which used to be the ASA's
glamour sector. After five or six years of heady growth, the industry's
aluminium consumption is down 35 per cent on last year as defence demand has
fallen and airline orders have been delayed.
Last year the ASA was worried that it was stuck with sales at the 1984
volumes but costs at 1991 levels. This year sales by volume are expected to
fall to a total of 94,000 tonnes of rolled and extruded aluminium, compared
with 103,000 tonnes worth about Pounds 235m in 1991. In the boom year of
1988, the association's members sold 120,000 tonnes of aluminium worth
Pounds 266m.
Consumption in the rolled sector, which sells to a wide range of engineering
companies, is expected to be down this year to 70,000 tonnes from 73,000
tonnes in 1991. Demand in the extrusion sector, which makes sections for the
building and transport industries, is predicted to fall to 24,000 tonnes
this year from 1991's 30,000 tonnes.
ASA members have been forced both to rationalise their industry and to
continue moving towards added value products. 'Some 10 per cent of the
warehouses we had in 1988-89 have been closed through rationalisation in a
bid to cut costs and improve efficiency and assist in the task of driving
down working capital,' says Mr Dawe.
Inevitably jobs have also been shed, and Mr Dawe estimates the number of
people now employed in the industry at just 2,000, down from 2,600 in 1990.
Even so, it has remained hard to make acceptable profits. Distribution costs
have risen as the number of deliveries made has remained static but the
quantities and values are much smaller than they used to be. 'Our major task
is to generate sufficient cash to keep our businesses solvent,' says Mr
Dawe.
The association, which now numbers 25 companies, is trying to build closer
links with its suppliers, and has recruited 11 of them as associate members.
It is also trying to force the pace of standardising to the metric system.
Although metrication has been under way in the UK for years, a great deal of
industry is still entrenched in the imperial system, according to Mr Dawe.
The ASA and its associate members are forming a study group to decide on
common metric standards. It believes that suppliers will find significant
advantages in settling for common standards and specifications across
Europe.
But the benefits should spread all down the line to the customer, Mr Dawe
believes. Stocks will be reduced, administration made simpler, and overheads
cut, and UK industry will be offered a product range equal to their European
competition.
The stockholders see themselves as metal bashers, a role they began to take
on in the boom years of 1987 and 1988. Investment in processing aluminium
has continued, says Mr Dawe, and 65 per cent of the aluminium which goes
through the stockholders is now processed before it is goes to their
customers. 'We are taking away from our customers what they often regard as
simple processes. We are often preparing component parts which will go
straight to their more complex machinery.'
Just-in-time delivery has also become more important and stockholders have
sharply reduced their own stocks, which were worth Pounds 70m in the late
1980s, but are now down to Pounds 45m, equivalent to 10 weeks' sales.
Mr Dawe feels there is room for further improvement. 'I still regard this as
too high. We have to work more closely with supply mills to reduce lead
times. We have set ourselves a target of having only two months' inventory.'
By the time the recession ends, aluminium stockholders will be leaner,
fitter and ready to respond quickly. Mr Dawe says: 'We have all learned a
hard lesson from the excesses of 1988-89. We will never again have high
stocks in a falling market.'

FT  28 OCT 92 / Survey of Aluminium (7): Charge of the lightweight brigade -
Aluminium is increasingly replacing steel in cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHEER went up from the aluminium industry when it became clear that Mr
Ferdinand Piech will next January take over as chief executive of Volkswagen
of Germany, the world's fourth-largest automotive group. An innovative
engineer, Mr Piech is boss of VW's Audi subsidiary and for the past 10 years
has enthusiastically driven that organisation towards using much more
aluminium in its up-market cars.
Next year Audi will launch an 'aluminium intensive' car based on a
revolutionary spaceframe concept - skeleton-like car bodies made from
aluminium - and using aluminium sheet components for the floor pan and body
panels. This vehicle was jointly developed with the Aluminium Company of
America (Alcoa) which has set up a Dollars 70m plant in Soest, Germany, to
make the spaceframe components which it expects to sell to other car makers
too.
Mr Paul O'Neill, chairman of Alcoa, says: 'Mr Piech - a far sighted leader
who has been supporting the aluminium intensive vehicle project for a decade
 -is now to become chairman of the whole of Volkswagen and this must be good
for the innovative use of aluminium as a material in autos.' Alcoa is not
alone in the spaceframe business. Reynolds Metals' technology was used for
the Ford Contour, a one-off 'concept' sports car.
Ford, the world's second-largest automotive group, says it is evaluating an
aluminium spaceframe for possible introduction in a 1997 or 1998 car. The
group also predicts that the average aluminium content of its US cars (at
present about 176 lbs or 79.8 kgs) will increase to 500lbs (227 kgs) by the
year 2005.
The spaceframe concept is also well-known to General Motors, biggest group
of its kind in the world. GM is to build a car based on an aluminium
spaceframe at an annual rate of 10,000 a year from 1993. Called the Impact,
it is an electric car developed to meet California's requirements for some
totally pollution free cars .
Among the world's other top six car companies, Toyota, Nissan and Honda of
Japan are already deeply committed to using more aluminium. Honda's NSX
sports car, launched in September 1990, is the most aluminium intensive car
on the road today and contains 1,000 lbs of the metal.
The most gung-ho forecasts about the use of aluminium in cars come from
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). It predicts
that demand for aluminium from Japan's car makers will reach 1.87m tonnes by
1995, more than double the 1989 level.
This confident forecast springs from the knowledge that Japanese
manufacturers have decided that only substantial use of the lightweight
metal will enable them to meet increasingly stringent fuel economy and
pollution regulations in the US, their most important market, without
reducing the size of their vehicles to unacceptable proportions.
Similar predictions are being made about European cars which are now about 5
per cent aluminium by weight. It is widely suggested this will go up to 20
per cent by the year 2000. Mr Jochen Schirner, chairman of VAW, Germany's
largest aluminium company, says that, even if the increase is only to 10 per
cent of the average car, it would mean each new vehicle carrying about 100kg
of aluminium and boost demand for the metal in Europe by about 1.5m tonnes a
year. This represents a jump of nearly one third on the present 4.6m tonnes.
US car companies used an average of 176lbs (79.8kg) of aluminium in each
vehicle last year and some analysts are more bullish than Ford and predict
this will rise to 600lbs (272kg) by the year 2000. If there is some increase
in car production over that time, an extra 6m tonnes of aluminium might be
required.
Put those figures in the context of total aluminium (including scrap) usage
last year of not quite 20m tonnes and it is easy to see why Mr David Morton,
chairman of Alcan of Canada, says the aluminium industry can expect an
'avalanche' of new business from the automotive industry.
Apart from weight saving considerations, the switch by car makers to
aluminium is also being heavily influenced by environmental pressures and
the car makers' perception that one day they all might be forced to produce
recyclable cars.
Mr Yale Brandt, vice chairman of Reynolds Metals and who is responsible for
that company's relationships with the automotive groups, points out that
this is where aluminium's role as an 'energy bank' is so important. 'If you
put 5 cents worth of electricity into aluminium, you get more than 4 1/2
cents back when the aluminium comes back as scrap.'
VAW's Mr Schirner says: 'Cars in the future will be dismantled into their
components within minutes. Aluminium is a high-value material that cries out
for several life cycles.'
Much of the increase in the use of aluminium in cars so far has come from
substituting the light metal for other materials. But aluminium is about
four times the price of steel - the traditional material used in cars - so
not everybody in the motor industry is enthusiastic about using vast
quantities even though it is only half the weight.
The aluminium industry's response was to find a way of designing a car from
a clean sheet so as compensate for the extra cost of the material. It
believes it has achieved this with the spaceframe concept.
Alcoa says, for example, it has cut the number of components required by
about half from the number needed for a conventional steel car body
structure. This reduces capital, tooling, labour, stock and other costs yet
produces a car 30 to 40 per cent lighter than a structure of equal stiffness
made of steel.
Hydro Aluminium of Norway is, like Alcoa, using extrusions for the
spaceframes it has developed. (Alcan, on the other hand, has chosen to build
its spaceframe of sheet aluminium.)
Hydro has developed aluminium spaceframes for Pininfarina, Porsche and
Tresser and is setting up a production unit to make them in Michigan, US.
Although it will not name its US customer, the project dovetails neatly with
GM's launch of the Impact electric vehicle.
Mr Ivar Hafsett, Hydro's president, suggests the aluminium industry still
has a great deal of work ahead before it can achieve the final breakthrough
 -the use of the technology in mass-produced cars. At present aluminium
spaceframes are suitable only for relatively small-volume models, produced
at an annual rate of no more than 100,000.
Much will depend on another project in which Hydro is involved - the F360m
Mosaic venture with Renault. This is part of the Eureka programme in which
European car producers and their suppliers have joined together to do some
basic research.
Mosaic has a target of using new materials and methods to achieve a 20 per
cent reduction in the weight and a 9 per cent reduction in cost of a car's
body-in-white plus a 9 per cent reduction in total investment cost. Mid-way
through the programme, which should be completed at the end of 1993, there
is stiff competition between two versions: an all-steel car which is
assembled with adhesives and a hybrid solution which involves Hydro's
aluminium spaceframe and plastic panels. This is a true mass production
vehicle rather than a limited volume specialised car.
As Mr Hafsett suggests: 'Our decade will see a lot of spaceframe-based
experimental cars and cars made in small volumes. The ultimate breakthrough
to mass-produced cars will have to wait until the next century.'
However, Mr Brandt at Reynolds adds a cautionary note. 'Ultimately, the move
to more aluminium in cars does not depend entirely on what the automotive
industry or the aluminium industry wants - but on what society wants.'

FT  28 OCT 92 / Survey of Aluminium (3): Pinpoints of light - Market
prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST ALUMINIUM analysts believe that they can still see the light at the end
of the demand tunnel that they first discerned in the early part of this
year; but the tunnel itself is proving to be much longer than it appeared
then, writes Richard Mooney.
They generally agree, however, that the end of the economic recession, when
it finally arrives, will bring a sharp rise in demand for aluminium, which
responds more quickly than other base metals to improvements in industrial
and consumer confidence.
The aluminium market held up well during the early stages of the present
economic down swing and in 1991 western world consumption (excluding eastern
Germany) totalled a record 14.95m tonnes. The trend in the second half of
that year was already downwards, however, and the consumption figure was
only 0.3 per cent up from 1990, compared with an average growth rate of 1.4
per cent in the period from 1979 to 1991, according to Billiton-Enthoven
Metals.
Things appeared to be looking up in the first quarter of this year with US
economic indicators assuming an encouraging aspect and European car sales
showing signs of recovery. It seemed then that the economic prognostications
circulating a year earlier were coming belatedly to fulfilment.
'Early in 1991,' said Billiton in the May 1992 edition of its Aluminium
Update publication, 'the consensus was that the English-speaking economies
would begin to recover in the second half of the year.' But it gradually
became apparent that the recession in those economies was more widely-based
and would be more protracted than was first feared. 'Also,' added Billiton,
'the extent of the slowdowns in Japan and Germany have been more severe than
had been expected earlier.'
The small rise in 1992 western world consumption of aluminium Billiton was
projecting at that time - to 15.2m tonnes from 15.05m tonnes in 1991 (both
figures including eastern Germany) - was mainly attributable to 'continued
expansion of the major non-mature economies, particularly those of the
Pacific basin'.
The 1992 consumption projection was left unchanged, as was the forecast for
1993 of 16.1m tonnes, in Billiton's late September market report. But the
mood of the authors had changed from cautious optimism to qualified
pessimism. In May they had suggested that the US economy was experiencing 'a
recovery, albeit a slow one'; but by September they were forced to conclude
that 'the US economy continues to stagnate'.
Meanwhile in Japan, the report said, 'things seem to be going from bad to
worse' (Marubeni recently forecast that the country's aluminium consumption
would fall by 8 per cent this year); and in Germany, according to the
Bundesbank, 'the western German economy is slowing down and an upturn in the
depressed east is still some way away'.
A somewhat less gloomy view was expressed in July by Anthony Bird
Associates, the specialist aluminium consultancy. While admitting that 'the
economic outlook is still dogged by the very poor state of consumer and
industrial confidence, especially in the once-resilient German and Japanese
economies', Bird argued that 'most of the fundamentals are sound', citing
low interest rates ('at least outside Europe'), low inflation and subdued
oil prices.
It found further encouragement in the fact that heavy consumer destocking
did not seem to have been a feature of the aluminium market's weakness in
the second quarter of 1992.
Bird also noted that aluminium's competitive position remained very strong
'in almost every market' at current depressed prices. It forecast demand
growth in 1993 of 6.5 per cent, a little stronger than that suggested in the
Billiton reports, followed by 3.8 per cent in 1994 and 3.2 per cent in 1995.
Billiton, in its September report, agreed that the prospects for aluminium
demand were somewhat brighter for next year. 'We believe that a period of
sustained recovery will be under way in the first half,' it said, 'and that
this will result in a sharp rise in demand, following several years of below
trend growth.' But it questioned how quickly this would translate into
higher prices. 'It could well be 1994 before the aluminium industry enjoys
the full benefits of economic recovery,' Billiton said.
In the longer term consumption prospects inevitably depend to some extent on
the response of the market to changes in the supply/demand balance.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Survey of Aluminium (2): Giants with a deadly breath -
Russia's smelters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME western aluminium producers claim their survival is threatened by
Russia's determination to push out exports of the metal to earn
desperately-needed hard currency. Russians are also paying a high price.
Conditions are so poor in some Russian aluminium smelters that the average
life expectancy of their workers is only 47 years.
If Russia's own anti-pollution regulations were enforced every one of its
aluminium smelters would either have to close or curtail output
substantially.
The cost of bringing these smelters up to date - to meet western standards
for emissions and efficiency - is prohibitive under present circumstances:
about Dollars 6.6bn to upgrade Russia's four biggest smelters alone.
Mr Horst Peters, general manager, technology marketing, for VAW Aluminium,
who made this calculation, also suggests that Russia's aluminium fabricating
industry requires huge sums to convert plants, originally set up to satisfy
the country's defence industries, to the production of consumer products
such as aluminium for cans and packaging materials.
He says at least one new 700,000-tonnes-a-year hot mill is necessary, which
would cost Dollars 500m and about the same amount is required for other
downstream projects.
Meanwhile, the aluminium industry in Russia and the rest of the Commonwealth
of Independent States is crumbling. How long it can hold off near total
collapse is anybody's guess.
Russian bauxite mines are being depleted and most will run out by the turn
of the century. More and more alumina (produced from bauxite and the raw
material from which aluminium is made) is having to be imported from the
west. Only half the 5.25m tonnes of alumina capacity in the CIS is based on
the modern Bayer process. The rest uses Pyrogen and Nepthaline processes
which are completely uneconomic.
Mr Peters suggests that, as CIS energy costs are permitted to rise to world
market levels (as they must do if the CIS is to meet International Monetary
Fund membership requirements), most of the alumina plants will become highly
uncompetitive. Alumina could be imported but the cost of shifting it across
Russia from port to smelter would be as much as Dollars 400 a tonne.
Russia's aluminium plants are short of spare parts, and other essential
materials such as petroleum coke and pitch. Accident rates are unacceptably
high.
When tested with all this, one Russian plant manager grinned and said: 'You
should have seen the smelters under the Communists.' He implied that
managers are used to working miracles to keep plants going.
Mr Paul O'Neill, chairman of the Aluminium Company of America, which sent an
investigating team to the CIS recently, speaks of the Russian industry as
'able to produce high-quality products in ghastly operating circumstances'.
The Alcoa team was impressed by the high level of education throughout the
CIS smelter workforces and by some of the technology it found - arising from
the former Soviet Union's willingness to provide unlimited resources for any
material needed for military use.
Mr Stewart Spector, a New York-based aluminium industry consultant, points
out it is virtually impossible to determine the real cost of CIS aluminium.
The Russians claim it averages Dollars 500 a tonne. But there has been no
power rate set by the Russian government. About 2.4m tonnes of Russia's 2.9m
tonnes of capacity uses hydro-electric energy. Mr Spector estimates the cost
of this power is probably one mill per kwh and 'for political reasons this
power will probably be subsidised and rates kept very low in future'.
Wage rates are also low. 'Even if you throw in all the non-productive labour
cost which is usually part of a CIS smelter operation, unit labour cost
ranges from one (US) cent to two cents a lb. That's less than the wage costs
in most third world countries where there are aluminium smelters.'
The CIS has one of the world's biggest aluminium industries. Its total
primary aluminium smelting capacity is about 3.8m tonnes while output last
year was 3.25m. Estimates of last year's exports vary, but Mr Spector
estimates they included well over 1.1m tonnes of aluminium of all types,
most of it destined for western markets. This year the CIS target is to
export 843,000 tonnes of primary aluminium and possibly 943,000 if it can
find the raw materials for the extra tonnage.
'The only way CIS plants are at present able to maintain production is with
the help of western trading organisations willing to assume the financial
risk of bartering alumina and other raw materials in exchange for aluminium
ingot,' Mr Spector suggests.
The damage done by the virtual doubling of CIS exports since 1986 has placed
the western industry - which is being forced to close environmentally
friendly smelting capacity to make room for metal from Russia's
mega-polluters - in a quandary. Dumping allegations are out of the question
because the international aluminium price is set by the London Metal
Exchange. The European Commission is, however, 'monitoring' the situation
but the North American industry's position is summed up by Alcoa's Mr
O'Neill who says: 'It would be difficult to square the principle of free
markets and open world trade by asking the Russians to curtail exports.'
Some western companies believe their best bet to obtain relief from Russian
export pressures is to help the CIS industry to modernise its smelters (this
would automatically entail some cuts in output for some years while the work
was done) and to convert fabrication plants to products for the CIS's
domestic market.
'The industry needs to help with the conversion of Russian fabricators to
the production of peace time products they need,' says Mr Randy Reynolds,
executive vice president, international, of Reynolds Metals. His company is
involved in an aluminium foil project which will take molten metal from the
Sayansk smelter in Siberia. This project is led by Fata, an Italian company.
Reynolds is supplying technology and will sell some foil in western markets
to repay loans and the rest in the CIS for food and cigarette packaging.
Reynolds is also talking to the Russian navy about using prefabricated
aluminium housing developed by the US group to accommodate personnel
released following the end of the Cold War.
The foil project was started before the Soviet Union collapsed. Mr Reynolds
says: 'Of course doing business in Russia is difficult. The decision-making
process is difficult - there are many laws to prevent you doing business.
The central bank does not exist any more. Some of our former partners don't
exist any more. But it is to Russia's advantage to see it through.'
Others are not so enthusiastic. Mr O'Neill says: 'I don't know if there is a
place for Alcoa in the CIS. We are not willing to sacrifice our values to do
business in an unseemly way in life-threatening circumstances.'
'There is only one certainty,' suggests Mr Spector. 'CIS production will
trend down over the next several years. However, there is no way of figuring
just how quickly or how soon it might decline. I am left with the feeling
that one day production will grind to a halt.'

FT  28 OCT 92 / Survey of Aluminium (4): The dawn was false - Why producers
are glum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLAGGING consumption, record production and stocks and historically low
prices add up to an unappetising recipe for any commodity sector. To most
people the obvious prescription for the indigestion felt by producers in
such a situation, especially those whose operating costs were not being
covered in the market place, would be a substantial dose of capacity
mothballing, if not outright scrapping.
To the more far-sighted, however, the danger of overdosing on retrenchment
and so blighting the longer term prospects of the industry as a whole might
be regarded as a comparable, if not greater, evil.
That was the attitude taken a year ago, when the aluminium market faced just
such a situation, by a considerable number of industry analysts. They need
not have worried. Producers did not cut output on the scale feared by the
analysts, consumption did not turn upwards as many had expected and as a
result the market remains sumptuously oversupplied with aluminium at prices
even lower than the sadly depressed levels of October, 1991.
The mood of the aluminium producing sector late last year was somewhat
equivocal. The fundamental situation was certainly bad. But there seemed no
reason to panic as the factors that were depressing the market could mostly
be regarded as short term. The world economic recession could not last much
longer; neither could the heavy influx of metal from the former Soviet
Union. And many producers felt that while some rationalisation of production
capacity might be prudent in the circumstances, it could safely be left to
their competitors.
A rise in prices early this year seemed for a while to justify that attitude
and there was a noticeable drying up of cutback announcements to augment
those promised in late 1991, most of which had been completed by the end of
the first quarter. But the price rise proved to be a false dawn, and as
Billiton-Enthoven metals put it in the May edition of its Aluminium Update,
it was 'in no way reflected in a turnround in this market's fundamentals',
which remained 'to say the least, unconstructive'.
Consumption remained 'muted', Billiton said; production cuts had 'not had
the desired impact'; and stocks had continued to rise 'swelled further by
resumed shipments from the CIS'.
Billiton suggested a variety of reasons why producers might hesitate to cut
output:
the costs involved in shutting or mothballing plants;
the willingness of large integrated producers to operate high-cost smelters
and accept the metal as a transfer price within their operations: 'In the
hope that the less efficient among the independents would take the decision
to close';
the linking of power and/or alumina (aluminium oxide) prices to the price of
the metal, particularly in the US. 'Thus,' it explained, 'falling metal
prices exert significant downward pressure on the cost curve of the
industry;'
the fact that many producers were able to 'lock in' higher prices by selling
forward late in 1990, when the market picked up. 'The more modest
improvement in prices since the start of this year has also encouraged some
forward selling,' Billiton added.
According to the Spector Report, a New York-based aluminium industry
consultancy, permanent plant closures in 1991 amounted to 372,000 tonnes and
temporary closures to 623,000 tonnes.
The effect of these cuts shows up in figures from the International Primary
Aluminium Institute. The average daily production rate fell from a peak of
41,000 tonnes in June, 1991 to 39,700 tonnes in December, then held steady
until falling further to 39,300 tonnes in March. But then the effect of new
capacity and expansions began to overtake that of the cutbacks and by August
the figure was back to 40,200 tonnes.
'In the absence of further cutbacks this rebound in production is sure to
continue,' said Billiton in its late-September Metals Report.
While Pechiney's new 215,000-tonnes a year smelter at Dunkirk had been fully
operational since mid-May there was more to come from two new smelters in
Quebec, Lauralco, at Deschambault, and Alouette, at Sept Isles. Both these
215,000-tonne units were well on the way to full production, Billiton said,
the former scheduled for this month and the latter in December. In addition
the 235,000-tonne Alba expansion in Bahrain was reported to be ahead of
schedule, with a fourth potline likely to be on stream by December.
Overall, the Spector Report says, these projects will have added 900,000
tonnes to annual capacity and 394,000 tonnes to expected 1992 production.
Further production boosts have come from Indonesia's Inalum, after increased
rainfall enhanced availability of hydro-electric power, and Canada's Alcan,
which this month restarted three potlines totalling 67,500 tonnes a year,
closure of which occurred last year due to a water shortage.
Future expansion plans are thin on the ground. Alusaf has a 400,000 tonnes a
year plant in South Africa on the drawing board. But financing for that
project has yet to be finalised and an environmental impact report, which
could delay or perhaps kill off the plan, is expected any day.
Further advanced but equally doubtful is a 180,000 tonnes a year plant in
Nigeria for which Reynolds Metals of the US, which has an 11 per cent
interest, is providing the technology. The Nigerian government is financing
the whole of the Dollars 1.66bn project, which Mr Randolph Reynolds,
executive vice president, international, of Reynolds Metals, recently said
was 'coming along slowly'. He added that his company was 'being very
cautious and making sure the money is available before making any move'.
In Australia a decision is expected before the end of this year on a
possible doubling of capacity at Comalco's 230,000 tonnes a year Boyne
Island smelter in Queensland. This project is complicated by the need, if it
is to go ahead, for a consortium including Comalco to spend ADollars 750m on
buying the nearby Gladstone power station from the Queensland state
government.
Billiton, in its September report, put 1991 western world production
(including Yugoslavia) at 15.11m tonnes, which was more or less in line with
the July estimate of Anthony Bird Associates, a specialist aluminium
consultancy, of 14.81m tonnes (excluding Yugoslavia). The two reports agreed
that output would be down this year - Billiton suggested 14.75m tonnes and
Bird 14.49m tonnes - but while Bird saw the fall continuing to 14.31m tonnes
in 1993 Billiton, with the benefit of another two months of data, thought
the uptrend would be resumed, taking the 1993 figure to about 15.1m tonnes.
Some divergence is also apparent on the prospect for CIS exports. In July
Bird projected 'net socialist exports of aluminium (including Yugoslavia) of
750,000 tonnes in 1992, down only slightly from 1991's 800,000 tonnes'. But
in the longer term it suggested that 'although there may be great
uncertainty about the timing of the coming decline in CIS exports, we have
little doubt that the decline will happen, and that it will be severe'. It
explained that few of the 'technically very inefficient' CIS smelters would
be able to stay in business when they had to pay realistic prices for their
inputs.
In contrast Billiton has warned against pinning hopes on a big cut in CIS
exports, noting that recent reports suggested that they could this year be
as high as the 1991 record, which it put at 875,000 tonnes, 'and will remain
high for the foreseeable future because of the country's need for hard
currency'.
'There is the possibility that CIS smelters could be forced to close or
reduce output markedly if environmental laws are enforced stringently,' it
added. 'But few regard this as likely in the near future.'

London's robusta coffee futures market set a fresh eight-month high
yesterday while cocoa touched a nine-month peak. Dealers said the COFFEE
market, which reached Dollars 930 a tonne in the January position before
closing at Dollars 924 a tonne, up Dollars 33 from Monday, rose on
technically-inspired investment fund buying. They thought it could climb
further before producers were tempted to return as sellers, but would not
speculate on the extent of the upside potential. The rise in COCOA prices,
which mainly reflected sterling's weakness against the US dollar, lifted the
March position to Pounds 734 at one point before it closed at Pounds 724 a
tonne, up Pounds 9 on the day. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices
were also aided by the pound's fall, the cash position closing Pounds 21.50
up at Pounds 1,427.50 a tonne. The rise was further encouraged by workers at
Codelco, the Chilean state metals group, threatening a strike call at the
end of the week if the company did not negotiate on privatisation plans.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Demand for timber remains in
doldrums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC recession and the depressed construction market in many European
countries continue to dampen demand for timber and little recovery is seen
over the coming year, according to a report from the timber committee of the
United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
However, the North American market, fuelled by a revival in new
housebuilding, is expected to show healthy growth this year and next.
European consumption of sawn softwood, which fell sharply in 1991, is
expected to fall by a further 4.8 per cent in 1992 to 69.1m cubic metres,
and then to stabilise in 1993 at about 69.5m cu m. However, production is
projected to rise by 0.8 per cent to 67m cu m in 1992 and by another 1.7 per
cent next year.
Despite a decline in imports and some rise in exports, weak demand has led
to oversupply in many European sawn softwood markets, leading to fierce
competition, low profitability and sawmill closures, the ECE says. This is
likely to continue in the near term despite a steady fall in Russian exports
outside the Commonwealth of Independent States.
However, the ECE is predicting a 5.9 per cent rise in North American sawn
softwood demand to 122.4m cu m in 1992 and a 3.1 per cent rise in 1993.
It also takes a more cheerful view of long-term European prospects, pointing
to the strong latent demand for sawn softwood in eastern and central Europe,
where there is a need to increase and improve the housing stock.
Developments in the markets for softwood logs in Europe are still marked by
the consequences of the 1990 storm, which felled over 100m cu m, according
to the report. It forecasts a slow rise in production in 1992 and 1993,
while trade is expected to drop back to pre-storm levels. Nevertheless, the
ECE says, large stocks of water-stored logs will continue to weigh on the
market.
Sawn hardwood consumption and production in Europe may decline slightly in
1992 to 18.4m and 14.5m cu m respectively, with little change in 1993. The
ECE notes that European imports of tropical hardwoods have fallen
significantly since 1989, in part reflecting campaigns by environmental
groups to save tropical forests.
In North America, consumption and production of sawn hardwood are expected
to increase by 5.5 to 5.7 per cent this year to 24.8m and 26.5m cu m
respectively.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Middle East selling sends gold
price to 10-week low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOLD price slipped to the lowest level for 10 weeks yesterday under
pressure from fresh Middle East selling. The London bullion market price
closed at Dollars 338.25 a troy ounce, down Dollars 2.90, taking the fall on
the week so far to Dollars 4.90 an ounce.
The New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) gold market steadied a little after
London's close and in late trading the December position was quoted at
Dollars xxx an ounce, down Dollars xxx on the day. But Comex analysts told
the Reuter news agency that the metal was poised to make another run towards
life-of-contract lows. Mr George Milling-Stanley, first vice president,
bullion sales, with Lehman Brothers, suggested that speculators were
targeting a further fall to the December gold contract's life-time low of
Dollars 335 an ounce. 'The MidEast was a substantial seller of gold,' he
said. 'It is short selling, looking to make a profit from the decline.'
London dealers said the market was being kept on the defensive by the
strength of the dollar and 'pre-US election jitters'. They thought prices
were likely to hold within a Dollars 336-Dollars 340-an-ounce range over the
next few days.

heal banana split
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN AN apparent effort to ease growing tension between Caribbean and Central
American banana exporters over future access to the European market, Mr
Rafael Leonardo Callejas, the president of Honduras, has said Latin American
producers have no plans to squeeze Caribbean exporters out of their
traditional market.
Speaking in Jamaica after a state visit, Mr Callejas said his government was
aware of the need to protect the 'access' of Caribbean banana producers to
the European Community after the creation of a single market in January. He
said Latin American exporters wanted to ensure that they would be allowed to
benefit from any expansion in consumption in Europe after the Caribbean
market was guaranteed.
Latin American producers, whose fruit is more price-competitive than that of
the traditional suppliers who have had preferential access to the European
market, have objected to proposals from the European commission which they
say will limit their earnings from Europe.
The Latin Americans are arguing in favour of an open market for the fruit,
while the Caribbean and other producers want continued guaranteed access and
limits on European imports of Latin American bananas.
'We have a lot of potential to expand bananas, but we recognise that this is
a very complex matter,' Mr Callejas said. 'We would not like to compete with
the Caribbean region because of several reasons, such as our advantage in
scale of production. So our effort will be to continue to try to convey this
message to the European Community,' the Honduran president said.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper mining projects attract
big spenders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME VERY high prices are being paid for copper mining projects, according
to Mr Douglas Yearley, chairman of Phelps Dodge, the world's second-biggest
producer of the metal.
He quotes three examples:
Lac Minerals of Canada is to pay USDollars 70m for 52.5 per cent of the
Lisheen copper project in Ireland which Phelps values at Dollars 35m to
Dollars 40m;
Minorco, part of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, is to pay
Dollars 185m for a one-third stake in the Colahausi project in Chile which
Phelps believes is worth Dollars 100m;
Placer Dome, another Canadian group, is to pay Dollars 100m for a 50 per
cent interest in the Zaldivar project, also in Chile, which Phelps values at
less than Dollars 50m.
Mr Yearley is also concerned about the number of newcomers to copper mining,
particularly those gold companies switching to the base metal.
At a private meeting with analysts during London Metals Week he described
these gold companies as 'amateurs' because copper was 'not their natural
business'. His remarks were so aggressive they were bound to be repeated and
become a big talking point in the metals markets.
He told the analysts Phelps would not become involved in bidding up the
price of mineral properties. It was better to explore for properties than to
buy at present - Phelps was spending Dollars 35m a year on exploration.
Discussing the Colahausi project, where Billiton, the Royal Dutch/Shell
mining and metals business, and Falconbridge, the Canadian company jointly
owned by Norada of Canada and Sweden's Trelleborg, are also involved, Mr
Yearley pointed out that copper had never been mined at such a height - the
deposit is about 15,000 feet above sea level - and it was on the wrong side
of the Andes mountains. Whereas Chile's successful Escondida copper mine was
sending ore for processing in a slurry via pipelines down to the sea,
Colahausi could not use this cost-saving technique.
The price paid for the Zaldivar stake, acquired by Placer Dome from
Outokumpu, the Finnish mining and metals group which retains the other 50
per cent, could be justified only if the copper price stayed at Dollars 1.15
a lb for the long term. Phelps, always conservative, used a long-term copper
price of 85 cents a lb for its valuations he said, while RTZ Corporation of
the UK, another big copper producer, used 91 cents.
Mr Eliseo Gonzalez-Urien, Placer Dome's vice-president, exploration,
yesterday vigorously defended his company's proposed purchase of the
Zaldivar stake. Placer Dome did not make long-term price forecasts but
looked at production costs. If Zaldivar performed 'as advertised,' its
production costs would be among the lowest in the world at 35 US cents to 55
cents a lb.
Copper at Zaldivar was near the surface and could be recovered by the
low-cost solvent extraction-electro winning process for the first several
years. The Dollars 500m investment would be paid back to the joint venturer
company in three years, Placer would be paid back in about five years while
the mine was expected to have a very long life, perhaps 50 years.
'Buying a copper mine is not like shopping for a pair of shoes where you can
walk up the high street comparing prices in several stores,' said Mr
Gonzalez-Urien. 'You pay what you think it is worth to you. Phelps Dodge, as
an established copper company, obviously has a different view to us.'
At his presentation, Mr Yearley said Phelps expected a copper supply surplus
of about 100,000 tonnes this year and next. Even so, prices next year should
range between 90 cents and Dollars 1.10 a lb. He suggested 1994 would be a
good year for the copper producers because production would stabilise while
consumption by then should be receiving a boost from a recovery in world
economic activity.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia's rice may be
over-egged - Why donor agencies are urging a policy re-think
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING and REUTER
</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE RAINS have fallen early in Indonesia this year, calming fears that the
country might slip from its target of self-sufficiency in rice. Once, in the
1970s, the world's biggest importer of rice, in good years Indonesia now has
the capacity to export.
Despite this success, donor agencies are urging the government to re-think
its rice policy. The system of price stabilisation and subsidies should be
restructured, they say, with the private sector adopting a greater role in
storage and distribution.
Estimates for the 1992 crop have been revised upwards as the threat of
drought has diminished. The latest forecast from the US Embassy in Jakarta
puts the 1992 crop at 29.8m tonnes milled production.
Imports for the year are estimated at 650,000 tonnes and exports at 100,000
tonnes. Stocks held by Bulog - the state agency responsible for setting
prices, controlling imports and exports and market intervention - are
expected to rise by 25 per cent to 1.25m tonnes by the end of the year.
Indonesia recently changed its policy of 'lending' rice during surplus
seasons to other rice-producing countries, such as the Philippines and
Vietnam, on the understanding that the loans can be recalled during periods
of deficit.
This year the government has switched to exporting on a commercial basis and
Bulog recently agreed to sell 200,000 tonnes over this year and next. The US
report suggests that competitive FOB prices 'would have to be at least
Dollars 50 to Dollars 55 per tonne below production costs when compared with
cif Jakarta prices for rice of a similar quality'.
This implies a loss on exports and has given ammunition to Bulog's critics,
who say that its officials do not always act in Indonesia's national
interest.
A recent report by the World Bank suggested that the role of Bulog should be
modified as part of a gradual reform of agricultural policy. It called for
the phasing out of subsidised rice for the military and civil servants,
amounting to 1.6m tonnes a year, 'which is often resold on the domestic
market at prices well below the government's cost of delivery'.
The bank suggests Bulog's marketing functions should be performed by the
private sector up to where intervention is required to keep prices in line
with the world market.
The report paints a bright picture of Indonesia's long-term prospects for
maintaining self-sufficiency in rice.
Compared to annual growth in demand of 3.7 per cent during the 1980s, it
projects an increase in the 1990s of about 2.2 per cent a year. This
reflects an expected decline in per capita consumption of rice as average
income rises, with consumers buying higher-value commodities such as
vegetables and meat. Demand is forecast at between 33m and 34m tonnes in the
year 2000, and between 34m and 39m tonnes in 2010.
The biggest obstacle to self-sufficiency is the conversion of land away from
agricultural use on the island of Java, which accounts for more than half
Indonesia's 183m population and is the nation's industrial hub. Java
produces 59 per cent of Indonesia's rice but is losing up to 50,000 hectares
(125,000 acres), or 1 per cent of its rice paddy, each year.
The use of higher yielding varieties and irrigation in areas outside Java
should more than offset the loss of land to industry and urbanisation,
however. The World Bank is confidently forecasting production surpluses in
the next decade (see table).
Much will depend, however, on agricultural reform outside the rice sector.
For instance, land that could be used for rice production is designated by
the government for sugar cane, despite Indonesia lacking a competitive
advantage in sugar production.
Donors argue that, while sugar refiners benefit from protected prices,
farmers are losing out. The same land could grow two crops of high yielding
rice for every crop of sugar, boosting the farmer's income and maintaining
national self-sufficiency in rice.
Vietnam expects to produce a record 23.2m tonnes of rice this year, compared
with 22m in 1991, according to an agriculture ministry official, reports
Reuter from Hanoi.
The country has exported 1.25m tonnes so far this year and is likely to
export 2m for the whole year, compared with 1.1m tonnes in 1991, deputy
prime minister Phan Van Khai told the National Assembly earlier this month.
Agricultural reforms launched in 1987 freed farmers to grow and sell their
own produce, transforming Vietnam by 1989 from a rice importer into the
world's third biggest rice exporter.

auction centres

ANTICIPATING that the Indian federal government will soon be announcing a
fresh credit line of Dollars 75m to Russia, including Dollars 30m for tea,
Russian buying agents for have become active at the Calcutta and other tea
auction centres.
Confirming the fairly strong buying for Russia, Mr Vijay Dudeja, spokesman
for the brokers, said the auction prices for teas had started improving,
though they were still lower than last year.
The expected new credit line would enable Russia to procure at least 16m kg
of tea. According to Mr Dudeja, the recent purchases for Russia include CTC
(cut, tear and curl), orthodox and Darjeeling teas.
Russia had earlier in the season imported 15m kg of tea by utilising the
first tranche of technical credit of Dollars 32m. According to industry
officials, a substantial portion of Indian tea being exported to Poland is
destined eventually for Russia.
Up to August, India's total tea exports amounted to 102m kg, compared with
114m kg in the first eight months of last year. Considering that Russian
buying has slowed down considerably, India has not done badly. Mr HP
Barooah, chairman of the Indian Tea Association, said that following the
rupee devaluation, Indian tea had become competitive with Sri Lankan and
Kenyan varieties. Because of this, India was able to export more tea to the
UK, Iran, Egypt and Jordan.
Pakistan, which usually imports about 150m kg of tea a year, mostly from Sri
Lanka, Kenya and Indonesia, held great promise for Indian exporters. Mr
Barooah said.
In spite of the export setback there has not been a precipitious fall in the
auction prices. That was because the country's tea output up to August fell
by 31.8m kg to 420.4m kg, the ITA chairman said.

FUJITSU, Japan's biggest computer company, yesterday reported the worst
results in the company's history.
Consolidated sales rose by 6.7 per cent to Y1,694.3bn (Dollars 13.88bn) in
the six months to September, against Y1,590bn a year ago. But parent company
pre-tax profits were down by 86.5 per cent to Y32.9bn, while on a
consolidated basis Fujitsu lost Y7.5bn pre-tax, compared with a profit of
Y30.9bn in the same period last year.
Sales of Fujitsu's computers and information processing systems moved ahead
by 10.9 per cent to Y1,246bn, but sales of communication systems were down
by 7.7 per cent to Y206.7bn and semiconductor and electronic component sales
fell by 3.4 per cent to Y174.9bn.
Fujitsu made a further cut to capital spending plans from Y140bn to Y110bn,
compared to Y198bn last year.
In spite of Fujitsu's Y19.2bn net consolidated loss in the first half it
expects to earn a net profit of Y5bn for the year.

FT  28 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Warning from SIA as profits
fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIA, the parent company of Singapore Airlines, warned yesterday that
business for the rest of this year would be 'mixed'. Demand on many routes
was low 'because of the sluggish economic climates in the major
industrialised countries.'
The warning came with the company's interim figures. Tough competition, the
world economic slowdown and a strong Singapore dollar pushed first-half
operating profits 8.9 per cent lower to SDollars 477m (USDollars 298m).
The fall at the pre-tax level was a sharper 21.5 per cent to SDollars 498m,
depressed by the absence of aircraft sales, which produced a surplus of
SDollars 88m in the same period in 1991.
Shareholders' funds, however, climbed 5 per cent to SDollars 7,398m, while
the dividend was maintained at 15 cents and the company announced a
one-for-one scrip issue.
Investors had feared worse, and the 'foreign' shares - those tradeable by
non-Singapore holders - rose 40 cents to 1,430 cents, outperforming the
local stock market.
SIA has increased its capacity by more than one-fifth over a year ago as new
routes to Johannesburg, New York and Madrid were opened.
The effect of the rise in capacity on sales was, however, limited by heavy
competition, said the company.
First-half turnover rose only 3.8 per cent to SDollars 2,753m, while the
load factor - a measure of how full the average aircraft is - fell 3
percentage points to 67.4 per cent. This is a large fall by industry
standards and was largely attributable to the cargo division.
The yield - the revenue earned per passenger or tonne of freight - dropped
almost 10 per cent. This meant that the break-even load factor, a
closely-watched figure reflecting margins and the strength of cost controls,
rose 0.7 percentage points to 61.3 per cent.
Group costs rose 7 per cent to SDollars 2,276m, pushed up by depreciation,
fuel prices, in-flight meals maintenance and overhaul.
The airline itself, excluding engineering, cargo and other subsidiaries of
the group, saw operating profits fall 22.4 per cent to SDollars 359m.
The decline was especially sharp reflecting payments to new subsidiaries
created at the start of the company's financial year in April.
SIA Engineering, for example, is now charging the airline commercial rates
for its services.

FT  28 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Flag-carrier recharts growth
plan - Daniel Green examines Singapore Airlines's restructuring strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOURTEEN hours flying time from Europe or the US may not be far enough for
Singapore to escape the effects of recession in the western world.
Singapore Airlines (SIA), which has seen capacity grow at 16 per cent a year
for the last two decades, seems already to be suffering under the strain.
But the world is not entirely to blame for the sharp fall in its profits.
Part of the decline is the result of a restructuring at the start of the
year which saw several new subsidiaries created in areas such as cargo and
catering.
Apart from the expense of the restructuring, the airline has seen operating
profits hit hard as it is forced to pay commercial rates for engineering
services from the newly-separate SIA engineering and maintenance division.
The restructuring has a longer-term aim in mind than half a year's operating
figures. It is intended to meet an immodest target of 8 to 10 per cent
growth a year for the rest of the decade.
The task is not an easy one. Mr Cheong Choong Kong, managing director, said
SIA's optimism of as recently as 1990 'has been tarnished' by world
recession and the possibility of international trade wars.
The separation of the cargo division follows similar moves taken recently by
the likes of British Airways and Lufthansa, the German carrier. They have
all responded to industry forecasts of a more rapid growth in air cargo than
passenger numbers: cargo volumes should grow by 40 per cent over the next
five years.
But Mr Robert Tan, chief executive of the airline's new engineering
division, predicts even more rapid growth in his unit, with sales rising
from SDollars 580m (USDollars 362.5m) now to SDollars 900m in 1997.
If the strategic drive into engineering and maintenance achieves this kind
of success, it will have been as much to do with geography and history as
traditional airline management. For most of its history, Singapore was a
quiet fishing village. Since the middle of the last century the port has
grown rapidly as a natural safe haven on busy shipping lanes, helped by the
availability of cheap ship repairs.
Today, it is the second-largest port in the world.
Singapore's ultra-modern Changi airport has suddenly found itself at a
similar crossroads. The latest generation of long-haul aircraft can fly
non-stop from Europe to south-east Asia, and the next generation, with
aircraft being delivered from next year, can bridge the west coast of the US
to south-east Asia in one hop.
Singapore is a natural choice in the region for refuelling and crew changes.
Changi regularly wins prizes for its efficiency, and the addition of a
second terminal in 1990 doubled capacity. Passengers and air crew are half
an hour from the city centre on a congestion-free motorway.
Servicing charges are likely to be keen because the engineering division has
a desperate need for new customers. The volume of business from Singapore
Airlines is limited because the carrier's fleet is small even by Asian
standards. And it has the youngest aircraft in the world, an average of just
over five years old, which need less maintenance than those of other
carriers.
SIA's solution is to offer a 'one-stop' engineering service to other
airlines, said Mr Tan. 'We have the facilities, tooling and skills for 90
per cent of accessories on Boeing 747s and 80 per cent on Airbus aircraft.'
The division is already contracted to Vietnam Air and Bulgaria's Jes Air,
and many others are on the list of potential clients.
Mr Tan says he will be able to woo west Asian airlines away from their
traditional links with Europe. He will have to move quickly. He admits there
will be competition from companies once involved in now shrinking military
maintenance contracts, and there are potential competitors elsewhere in the
Far East where costs, especially of personnel, are lower than in Singapore.
Costs are already a problem across SIA. The company is considering moving
its accounting and data processing operations to cheaper centres in India or
China.
SIA is already marketing its new engineering services hard. It may not take
long to see whether its has been nimble enough to capture a significant
slice of the long-haul maintenance market.

FT  28 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: BT to convert Pounds 1.69bn
loan stock into Eurobonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecom is to convert Pounds 1.69bn (Dollars 2.75bn) of its
registered loan stock into Eurobonds.
This is the latest development in the government's auction of privatised
companies' debt to raise around Pounds 1bn this fiscal year.
Baring Brothers and the Treasury first announced the auction of BT and
electricity sector debt in August. The BT debt to be converted into
Eurobonds carries coupons of 12 1/4 to 12 1/2 per cent and matures between
1997 and 2006.
BT and the Treasury have agreed to amend the terms of the stock so that it
conforms with the terms and conditions of those on the company's existing
Eurosterling bonds. The coupons and payment dates of the debt to be
auctioned will remain unchanged.
Baring Brothers said the move would enhance significantly the marketability
of BT's debt and widen its third party investor base. The existing stock
pays interest net of withholding tax, while the Eurobonds will pay interest
gross.
However, traders said yesterday that while marketability would be improved,
the high coupons and likely pricing well above par value would be limiting
factors on distribution into the international market.
Parties wishing to bid must pre-register their interest with Baring Brothers
by November 3. Pre-registration implies no commitment to bid.
Barings expects to send out particulars of the auction in the first week of

<TEXT>
A NEW YORK bankruptcy judge has approved the sale of the New York Daily
News, the loss-making tabloid, to Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, the property
investor and magazine publisher.
Judge Tina Brozman said the sale was 'necessary and appropriate' shortly
after she ruled in favour of Mr Zuckerman on a trade union dispute involving
the paper's typographers.
Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, owner of the weekly US News and World Report magazine
and The Atlantic, a monthly magazine, had warned he might walk away from the
transaction if he had to honour a 20-year-old contract that guaranteed
life-time employment for 165 typographers.
Judge Brozman said enforcing the typographers' contracts 'would have a
devastating effect on the sale and would probably kill it.'
The fate of the Daily News, which was previously owned by the late Mr Robert
Maxwell, has been in the hands of the bankruptcy court since it filed last
year for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law.

AMERICAN Express revealed a Dollars 205m third-quarter net loss after a
heavy Dollars 342m after-tax restructuring charge related to 4,800 planned
redundancies and other measures in its core travel-related services (TRS)
division.
The group's deficit was the biggest in a quarterly period since the
disastrous losses suffered by its Shearson Lehman investment banking and
securities subsidiary in early 1990. It underscored what Standard and
Poor's, the rating agency, termed a negative outlook for the company.
Although the agency affirmed debt ratings, S&amp;P noted American Express's
problems with credit quality and competition in the card market.
The American Express loss, which compares with a Dollars 31m net profit a
year ago, was caused by red ink in three of its most important divisions.
The TRS division loss was Dollars 187.5m, although operating earnings were
Dollars 155m before the restructuring charge.
The American Express Bank loss was Dollars 29.8m, caused by staff reductions
and by a jump in bad debt provisions for property loans in the UK - from
Dollars 8m a year ago to Dollars 67m.
American Express's share of Shearson Lehman's loss was Dollars 37.4m. The
investment bank and brokerage house said its quarterly loss was Dollars 25m,
compared with net profits of Dollars 63m a year ago.
The reduction of the TRS workforce by 4,800 represents 9 per cent of the
division's 53,000 employees.
Other costs were attributed to reorganised product groupings and the need to
cut expenses.
Loss per share in the third quarter was 45 cents, against net earnings of 5
cents a year ago.
The losses slashed American Express's net earnings for the first nine months
to Dollars 380m, compared with Dollars 551m in the same period of last year.

RECESSION in the world airline industry was underscored when Boeing, the
leading manufacturer of commercial aircraft, reported a 9 per cent drop in
third-quarter earnings.
The Seattle-based company reported net earnings of Dollars 364m, or Dollars
1.07 a share, compared to Dollars 401m, or Dollars 1.17, in the third
quarter of last year. Sales fell 10 per cent to Dollars 6.9bn.
Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman, noted some airline customers had asked to
reschedule orders and option delivery positions. However, some of the
negotiated deferred deliveries had been offset by new orders and requests by
other customers to accelerate deliveries. The firm backlog of orders at the
end of the quarter stood at Dollars 93bn, down from Dollars 97.9bn at the
end of 1991.
Announced orders for commercial jets for the first nine months were valued
at Dollars 11.5bn, down from Dollars 14.7bn in the same period of last year.
For the first nine months, the company reported earnings of Dollars 1.26bn,
or Dollars 3.69, on sales of Dollars 22.7bn, compared with earnings of
Dollars 1.16bn, or Dollars 3.39, in the same period of last year.

<TEXT>
EDGARS, the fashion retailer belonging to South African Breweries, raised
sales and earnings in the six months to the end of September but failed to
achieve real growth.
Sales rose 9 per cent to R1.4bn (Dollars 482m) from R1.3bn a year earlier,
while operating profits rose 7 per cent to R194.4m from R181.9m.
Attributable earnings rose 5 per cent to R82.4m from R78.6m.
The low growth in earnings testifies to the extremely tough operating
environment, with private consumption expenditure expected to drop this year
for the first time since 1985.
In the five years to 1992, Edgars increased attributable earnings per share
at a compound rate of 27.4 per cent per annum. In the half-year under
review, earnings per share rose by only 5 per cent to 162 cents from 155
cents. But the dividend is being raised by 6 per cent to 38 cents per share
from 36 cents.
Mr George Beeton, chief executive, said the weaker consumer demand was
reflected in the estimated 8 per cent growth in clothing, footwear and
textiles turnover - well below inflation.
He said, however, that the group had managed to outperform the market with
sales rising by 9 per cent. He said costs and markdowns had been well
contained, which was helped by inflation in the sector declining to an
average 7 per cent.
Looking at the group's divisional performance, Mr Beeton said the Edgars
chain had matched its 1991 interim earnings, while Sales House gained market
share and enhanced its profitability. Jet improved its results, despite the
depressed state of the cash market.
The group is not anticipating an upturn in retail sales in the second half
of the financial year, and hence predicts sales and profit growth for the
full year will be in line with the first-half performance.

<TEXT>
PLACER DOME, the Canadian mining group, expects next week to emerge with a
new understanding about its gold operations in Papua New Guinea. Mr Peter
Crossgrove, its new vice-chairman, has agreed to travel to PNG for a meeting
on November 5 with Mr Paias Wingti, the recently-elected prime minister.
Shares in companies with big PNG interests have fallen following comments by
Mr Wingti indicating his government wishes to renegotiate some natural
resource contracts.
PD's 75.7 per cent-owned Australian subsidiary, Placer Pacific, has a stake
in two of PNG's newest gold mines: 30 per cent of Porgera, one of the
lowest-cost in the world, which is expected to produce more than 1.4m troy
ounces this year, and 80 per cent of Misima, scheduled to produce 300,000
ounces.
Mr Crossgrove, in London yesterday, said he hoped 'to settle all the issues
to everybody's satisfaction', at the meeting at Mr Wingti's home, when the
future of mining in PNG would top the agenda.
He pointed out that PD had been operating in PNG since 1938 and that the
Porgera mining agreement was considered a model for future projects there.
Mr Crossgrove is widely expected to be appointed PD's chairman after a
successor to Mr Tony Petrina, who resigned recently as president, is named.

<TEXT>
MR LI Ka-shing, chairman of diversified Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison
Whampoa, yesterday re-affirmed his company's commitment to its UK
telecommunications business, in an attempt to end speculation concerning the
group's ambitious international telecommunications strategy.
Mr Li said it was Hutchison's 'firm intention' to continue supporting its UK
operations, which could require capital of up to HKDollars 9bn (USDollars
1.6bn)
Mr Li said the main ongoing UK investment would be in the company's personal
communications network, a new mobile system designed to compete mainly with
existing cellular networks. UK telepoint and paging networks were complete
and would not require as much further investment.
Mr Li's statement was the second concerning the company's telecommunications
interests in the past week.
The first, issued following a request from the Hong Kong stock exchange last
week, stated that Hutchison would refocus its attention on Hong Kong and
China. The failure to mention the UK fuelled speculation that these
oper-ations would be sold or abandoned.
Further confusion followed on Monday when Hutchison made 40 people redundant
in Hutchison Telecommunications' corporate head office in Hong Kong, about
80 per cent of the total workforce there.
Despite the latest statement, some analysts questioned how long Hutchison
would stick by its UK operations.
'I expect the future investment in the UK will be well below the figure
originally envisaged and I still anticipate Hutchison's withdrawal from the
business as soon as a serious buyer emerges,' said Mr Clive Weedon at
Nomura.
Hong Kong investors' dissatisfaction with Hutchison's telecom business was
demonstrated on Thursday, when the share price rose 12 per cent after a
magazine article claimed the UK operations would be sold or shut down by the
end of the year.
Although Mr Simon Murray, Hutchison's managing director and main architect
of the group's telecommunications investment in the UK, denied the story, it
is understood that there is opposition within the Hutchison board to
continued expenditure in the UK.

FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: Northern Telecom gains 11% and
predicts further growth
</HEADLINE>

   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker, has
reported a surprisingly strong 11 per cent rise in third-quarter earnings
and predicted further 'respectable' growth for the rest of the year.
Yesterday's third-quarter earnings report set off a rise in Northern
Telecom's shares, which closed CDollars 2 1/8 higher at CDollars 45 1/2 on
the Toronto stock exchange yesterday.
The stock has traded as high as CDollars 58 this year, but recently fell
below CDollars 40 on reports of weaker demand and intensifying competition
in many markets.
Earnings climbed to USDollars 113m, or 46 cents a share, from USDollars
102m, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose 5 per cent to
Dollars 2.02bn.
The order intake improved by 8 per cent to Dollars 2.26bn, and orders on
hand stood at a record Dollars 3.38bn on September 30, 16 per cent higher
than a year earlier.
The company said that gross margins widened by about 2 percentage points,
reflecting growth in sales of central office switches.
Dr Paul Stern, chairman, ascribed the improvement mainly to expanding market
share.
'The market is tough, and we're slugging it out on the strength of product
and our relationships,' Dr Stern said.
He added that he still expected earnings for the year as a whole to exceed
1991 levels. For the first nine months, earnings were Dollars 293m, down
from Dollars 307m in January-September 1991.
Third-quarter revenues rose in all geographic markets except Europe, which
was affected by weak demand as well as the divestiture of some businesses
which Nortel acquired as part of its takeover of Britain's STC in March
1991.
Sales of business communications systems and terminals were flat, but
revenues from all other product lines increased, with the biggest rises
posted by transmission products and cable.

ZENITH ELECTRONICS yesterday reported a third-quarter loss of Dollars 41.8m
and said it would lay off 2,600 employees, or 15 per cent of its US
workforce.
The Chicago-based manufacturer also said it would cut operations and jobs at
its television plant in Mexico as part of its restructuring.
In light of the third-quarter loss, the company said it was reconsidering a
proposed public offering of 8m shares of common stock, announced in August.
The third-quarter loss was equal to Dollars 1.42 a share and compared with a
deficit of Dollars 1.5m, or 5 cents, the third quarter last year. The
third-quarter results include a special Dollars 23m charge for severance and
restructuring costs, and a Dollars 2m tax credit.
Third-quarter sales fell to Dollars 313m, from Dollars 344m in the same 1991
quarter. The company said its slow response to industry price cuts for
colour TVs and start-up costs at its Mexican assembly plants depressed
third-quarter margins.
For the first nine months, Zenith reported a loss of Dollars 85.6m, or
Dollars 2.92 a share, on sales of Dollars 858m. That compares with a loss of
Dollars 52.1m, or Dollars 1.82, on sales of Dollars 923m in the same 1991
period.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW bout of transatlantic fare wars loomed yesterday as American Airlines,
one of the three largest US carriers, said it would match the fare cuts on
European routes initiated by its smaller rival, Continental Airlines, on
Monday.
Continental, which has been operating under bankruptcy court protection
since late 1990, announced that it was reducing fares for winter travel in
Europe by an average of 35 per cent.
The reduced-price tickets apply to travel between December 27 and March 30,
and must be purchased by December 31.
Continental's move cuts round trip fares from Dollars 498-Dollars 902, to
Dollars 358-Dollars 498. The cheaper tickets would be non-refundable.
American's response is significant because it is a bigger transatlantic
operator than Continental and is likely to spur similar reductions from
other big carriers.
This latest bout of price-cutting comes just as the US airline industry is
reporting dismal figures for the third quarter of 1992.

LOWER interest charges more than compensated for falling domestic tobacco
profits at RJR Nabisco in the third quarter of 1992, helping the large US
cigarette and food group to post after-tax profits of Dollars 182m, up from
Dollars 123m in the same period a year earlier.
At the operating level, RJR Nabisco - the subject of a Dollars 25bn
leveraged buy-out in 1989 - reported static results.
Operating profits in the three months to end-September were Dollars 763m,
compared with Dollars 762m in 1991, although total sales rose to Dollars
4.02bn from Dollars 3.76bn.
This reflected increased earnings from the international tobacco operations,
where profits rose to Dollars 159m from Dollars 135m, but a dip on the
domestic side, with profits slipping to Dollars 553m from Dollars 578m.
On the latter front, RJR said domestic sales volume was up by 6 per cent,
with growth in the discount sector more than offsetting the decline in
full-priced brands. However, in spite of the higher volumes and some price
rises, increased marketing expenditures produced the profit decline.
On the food side, sales rose by 6 per cent to Dollars 1.69bn, but operating
profits were little changed during the quarter at Dollars 232m compared with
Dollars 228m.
RJR said there had been strong sales growth in Latin America, but progress
in North America had been restrained by the weakness in consumer spending.
On the financial front, RJR Nabisco has continued the restructuring of its
balance sheet, and yesterday Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman, noted that Dollars
2.8bn of debt had been refinanced since the start of the year.
In the third quarter, RJR repurchased and retired Dollars 100m of
payment-in-kind debentures, plus another Dollars 412m of other debt
securities.
This helped cash and non-cash interest expenses to fall from Dollars 500m in
the third quarter of 1991, to Dollars 345m this time.
The latest figures mean that in the first nine months of the year, RJR has
reported after-tax profits of Dollars 254m, compared with Dollars 207m in
the same period of 1991.

ALLIED-SIGNAL, the US technology group undergoing a restructuring, yesterday
reported a 75 per cent increase in third-quarter net income, excluding a
large charge taken a year ago, led by much better results from its
automotive components business.
It reported net income of Dollars 140m, or 99 cents a share, compared with
Dollars 80m, or 58 cents a share, before a restructuring charge which turned
last year's net into a loss of Dollars 540m, or Dollars 3.94 a share.
Sales rose to Dollars 2.94bn from Dollars 2.87bn.
Mr Larry Bossidy, who set the shake-up going when he became chairman in
1991, said the company expected its full-year earnings to exceed the high
end of its previous forecast of Dollars 3.60 to Dollars 3.85 per share.
The third-quarter operating margin was 7.4 per cent, up from 5.1 per cent a
year ago, while productivity rose 5.9 per cent in the first nine months of
the year and return on equity was up from 9 per cent to 17 per cent.
The automotive business produced net income of Dollars 39m, up from Dollars
20m, thanks to 'strong sales and profits in the automotive aftermarket and
the North American light and heavy truck markets, as well as productivity
gains'.
Higher sales and profits for car and light truck brakes, filters and spark
plugs, turbochargers and heavy vehicle equipment were offset partially by
lower sales and increased losses in Brazil.
The aerospace business reported net income Dollars 3m higher at Dollars 55m,
which the company attributed mainly to productivity improvements, while
engineered materials saw profits rise to Dollars 55m from Dollars 37m
For the nine months the company reported net income of Dollars 412m, or
Dollars 2.93 a share, against Dollars 227m, or Dollars 1.67, last year,
excluding charges.

XEROX, the document processing group, yesterday reported an 11 per cent
increase in third-quarter net income and announced a Dollars 444m provision
for restructuring at Crum and Forster, its property/casualty insurance unit.
The provision was offset by the realisation of Dollars 444m in capital gains
at Crum and Forster, but the subsidiary warned it expected to take extra
provisions in the fourth quarter.
Xerox shares fell Dollars 2 1/4 to close at Dollars 76 as analysts expressed
disappointment over the results of its core copier business and concern as
to whether Crum and Forster's remaining unrealised capital gains would be
sufficient to cover any further provisions.
Xerox reported net income of Dollars 135m, or Dollars 1.18 a share, compared
to Dollars 121m, or Dollars 1.06, in the same period of last year, while
revenues rose to Dollars 4.5bn from Dollars 4.3bn. Analysts expectations had
centred on earning per share of about Dollars 1.29.
For the nine months, it produced net income 11 per cent higher at Dollars
402m, or Dollars 3.53 a share, compared to Dollars 363m, or Dollars 3.18.
Revenues were Dollars 13.1bn, against Dollars 12.9bn.
Mr Paul Allaire, chairman, said the company's new range of document
processing machines were 'meeting with excellent customer reception, despite
the weak economic environment in the US and deteriorating economies in
Europe, Japan and Brazil'.
Third-quarter income from the document processing side was 10 per cent ahead
at Dollars 128m, while revenues grew 9 per cent to Dollars 3.6bn. Excluding
currency effects, revenues grew 4 per cent.
Mr Stuart Ross, chairman of the financial services business, said a new
management team at Crum and Forster was looking at several alternatives for
restructuring its insurance operations and strengthening its financial
position.

FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: Paribas offers to repay
Italcementi FFr500m

PARIBAS, the French investment bank, has offered to repay FFr500m (Dollars
96.1m) of the FFr6bn it received for the sale of a controlling stake in
Ciments Francais to Italcementi, the Italian cement group.
The settlement, which would be shared with Mediobanca, the adviser to
Italcementi, follows the discovery by Italcementi of FFr1.05bn in
off-balance sheet financial dealings at Ciments Francais.
Italcementi did not formally accept the offer, but the two sides have been
working closely on terms for a settlement.
Ciments Francais yesterday disclosed the dealings had cost it FFr655m in
exceptional losses during the first six months of this year, triggering a
fall from net profits of FFr113m in the first half of 1991 to a net loss of
FFr740m in the same period of 1992.
Mr Bernard Laplace, who took over as chairman this month after the
resignation of Mr Pierre Conso, said the off-balance sheet dealings had
taken place, without the knowledge of Ciments Francais' board or auditors,
between January 1 1989 and September 30 this year.
He said the proceeds had been used to finance its expansion in Spain and
Portugal. However, the cost to the group in the first half was composed of
FFr251m in direct losses and FFr404m of financial costs.
Dealings in the shares of Guintoli, a construction company associated with
Ciments Francais, were responsible for between FFr250m and FFr350m of the
off-balance sheet transaction.
Paribas refused to comment on press speculation that it may make an offer
for Guintoli as part of an agreement with Italcementi and Mediobanca and
that it would take on part of Ciments Francais' off-balance sheet
liabilities.
As part of their agreement Paribas and Italcementi would each provide loans
of FFr300m to Ciments Francais to recapitalise the company which, even
before the disclosure of its exceptional losses, was suffering from the
depressed state of the European construction market. Without the exceptional
debit Ciments Francais would have made a loss of FFr85m in the first half of
this year on turnover which slipped from FFr7.97bn to FFr7.57bn.
It is not clear whether Paribas, which still owns 34 per cent of Ciments
Francais, will have to adjust its own first-half figures to allow for the
latter's unexpectedly heavy losses. Paribas' shares yesterday fell FFr12.5
to FFr330.5. The French bank had originally anticipated a profit of FFr800m
on the Ciments Francais deal.

FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: GBL seeks alternative BBL bid
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROUPE BRUXELLES Lambert (GBL), the Belgian holding company, is still
searching for an alternative solution to the likely Dutch bid for Banque
Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), the bank in which it has a 13 per cent stake.
GBL yesterday also announced that its consolidated profit for the first half
of 1992 had slipped from BFr6.01bn to BFr5.03bn (Dollars 158m). Excluding
capital gains and exceptional results, profit was almost static at
BFr2.98bn, compared with BFr2.91bn.
The holding company is at the centre of speculation over the future of BBL,
the accounts of which are being examined by Internationale Nederlanden Groep
(ING), a Dutch banking and insurance company which wants to make a full bid.
Some 24 per cent of BBL is directly or indirectly controlled by GBL, which
believes the proposed offer of BFr3,600 a share undervalues the bank. GBL
said yesterday that it did not want to predict now what its attitude might
be if a bid were launched.
The company said its results had been affected by several elements,
including the drop in profits at Petrofina, the Belgian oil company, in
which GBL has a 20 per cent stake, although this was compensated by profit
increases from other portfolio companies, most notably CLT, the
Luxembourg-based media group.
GBL warned against attempting to estimate the full-year performance from
half-year figures which are affected by the seasonal nature of some of the
portfolio revenue.

FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: SME shares suspended as rumours
spark rally

<TEXT>
SHARES in SME, the Italian foods, retailing and catering group controlled by
the IRI state holding company, were suspended yesterday after sharp
fluctuations in recent days on rumours it might be privatised.
The movements in SME's stock, which surged 5.8 per cent to L4,738 on Monday,
prompted Consob, Italy's companies and stock market watchdog, to demand a
suspension pending clarification within the day.
Yesterday evening, IRI, which owns 62 per cent of SME, denied the conclusion
of any negotiations on the sale of all or part of its stake, or on the
disposal of any SME subsidiaries.
In a separate letter to Consob, SME confirmed that negotiations on disposals
were limited to its sweets division. The activities concerned are already
run as joint ventures with private-sector companies. Following the
information, Consob said trading in SME's stock would resume today.
However, the denials are unlikely to deflate speculation about the group's
fate. SME, which made net profits of L42.8bn (Dollars 34m) on sales of
L2,961bn in the first half of this year, is one of Italy's most attractive
privatisation candidates.
The group controls GS, a leading supermarket chain, while its food
production division owns a number of familiar branded products, such as
Bertolli vegetable oils and Cirio tinned vegetables. SME's Italgel frozen
foods division has also been regularly courted by leading multinationals in
the sector.
Last weekend, Ferruzzi, the private sector agro-industrial group, entered
the fray following comments by Mr Carlo Sama, a senior executive, that it
would be interested in acquiring some of SME's brands. There have also been
rumours of a takeover, possibly engineered by Mr Raul Gardini, the former
Ferruzzi head.

FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Pressac checked by redundancy payments
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITHOUT redundancy payments and associated costs, Pressac Holdings, the
Nottingham-based volume manufacturer of automotive, telecommunications and
lighting components would have achieved an 11 per cent advance in
profitability.
However, exceptional items of Pounds 177,000 left pre-tax profits for the
year to July 31 1992 virtually unchanged at Pounds 1.84m compared with
Pounds 1.82m for the preceding year.
Mr Roger Boissier, chairman, said the group had reacted well to severe
market conditions which had been 'particularly appalling' in the UK.
The group had continued to improve productivity and had been successful in
gaining market share which would generate growth.
New products being launched this year included a range of RAST 5 connector
systems for the domestic appliance market and a range of insulation
displacement connectors and privacy adaptors for video telephones.
The balance sheet remained strong with year-end gearing at 24 per cent after
allowing for the continuing high level of capital investment in improved
manufacturing which absorbed Pounds 3.7m during the year.
Turnover declined from Pounds 34.5m to Pounds 33.7m with 41 per cent (42 per
cent) of sales exported. A final dividend of 1.65p maintains the total at
2.4p from earnings of 4.7p (5.8p) per share.

FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Greenalls gets swift nod on Pounds 86m
issue - A change in strategy for the Lancashire group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENALLS' Pounds 86m cash call has been given a quick nod of approval by
the City.
Analysts, after all, have had plenty of time to mull over the pros and cons
of a rights issue by the Lancashire-based pubs and hotels group.
The move was clearly signalled 10 months ago when the group reorganised its
two-tier share structure, ending 230 years of Greenall family control.
The restructuring - which left the family with a 16 per cent stake - marked
the end of the company's transition from regional brewer to national
retailer.
The 1989 report of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on the brewing
industry was the catalyst for Greenalls' switch in business strategy. With
the beer market in slow decline and increasingly dominated by national lager
brands, it became clear that the post-MMC environment would offer much
better growth prospects for the group as a pubs operator.
Its record as a brewer had been sound. Between 1970 and 1990, the group
achieved a real compound growth rate of 6 per cent a year in earnings per
share and 8 per cent a year in shareholders funds. Pre-tax profits rose from
Pounds 3m in 1970 to Pounds 62m in 1990.
But the management, including the founding family's Peter Greenall, now
managing director, decided that resources should be focused on its retail
estate in which it believed it had a sustainable competitive edge.
History was swiftly consigned to the dustbin. The breweries at Warrington
and Nottingham were closed in 1990. Closure costs of Pounds 48m were
partially offset by the Pounds 26m sale of Greenalls' share in Vladivar
vodka - the 'wodka from Warrington.'
The breweries had been operating 40 per cent below capacity. A brewing
contract with Allied-Lyons enabled Greenalls to get its beer brands supplied
more cheaply while shopping around for a selection of best-selling lagers
and bitters.
A restructured group focused on four business areas: its estate of 1,400
pubs; 110 Premier House inns providing branded food and accommodation; De
Vere hotels, including the Belfry, venue for golf's Ryder Cup; and drinks
and leisure services which encompassed the biggest off-licence chain in the
north of England.
Reform of the share structure earlier this year was the signal for a prudent
and pragmatic expansion along the entire front.
Easier access to the market for development finance was a necessity for the
business.
Mr Andrew Thomas, chairman and chief executive, said at the time: 'It is
important that the company has maximum flexibility in terms of access to
financial markets in order to respond rapidly to opportunities for investing
in existing business areas as they arise.'
The deepening recession, according to Mr Thomas, is now creating
opportunities 'to acquire quality assets at low prices on which we believe
we can earn attractive rates of return.'
The City had expected the rights issue to be linked to a specific
acquisition. But Mr David Thompson, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, says: 'We
think this new emphasis - on piecemeal add-on acquisitions - is less risky.
It stresses the intention to ensure an adequate return on investment, to be
choosy, and not to commit large sums of money in one throw.'
Greenalls' balance sheet will be bolstered by the Pounds 86m it will raise
from issuing nearly 30m shares at the discounted price of 295p. Gearing will
fall from 27.5 per cent to 14.5 per cent, with interest cover rising to 6.
The cash inflow will neatly match the amount spent during the past year on
investments in group operations; investments which set the cautious tone of
its expansion during a time of difficult trading and flat profits.
About Pounds 30m has been spent on upgrading the group's 1,400 pubs which
last year contributed Pounds 44.8m, 60 per cent of total operating profits.
Forty pubs at the tail end of the estate were sold for Pounds 6m; and 39
hand-picked outlets in the northern home counties were acquired for Pounds
10m from Allied-Lyons.
Spending on the group's catering inns, which reported operating profits last
year of Pounds 6.4m, amounted to Pounds 16m. By adding facilities such as
restaurants, children's play areas and budget accommodation, the company
claims it can increase the return on investment by 6 percentage points.
Greenalls' expanded its off-licence chain during the year to 500 outlets -
the fourth largest in the country - with the Pounds 20m acquisition of 187
Blayneys stores from Vaux.
De Vere hotels picked up a bargain earlier this month when it bought the
Belton Woods hotel and golf complex at Grantham from the receiver for Pounds
10.3m - about half its development cost.
A new hotel was opened at Swindon this year and two more will be built in
the next two years. But its US hotels lost Pounds 665,000 last year, and
will be sold as soon as possible.
Of all Greenalls' ambitions, it is its aim to turn De Vere into one of the
country's leading luxury hotel chains that raises most quizzical eyebrows.

FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Cost cutting gains at British Syphon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH SYPHON Industries, the industrial group which is 70 per cent owned
by management following an attempt to take the company private in 1989,
yesterday announced an 11 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds
2.71m to Pounds 3.02m, for the six months to June 30.
The result was struck on sales down 14 per cent at Pounds 19.7m. Mr Bryan
Morrall, chairman, said the gains had been made through cost cutting and
tighter working capital. Operating profits rose 13 per cent to Pounds 1.5m.
The group, which has cash deposits of Pounds 30m, also stressed its
determination to seek a suitable acquisition at the earliest opportunity. It
is likely to pay for a purchase with shares and would use the cash to pay
off a target's debt.
Any paper deal would dilute both the management and Mr Nathu Ram Puri who,
with his private conglomerate Melton Medes, controls 25 per cent of British
Syphon. Mr Puri's stake barred management from taking the group private in
1989.
Mr Morrall said an acquisition would be in the interests of all
shareholders. A paper deal would create a market for the shares and, in
effect, return the company to the public arena.
British Syphon has been actively looking for an acquisition in the
manufacturing sector. It was reported to have been the suitor for Mosaic
early this summer, before withdrawing at the last minute. During the first
half, it took a Pounds 400,000 extraordinary charge for the costs of an
aborted acquisition.
Mr Morrall said the ideal target would roughly double British Syphon's
market capitalisation of Pounds 30m at last night's share price of 88p.
The group is to pay an interim dividend of 2p; it only returned to the
dividend list after four years, with a payment of 3p, in December. Mr
Morrall said part of the reason for resuming dividends was to increase the
attraction of an all-paper offer.
Earnings per share were 11 per cent ahead at 5.9p (5.3p).

<TEXT>
PEREGRINE Investments, which yesterday increased its stake in Invesco MIM,
the UK fund management group, has rapidly emerged as one of the leading
financial powerhouses in Hong Kong since it was founded in 1988.
Helped by its strong connections with the colony's leading businessmen,
including founding shareholder Mr Li Ka-shing, the colony's richest man, the
firm has grown to a market capitalisation of Dollars HK5.6bn, compared with
its start-up capital of Dollars HK300m.
It has focused on stockbroking, corporate finance and direct investment
activities.
'The investment in Invesco MIM is a logical extention of our business', said
Mr Francis Leung, managing director.
It had long been rumoured that Peregrine would set up its own fund
management operation, but Mr Leung said: 'It would be too difficult to be a
late entrant in that market.'
Mr Leung said it was a strategic stake.
Peregrine has held discussions with Invesco MIM about expanding sales and
finding investment opportunities in south east Asia. Peregrine has offices
in Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Seoul and Singapore, although the bulk of
its earnings continue to flow in from the colony.
The company was set up primarily by Mr Philip Tose and Mr Leung, two senior
executives from Citicorp Vickers, who obtained financial backing from a
client list that reads like a Who's Who of corporate Hong Kong.
Its backers include Hopewell Holdings, Great Eagle, Citic Hong Kong - the
local arm of the Beijing-controlled corporation - and Yue Xiu Enterprises,
another influential Chinese corporation.
Peregrine has profited substantially from these connections.
This year, it was lead underwriter for placements by Hopewell and Mr Li's
conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa.
It has also developed a reputation for providing easy access to Hong Kong's
deal-makers.
A sell note on Hutchison earlier this year led to a diving share price,
despite the company's assertions that its Chinese Walls remained intact.

Unsecured creditors of Parkfield, the entertainment and engineering group

Dividend cheques were being sent out from Monday. Further dividends would be
determined by the level of final agreement of claims, but the total target
for creditors remained at 30p in the pound.

Siddons directors also said that in view of the uncertain future of the

FT  28 OCT 92 / Breeden opposes Iosco capital standard: SEC chairman
condemns proposal as 'imprudent' - Chance of agreement recedes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE likelihood of agreement being reached on an international standard for
the capital to be held by securities firms and banks receded sharply
yesterday, when Mr Richard Breeden, chairman of the US Securities and
Exchange Commission, said he was implacably opposed to the current proposal.
Mr Breeden said the proposal - which is supported by the Securities and
Investments Board of the UK - was 'imprudent in the extreme' and it would be
better if agreement was 'never reached' than to accept the proposals.
Mr Breeden is chairman of the technical committee of the International
Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco), whose annual meeting is
taking place in London. There is an emergency meeting of the technical
committee this morning.
Mr Breeden said the SEC had tested the proposals to see what would have
happened if they had been in force during Black Monday in October 1987, when
share prices fell more than 22 per cent. 'Several big securities firms would
have collapsed,' he warned.
The Iosco proposals have already been enshrined in a European Community
capital adequacy directive (or CAD), to be followed by all EC-based
securities firms. 'The levels of capital under the CAD are highly unsafe,'
he said. 'I am not sure the public understands that.'
The dispute between the SIB and the SEC hinges on the extent to which a
securities firm should be able to reduce the capital it carries, to cover
the risk of losses on a portfolio of equities, by hedging that portfolio.
Mr Breeden also pointed to a second reason why an international standard was
unlikely to be agreed. Any standard would be applied by Iosco members and
the bank regulators grouped in the Basle Committee on Bank Supervision.
Mr Breeden said Iosco members were united in opposition to the Basle
committee's position on the capital to be applied to holdings of bonds and
debt securities, as opposed to equities.
Under the Basle proposals, banks' holdings of bonds for investment purposes
 -as opposed to their trading books - would be excluded from any capital
requirement, but Iosco opposes this distinction and says that capital should
be required for all bond holdings.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Blenheim rises 31% on French growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLENHEIM Group, the fast-growing organiser of exhibitions, yesterday
announced higher-than-expected profits helped by growth in France, its most
important market.
Blenheim reported a 31.8 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds
28.3m to Pounds 37.3m in the 12 months to August 31. The company is changing
its year-end and will report final results for the 16 months to 31 December.
Analysts expected profits of Pounds 34m and the shares added 13p to 533p. Mr
Neville Buch, chairman, said the results were 'very positive' given troubles
elsewhere in the media and advertising sectors.
Turnover increased 25.5 per cent to Pounds 153.3m, helped by a Pounds 13.5m
contribution from the bi-annual Batimat building supply exhibition, held in
France last November.
The proportion of operating profits from France almost doubled to 53 per
cent, or Pounds 24.6m. This was due to the timing of occasional events like
Batimat, which make geographical and timing comparisons unreliable.
Profits in the UK fell 7.2 per cent to Pounds 7.7m as recession affected the
company's smaller shows and housing-related exhibitions. US profits fell 13
per cent to Pounds 12.7m, although Mr Buch said the market was resilient,
and re-bookings by exhibitors stood at 85 per cent.
Exhibition space sold in the 12 months rose 12.1 per cent to just over 1m
square metres. But there were some signs Blenheim's growth may be slowing.
After announcing interim profits ahead 51 per cent to Pounds 27.8m, profits
in the second six months fell to Pounds 9.5m, almost unchanged on the
comparable period.
Net borrowings increased from Pounds 23.8m to Pounds 39.6m due to
acquisitions. Interest costs increased 25 per cent to Pounds 6m. But
interest cover improved to more than seven times, thanks to the rise in
operating profits.
Because most of the company's assets are intangible, and not included on the
balance sheet, Blenheim has negative shareholders' funds of Pounds 100.6m.
If intangibles are included, gearing increased slightly to 17 per cent.
Earnings per share increased 15.4 per cent to 27.8p. The company is
proposing a second interim dividend of 6.3p to make a total of 9p, a 14.9
per cent increase.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Market takes aim at the Old Lady: Criticisms of the Bank of
England's way of providing cash to the sterling money market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are tough times for the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street. The Bank of
England has been sharply criticised by politicians and the press for its
handling of the sterling crisis and the BCCI affair. Now, a growing chorus
of complaint can be heard about another area of the Bank's activity: the
method by which it provides cash to the sterling money market.
The provision of cash to the banking system is one of the Bank's most
important roles. The daily injection of sterling into the money market
ensures commercial banks have adequate liquidity for their operations. The
rate at which the Bank sells cash also sets the level of base rates
throughout the banking system.
But, in recent weeks, money market dealers have criticised the Bank's method
of providing liquidity as antiquated and unsophisticated.
Two specific complaints are voiced. First, that the Bank was unable to check
the heavy selling of its currency during the recent foreign exchange turmoil
by raising money market rates. Secondly, that it has been unable to stop
short-term money market rates rising as high as 100 per cent since
sterling's devaluation on Black Wednesday, September 16, forcing some banks
to pay a very high premium to borrow money.
'The Bank's money market operations are creaking at the seams,' says Mr Mark
Brett, an economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London. 'And a lot of
people say that the system needs to be changed.'
The first charge against the Bank focuses on its inability to defend
sterling in the run-up to 'Black Wednesday'.
Critics say that the Bank of England's operations did not enable it to
defend the currency with the same credibility that was enjoyed by the Bank
of France.
In the face of huge selling of the French franc, the Bank of France avoided
raising the key 'intervention rate', through which some 90 per cent of bank
refinancing is done.
Instead, it raised rates in the 5-10 day lending window, through which a
small proportion of the banking sector is funded, by 1.5 percentage points.
This convinced speculators that the Bank was determined to tighten policy
and defend the currency without passing the costs of higher rates on to
corporates and the private sector. However, the Bank of England did not
enjoy the same flexibility. Its only means of scaring speculators was a vain
attempt to raise interest rates on short-dated bills, instantly putting up
base rates. This was ineffective.
'The rise in base rates to 15 per cent on Black Wednesday had no credibility
with foreign exchange dealers because it dealt a devastating blow to
corporates and the household sector,' says Mr John Shepperd, an economist at
SG Warburg securities. 'Effectively, the Bank has a single sledge-hammer
with which to crack every nut.'
That inflexibility is now being blamed for a problem that has surfaced since
Black Wednesday: the sharp fluctuation in short-term sterling rates, making
the market an uncertain environment for traders.
The rate for overnight lending in the interbank market has ranged between 10
per cent and 100 per cent since last Friday. This is due to the large
shortage of cash in the system following the Bank's purchases of sterling on
the foreign exchanges last month, estimated at Pounds 15bn.
According to one money market dealer, the volatility in rates is undermining
overseas confidence in London as a financial centre. 'Why should any
overseas investor wish to trade in sterling when he has no idea what rate he
will pay to borrow it on any given day?' he said.
Critics say the Bank cannot bring rates down because it is hindered by two
faults in the system:
The discount houses, which are specialist banks acting as intermediaries
between the monetary authorities and the banking system, say the shortages
are aggravated because the Bank has allowed their traditional role as
providers of liquidity to be eroded.
Up to the end of the 1980s, most commercial banks had to deposit 6 per cent
of their stock of bills with discount houses in the form of a subscription
fee known as 'club money'.
Clearing banks are now being allowed to ignore that rule and are building up
large stocks of these bills, leaving less liquidity among commercial banks
and building societies. The discount houses believe the Bank should
reinforce the club money rule.
The Bank is unable to inject short-term funds into the market because this
would be interpreted by dealers as signalling a base-rate cut. In recent
months, the Bundesbank has successfully controlled money-market rates by
injecting or draining short-term funds from the system, while leaving its
officially posted rates unchanged.
The Bank of England cannot do the same because it controls money market
rates and base rates via the same operations. In the current political
climate, dealers are expecting base rate to be cut to 6 per cent at any
time, and the Bank cannot inject funds to bring down money market rates
without signalling a base rate cut as well.
The Bank of England is standing firmly by its system. It acknowledged
yesterday that the French have a wider variety of instruments with which to
set rates than the British.
But a Bank official argued that the Bank of France avoided passing the costs
of higher lending rates on to the private sector because of its huge
shareholding in the French banks, putting pressure on bank chiefs not to
raise base rates. 'Their market is less perfect,' he said.
The official also argued that overnight rates were high in spite of its
preparedness to offer cash to the market to meet the shortage. Dealers are
not prepared to sell bills to the Bank at current rates, thinking there will
be a base rate cut. 'The overnight rate has been up at high levels because
the market has been in a fever pitch about a base rate cut that never came,'
he said.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Japanese electronics groups in fresh cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S big electronics companies - including Matsushita Electric
Industrial, Mitsubishi Electric, Toshiba, NEC, Fujitsu, and Hitachi -
yesterday cut capital spending plans further after reporting dismal interim
results in the half year to September, with declines in parent-company
pre-tax profits between 39 per cent and 87 per cent.
On a consolidated basis, Fujitsu, the world's second biggest computer
company, slipped into the red, posting a pre-tax loss of Y7.5bn (Pounds
37.87m), and a net after-tax loss of Y19.2bn, the first net loss in its
history.
The decline reflects the sharp slowdown of consumer spending in Japan, cuts
to capital investment, manufacturing overcapacity which has led to intense
price competition, and appreciation of the yen.
Profits have also been undermined by heavy capital spending, which ended
last year. Electronics companies are now having to make depreciation charges
to pay for new manufacturing facilities.
All the companies announced further cuts to current year capital spending
yesterday, with the exception of Toshiba, which announced cuts earlier.
Benefits of reduced spending will begin showing in the accounts next year,
although they are likely to chill the economy further.
Some companies have successfully cut costs, reduced overtime, and ended
lines of slow-selling products. Matsushita said it would cut directors
salaries by 10 per cent.
The companies were pessimistic about prospects for recovery in the second
half.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Hong Kong firm lifts stake in Invesco MIM to 14.9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PEREGRINE Investments, the aggressive Hong Kong securities house backed by
Mr Li Ka-shing, the colony's richest man, has taken a 14.9 per cent stake in
Invesco MIM, the UK fund management group.
It purchased 4.4 per cent of Invesco MIM earlier this year, and on Monday
acquired a further 10.5 per cent for Pounds 19.7m.
Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that most of the shares came from portfolios
managed by Invesco MIM itself. Some 18m shares in discretionary client
portfolios managed by Invesco MIM were sold through brokers Smith New Court
yesterday at 77p per share when the market price was 70p. However, Invesco
was apparently unaware of the identity of the purchaser when it agreed the
sale.
Invesco was approached directly because its US-based chairman, Mr Charles
Brady, had earlier made it known he wished to sell the Invesco shares
purchased under his predecessor Lord Stevens' tenure for discretionary
client accounts. As of the end of last year, clients owned 7.9 per cent of
the company, a practice which earned it much criticism from analysts.
Invesco, whose share price has been hard-hit by mismanagement within its UK
operations, yesterday declined to comment officially on the stake. Senior
management is said to be inquiring into whether the stake was purchased as a
corporate investment or on behalf of Peregrine's own fund management
clients.
Mr Frances Leung, Peregrine's managing diretor, said Peregrine was not
considering a bid for Invesco MIM, but would not rule out further share
purchases.
Analysts discounted the possibility of a hostile bid for Invesco, noting
that to do so would undermine its client relationships. 'Under US Erisa
(pension fund) laws, clients must agree to a change of ownership of their
fund manager,' said Mr Phillip Gibbs, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
However, Invesco had mismanaged its balance sheet, and the slide in its
share price has made them cheap given the fee income generated by the Pounds
30bn of funds it manages worldwide.
However, senior executives at Invesco privately doubt the share purchase
merely reflects Peregrine's desire for joint enterprises.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Bush hopes buoyed by US growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush drew solace yesterday from official figures indicating
the US economy grew at an annual rate of 2.7 per cent in the third quarter,
a more robust performance than expected, writes Michael Prowse in
Washington.
Mr Bush hailed the figures as 'encouraging for the American people'. It was
the 'sixth straight quarter' of growth following a contraction in the winter
and spring of last year.
The figures were the best economic news in months for Mr Bush, but may be
too late to alter the pessimism over jobs and living standards that has
played into the hands of Governor Bill Clinton, Democratic frontrunner.
Financial markets shrugged off the figures in the belief that they gave an
exaggerated impression of the economy's underlying strength. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average closed down 8.38 at 3,235.73. Bond prices rose, mainly in
reaction to a report indicating that consumer confidence fell again this
month.
Analysts said the growth figures reflected an unsustainable pace of consumer
spending, which grew at an annual rate of 3.4 per cent against a 0.1 per
cent fall in the previous quarter. The turnaround partly reflected a sharp
fall in the personal savings rate to 4.5 per cent.
Doubts about personal spending grew after a report showed the fourth
consecutive monthly decline in consumer confidence.
The Conference Board, a New York business analysis group, said its
confidence index fell four points to 53.0, its lowest reading since February
and about half the level in a healthy recovery.
The increase in gross domestic product was sufficient to raise output above
the previous peak reached in the autumn of 1990, prompting some economists
to claim that a 'real' recovery was at last under way. Most forecasters had
expected growth of about 1.5 per cent at an annual rate.
Growth was spurred by strong business equipment investment, which grew at an
annual rate of 8.5 per cent, higher defence spending, and a rebuilding of
corporate inventories.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Heseltine backs move to boost coal sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT would be prepared to seek changes in the law if this could
increase the market for coal in the UK, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary, said last night.
He told a select committee of backbench MPs that he had tried to intervene
in negotiations about the future of British Coal, which had threatened to
close 31 pits. But he had received legal advice that this would not be
possible.
Last month, he said, he had considered getting British Coal, the electricity
generators and distribution companies 'into one room' to thrash out a new
set of long-term coal supply contracts. But he was advised on September 7
that he did not have the legal authority to interfere in the privatised
electricity industry.
'I don't have the power to make the electricity industry buy coal,' he told
the committee on trade and industry, which was holding the opening session
of its inquiry into the future of the coal industry.
As Mr Heseltine appeared before the committee, the European Commission
offered to give evidence to a Commons select committee and urged a
suspension of the shutdown programme pending a full inquiry.
The offer to go to Westminster to outline the economic impact on the
Community of the government plans was made by Mr Antonio Cardoso de Cunha,
EC energy commissioner, at a meeting in Strasbourg with members of the
Association of Colliery Managers.
In separate talks with Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union
of Mineworkers, the commissioner endorsed the idea of an independent inquiry
into the closures.
Mr Scargill said: 'In answer to my questions the commissioner said he
believed that there should be an inquiry to examine all aspects of energy
policy and all claims by all sides.
'He said that until such an inquiry had been held all 31 pits should remain
open and no miners should be made redundant.'
At the select committee, Conservative and opposition MPs criticised Mr
Heseltine for the abruptness of the decision to reduce the UK coal industry,
and sought assurances that threatened pits would be kept open during the
three-month inquiry.
Mr Heseltine said news of closures should not have come as a shock because
they had been widely anticipated. However, the timing of the announcement,
on October 13, had been dictated by widespread leaks, he said.
Although details of the redundancy terms to be paid to miners had been
agreed on October 2, the decision to announce the closures was only taken on
October 11, two days before.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Bundesbank policies under fire: Top economic institutes urge
rapid interest rate cut to reverse downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S five leading economic research institutes yesterday questioned the
very foundation of the Bundesbank's tight monetary policy and urged a rapid
relaxation in interest rates to reverse the current economic downturn.
They also warned that the German government and federal states would fail to
reduce the overall public sector deficit next year and called for severe
restraint in unions' wage demands to keep them below the current rate of
inflation.
In one of their most critical economic reports of recent times, the
institutes warned that growth next year was likely to slow to 0.5 per cent,
from a 1.5 per cent forecast increase in gross domestic product in 1992.
Even that gloomy forecast is based on the assumption that the Bundesbank
will set a higher target for the growth of money supply, and that interest
rates will decline - steadily in the long-term capital markets, and sharply
in the short-term money markets.
The key element in the institutes' autumn report is a critique of the
central bank's reliance on the M3 measure of money supply, which includes
short-term deposits as well as current accounts and cash in circulation.
They say that, in fixing its money supply target, the bank has failed to
make sufficient allowance for the increase in state-controlled prices in
east Germany necessary to bring them up to west German levels.
'The importance of all those additional transactions arising from the
increase in administered prices, such as rents and heating costs, was
under-estimated,' they say.
'Monetary policy must make available additional money supply to correspond
with growth in the nominal volume of transactions.'
They also say that, because of additional distortions, including the
abnormal attraction of short-term deposits (because short-term interest
rates are higher than long-term rates), the restricted M1 measure would be a
better guide to monetary policy.
The arguments were partially accepted yesterday by Mr Otmar Issing, the
Bundesbank's director responsible for economic research. He said the bank's
own investigations had shown 'some distortions' in M3 in recent months. But
he insisted the excess growth was only 'partly tolerable' and rejected using
M1 rather than M3 as a guideline.
Dr Heiner Flassbeck, of the DIW institute in Berlin, also warned against a
protracted debate on tax rises. He said a rapid decision on tax reform was
needed, to ensure a fairer distribution of the burden of German unification
costs and provide an incentive for trade unions to restrain wage rises.
Mr Kohl's initiative was also sharply criticised by the BDI, the German
industry federation, which said: 'Announcing future tax increases without
enacting the necessary cuts in public spending further endangers the frail
German economy.'
The institutes' report forecasts an increase in the overall public sector
deficit from DM95.5bn (Pounds 39bn) this year to DM100bn in 1993. As for
transfers to support the east German economy, it suggests they will reach
DM163bn this year, and DM161bn in 1993, compared with DM132bn in 1991.

FT  28 OCT 92 / US economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is less to third-quarter US growth figures than meets the eye. The 2.6
per cent annual growth rate is arresting, but there are few reasons to
suppose that the US economy is about to take off. A healthy increase in
consumer spending during the quarter was paid for out of savings rather than
increased earnings. The markets also take a jaundiced view of trade
statistics in the week before the presidential election. On balance, the
current growth estimate is more likely to be revised down than up.
By the time that happens, the figures may seem like ancient history. If Bill
Clinton wins next week, attention will be focused on what kind of fiscal
measures he will use to stimulate the economy, and what the Federal
Reserve's response will be. Even if Mr Clinton decides on a substantial
package, though, it will be the second half of 1993 before it has much
impact. Given renewed economic weakness, the Fed may decide it cannot wait
that long.

FT  28 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Grand Metropolitan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One could conclude that the interest of GrandMet subsidiary IDV in Gonzalez
Byass is a sign that the big drinks companies are scraping the barrel for
exciting brands. The UK sherry market, after all, has been in decline for
several years, and the scope for converting far-flung tipplers on IDV's
international distribution network to even a good name such as Tio Pepe must
surely be limited.
It would be wrong, however, to exaggerate the extent to which the worldwide
drinks industry has already concentrated. Of the top 100 global spirits
brands, for example, only 39 are owned by the Big Four (GrandMet, Guinness,
Allied Lyons and Seagram). Their collective reach is rather less in the five
main European markets. On the face of it, therefore, investors can expect
more deals as small- to medium-sized family proprietors feel the squeeze of
a protracted recession.
If the Cinzano model is followed, GrandMet might buy an initial minority
stake with a view to ultimate control. It would not do to overpay for GB's
largest selling Spanish brandy, though. The locals look to be turning in
growing numbers to GrandMet's J &amp; B whisky brand.

FT  28 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Blenheim Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While most empire builders in the media sector have long since collapsed
under the combined weight of debt and recession, Blenheim still wears its
imperial crown. Yesterday's 32 per cent increase in pre-tax profits was
ahead of even the City's best expectations. Borrowing remains moderate and
cash flow is positive, thanks to the enviable practice of taking clients'
money up to a year in advance. If only advertising agencies enjoyed such
favourable terms of trade.
But while expenditure on exhibitions is holding up better than advertising
or public relations, Blenheim looks far from recession-proof. Profits in the
UK have been flat for three years. With the French and German economies
poised to take a steep downward lurch, Blenheim will have to muster all its
management skills if the giddy rate of earnings growth is to be maintained.
True, its continental European exhibitions tend to be market-leaders rather
than the hodge-podge of smaller events in the UK. Even a small fall in
revenue from exhibitors, though, will make a serious dent in margins.
Overheads were cut again this year, but there is now little fat left on the
corporate body.
With cash and contracts already in the bag for next year, growth looks
secure in the near term. What happens in 1994 and after is less certain. The
market may take some comfort from the fact that the chairman and other
directors retain a substantial stake in the business. Even so, a prospective
price earnings ratio of 15 times next year's forecast earnings leaves plenty
of scope for disappointment.

FT  28 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Deflated expectations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If there is a bright spot in the CBI's latest industrial trends survey it
must be the inflation outlook for the UK. Unit costs actually fell for the
first time since the survey started 34 years ago, and, in spite of
devaluation, more companies expect to cut prices than raise them over the
coming quarter. Of course, that just emphasises how depressed the economy
is; it would be wrong to assume that the increase in import costs will never
feed through into domestic price rises. After a further dip, underlying
inflation will probably be heading back up in the second half of next year.
Companies are also taking heart from the export opportunities offered by
sterling's fall. But given that the economic prospects for continental
Europe continue to worsen, those hopes may be short-lived. That is
unfortunate, because companies' investment intentions offer little hope of
growth. Companies are embarking on another round of retrenchment, cutting
both capital expenditure and labour forces. That leaves the poor consumer,
who is as unlikely as ever to go on a spending spree as the threat of
unemployment intensifies. It will take more than piecemeal interest rate
cuts and jiggery-pokery with the funding rule at the Mansion House speech to
get things moving.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Depression is in the mind: Governments must maintain
financial stability and open markets to achieve recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'It still seems probable that we should be able to prevent serious
depressions by preventing the inflations which regularly precede them, but
there is little we can do to cure them, once they have set in. The time to
worry about depressions is, unfortunately, when they are furthest from the
minds of most people' - Friedrich Hayek, The Monetary Framework, The
Constitution of Liberty
If Hayek was right, the world economy is already doomed. For an inflationary
reduction in the purchasing power of money has been a feature of the world
economy since the second world war, while a depression is certainly not far
from the minds of people today. On the contrary, many people write as if a
global depression were a fact, not just a fear.
The dangers were well described by the American economist, Irving Fisher in
his analysis of debt deflation in the 1930s*. Over-indebtedness and asset
price deflation can lead to debt liquidation, to the collapse of banks and
the decline in bank deposits, to a fall in prices and to a rise in real
rates of interest. If a fixed exchange rate system and an outbreak of global
protectionism is added to the list, deflation can readily become global.
Yet it is not at all obvious why a global depression should happen and quite
clear that nothing like one has happened yet. The gross domestic product of
the industrial countries as a group continues to rise every year. There is
no resemblance between this and the Great Depression: between 1929 and 1933
US real gross national product fell by 30 per cent, while German GDP
declined by 24 per cent between 1929 and 1932. Contemporary examples of
comparable collapses are not to be found among the industrial countries, but
in eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union.
Helped by the decision to break the fixed link between sterling and gold in
1931, UK GDP fell by only 5 per cent between 1929 and 1931 and was back
above 1929 levels by 1934. Thus the performance of the UK economy during the
present recession does merit comparison with that during the Great
Depression. But there is an important difference: with a decline in GDP of 4
per cent between the second quarters of 1990 and 1992, the UK has suffered
far more than any other leading economy this time. In the Great Depression,
by contrast, it suffered less than others.
What this is not, therefore, or at least not yet, is a global depression, by
which is meant a prolonged period of worldwide economic decline, with
falling prices and collapsing trade. Between 1930 and 1932, for example,
world trade in manufactures fell by 40 per cent. This time trade continues
to grow.
At the same time, the current recession is different from others since the
second world war. As a consequence - argues Alan Greenspan, the chairman of
the US Federal Reserve - recovery is also likely to be particularly slow.
This slowdown, so far most evident in the Anglo-Saxon economies, has been
both unexpected and consistently underestimated. At the end of 1989, for
example, the OECD forecast fairly steady growth for US and the UK (see
charts).
It is true that most economic slowdowns are unexpected. But the last two -
the oil-shock related recessions of 1973-76 and 1979-83 - were unexpected
for a rather good reason. The combination of a sudden sharp deterioration in
the terms of trade with a desire to lower rates of inflation in the
industrial countries, which reached 14 per cent in 1974 and 11 per cent in
1980, explained both the recession and the surprise. But this time there has
been an unexpected recession without a similar global surprise.
The exception that seems to prove the rule has been Europe, where German
unification has been one explanation for recent mediocre performance. It was
partly an accident of history, but also a mistake by the politicians that
made this the moment when the exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System was treated as a modern-day gold standard.
The rest is already history: a short-lived economic spurt in Germany; a
boost to demand in the rest of Europe from the disappearance of the German
external surplus, more than offset by the recessionary effects of the rise
in German interest rates; slower growth in Europe; and, finally, the exit of
the lira and sterling from the ERM and the devaluation of the Spanish
peseta.
German unification is not the only unexpected political event to affect
current economic performance. The peace dividend, also caused by the end of
the cold war, has important effects on the US. California, now expected to
reject Mr Bush in the presidential election, is the most significant victim
of defence cuts.
Yet the story in the US, Japan, the UK, Canada, Australia and Scandinavia,
economies that together account for two-thirds of the total output of the
industrial countries, is rather different. It is one of asset price
inflation followed by debt-deflation. In the 1980s, private citizens - from
the humblest house buyer in Surbiton to Mr Paul Reichmann - chose to bet on
inflation, something that the financial liberalisation of the 1980s made too
easy and over-ambition or perhaps simple greed made too attractive.
According to the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook****, the ratio of total
private non-financial sector debt to GDP rose from below 0.8 to above 1.6 in
the UK, from above 1 to above 1.4 in the US and from 1.3 to 2.2 in Japan
between 1980 and 1991. Prices of residential property, deflated by consumer
prices, rose by some 200 per cent in Japan between 1980 and 1991, by roughly
three-quarters in the UK between 1980 and 1989 and by some 30 per cent in
the US. Thereupon they plunged, with serious consequences both for debtors
and financial intermediaries. The latter is not surprising: in the US 42 per
cent of all outstanding bank loans was against property in 1991, while in
the UK the proportion was 31 per cent.
Provided the financial system does not collapse, depositors should feel
little worse off as a result of asset price falls. But substantial net
borrowers will. In the UK, for example, the ratio of mortgage debt to the
value of the housing stock rose by almost 10 percentage points, to nearly 33
per cent, between 1988 and early 1992. As net worth declines, people try to
save more. As the desire to save rises, economies decline, further
undermining debt-servicing capacity.
In the 1980s, real rates of interest - interest rates deflated by the prices
of goods and services - were high, above the long-term rates of growth in
most industrial countries. But to purchasers of assets, things looked
different. Since asset prices rose far faster than the prices of goods and
services in general, borrowing seemed a painless way of becoming rich. But
the prices of goods and services, on the one hand, and of assets, on the
other, cannot diverge indefinitely. Ultimately, the relative prices of
assets must fall.
If this is the main problem, what is the prognosis and what, if any, are the
solutions?
The Federal Reserve believes that the past two years have taken the US
economy only about half way through the necessary balance sheet adjustment,
following seven reductions in its benchmark rate of interest, the discount
rate, taking it from 7 to 3 per cent. Some financial economists are gloomier
still. By those standards, Japan has hardly begun its adjustment and the UK
has also far to go, particularly in the personal sector.
Low short-term rates of interest are simply a necessary condition for
balance sheet adjustment. But they are not a sufficient condition for a
strong recovery. Recovery demands a return to borrowing, precisely what
debt-encumbered businesses and individuals will refuse.
What could be more attractive to those responsible for debt-laden economies
than another bout of inflation? If debt-to-GDP ratios are double what
debtors desire, why not double nominal GDP? Only too aware of this danger,
Hayek also wrote that 'the harmful effects of even small doses of inflation
can be staved off only by larger doses of inflation'.
One objection to a policy of default through inflation is that an
uncontrollable flight from the currency would be certain. High inflation is
also a recipe for civil strife and economic inefficiency. Moreover, this was
precisely the policy tried in the 1970s, with disastrous consequences for
the borrowing behaviour of the private sector in the 1980s.
The legacy of past inflation also explains why the other obvious remedy for
the pains of debt adjustment, a fiscal boost, is likely to prove
ineffective. A large government sector is a bulwark against an economic
collapse. But further government borrowing is no sure route to recovery.
Knowing as they do the temptation to inflation inevitable in a highly
indebted economy, investors demand high interest rates as the price for
taking on more long-term debt. Unless a fiscal boost can be believably
limited in duration, the resulting increase in long-term interest rates
would tend to nullify the benefits of a more active fiscal policy.
Far better than the scatter gun of inflation would be a conscious decision
by government to substitute its own liabilities for a part of the
outstanding private debt, but rather to shore up an enfeebled financial
system than to protect borrowers from the consequences of their errors. Debt
nationalisation has already occurred in the US in the case of the savings
and loans institutions, as well as in the case of Scandinavian banks. Nobody
can be sure that it will not happen, to some extent, in the UK and Japan as
well.
Not allowing the financial system to collapse is essential if asset price
declines are not to create a depression. Governments must also keep
short-term interest rates low enough to permit balance sheet adjustment.
Equally important, however, is international co-operation, particularly over
trade. An outbreak of protection, following a collapse in the Uruguay Round
of multilateral trade negotiations, would be almost the worst possible
mistake.
Governments must ensure the health of their financial systems and the
openness of their economies. Recovery will follow in time, if not as soon as
many hope. The worst mistake of all would be to panic. This is not yet a
re-run of the Great Depression. Provided governments keep their heads, it
should not become one either.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Leading Article: No time off for America
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US presidential election campaign has been dominated by a single
question. Who can do most to revive the domestic economy - President George
Bush, with his continuation of the low-tax, minimum-government strategy
initiated by President Reagan, or Governor Bill Clinton, with his new
interventionism? Outsiders who regard the occupant of the White House as the
natural leader of the developed world must accept that foreign policy issues
will not be decisive in this contest.
Americans today believe that they need time off from world leadership.
Preoccupied with social and economic problems at home, they have come to see
their incumbent president's interest in foreign policy as an expensive
luxury. In deciding for or against him next Tuesday they will be asking who
can, above all, restore the American economy's ability to withstand global
competition, create employment, generate wealth and arrest the descent of
important cities into anarchy.
At best this mood reflects an understanding that superpower status, even if
measured by military strength and exercised by diplomatic skills, depends in
the long term on a productive economy and a cohesive society. Yet Americans
should be under no illusion that they can solve their domestic problems
purely through domestic policy. While the main military threat to US
security has disappeared, the US economy is much more dependent on
international trade today than in the past. More than ever the US needs an
open world market.
Free trade
President George Bush appreciates this. He has grasped the opportunity of
Mexico's conversion to free trade, and has given high priority to the
Uruguay Round, in spite of many interest groups lobbying in the opposite
direction. Mr Bill Clinton appears to share the free trade orientation, but
the contrary pressures within his party are stronger.
Security issues are equally important. Experience has taught Americans that
their security is ultimately bound up with that of Europe. They cannot be
indifferent to the success or failure of political reform in Russia. They
cannot but regard China's rapid economic growth as at once an opportunity
and a threat. They must be worried by the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, in controlling which both Russian and Chinese co-operation will
be essential. And they should worry also about the world population
explosion and the ecological balance of the planet - issues inseparable from
the gnawing question of third world poverty.
Broader challenges
In dealing with such issues, Mr Bush's record has been mixed. He was deft
and forceful in handling the reunification of Germany; even more so in
organising the response to Iraq's seizure of Kuwait. He has averted the
fragmentation of Soviet nuclear forces; shown strategic vision in dealing
with China; and brought Arabs and Israelis together in a promising peace
process. But he has not risen to the broader challenges of the time.
Understandably, the US has no appetite for the role of universal policeman.
But under Mr Bush it has not gone very far, either, in adapting its policies
to favour an effective multi-polar system. In Europe, it has payed lip
service to European unity while allowing a weak dollar to help pull the
European monetary system apart. It has insisted on the primacy of Nato in
security matters, yet discouraged any Nato involvement in coping with the
most serious breakdown of European security, in Yugoslavia. Latterly even
the control of arms exports has been sacrificed to electoral interests.
Mr Clinton is inexperienced in foreign policy but has good advisers, drawn
from a party with a tradition of paying prices and bearing burdens in the
cause of freedom. A Clinton victory would not necessarily bring a change for
the worse in foreign policy - or an improvement in domestic policy. While
ridiculing Mr Bush's 'read my lips' pledge, Mr Clinton has given a similar
hostage to fortune by promising not to increase taxes on 'the middle class'.
Whoever wins will be immediately confronted with the task of promoting
growth in the domestic economy, tackling the budget deficit, and, at the
same time, refocusing on the inescapable global responsibilities of what is
still the most powerful nation on earth.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BRIAN Mulroney, Canada's long-suffering prime minister, has just joined
the growing band of western leaders rendered impotent by popular
disaffection. The decisive No pronounced by six of the country's 10
provinces in Monday's referendum on a new constitution represents a
humiliating blow not just to his government but to Canada's ruling elite. It
may also bring closer a prospect which politicians have been wrangling for
years to fend off: the slow disintegration of Canada as a unitary state. At
best, Canadians now face years of political uncertainty; at worst, they
could be drifting towards a divorce - or divorces - that will be messy and
acrimonious in the extreme.
That may seem unduly apocalyptic. Canada remains one of the world's most
prosperous countries with traditions of tolerance and moderation; its
imminent break-up has been frequently predicted in the past without tangible
results - most recently after the collapse of a previous, less far-reaching
attempt at constitutional reform, the Meech Lake accord of 1987.
Nor should Monday's result be read as a rejection of Canada by a majority of
Canadians. As with Europe's Maastricht treaty, voters were considering a
tortuous and flawed document - the Charlottetown accord - that sought to
bridge or fudge serious conflicts of interest between provinces, and in
particular to accommodate francophone Quebec's desire for special status
within the federation. And as in Europe's referenda on Maastricht, those who
voted No did so for a variety of reasons, ranging from disenchantment with a
lacklustre ruling class to dismay at a sluggish economy.
Serious setback
But that does not make Monday's verdict any less serious a setback. With
federal elections looming within the next 12 months, Canada will not now be
able to reopen serious discussion of a constitutional settlement for years.
In the meantime, it will be open season for populist politicians in the
provinces who advocate greater autonomy, or separatism, without caring to
spell out the consequences.
This is most obviously the case in Quebec, where separatist parties hope to
win the next provincial elections and would then press for another
referendum on independence. But the voices of the Quebecois have echoes
elsewhere - notably in the resource-rich western provinces which are tiring
of providing fiscal transfers to a federation that often seems remote from
their concerns, and among the aboriginal peoples seeking self-rule. Such
sectional interests have been aroused by the concessions promised under
Charlottetown and will not lightly retire from the fray. Since many of their
demands could ultimately conflict, Canada will not be able to escape the
task of negotiating to reconcile them.
Separate identity
Canadians may have rejected their leaders' latest proposal on Monday, but
none of the issues which prompted the need for a new constitutional
settlement has gone away. The centripetal pull of a country 10 times as
populous to the south remains as strong as ever. Indeed, Canada will feel
the force of the US market all the more strongly with the arrival of the
North American Free Trade Area.
Conversely, Canadians' desire to preserve a distinct political and cultural
identity vis a vis their southern neighbours does not seem to have
diminished. The question now is whether that is possible within one country,
or can only be accomplished via separation.
A divorce between Quebec and the rest of Canada would not necessarily be a
disaster. There is no reason in principle why a small and compact country
should find it more difficult to make its way alongside the US than a large
but thinly-populated one.
What matters above all is the manner of the separation, and here there are
ample grounds for conflict - between the federation and the provinces over
assets, between the west and the east over budgets, between the provinces
and the aboriginals over land, or all of them simultaneously. Canadians will
need large reserves of patience and flexibility if these pressures are not
to result in damage to their country's economy and social fabric.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Policy begins at home: Domestic considerations have moved to
the top of the political agenda worldwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A disturbing tremor is running through the political leadership of the
world's leading economies.
In the US, President George Bush is facing a desperate struggle for
political survival. In Europe, the British government is reeling from a
string of crises which has undermined its authority; the French Socialists
fear for their political futures; the Italian government is struggling to
achieve vital political and economic reforms; across the EC, lights have
almost gone out on political and monetary integration.
Meanwhile in Japan, the Takeshita faction, the central pillar of the ruling
Liberal Democratic party, is embroiled in a power struggle to replace its
fallen kingmaker, Mr Shin Kanemaru. The struggle could seriously disable the
Miyazawa administration as it attempts to revive the ailing economy.
Clearly, the elements of this political turmoil are not all alike. Yet they
share a common thread. They are all part of a great turn inwards in
politics, away from international commitments towards domestic agendas. In
each case the balance between international and domestic priorities is being
readjusted.
In the late 1980s it became fashionable to predict that national politics
would be overtaken by the internationalisation of political power. According
to this view, the nation state was being superseded as the base for
political power, as national policies were increasingly circumscribed by
international factors, particularly the flow of the international economy
across national borders.
Instead, this year will mark the revenge of national politics, as domestic
considerations in the most powerful economies take precedence over
international considerations. In the US, Europe and Japan, ambitious
attempts to align national political priorities with international
commitments are being unwound in favour of more modest attempts to put the
domestic economic house in order.
This shift is most pronounced in the US. Two years ago President Bush basked
in the afterglow of the Gulf war and the west's triumph over communism in
eastern Europe. But in the past 18 months the domestic economy has taken
priority. The dominant theme of the presidential campaign has been a call
for America to redirect its energies to the domestic agenda at the expense
of commitments abroad.
Until very recently European leaders were confident that economic and
monetary union was the best way forward. The line between domestic and
international politics has become increasingly blurred in Europe as national
sovereignty has been superseded by the Community in more and more areas. But
the move towards integration may have stalled. The Maastricht treaty is in
danger of running into the sand as its architects reassess the prospects for
economic convergence and the democratic credentials of the institutions it
seeks to create.
But most important, integration has been thrown off-course by the assertion
of German national priorities. So far, the country's policy of paying for
the costs of unification without significant tax increases has forced
others, particularly the UK, to reassess the feasibility of economic
integration around the core of the German economy. The German turn inwards
has forced others to do the same.
Japan is slightly different. Since the second world war it has been cautious
in its international commitments. It has just taken its first, tentative
moves towards a more active foreign policy through its overseas aid
programme and its increasing involvement in UN peacekeeping activities in
Asia.
However, in Japan too, political turmoil has been provoked by a turn
inwards. In the late 1980s Japanese economic policy was largely designed to
meet US demands that the Japanese trade surplus should be reduced. To
achieve that end authorities stimulated the domestic economy through
relatively loose monetary policy, which in turn inflated the bubble economy
of soaring stock prices and real estate values.
Over the past two years, however, the Japanese economic authorities have
reasserted the importance of economic policy being directed towards domestic
stability rather than international commitments. As the bubble economy has
been deflated, so have the reputations of the politicians who prospered
during its heyday.
This great turn inwards to put domestic economic houses in order may be
necessary. But it carries at least two significant risks.
The first is a risk for the world's weaker economies. As the main
industrialised countries are increasingly preoccupied with their own
problems they may become more reluctant to direct policies and investment
towards other countries. Even political leaders of weaker economies in
Europe, such as the UK and Ireland, may find it difficult to gain influence
with German pol-icymakers. For economic officials in eastern Europe and
Africa, the sense of exclusion will be that much greater. In these regions,
the need to find levers to influence policy in their more powerful partners
will become an increasingly vital task.
The second risk confronts the leading economies themselves. The turn inwards
could well prove fertile ground for protectionist politics. The
introspection of 1992 may mark the ebbing of ambitious international designs
for economic co-operation. The danger is that it may yet send the tide
flowing in the other direction.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Arts: LPO and Kyung-Wha Chung - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Monday Franz Welser-Most and the London Philharmonic began their Festival
Hall concert in deceptively low profile, with the 18 year old Schubert's
Stabat Mater. It inhabits the limbo reserved for those more than competent
works by future masters which betray too few signs of the mature composer to
come. This sober, graceful Stabat Mater might have been composed by any
number of well schooled musicians and few listeners would guess Schubert
first.
The LPO's choir sounded grey, their collective imagination unstirred. Then
the violinist Kyung-Wha Chung arrived to play Bruch's D Minor concerto - his
Second - and electrified everybody, as she is wont to do. Though this
thoughtful, honestly made late-Romantic concerto boasts no astonishing
wattage, she compelled us to listen to it as if it were a graven revelation;
her commanding bow and her luminous conviction brooked no argument. Bruch
would have been pleased, and indeed honoured. The orchestra, beautifully
rehearsed, played their secondary role superbly.
Kyung-Wha Chung used to deliver almost anything with a pantherish intensity,
often several scalding degrees beyond what the music could really bear.
Here, it was lovely to hear her playing Bruch's unspectacular concerto with
such acute sympathy and poise - but no hyper-dramatic pressure. Fluent
musicianship was Bruch's leading virtue, and when it is made as plain as
this one can't but admire and surrender to it.
Nonetheless, in Sibelius's Fifth Symphony after the interval the LPO strings
were surely inspired by Chung's high-definition model. Their stark, fraught
phrases boasted a passionate unanimity far beyond the British string-norm.
(Presumably the LPO's new Leader, Joakim Svenheden, had something to do with
that too.) The woodwinds were properly plangent, with a touch of shrillness
in the right places, and all the brass were resoundingly secure.
Yet the symphony seemed simpler than it is. Despite Welser-Most's fine
gradations from pp to ff, everything sounded brightly polished, up-front -
no chiaroscuro, no suggestive depths. As a result, the symphonic impetus
sometimes flagged even while the actual execution dazzled.
There were some magical passages - like the first dance-paragraph of the
Scherzo, which materialised out of the air with the utmost sweetness and
modesty, set as if at a shy distance. The Andante variations could have done
with more delicate effects of that kind; and in the Finale the famously
unforgettable up-and-down thirds for horns never accumulated their full
sense of thankful return and expansive release.
In short, we got a sharp symphonic blueprint but only hints at the dramatic
subtext, which is always the heart of the matter in Sibelius as in Mahler. I
look forward to hearing Welser-Most conduct this Fifth again in (say) five
years' time, by when his scrupulous attention to the musical surface should
extend to a wider focus.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Arts: 'Lulu' as melodrama - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The story of Lulu, a woman with an insatiable sexual appetite who comes to a
sticky end, must go deep into mythology, whether it is treated as tragedy or
farce. It can also be melodrama, as an impressive new production by the
Cambridge Theatre Company shows.
Frank Wedekind's original Lulu was regarded as so shocking that it was not
performed in his lifetime (1864-1918). Alban Berg later made an opera of it.
Quite why the play as a whole was suppressed - it was allowed to run in
separate parts - is not clear. It is not far out of line with the real life
activities of Jack the Ripper and the fantasies in The Picture of Dorian
Gray, both of which were broadly contemporary. Anyway, it is in this spirit
that the Cambridge have picked it up in a new version by the once fierce
playwright, Edward Bond, and his wife Elisabeth Bond Pable. The pair have
worked on Wedekind before.
The Bonds may have deeper thoughts in mind, but their Lulu ccomes across as
melodrama through and through. Lulu is a victim of child sex abuse. Molested
by her father at an early age, she takes to sex like a duck to water and
seldom stops paddling. It takes her a long way: from the artist's studio of
Berlin to the salons of Paris and finally the garrets of London. By then her
father is 80 but still hankering after her and she is still tempted.
She falls to Jack the Ripper's knife when she is reduced to picking up men
from the streets and paying them to sleep with her. The original portrait of
Lulu, painted in Berlin, has made its way to London via Paris and now hangs
in the attic. Lulu has remained true to her principles: she spurns the
advances of her lesbian admirer, Countess Geschwitz. Only men will do,
though at one stage she regrets that she cannot make love to herself.
Is this shocking? No, because it contains no new insights and we have become
inured to sexual violence. The story has no moral as far as one can see. Yet
the direction by Nick Philippou at the Lilian Baylis Theatre is wonderfully
done. Watch the way Lulu dangles a piece of asparagus dripping with butter
an inch or so above her mouth. It may have been picked up from the movie of
Tom Jones, but it catches the link between sex and eating.
There is a scene which could be farce when Lulu has four lovers in and
around the dining room at the same time: one serving, one eating, the
husband peeping through opera glasses from behind the door and the man from
the local billiard hall concealed behind the curtains. Philippou's direction
achieves the remarkable feat of playing this straight.
There are some liberties. When Lulu picks up an African prince she tells him
her name is Daisy; he begins to sing the famous song. There may also be some
losses. A reference to a riot in the Reichstag has become irrelevant. The
symbolism of Lulu's investments is thrown away. She has put her money into a
company called Jungfrau. The share price collapses catastrophically just as
she decides to cash in because she is subject to blackmail and her own body
is worn out by over-use.
Lulu is played by Susan Lynch with great physical elasticity. She has one
defect, though it may be deliberate. She has a nasty curl to her lips and
her voice can become unpleasantly harsh. The hair and eyebrows are
excessively severe. Melanie Jessop plays the lesbian countess with such
feeling that perhaps she is in the wrong play. The men are all more than
competent, but this is Lulu's show.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Arts: Ogres, vampires and maidens abound / Review of
Mascagni and Marschner operas at Wexford
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An 18th century operatic version of a Shakespearean comedy, an early 19th
century romantic tale of vampires and innocent maidens and a 20th century
retelling of an episode of the French revolution - the fare offered by the
current Wexford Festival - is nothing if not eclectic.
When he came to compose Il piccolo Marat around 1920, Pietro Mascagni had
been famous for three decades. They had not been happy decades, for his
efforts to repeat the youthful success of his Cavalleria rusticana had
largely failed. In accepting the French subject proposed by the librettist
Gioacchino Forzano, Mascagni was in effect taking a step backwards, toward
the grim realism of an earlier generation. The story of 'Les Noyades',
victims of the Terror slain by mass drowning, inevitably suggests Umberto
Giodano's Andrea Chenier; unfortunately, the comparison only underlines the
weakness of the Mascagni work, its flat, disjointed libretto, its
over-emphatic, undistinguished score, its cardboard characterisation.
Still, Il piccolo Marat has its defenders, including the scholar Julian
Budden, who makes a fervent case for it in the Wexford programme book. The
Wexford production also argued strongly, if not convincingly, in the work's
favour. The conductor Albert Rosen drove orchestra, chorus and singers at an
urgent pace, the volume turned up full blast. The vigour of the performance
still could not hide the limpness of the text  - though in the central role
of the Ogre, the Russian bass Georgi Selesnev, was a splendid, vital
villain, notable not only for his powerful yet flexible instrument but also
for his excellent enunciation. In the ungrateful, taxing title role, the
American tenor Thomas Booth sang with generous enthusiasm, letting his voice
ring out. While he is not a great romantic actor, Booth's purposeful
sincerity won him deserved applause.
The role of Mariella, the ingenue heroine is not rewarding: she has little
to do save suffer. But Karen Notare also threw herself totally into her
task. The voice is big, occasionally unruly and, at top volume (as the
conductor often wanted it) it is not entirely pleasant. But in her long
second act scene this dramatic soprano sang accurately and affectingly.
Producer Stephen Medcalf boldly scrapped any notion of realism and opted for
a more fanciful narration, with dream-like, flashback tableaux and a lovely
final apotheosis-vision.
The designer Charles Edwards merits all praise.
Wexford is to be praised, too, for its intelligent selection of supporting
singers. The American baritone Richard Zeller (European debut) made a
moving, lyrical Carpentiere and in their even briefer appearances, the bases
Jose Garcia and John Rath made a good impression.
While it is given fairly regularly in German houses, Marschner's Der Vampyr
is virtually unknown elsewhere; and yet, as this Wexford staging indicates,
it can be enjoyable and, within its limits, effective. Wisely, the Wexford
producer Jean-Clause Auvray decided not to send up the work. There are,
true, some light, singspiel-like moments in The Vampyr, but there are also
scenes of tenderness and terror. Unfortunately, Auvray decided to add some
inventions of his own - including a totally misleading ending - and also to
omit some of its magic. Thus the designer, Kenny MacLellan, was not allowed
much scope.
In the libretto, by WA Wohlbruck (after Polidori), Lord Ruthven, the
vampire, has to drain the blood of three maidens on the eve of their wedding
and all within the space of 24 hours. Miraculously Ruthven brings it off -
so there are three fairly meaty female roles. As the third girl, Emmy, the
young Irish soprano of Frances Lucey enjoyed a well-earned triumph. Clean
and pure, the voice poured out freely, naturally; the words were distinct,
the phrases sensitively shaped. Unfortunately, the other two victims were
less exciting and the vampire himself, the American baritone William
Parcher, was hollow-voiced, his diction woolly, his pitch sometimes less
than perfect.
As Aubry, the proper beloved of victim number two, the tenor Walter MacNeil
sang with fresh, impassioned tone and musical precision. Though not a born
actor, he commanded respect and admiration. Among the smaller roles, the
German tenor Jurgen Sacher was appealing as George (Emmy's betrothed) and
Jutta Winkler was a pert Suse.
Marschner's music, following Weber and anticipating Wagner, is not sublime,
but it is never less than competent and often delightful. Wexford performed
it in the revision made by Hans Pfitzner in the 1920s; among its vagaries
there is the shifting of the catchy Overture from its normal position at the
opera's beginning to an awkward place between first-act scenes. The Festival
might well have gone back to the original on this occasion.

A packed evening. Open Space (7.40 BBC2) shows a Cambridge Union debate on
political correctness with British journalist Ann Leslie attacking and
American feminist Andrea Dworkin defending.
Today's Timewatch (8.10 BBC2) is unique: Kenneth Griffith, in telling the
story of Roger Casement, argues the Irish nationalist case with passion.
Normally television simply suppresses the argument. Dispatches (9.00 C4)
suggests that the lifting of border controls within the EC may lead to a
reduction in individual liberties - or anyway more mistaken arrests - as
police attempt to compensate by exchanging, and storing on computers,
increasing amounts of information. The programme shows how mistakes arising
from this can lead to violent arrest and wrongful imprisonment.
In Whicker's World (9.00) the globe-trtting chronicler of the rich finally
meets the richest of the lot: the Sultan of Brunei. BBC2 shows the first in
a three-part adaptation of Conrad's The Secret Agent (9.25). Michael Palin
continues his journey from Pole To Pole through Russia, from St Petersburg
to Odessa (9.30 BBC1).

FT  28 OCT 92 / Arts: Free speech impersonated - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By rights British television ought to be declaring tonight a gala occasion:
BBC2 is screening a new programme by Kenneth Griffith, an actor familiar
from dozens of British movies who, in the latter half of his life, has
turned himself into a maker of unique documentaries. Instead, tonight's
programme, 'Roger Casement - Heart Of Darkness', is tucked away in the
Timewatch slot without so much as a promotional picture in Radio Times.
Still, better that it should go out quietly than not at all. Griffith has
been known to call himself, with some justification, 'Britain's most
suppressed film maker', and the most famous of those suppressions occurred
in 1973 when his programme Hang Out Your Brightest Colours, about the IRA
leader Michael Collins, was banned.
Now, nearly 20 years later, Griffith is finally managing to bring to our
screens some idea of the Irish nationalist case which, in this country so
proud of its tradition of free speech, has so rarely been expressed on
television. Today when even the comments of an officially legitimate
organisation such as Sinn Fein are suppressed by the British government
(confirming for so many naive Americans the belief that what they see in
Ireland is the last grinding of the British imperialist jackboot) Griffith's
achievement is all the more remarkable.
He has done it by spending the first half of his programme detailing
Casement's work in Africa and South America where he championed the cause of
enslaved black people, only turning to the championship of Irish nationalism
in the latter part of his life. In what has become his trademark Griffith
plays not only the role of his central character, but all the others too:
Joseph Conrad (who, it seems, was inspired to write 'Heart Of Darkness' by
meeting Casement in the Congo), King Leopold of Belgium, Lord Lansdowne, and
so on.
As is also his firm habit, Griffith takes all the historical parts of his
script from original documents, a practice which makes his programmes closer
to true 'documentaries' than most, but his own feelings are also allowed
full rein. Since he is a passionate, committed, and deeply opinionated man
this makes for powerful programmes, full of the strong flavours we expect in
print, which are so rarely tolerated in broadcasting. With his willingness
to express contrary views of people ranging from Napoleon to the Afrikaners,
and his fervent attachment to the cause of personal freedom, Griffith has
become the Celtic conscience of British television. He is now 71, but
today's programme is a splendid addition to an already impressive CV. May
there be many more.
                            *      *      *
The increase in cheap populist rubbish on British television, noted so often
in this column over the last few months, shows every sign of continuing and
even intensifying. Dial Midnight which describes itself as 'a live
late-night phone-in' is screened by ITV in London and northern Scotland on
Friday nights in time to catch people coming in from the pubs. Its young
female presenters, Samantha Norman (yes, Barry's daughter) and Anastasia
Cooke specialise in items about the sexually bizarre. Two weeks ago they
brought us Nikki who, we were told, was born with both a penis and a vagina
but was now pregnant. Last week they interviewed an American surgeon whose
speciality is penis enlargement. In the studio was a heavily disguised
person who claimed to have had the treatment.
Every weekday morning BBC1 is now running Good Morning With Anne And Nick, a
classic example of increased competition producing not variety but more of
the same: the BBC is responding to ITV's ratings success This Morning which
is presented by husband and wife team Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan. The
BBC version has a daily reading from Barbara Cartland, beauty hints, a
medical phone-in, and much pouring of tea as Nick grins at Anne and Anne
smiles distantly at Nick.
Furthermore it has been announced that in January, when the new ITV
franchises finally come into effect and the scramble down market gets going
in earnest, BBC1 will launch an early evening magazine programme called
Entertainment Express dealing with Hollywood gossip, prime time television,
mass-market music, best-selling books, Nintendo and home entertainment. It
sounds like a classic example of media howl-round with television feeding
increasingly off its own regurgitated material.
In this new world of television if series such as The South Bank Show are to
be preserved, and to continue transmission at a reasonable hour, we should
no doubt take more trouble to express our admiration. Melvyn Bragg's series
succeeded Aquarius 15 years ago as ITV's flagship arts programme, and the
standard has been consistently high for so long that it is hard not to take
it for granted. This week's programme on the Royal Ballet's comparatively
young ballerinas, Darcey Bussell and Viviana Durante, was typical in many
ways. Technically well made, it provided insights which must have been new
to all but the specialist, and though there was a smattering of 'home life'
detail (taking the Jeep to the garage, wandering in the market) the
programme concentrated on what the SBS has always done best: analysing and
illustrating for the lay viewer the path to success in whichever art form
happens to be the week's subject.
                            *      *      *
Michael Palin's greatest asset is his Mr Nice Guy persona. Even in Monty
Python's Flying Circus, while the others were being outrageous or manic, he
tended to be the more reasonable one, or the fall guy. The same was true of
his role in A Fish Called Wanda, and it was surely his unaffected charm,
verging occasionally on diffidence, which made his 1989 travel series Around
The World In 80 Days so popular. That said, charm alone may not always be
enough. There were nice moments in the opening episode of his new travel
series, Pole To Pole, as when, panning for gold in a Lapland river, he
shouted at his film crew 'Go away, go away, leave me here, I don't need you
any more', or found himself being propositioned by a lonely lighthouse
keeper. But that episode which felt like such a long hour turned out to be
only 50 minutes. Perhaps matters will improve today as he travels through
Russia.
                            *      *      *
Mention of Wanda brings to mind this week's 'Screen One' production, Trust
Me, in which Alfred Molina played a pathological fantasist/liar who comes
unstuck when he tries to sell the story of his life as a contract killer to
a publisher and is promptly hired to bump off the publisher's wife. Both
works are comedy thrillers, a form in which there is such a strong British
tradition, but while most people who have watched Wanda would happily watch
it again it is hard to imagine anyone bothering to watch Trust Me twice.
Why? Perhaps because the laughs in the television film are fewer and milder
than those in Cleese's film. But more important, surely, is Cleese's
willingness to re-work and polish his material almost obsessively, a habit
which paid off in Fawlty Towers as well as Wanda. No doubt lots of hard work
went into Trust Me, but that much more effort might have turned it into an
endlessly repeatable classic.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Management: Learning how to learn from allies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Western companies which have joint ventures or other 'strategic alliances'
with Japanese partners are notoriously bad at extracting knowledge and
skills from their allies - on technology, marketing, strategy, organisation
or anything else. Not only are the Japanese much better at learning in the
other direction, they are also more adept at building barriers against
unwanted learning by the other side.
Motorola, the American electronics group, and a few other western companies,
have overcome this two-way deficiency by improving their learning skills, or
'learning how to learn'.
But a constant flow of research shows that most of the learning from
western-Japanese alliances is still one-way. There continues to be a crying
need both for better confidential advice to companies about how to handle
particular alliances, and for a general guide to learning in such
situations.
Precisely such a document has now been compiled, by a helpfully
cross-cultural team: a German management consultant, Heidi Amponsem of Booz
Allen &amp; Hamilton's Dusseldorf office, and a Canadian academic, David
Rutenberg of Queen's University in Ontario. They unveiled it at the annual
conference of the International Strategic Management Society.
Their guide comes in a rather curious form, but it offers all sorts of
sensible insights and suggestions, ranging from annual reviews of the
adequacy of communication from the alliance to its parent company, to the
need for better job rotation policies for people on secondment from the
parent to the alliance.
Under the deceptively prosaic title of 'process guide to accelerate an
organisation's learning'*, the document covers several kinds of learning:
not just from formal alliances, but also from informal collaboration, as
well as from 'reverse engineering' - the dismantling and analysis of other
companies' products.
On informal learning, the guide suggests that the organisation should
perceive customers, suppliers and other outside organisations as important
sources for learning. It should systematise this learning through regular
meetings of the managers and other employees involved in such contacts.
The guide, which doubles as an academic research document, is in the form of
a series of self-assessment sheets, covering what the authors call five
stages of learning: 'sensitisation' of the organisation and its employees to
basic learning processes, and even to the need to learn (which,
surprisingly, is not always obvious to everyone); information acquisition;
synthesis of learning between individuals; transfer and storage of it; and
implementation and evaluation of learning.
Each sheet contains a set of positive statements, to which readers are
invited to indicate whether their company always, sometimes, or never does
what is stated. Under 'sensitisation' for formal strategic alliances,
Amponsem and Rutenberg's statements include 'employees are specifically
selected and trained for the alliance', and 'employees away at a strategic
alliance realise that after they have learned as individuals they still have
to transfer their insight to their home company'.
Under information acquisition, the guide suggests that 'the persistence and
endurance needed to achieve learning goals is realistically understood'.
Also 'employees away at a strategic alliance understand which information
must remain proprietary'.
Under synthesis of information from the alliance, the guide not only
suggests regular meetings of all employees involved in each alliance, but
also of one representative per alliance, in order to pool corporate insight
into how to learn from alliances in general. Also, the parent should revise
constantly its beliefs, values and guidelines for operating alliances.
Under transfer and storage, they suggest regular internal 'benchmarking'
reports which compare the parent's operations with those of each strategic
alliance.
Under implementation and evaluation, there should be an annual assessment of
how corporate practice has been improved due to each alliance. And there
should be an annual analysis of the costs and benefits of the alliance, plus
a projection into the future.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Management: BhS transformed - John Thornhill charts the
retailer's fortunes as the sale of Habitat and Richards puts it centre stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retailing often resembles a pendulum; big store chains rarely go bust, they
just swing into, out of, and back into fashion - much like the goods they
sell. Such has been the fate of BhS, the clothing and homeware retailer,
once known as British Homes Stores, which has thrived and dived and seems
set to thrive again as it re-emerges in clearer light this week from the
shadows of the Storehouse conglomerate.
Throughout the 1970s, British Home Stores was one of the strongest retailers
on the high street, retaining a fine reputation in the City. Fund managers
investing in the stores sector were faced with a simple choice of buying
shares in either British Home Stores or Marks and Spencer.
But in the 1980s the fortunes of the two companies drastically diverged.
Crudely put, M and S prospered as a result of the excellent execution of a
simple strategy; British Home Stores struggled through the faulty
application of a bad one. M and S now makes as much profit as BhS makes
sales.
After being swept up into Sir Terence Conran's Storehouse group in 1985, BhS
ossified during the rest of the decade, growing slow and unresponsive.
Profits slumped from Pounds 71.1m in 1987 to Pounds 27.5m by 1990 and as
recession gripped, the company appeared to be heading for a crisis.
The failure of the merger was recognised this week as Storehouse disposed of
Habitat and Richards, shattering Conran's original design of a diversified
retailing group and returning BhS to something like its original form.
But as a result of clearing the clutter, shareholders may now be better able
to appreciate an eye-catching comeback that has been staged at BhS over the
past three years, finally resulting in impressive gains in profits - albeit
from a low base. The Pounds 108m proceeds of Storehouse's disposals will now
be largely used to accelerate this renewed organic expansion.
At the leading edge of BhS's revival has been David Dworkin, who was chief
executive of BhS from November 1989 until he assumed the same role at
Storehouse this July.
A sardonic, undemonstrative American who resembles a hip professor at a
Californian university, Dworkin has presided over a radical process of
change at BhS, which has intrigued the academic world and been used as a
case study at Harvard Business School to demonstrate how to effect change in
a service sector business.
Dworkin says he had never heard of BhS when he was asked to become its chief
executive. He believes his ignorance was a blessing in that he viewed the
business in a truly objective light.
'A person who had grown up in this country could not have come in and done
what was necessary because they would have had too much mental baggage. They
would have been locked into too many haunting demons,' he says.
When he studied BhS he saw an overstaffed static company with little
strategic vision and still less determination to impose one. But with 130
well-located stores, 3.5m shoppers a week, annual sales of more than Pounds
600m, and a surprisingly high degree of customer goodwill, Dworkin believed
the business had great potential - it was simply a question of unlocking it.
To help him achieve the task, Dworkin assembled a core of like-thinking
people both from within and outside the company. Prominent among them were
Ann Iverson, a fellow American retailer (now entrusted with the task of
reviving Mothercare), and Steve Bedford, BhS's human resources director, who
had already thought deeply about how to change the company's culture.
These directors were a complete contrast to the previous BhS management. The
new team not only read the works of management gurus such as Michael Porter
and Tom Peters; they even believed them.
Women were represented on the board for the first time. Six of the seven
directors were under 40.
'We are a different generation and have more open-minded attitudes. We are
the children of the 1960s. Hey, if our sales go up any more we'll all be
smoking dope,' says one director.
Dworkin's first priority was simply to improve the standards of retail
practice. He was horrified to learn that some stores were unable to take in
the new season's stock because their stock rooms were full of unsold
merchandise from four years ago. In the American tradition, Dworkin
ruthlessly marked down prices in order to shift unwanted stock.
With the help of outside consultants, the new team studied every link in the
company's supply chain, speeding up the time it took to bring goods from the
factories to the shop floor and reducing the number of suppliers from 850 to
500. By doing so, BhS increased the volume of goods it bought from any one
supplier, thereby improving buying terms and service.
The company also upgraded the physical fabric of the stores: display
wardrobes were ripped out and more open lay-outs introduced; aisles were
widened; the internal lighting was sharpened up. Computer systems were
introduced giving the company more accurate sales data, and electronic links
were established with suppliers to ensure a more rapid replenishment of
fast-selling goods.
Under the direction of Helena Packshaw, the marketing department began fully
to support the company's buyers for the first time. An enormous number of
interviews were conducted to determine shoppers' needs. A BhS Choice card
was successfully introduced offering discounts for frequent shoppers.
All these 'hard' problems were relatively simple to identify and solve. But
at the same time Dworkin increasingly realised there would have to be a
revolution in the 'soft' side of the business - radically changing the way
people thought and acted in order to 'free up' the organisation and
'empower' the staff.
However, this process was - in part - a brutal business. Layers of
management were hacked out and 900 staff were sacked. 'Waving a magic wand
and shouting 1990s buzz-words was not going to solve anything. We needed to
change a lot of people first,' he says coldly.
This is the first of two articles. The second describing BhS's 'people
revolution' appears next week.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Management: Taking the risk of disease out of travel -
Health Check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Much of the blame for the global spread of sexually-transmitted diseases
has, in the past, been attributed to the indiscreet meanderings of the
military. Now a new agent - the international traveller - is also aiding and
abetting the spread of increasingly-resistant diseases.
If you travel abroad as part of your job, you should be aware that the risk
of picking up a sexually-transmitted disease is higher in some parts of the
world than in others. High-incidence areas include Thailand, the
Philippines, East and West Africa, as well as parts of the Caribbean and
central America.
Risk is also related to the number of sexual exposures, number of partners
and whether or not a condom is used. Avoid casual anonymous contacts and, in
particular, any form of sex-for-pay. Studies have shown that the latex
condom provides better protection than the natural skin condom, which is
more porous to smaller organisms such as HIV.
Post-exposure symptoms may be deceptively absent and, to further complicate
matters, the simultaneous transmission of several diseases is quite common.
Once the infected traveller comes home, often within the incubation period
of a disease, a partner may be unwittingly infected.
Travellers who suspect they may have been infected, even in the absence of
symptoms, should be examined by a doctor. Sexual partners should also be
screened and, if necessary, treated.
The author is the medical director of the Insead Business Health course.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Jobs: What a difference three months makes - Study of world
living costs by European Commission shows effects of the plunge in sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHICH kind of British export has risen in price as a result of the United
Kingdom's devalu . . . (sorry) withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism?
The answer, of course, is the two-legged variety - expatriate British
workers, especially when of executive status. And today the Jobs column can
give an idea of how much the cost of same has shot up, at least to employers
who don't require the far-flung Brits themselves to bear the brunt of
exchange-rate changes.
A touch ironically, the cost indicators which are set out in the
accompanying table originate with the European Commission. Having staff of
its own scattered about the globe, the EC compiles data on world-wide living
costs through the Eurostat directorate at its Brussels headquarters.
Hitherto the results have been kept for official use. But, perhaps feeling
the budgetary pinch, the commission has now decided to put its data on the
market. It is doing so in the UK through the International Employer branch
of the Sedgwick Consulting Group, and anyone wanting details of the service
should contact Richard Hume-Rothery at Winterton House, Nixey Close, Slough,
Berks SL1 1NG; telephone 0753 516151, fax 0753 516190.
Whereas the full survey covers 117 cities, my extracts are limited to 22
(not counting London which, although missing from the list, is present in
spirit because the living-cost indices are based on London prices at 100.)
For each city, the table starts with the exchange rates prevailing first in
July then at the close of markets last Friday, and goes on to show the
indices at each date and the change between them in terms of percentage
points.
Another limitation is that, as is usual in such surveys, no account is taken
of housing costs which are very hard to measure in an internationally
consistent way. Nevertheless - as might be expected, given that the EC has
been called 'the bureaucrat's bureaucracy' - even the limited information
here supplied is more detailed than the normal type of living-cost
indicators.
Those I've printed previously consist of a single index figure, representing
the local price of a 'basket' of goods and services bought by a typical
executive family sent to work there. By contrast, the EC prices three
different baskets for each place.
The first, the 'home country pattern' denotes the buying habits of pukka
expatriates who insist on preserving the same style of life they led before
going abroad. The next, the 'host country pattern', represents the typical
style of executives who're natives of the place concerned. The third is the
'intermediate pattern' of the expatriates who change to the local style in
some ways while maintaining their homeland habits in others.
Which of the three patterns is adopted can make an appreciable difference to
an employer sending people to work abroad. Take for example a British
executive on a gross salary of Pounds 50,000 in the UK who is being
transferred along with spouse and two children to a job in Geneva.
With the local index for the home country pattern now 175.8, I'm told the
extra pay needed to preserve their UK style of life would be Pounds 15,960 a
year. While that could be cut to an additional Pounds 9,660 by forcing the
family to go totally native on an index of 145.8, the EC feels it would be
fairer to compromise on the 160.1 figure and an extra Pounds 12,600.
But quite apart from such individual instances, the cost changes brought
about by the plunge of sterling surely make arresting reading in their own
right. Measured by the index-point differences since July in the
intermediate pattern - on which the table is ranked - Buenos Aires,
Amsterdam, Hong Kong and Dublin have all become dearer than London, whose
place in the two-tier Europe seems no longer to be in any doubt.
Indeed, of the EC capitals listed, Athens is nowadays the only one cheaper.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Business and the Environment: A tale of two states -
Victoria Griffith describes how the environmental paths taken by Vermont and
New Hampshire in the 1980s have affected the business climate there today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This autumn, thousands of tourists from around the world will flock to see
the changing leaves in the New England states of Vermont and New Hampshire.
In Vermont they will be treated to bucolic scenes of cows grazing on
mountainside pastures, small country towns and forest preserves.
In New Hampshire they will see similar scenes, but they may have to drive
through miles of land dotted with office developments and condominiums to
get there.
Twenty years ago, the New England states of Vermont and New Hampshire were
so much alike that they were often referred to as 'twin states'. The twins
were heavily agricultural, preserving a rural way of life despite their
proximity to Boston.
During the 1980s, though, these states followed such different environmental
paths that they could be case studies for measuring the impact of
environmental changes on business.
New Hampshire thrived, thumbing its nose at its poorer neighbours. The
state's low tax levels and non-interventionist policies served as a magnet
for scores of high-technology businesses. With an unemployment rate well
below the national average, it was the economic envy of the country.
As the US moved into recession, though, it became clear that New Hampshire
would have to pay a price for indiscriminate development. The computer
industry ran into crisis and many companies closed their doors.
Bank failure plagued the state, as speculative loans to cover the expansion
of the computer industry and new housing developments were never paid back.
Unemployment soared and thousands of jobs flowed out of the state.
The scars of development proved more difficult to erase than the jobs,
though. New condominium and industrial projects had eradicated many of the
state's farmlands - the very scenery tourists came to New Hampshire to see.
The economic picture in Vermont, while not exactly up-beat, is better than
that of its eastern neighbour. At 6.5 per cent in August, unemployment is
far lower than the national average. The state did not experience the heavy
outflow of jobs that plagued the rest of the northeast, and it was the only
New England state to escape a major banking crisis.
Vermont residents attribute much of this economic success to the state's
heavy-handed environmental policies. Vermont has some of the strictest
environmental controls in the world, regulating not only air and water
contamination, but visual pollution as well.
Billboards, or even large signs outside stores, are strictly forbidden.
Recognising the strong connection between the presence of agriculture and
tourist levels, the state has instituted a complex system for the protection
of farmlands.
Milk prices are supported within the state to aid dairy farmers. And the
state offers property tax subsidies to farm and timberland owners through
what has been dubbed the 'current use' law, which has helped preserve
forests and open space.
Perhaps most important, Vermont's Regulation 250 allows the government to
veto any large development scheme that may have a negative impact on traffic
levels, pollution levels or quality of life. Although many believe the
protective zeal is sometimes exaggerated, most Vermont businessmen support
the state's environmental laws.
'The banking community in this state feels that (Regulation) 250 provided a
moderating influence on excessive growth in the 1980s and was a major factor
in preventing bank failures in Vermont,' said John Ewing, president of the
Bank of Vermont. 'Without environmental controls, we might have had the same
sort of banking crisis that hit the other New England states.'
Many people in the business community feel that concern for the environment
has also helped create a marketing image that has served the state well.
'Vermont still has an aura that helps us sell products,' said William Davis,
president of Cabot Creamery, a cheese and dairy product manufacturer.
'Food products, especially, are enhanced by the Vermont image because people
believe the ingredients will be free from contamination and made in an
old-fashioned way,' said Maxine Brandenburg, head of the Vermont Business
Roundtable, a government and business coalition which offers advice on
environmental policies.
Even companies which cannot benefit directly from Vermont's marketing image
may be attracted to the state for its strong environmental reputation. A
recent study by the Vermont Business Roundtable found that quality of life
was cited most frequently by the business community as the main reason for
locating their company in Vermont.
'Environmental regulations translate into quality of life, and that's one of
the main reasons we moved here,' said Robert McKinney, vice president of
KBA, a printing machine distributor.
KBA just relocated to Vermont from Long Island, taking more than half its
employees with it. 'We were surprised at how many of our employees decided
to make the move. I guess we're all after a good quality of life,' says
McKinney.
Most important to its economic well-being, perhaps, has been Vermont's
success in the tourism business. Vermont pulled in nearly Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 600m) in tourist dollars in 1990, making tourism the second biggest
money-earner in the state.
According to US Travel Data, a non-profit research group based in Washington
DC, Vermont now attracts nearly 50 per cent more in per capita tourist
revenues than New Hampshire. That is despite the fact that New Hampshire has
a coast line, higher mountains, and is closer to Boston.
The Vermont/New Hampshire comparison is not a clear-cut study. New Hampshire
is not an environmental pariah. For one thing, it boasts one of the best
wetlands protection schemes in the country. And some Vermont residents feel
the environmental zeal in the state at times takes things too far.
Still, experiences in these states show that environmental decisions - not
just clean air and water, but more subtle environmental controls on visual
pollution - can have a profound impact on business.
In the wake of the crisis, some members of the business community in New
Hampshire admit that lack of attention to the environment may have
exacerbated the state's problems. 'We have to be careful, because if we
destroy our environmental beauty we can't get it back,' said Jerry Little,
president of the New Hampshire Bankers Association.
'The environment is one of this state's biggest assets, and if we lose it,
we will lose one of the main reasons businesses like to operate from here,'
he says.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Business and the Environment: Growth through green economics
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A new study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Stephen Meyer
has challenged the widely held belief that environmental controls hinder
economic growth, arguing that environmental efforts can boost output, job
growth and productivity.
Meyer's study, which he claims is the first empirical test of the impact of
environmentalism on the economy, analysed the impact of individual US
states' environmental policies on their economic performance. He believes
controls may motivate companies to become more efficient, and that product
innovation necessitated by the controls can improve productivity.
Meyer arrived at his conclusions by testing the relationship between
environmental rank (how the state's ecological efforts compared with that of
other states) and economic growth during the periods 1973-80 and 1982-89.
The results held, he claims, even when time ranges were varied and when the
analysis was restricted to the 25 states with the smallest economies.
'For those which continue to argue that environmentalism hurts economic
growth and prosperity, the burden of proof now falls on their shoulders,' he
concludes.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Business and the Environment: Insurers offer new pollution
protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The launch last week of a new environmental insurance policy, which pays out
when regulators order companies to clean up, signals that the UK insurance
sector is beginning to respond to industry's growing concerns about the cost
of pollution.
The new policy by two US companies - ECS Underwriting and National Reliance
 -requires policyholders to carry out environmental surveys and makes
coverage dependent on the adoption of rigorous controls to reduce the
likelihood of pollution.
It remains to be seen, however, whether industry will respond any more
enthusiastically to these products than to similar - but more restrictive -
policies pioneered by a handful of UK companies. A raft of new national and
European legislation is redefining the pollution liabilities of industry and
its financial backers.
Under legislation introduced in the past couple of years both the National
Rivers Authority and local authorities have acquired considerable powers to
order companies operating polluted sites to finance clean-ups.
If site operators go into liquidation, their bankers or receivers could be
asked to meet the costs. In addition, the introduction of a register of
contaminated land is expected to increase the scope for litigation.
The values of properties built on contaminated sites will probably fall.
Site operators or owners, including thousands of householders, could face
the extra costs of cleaning up contamination.
Recently, for example, 671 householders at Armley, a suburb of Leeds, were
presented by Leeds City Council with a Pounds 5m bill to clean up asbestos
dust from their properties. The pollution occurred as a result of emissions
from an asbestos factory situated in the area over a 30-year period until
its closure in 1958.
Potential European legislation, influenced by the legal concepts of strict
liability (liability without proof of fault), is reinforcing this trend.
A survey by the Sedgwick Group, insurance brokers and consultants, found
that environmental concerns were top of the list of worries for risk and
insurance managers of UK companies. More than 80 per cent of the boards of
100 British companies were more worried by pollution than any other risk.
Yet the conventional insurance market has been of limited help.
Traditionally, UK public liability insurance has provided industry with
coverage where it is found liable for pollution damage to third parties.
But in April 1991, British insurers restricted the scope of coverage to 'a
sudden, identifiable, unintended and unexpected incident which takes place
in its entirety at specific time and place during the period of insurance'.
The ECS policy - along with similar coverage offered by the Chemical
Industries Association, American International Group and Zurich Insurance -
helps plug the gap. Known collectively as 'environmental impairment' or EIL
policies, they cover against the risk that gradual or accidental pollution
will cause damage to third parties. The ECS policy is more innovative in
that it pays for the cost of cleaning up a contaminated site if action is
ordered by regulators.
All EIL policies are dependent, however, on the environmental surveys
carried out at the policyholders' expense and rigorous controls of risk. The
ECS policy is strictly underwritten to cover specific sites and coverage is
on a 'claims made' basis, which means that in general claims must be made
within the policy period, for example. At a time of recession the expense
could prove off-putting. The survey alone - which provides no guarantee that
insurance will be offered - could cost at least Pounds 10,000.
Francis de Zulueta, chairman of a London insurance market group on
environmental liability and financial institutions, says he believes it will
be two years before the market takes off, with the recession and the limited
character of cover depressing interest.

<TEXT>
A Pounds 40M CONTRACT to provide the British Army with laser equipment to
simulate firing has been awarded to the Saab group of Sweden.
Saab was chosen in preference to Loral Solartron, a subsidiary of the US
Loral group, which provides similar equipment for US forces.
Royal Ordnance, the British Aerospace subsidiary, and GEC-Marconi, offering
a French system, were both eliminated at an earlier stage of the
competition. However, Royal Ordnance is expected to supply small-arms
training equipment under the Saab contract.
The equipment is designed to reduce the amount of live firing carried out by
troops in training. The Ministry of Defence said it would bring 'cost
savings and benefits for the environment'.
The project involves laser projectors attached to a range of weapons
including tanks, anti-tank missiles and guns. Each 'hit' is recorded by
receivers carried by individual troops or vehicles. Options for extra
realism include sound effects and puffs of smoke.
Battlefield exchanges during exercises can subsequently be replayed and
performance analysed.

FT  28 OCT 92 / What Future For Coal: Miners return to court to save pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINING unions yesterday applied for injunctions against British Coal's
decision to halt production at 10 collieries earmarked by the government for
closure. The move, taken separately by the National Union of Mineworkers and
the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, follows British Coal's refusal to heed
a noon deadline set by the unions' lawyers.
The NUM and UDM applications are scheduled to be heard in the High Court
tomorrow and next Tuesday respectively.
Attempts by British Coal to have the actions heard concurrently were
rejected by the NUM as a ploy to gain time and break the momentum of the
campaign against pit closures.
Mr Mark Stephens, a solicitor for the NUM, said: 'British Coal is trying to
stall on addressing substantive issues which are of clear urgency to the
miners and the public at large.'
Two pits - Grimethorpe and Houghton Main in South Yorkshire - are due to
stop cutting coal on Friday, while seven have already stopped production. Of
the 10 collieries, only Betws in south Wales will remain in production from
next weekend.
Union officials said British Coal was pressing miners to take voluntary
redundancy before the 90-day consultation period expired.
British Coal figures show wide variations in the rate at which miners are
applying for redundancy. At Markham Main in South Yorkshire, 250 of the 730
miners have applied for redundancy while at Parkside, Lancashire, only 2 of
the 782 miners have.
At Trentham, Staffordshire, (1,544 miners) there have been 97 applications;
Taff Merthyr, south Wales, (410 miners) 4; Grimethorpe, South Yorkshire,
(957 miners) 150; Houghton Main, South Yorkshire, (441 miners) three.
The unions argue that ceasing production and development is endangering the
mines' viability and violates an earlier undertaking given by British Coal
to the High Court.
British Coal said last night that it saw no grounds for continuing
production at the 10 pits and would oppose the action.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Rail switch for Channel ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL and the government have firmly ruled out the possibility that
Britain's railways could be converted to take bigger Continental freight
trains after the opening of the Channel tunnel.
This means most Continental freight traffic will continue to enter Britain
by road after the tunnel's opening, much of it transferring from rail on the
French side of the Channel.
The decision will come as a blow to environmental lobbyists and others
supporting moves to encourage a transfer of freight from road to rail.
The Department of Transport said even a limited programme of converting
Britain's main rail routes would cost between Pounds 3bn and Pounds 4bn, and
the country's railways would be unable to justify such an outlay after
privatisation.
The government has reviewed the options for converting the routes following
an undertaking given to the Commons transport committee earlier this year.
Although the width between the rails in Britain is the same as on most
European railways, Continental freight wagons are mostly too wide and too
high to run on BR's tracks without crashing into platforms, bridges and
trains coming in the opposite direction.
When the Channel tunnel opens BR's biggest market for cross-Channel freight
will be the 2m lorry trailers a year at present carried by ferry.
SNCF, the French national railway, is spending FFr1bn (Pounds 122m) to
upgrade its principal routes between now and 1997 so its freight trains can
give piggyback rides to lorry trailers.
Britain's loading gauge, or track clearance, is too small to allow this.
Instead, BR hopes that UK/Continental freight carriers will use swap bodies
 -containers which can be lifted from lorry trailers to rail wagons for the
main part of their journeys.
More than 90 per cent of Continental swap bodies can be squeezed on BR's
tracks if special small-wheeled wagons are used. The technology requires
expensive mechanical handling equipment wherever the road/rail transfer
takes place, and the cost can be justified only for very long distances.
The result is that most UK/ Continental freight operators are likely to
choose the cheapest option of using road transport in the UK, crossing the
Channel by ferry or the Eurotunnel shuttle. If they switch to rail at all
most will wait until they can load lorry trailers on rail wagons in Calais.
The Department of Transport said it was not feasible to upgrade UK freight
lines to take piggyback wagons, although new lines such as the Channel
tunnel rail link would be built to accommodate them.

Lord Clyde, who headed the inquiry, said the social workers failed to

ONLY a third of companies dealing with foreign tourists can cope fully with
customers' language needs, according to a survey for the British Tourist
Authority and the Department of Employment, Michael Skapinker writes.
Although more than 90 per cent of the companies responding to the survey
said their staff came into contact with native speakers of other languages,
63 per cent relied to at least some extent on customers being able to speak
English.
The tourist authority said the survey, conducted by the Institute of
Manpower Studies, may have presented too optimistic a picture. A total of
1,500 companies were sent the questionnaire and 29.4 per cent responded. The
authority said companies with a commitment to foreign language skills were
more likely to have responded.
Although 70 per cent of respondents said their language needs would
increase, only 45 per cent planned to step up training.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Germany hits a rich seam of redundancies: Coal mining and
the free market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MAY be hard to imagine, but there is a coal mining industry which has
suffered even greater shocks than that in Britain.
Since the Berlin wall came down and market forces flooded eastern Germany,
more than 70,000 workers mining the low-grade brown coal, or lignite, have
lost their jobs. A catastrophe by western standards, such 'rationalisation'
is commonplace in an economy which has shed more than 3m workers in just two
years.
The trauma continues. Another 20,000 coal jobs are scheduled to go. By the
year 2000 there will be just 40,000 miners left processing 100,000 tonnes of
lignite a year, compared with the 130,000 who used to provide 70 per cent of
eastern Germany's primary energy.
Rationalisation of the west German hard-coal industry since 1960 has been
conducted at a more gentle pace. Labour reductions comparable with those so
speedily imposed in the former GDR and a 50 per cent cut in output, have
been phased in over more than 30 years. Many of the displaced workers have
been absorbed into a growing economy which has created 3m jobs in a decade.
The process is set to continue, with steady annual reductions in the
workforce of about 7 per cent.
But not for much longer. The Bonn government expects to be told by the
European Commission to dismantle its controversial coal subsidies and to
expose the western industry to the forces which have recently hit Britain's
miners.
Bonn won some time a year ago, when the government received grudging
permission from Brussels to maintain the so-called Jahrhundertvertrag. Under
this scheme electricity users pay a levy of 8 per cent on all bills into a
government-administered fund used to compensate generators for the cost of
using domestic coal.
The scheme, into which Bonn injects an extra DM5bn a year, is due to expire
at the end of 1995. The Huttenvertrag, which subsidises the use of domestic
coking coal to the tune of around DM3bn a year, is due to run until 1997.
European competition and energy officials make no attempt to hide their
feelings. As Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, EC energy commissioner, said in
Wales last week they are unhappy to see expensive German coal still burning
while British coal is thrown away.
Under regulations being drafted in Brussels the commission wants subsidies
scrapped by 1997 on all hard-coal pits with above-average EC production
costs. That would spell the end of all west German mines, which extract coal
from exceptionally deep and geologically-difficult pits at an average of
three times the world market price.
Mr Jurgen Mollemann, Bonn economics minister, claimed the plan ran counter
to the EC aim of secure energy supplies. Mr Cardoso e Cunha replied that
this was not an argument which could defend production which was 'totally
uneconomical'.
Mr Mollemann and the mining industry also face considerable domestic
difficulties. Steel makers, long irritated by the constraints of the
Huttenvertrag and now struggling to break even, have begun arbitration
proceedings in a bid to reduce coking coal prices. Klockner-Werke, which
last year lost DM180m on its steel operations, is trying to reduce its
annual bill by DM90m.
Meanwhile, Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister who is no friend to his
junior colleague Mr Mollemann and is under pressure from the Bundesbank to
control deficits, is insisting on immediate cuts in federal spending.
Subsidies, 38 per cent of Bonn's DM425bn budget this year, cannot be
expected to evade the axe for long.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Whips weigh their carrots and
sticks - How Tory party managers will try to pull MPs into line over Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's counter-offensive against Tory Euro-sceptics was under way
last night, orchestrated by party whips trained in persuasion techniques
ranging from the subtle and gentlemanly to the blunt and unforgiving.
Mr John Major will take the rare step of addressing the 1922 committee of
backbench MPs tomorrow - he usually appears only a few times a year. He met
about a dozen wavering MPs in his Commons office yesterday.
Other Conservatives have been offered face-to-face meetings with Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, or Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign
office minister. Behind the scenes, the 14 government whips have begun to
calculate the possible outcomes when the Commons debates Maastricht next
week.
Until last night, it had been mostly a listening exercise - in contrast with
the tactics of the Euro-rebels who have already begun to flood backbenchers'
meetings and press colleagues to take sides.
Cabinet ministers meet tomorrow morning, before Mr Major addresses
backbenchers, to agree next week's motion. They will want a report from Mr
Richard Ryder, the chief whip, on the likely extent of opposition.
Attempts to head off a defeat are likely to escalate dramatically as the
vote approaches. There will be fewer offers of carrots, more use of the
stick. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, is abroad until the weekend but
could join government attempts to quell the revolt over the weekend.
Whips, by tradition, pride themselves in knowing what the result of a vote
will be and, if defeat looks certain, in trying to ensure the government
swerves to minimise damage. Last week's climbdown over pit closures, albeit
ungraceful and hurried, is a textbook example.
Mr Ryder, working from an office off the members' lobby and rarely seen by
the public except occasionally in television shots, has a range of weapons
to use.
For younger MPs there will be grave warnings about future ministerial career
prospects. For others there will be appeal to loyalty, reminders of past
favours or hints about positions on the Commons select committees - though
some Euro-sceptics have already lost theirs.
Some Euro-rebels believe the next tactic will be to contact MPs'
constituency assoc-iations, alerting local officers of the trouble their
member is causing.
'We know it's going to be a tough game,' said one leading Euro-sceptic, as
if bracing himself for the battle ahead.
One - unlikely - option for Mr Major would be a television address, to
appeal over MPs heads to constituents. That might give the impression of
panic. A series of television interviews, which can be arranged with only a
few hours notice, is an alternative.
Whips' techniques vary. Some are civilised, merely politely inquiring into
an MP's intentions and offering to help answer points of concern.
Mr Ryder is amiable but firm. Mr David Lightbown, the large-framed assistant
whip, sometimes intimidates waverers with his gruff voice and burly
presence.
Each whip oversees a group of MPs, acting as a conduit for the passing on of
views and voting intentions. Different MPs require different techniques. 'If
you talk to a school teacher about how they treat their children, you will
see that they don't use the same method on each of them,' explained one.
Heavy-handed techniques can backfire. Mr Walter Sweeney, Tory MP for Vale of
Glamorgan, says he was told before the summer recess that he would be
'making life difficult' if he signed a Commons motion tabled by
Euro-sceptics.
He backed off then but has since told whips in a letter that he will vote
against the government when the Commons debates a substantive motion on
Maastricht.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lloyd's underwriter forced to quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNDERWRITER appointed by Lloyd's to investigate record losses at the
insurance market has been forced to leave the market after misjudging his
own syndicate's losses.
Mr David King resigned as underwriter of marine syndicate 745 earlier this
month after the extent of his losses for 1990 became apparent.
On Monday, Mr King gave up his position on a three-member Lloyd's 'loss
review' team investigating the losses in 1988 and 1989 of Rose Thomson Young
syndicate 255.
The team is one of seven set up to look into the reasons for recent losses.
Overall these amounted to Pounds 510m in 1988 and Pounds 2.06bn in 1989.
Mr King, now in his early 60s, has had 45 years experience at Lloyd's and
was widely regarded as a successful underwriter.
In 1990 more than 20 per cent of the syndicate's 1,743 Names - the
individuals whose assets support underwriting at Lloyd's - worked with
agents or brokers at the market, a much higher proportion than average,
indicating that Mr King was widely respected among his peers.
His syndicate, managed by KPH Underwriting Agencies, was a market leader in
the reinsurance market, specialising in the same 'spiral' business which has
left syndicates managed by Feltrim, Devonshire, Gooda Walker and Rose
Thomson Young agencies with multi-million pound losses.
In spiral reinsurance, underwriters with syndicates and companies reinsure
each other's exposure to high-level loss. Reviews into the Gooda Walker and
Feltrim losses, completed over the past month, have laid the blame on poor
underwriting, inadequate reinsurance and weak management controls.
Although syndicate 745's losses in 1988 and 1989 were relatively small, Mr
King appears to have misjudged his exposure in 1990 to claims from the
January storms and was unaware of the potential size of losses until an
internal review in August this year.
Syndicate managers now estimate total losses for 1990 to be between 90 per
cent and 140 per cent of the syndicate's capacity (or capital base) of
Pounds 43.1m, way in excess of earlier estimates. Embarrassingly for
Lloyd's, syndicate 745 could itself become the subject of a loss review,
since such reviews are normally triggered when losses exceed 90 per cent of
capacity.
According to Mr Andrew Elliott, who has taken over as underwriter of
syndicate 745, Mr King underestimated his potential exposure to non-marine
losses.
Following Hurricane Hugo and a series of other losses in late 1989, the
Lloyd's market was in a state of turmoil and many of the syndicates
re-insured by syndicate 745 changed the mix of business underwritten.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Subsidy call for high definition TV
technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM including leading electrical manufacturers and television
companies is urging the government to introduce subsidies to encourage
broadcasters to make programmes using high defini-tion television technology
(HDTV).
The government is already opposing European Commission plans to offer
broadcasters Ecu850m (Pounds 680m) in aid to introduce HDTV programmes. But
the consortium, including Sony, the consumer electronics manufacturer,
BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster and Dixons, the electrical retailer, claims
its plans would involve smaller subsidies.
The consortium's move comes as the European Community faces deadlock over
the plan by the commission to subsidise the transition from conventional
television broadcasting and stimulate the market for HDTV.
Member countries have so far been unable to agree on the commission's
proposal. The UK, in particular, is strongly opposed and at a meeting of the
EC's telecommunications council in June Mr Edward Leigh, UK technology
minister, said the plan was 'totally unacceptable'.
He said: 'We will oppose any expenditure until we see . . . a convincing
business case (for a subsidy).'
The business case was put forward in a report prepared for the commission
and appears to have been generally well received by member countries.
The commission is optimistic that a majority of members are moving closer to
finalising most aspects of the plan, apart from the most contentious issue -
the amount of the proposed subsidy.
Such agreement paves the way for discussions over subsidy levels at a
meeting of European telecommunications ministers in Brussels next month.
The consortium's proposal, which is being studied by the Department of Trade
and Industry, could be seen as a compromise with its calls for much lower
subsidies than in the commission's plan.
The UK's stance against any subsidy appears increasingly to be in the
minority on the issue.
The DTI said: 'We are working on coming up with a response to the
commission's study.'
However, a level of subsidy significantly lower than the proposed Ecu850m is
unlikely to achieve the commission's objective of creating a critical mass
of broadcasts to stimulate the market for high definition television.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Accounts body calls for reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACCOUNTING standard dealing with deferred taxation should be amended to
improve the level of disclosure, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of
Scotland said yesterday.
The analysis of SSAP 15, an accounting statement introduced in 1978, was
edited by Professor Pauline Weetman of the University of Stirling on behalf
of the research committee of the Scottish institute.
Deferred tax is that amount assessed for tax purposes in one period but
recognised in a company's financial statements in another.
In the long term the study calls for a 'flow-through' approach to accounting
for tax, in which actual tax charges would be adjusted only for short-term
timing differences such as those caused by interest payable or receivable
being different to that paid or received.
In the short term, it suggests:
A new disclosure note reconciling the effective tax charge to that which
would have applied at the full rate of corporation tax.
Greater emphasis in the standard on the need for better quality disclosure
in the notes to the accounts.
Treating advance corporation tax as a separate asset item which should not
be set against the deferred tax liability.

Mr Major's decision to attend the 1922 meeting tomorrow has stymied an
initiative by backbench loyalists to set up a 'breakaway' committee which
would, they say, more accurately represent Tory party opinion at
Westminster. The loyalists had planned to boycott the regular meeting of the

high public profile of Sir Marcus Fox, the committee's chairman. Whether the
planned breakaway is merely postponed or lapses will now depend on how
Thursday's meeting goes.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Straw attacks homes 'crisis'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday launched a five-point plan designed to end Britain's
'biggest housing crisis since the war'.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, accused the government of
'perverse economics' in preventing local authorities from using their own
funds to help solve the shortage of accommodation.
He called for:
The government to use empty repossessed houses for homeless families;
Court orders for repossessions to be refused until the lenders offered
practical help and advice to people in arrears, with options of accepting
reduced payments for a limited period;
The government to ensure that mortgage rescue schemes, which had so far
failed, could be made to work towards helping those owners in difficulties
remain in their homes as tenants;
The introduction of effective shared ownership schemes involving the payment
of lower mortgages in return for giving the lender or housing association an
equity share in the home;
An end to constraints on local authorities using capital receipts worth
Pounds 5bn.
Mr Straw said: 'The housing market is facing its biggest crisis since the
war. A million people live in homes worth less than they paid for them,
house prices are going through the floor, while repossessions and
homelessness are at unacceptable levels.
'Labour believes that cost-effective measures can be taken to stem
repossessions and to stimulate the market.'

FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour says benefit tax is planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAXING invalidity benefit, which would raise Pounds 550m in a full year and
affect 900,000 people, is being seriously considered by the government,
Labour said yesterday.
Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow social security secretary, said yesterday that
internal government documents had been leaked to him which showed that
ministers were considering taxation of the benefit from April 1994.
This would be introduced either in a 'big bang' change or phased in over
four years, he claimed.
A more immediate change signalled in the documents is a review by the
department of social security of the upper age limit for invalidity benefit,
which looks set to be one of the casualties of the current public spending
discussions.
The documents published by Mr Dewar suggested that some 250,000 people on
invalidity benefit would lose more than Pounds 15 a week in income once the
taxation was fully in place. They also refer to the sensitivity of
collecting small amounts of money from people dependent on benefit, and also
to the high levels of manpower involved.
Mr Dewar condemned the plans as an attack 'not on poverty but on the poor'.
'Those who are sick and unable to work are to be brought into the tax system
by a government which claims that it wants to take the lowest income groups
out of tax,' he said.
While the Treasury refused to comment on the leaked papers, the department
confirmed that bringing invalidity benefit within tax has been a government
commitment since the early 1980s.
Social security ministers are resigned to its being a tough year on spending
but insist that some of the more radical suggestions being made are merely
Treasury aspirations rather than plausible outcomes to the spending round.
EDX, the public spending committee chaired by Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, is to meet again this week, and Cabinet is also expected to hold
a general public spending discussion.
The social security ministers, conscious of recent presentational errors,
are intending to try to soften up opinion on the Tory back benches before
the results of the spending round are announced.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Court told of pact on Iraqi deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOREIGN Office at one point opposed the granting of export licences to
Matrix Churchill, the machine tool maker, to sell equipment to Iraq because
of concern about the Iraqi defence procurement programme and publicity given
to the Banca Nazionale Del Lavoro (BNL) affair in the US, an Old Bailey jury
heard yesterday.
Ministers from the Department of Trade and Industry persuaded the Foreign
Office to agree to the export of the machine tools by the Iraqi-owned
company provided the DTI handled any publicity problems, the court was told.
In his second day giving evidence, Mr Eric Beston, an assistant secretary at
the DTI, said that in mid-1989 the Foreign Office opposed granting the
licences for three reasons:
There was a lot of publicity about the Atlanta branch of BNL being a front
for the Iraqi defence procurement programme.
Iraq was trying at the time to take over Learfan, a company involved in the
production of composite materials for defence use.
The Foreign Office had conclusive evidence that previous shipments from
Matrix Churchill had gone to factories involved in munitions production.
Mr Beston agreed under cross-examination by Mr Geoffrey Robertson QC that
the DTI disagreed with the Foreign Office, saying the equipment to be
exported was for general industrial use and that foreign companies would win
the order other-wise.
However, at a meeting between Mr Alan Clark and Lord Trefgarne, trade
ministers, and Mr William Waldegrave, the Foreign Office minister, it was
agreed to grant the export licences provided the DTI handled 'presentational
prob-lems'.
Earlier the court heard that US Senator Jesse Helms contacted the DTI and
threatened to name Matrix Churchill in the Senate and accuse it of breaching
UK export regulations.
Mr Beston had warned him that if he did so, it would be followed by a sharp
response from the British government.
Mr Paul Henderson, a former Matrix Churchill managing director, Mr Trevor
Abraham, a former commercial director with the company and Mr Peter Allen, a
former sales director, all deny breaching export regulations.
The prosecution alleges they deceived the DTI by pretending the equipment
was for civilian, not military use.
The trial will continue today.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Minor parties may be crucial to
Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE position of even the most pro-European of the minor parties at
Westminster appeared to be hardening against the government yesterday, as Mr
Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, accused Mr John Major of
undermining the case for Europe.
The Liberal Democrats exemplify the dilemma for many of the minor parties,
whose votes could prove crucial if the Tory rebellion is maintained.
They broadly support the Maastricht treaty and bill, but would oppose the
government if the issue is one of confidence. If the motion itself is bland
and technical, then the way the government presents it in the run-up to the
debate could have a critical impact on how the smaller parties behave in the
vote.
The Liberal Democrat MPs will discuss today how they intend to vote next
week. Though all 20 MPs would sign up to voting against the government, the
sole Liberal Democrat Euro-sceptic, Mr Nick Harvey, might abstain if the
official decision were to vote in favour of Maastricht.
Mr John Taylor, the Ulster Unionist spokesman on European affairs, said
yesterday that the party's nine MPs would vote against Maastricht even if it
meant bringing down the government or the prime minister.
The Unionists' abstention in last week's debate on pit closures helped the
government's majority into double figures, but Mr Taylor said that if the
government went ahead with the Maastricht bill there was 'no question' of
another abstention by Ulster Unionists.
The three Democratic Unionist MPs, led by Mr Ian Paisley, are also likely to
vote against Maastricht.
For the three nationalist, and pro-European, parties, the dilemma is similar
to that for the Liberal Democrats. Between them they have 11 MPs, though the
four Social Democratic and Labour party representatives do not invariably
attend even close-run votes.
There was some cheer for Mr Major, however, from Sir James Kilfedder, the
sole Popular Unionist MP. His supportive intervention in the Commons
yesterday afternoon, in which he talked of the prime minister's 'brave
deter-mination . . . to put the UK at the heart of Europe', has heightened
expectations that he would vote with the government next week.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Health reforms 'failing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S health care reforms are failing to create an internal
market as planned, according to a survey from accountants Arthur Andersen
released yesterday.
Nearly 80 per cent of hospital chief executives and unit general managers
did not believe the National Health Service objective of creating an
internal market are being achieved.
More than 70 per cent, however, said the reforms had resulted in
improvements in overall efficiency, quality of service, average length of
occupancy and waiting lists.
The survey questioned senior executives from 50 hospitals across England in
July, and spanned those from existing trusts, non-trusts and units applying
for trust status.
About 70 per cent said that community relations had remained the same or
worsened since the reforms, and a third said staff morale had deteriorated.
The most significant problems in implementing the reforms included the
adequacy of information, the timetable established, relationships with
purchasers, quality of management and internal resistance. The survey
suggested there was less sharing of information with other hospitals than in
the past.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley offers Maxwell pensioners
Pounds 100m loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday announced measures, including a Pounds 100m
interest free loan to pension schemes, to aid pensioners defrauded by the
late Mr Robert Maxwell.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, made the announcement in
response to a parliamentary question about steps the government is taking to
ease the plight of pensioners. So far, a voluntary trust set up by the
government to solicit donations from the individuals and companies who had
dealings with Mr Maxwell has collected just under Pounds 6m, far short of
the missing Pounds 440m.
Mr Lilley said: 'This measure will not close the gap between the Maxwell
schemes' assets and liabilities. For that, we still need substantial
contributions to the trust.'
The government will also defer indefinitely its obligation to collect from
the various Maxwell company pension schemes reimbursements for payments to
pensioners for the Guaranteed Minimum Pension portion of their individual
pensions.
The government is paying the GMP portions of pensions for Maxwell
pensioners, an amount equal to no more than 20 per cent of each individual's
pension entitlement.
In announcing its loan the government noted that so far liquidators for the
Common Investment Fund operated by Maxwell-controlled Bishopsgate Investment
Management have isolated Pounds 136m in assets belonging to pensioners.
Yesterday Mr Neil Cooper, partner at Robson Rhodes and liquidator of BIM,
gave detailed evidence to a parliamentary select committee about how assets
were diverted from the pension schemes.
Mr Cooper provided the clearest insight to date about how BIM, under two
agreements which it described as 'stock lending', sent assets to securities
firms and banks which were then treated as collateral for loans to Mr
Maxwell's private interests. He said that Pounds 150m disappeared from the
schemes in this way, Pounds 58m of it sent to Credit Suisse and an
additional Pounds 51.3m sent to Lehman Brothers International.
Mr Cooper told the committee: 'I do not accept that these are stock lending
agreements nor that BIM is bound by them.'
While he declined to be drawn on the agreements, he noted that BIM was
effectively a borrower of Treasury bills from Lehman Brothers under the
agreement. BIM, as a fund manager, was not a market maker entitled to borrow
stock under conventional stock lending agreements.
Mr Cooper also said that an analysis of property investments of the combined
pension schemes showed that 21 out of 23 properties were 'inappropriate' for
pension fund investment.

SAVINGS of up to 30 per cent in the cost of the European Fighter Aircraft
project can be achieved, meeting the demands of Britain's partners in the
venture, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, told MPs yesterday.
He said the reductions required by Italy, Germany and Spain to save the EFA
would not affect its military capability. The identification of cost savings
follows government-commissioned studies of the project on which 28,000 UK
jobs depend.
Production costs could be reduced by up to 20 per cent. Further savings, up
to 30 per cent, were possible, he said.
Mr Rifkind expressed the hope that all four countries would continue to take
part in the project. 'Both the Italian and Spanish defence ministers have
indicated that they are very impressed with the savings identified,' he
said.

<TEXT>
CHINA yesterday predicted that Hong Kong would slide into chaos if Governor
Chris Patten refused to back down on his plans for democratic reform, Reuter
reports from Hong Kong.
In a blistering attack published in a Beijing-controlled newspaper, China's
top official responsible for the colony, Lu Ping, promised to fight Mr
Patten to the end over his proposal to let Hong Kong people elect the
majority of their legislature for the first time.
'Should Patten go on doing it his own way, there will certainly be big chaos
in Hong Kong,' the newspaper quoted Lu as saying.
'I can tell everybody that we are now determined to persist with Mr Patten
till the end if that's what he wants,' said Lu, who is director of the Hong
Kong and Macau Affairs Office.
Lu's attack is the latest in a media onslaught begun within minutes of Mr
Patten announcing his proposals on October 7.
Most attacks were anonymous or attributed to relatively junior officials.
But last Friday, shortly after Mr Patten left Beijing after his first visit
as governor, Lu broke his silence by threatening to overturn the Legislative
Council, the advisory cabinet and the judiciary once China takes control in
1997 if Mr Patten refused to back down.
The governor has denied encouraging social turmoil or political unrest. But
in remarks clearly aimed at Lu, he said some people might be trying to do
just that.
He has also consistently challenged China to put forward counter-proposals.
But Lu said: 'I waited more than half a month for Patten to come without
saying a word about his political speech. But during the six-hour meeting, I
talked most of the time and Patten didn't even say a word like 'we will
consider it'.'

FT  28 OCT 92 / Slow pace of talks fuels Palestinians' frustration: One year
on, the negotiations leave a West Bank camp disillusioned and angry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN DAHAISHE refugee camp, just south of Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank,
there are strong feelings about the Middle East peace talks which last week
entered their seventh session since opening in Madrid amid such fanfare one
year ago.
Almost without exception, Dahaishe's 8,200 residents are contemptuous of the
slow-moving process. 'All of us in the camps - the poor people - are against
the talks now,' says 17-year-old Iyad Odeh, whose father Ibrahim was killed
in front of his seven children by a stray Israeli bullet in 1988. 'They will
give us nothing.'
A hunger strike by Palestinian prisoners which ended recently sparked a wave
of violent unrest across the occupied territories of an intensity not seen
since the early years of the five-year intifada, or uprising, against
Israeli rule.
Karima Abeid, whose jailed husband Khalid was on the hunger strike, is
another Dahaishe resident who has little time for the peace talks. 'I don't
believe the Israelis will give us peace. I think they are fooling us. Here
in every house we have people whose lives were destroyed by the Israelis, so
what do you expect?'
Opinions like these haunt members of the Palestinian delegation to the
negotiations. A year after being feted in the streets after their return
from Madrid, they are acutely aware that now there is widespread frustration
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip because so little tangible progress has been
made since.
Opposition in the territories to the talks has been led by two main
movements. The most radical is the Islamic fundamentalists, the leading
organisation of which is Hamas, the main Palestinian power base outside the
secular Palestine Liberation Organisation. The second chiefly comprises two
radical, left-wing PLO factions, the PFLP and the DFLP.
Although there are great ideological tensions between the two, they are
united by their rejection of the terms of the peace talks, which envisage an
interim stage of limited Palestinian self-rule, or autonomy, before further
negotiations start on the final status of the territories.
Fatah, the mainstream PLO faction led by Mr Yassir Arafat, has accepted the
'two stage solution,' believing it offers the only realistic, available
prospect of an eventual independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and
Gaza.
Mr Riad Malki, a leading advocate of the leftist opposition, believes the
failure so far to reach an initial 'autonomy' agreement, despite the advent
earlier this year of a more dovish Israeli government, has enhanced the
standing of the opposition camp. 'We are optimistic that we will represent
the majority of the people and exert pressure to prevent the delegation from
signing an autonomy agreement.'
The thrust of the opposition is that the five-year interim self-government
phase is an Israeli ruse which will become the permanent status quo,
thwarting the Palestinian struggle for full independence.
The weakness of this case lies in the absence of a coherent alternative.
Even Mr Malki admits the Palestinians are in their 'lowest position ever' in
terms of bargaining power to demand immediate transition to statehood. They
have no realistic military option against Israel. All key Arab states,
including previously hostile Syria, are involved in or support the talks.
There is no longer a counterweight to the US, which brokered the process, to
support a tougher Palestinian line.
'The patience of our people is decreasing, that is very clear,' says Mr
Radwan Abu Ayyash, a prominent Fatah supporter. 'The (terms of the) peace
talks are not our preferred choice. But we have no other way.'
He believes Palestinians will accept an agreement based on an initial period
of limited self-rule - if the PLO leadership endorses it clearly as a step
in the direction of statehood and if it comes soon, before support is eroded
any further.
Even in Dahaishe camp, this is grudgingly acknowledged by some residents,
including Karima Abeid. 'If it is going to be a period which leads to a
Palestinian state, then I will support it. I'm with the PLO. But at the end
we must have a state and a full Israeli withdrawal.'

however, that future tours, and the 1995 rugby World Cup, which South Africa
is supposed to host, were at risk.
This week's statement by Mr Mluleki George, president of NOSC, has refocused
attention on the use of sporting boycotts as a political weapon following
the gradual lifting over the past year of the sports moratorium.
Mr George was essentially repeating a point he made in April when he sought
to have the August visit to South Africa by the New Zealand All Blacks
cancelled: namely that the country's rugby authorities pay insufficient
attention to developing the sport, preferring to focus on international
tours.
Mr George's frustration relates to a perception that the South African Rugby
Football Union (SARFU), and rugby supporters in general, have been less than
enthusiastic in embracing the new South Africa. In stark contrast to the
nimble diplomacy practised by leading cricket administrators, rugby
authorities have made little effort to hide their distaste for the ANC's
considerable sporting influence.
Tempting though it may be, however, to try to punish conservative whites by
seeking rugby's isolation, this route is not without problems. Some question
how Mr George can justify such a step when his grievance is more a matter of
style than substance.
For although rugby probably deserves its reactionary image, it has met the
two prerequisites set down for a return to international competition: unity
of administrative structures, and a development programme. On the latter
front, R6m (about Pounds 1.3m) has recently been paid into a development
fund.
Since few blacks play rugby, few are likely to be concerned either way about
Mr George's strictures. Whites are likely to have mixed feelings. Many will
be resentful at the efforts to politically cleanse sport, though there would
probably also be widespread support for the introduction of a younger, more
progressive group of administrators to run the sport.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Amnesty condemns Burmese torture camps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT steps by Burma's military government to release some prisoners,
abolish military tribunals and lift a night-time curfew do not signify
fundamental change in its disregard for human rights, according to a report
by Amnesty International published today.
The human rights organisation says the State Law and Order Restoration
Council (Slorc) has systematically and ruthlessly suppressed dissent since
it assumed power in 1988.
It has held thousands of people either without trial or with unsatisfactory
trials. In addition to widespread arbitrary executions, security forces have
engaged in torture and rape. Amnesty says it knows of 20 'torture centres'.
Tens of thousands have been forced to work as porters for the military, and
many have suffered inhuman treatment. Thousands, particularly from ethnic
minorities, have been driven from their homes and forced into camps.
The Slorc ignored the results of a general election in May 1990 which the
opposition National League for Democracy, won by a landslide. Its leader,
Aung San Suu Kyi, has been under house arrest since July 1989. She was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year.
Amnesty says government policy and military strategy have created a climate
in which gross human rights violations are tolerated - perhaps even
sanctioned.
The organisation calls on Burma to end the death sentence, release political
prisoners or try them fairly, review convictions, investigate allegations of
torture and punish its perpetrators, ratify international human rights
protocols, and introduce human rights protection into its new constitution.
Amnesty urged the Burmese authorities to grant full access to the special
rapporteur appointed by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, who
is due to report to the UN general assembly later this year.
Myanmar: 'No law at all': Human rights violations under military rule.

<TEXT>
ISRAEL positioned more tanks and troops along its border with Lebanon
yesterday in the third day of hostilities between Iranian-backed Hizbollah
guerrillas and Israeli forces.
At least 14 people are believed to have died in the violence. On Monday
night three Israeli gunboats bombarded the Palestinian refugee camp at Nahr
El-Bared in Syrian-controlled northern Lebanon. Yesterday an Israeli
warplane bombed suspected Hizbollah targets in the northern Bekaa Valley.
In the south, Hizbollah fired about 30 Katyusha rockets, some into northern
Israel. It was the first time the fundamentalist guerrillas have targeted
Israeli territory since the assassination by the Israelis of their leader,
Sheikh Abbas Musawi, last February.
The rockets fired by Hizbollah killed a 14-year-old boy in the northern
Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona and a Lebanese school teacher and his
18-month-old son in Rmaich, just north of Israel. United Nations soldiers
yesterday turned back 150 Hizbollah guerrillas who were attempting to reach
Israeli-held territory.
Security sources said at least eight Israeli Cobra helicopter gunships fired
missiles into suspected Hizbollah hiding places in the 440 square mile
'security zone' in southern Lebanon on Monday night. The Israeli artillery
fired 700 rounds into southern Lebanon between Sunday afternoon and dawn
yesterday, when the shelling subsided.
The escalation began when a remote-controlled bomb detonated by a Hizbollah
guerrilla killed five Israeli soldiers on Sunday. A sixth Israeli soldier is
believed to have died from his wounds.
Security sources said they had seen no sign of an Israeli armoured column
with tanks moving into southern Lebanon, as reported by Israeli radio
yesterday. Israel later issued an official denial that there was mass
movement into Lebanon.
The Lebanese army - which usually refrains from involvement in
Hizbollah-Israeli battles - has cancelled all leave and told its troops to
rejoin their units. Lebanese troops fired artillery rounds towards Israeli
positions that were shelling civilian areas near Nabatiyeh late on Monday.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S industrial production rose 4.6 per cent in September, compared with
a month earlier, but Mr Tsutomu Hata, the minister of finance, warned that
an expected economic recovery would not be seen until at least early next
year.
The increase in the seasonally adjusted industrial production index followed
a 4.2 per cent fall in August.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) said that the
increase last month suggested that the reduction of inventories was nearing
completion.
However, Miti forecast that industrial production would fall by 2.4 per cent
in October and a further 1 per cent in November.
The producers' shipment index rose 4.8 per cent in September, reflecting the
production increase, while the inventory of finished goods index was down
1.2 per cent cent.
Mr Hata said that opposition parties had shown support for an emergency
economic package announced in late August, and were not likely to delay the
measures at a parliamentary session beginning this week. Japanese executives
are concerned that the package will be derailed by debate on the scandals
afflicting the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
The minister said a decline in personal consumption had caused concern in
the government, and Miti figures released yesterday for large retailer sales
showed a 2.9 per cent fall in September, compared with a year earlier.
Miti said department store sales declined for the seventh consecutive month,
while sales at supermakets were lower for the second month in a row.
Discussion of the trends in personal consumption also dominated a quarterly
gathering of Bank of Japan regional managers, most of whom reported that
local residents were buying cheaper goods and delaying large purchases.
The three-day meeting, which began yesterday, will be used as an important
guide by the bank on the direction of monetary policy.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN ministers of the European Community and the Association of
South-East Asian Nations meet this week without being able to make progress
on a planned new co-operation agreement.
Negotiations on a new accord, to replace one signed in 1980, were halted
earlier this year because of Portugal's opposition to Indonesia's human
rights record in the former Portuguese colony of East Timor.
Friday's meeting in Manila, to be chaired by Britain as EC president, will
attempt to circumvent the impasse temporarily by attaching new areas of
co-operation to existing arrangements.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, will arrive in Manila on Friday but
Mr Alastair Goodlad, foreign office minister responsible for the region,
will stand in for him in earlier sessions.
The inability to proceed with a new accord, due to include provisions for
resolving trade disputes and on European Investment Bank lending, is
frustrating for both sides.
At the Manila meeting, the EC and Asean are expected to agree on an enhanced
consultative mechanism under which trade experts will meet more frequently.
Access of Asean members to EIB lending is also expected to be supported,
though not to the extent which would be possible under a full new agreement.
Portugal and Indonesia are discussing their differences over East Timor,
which was annexed by Indonesia in 1975, under the auspices of the United
Nations secretary-general. Indonesian troops shot dead at least 50 civilian
protestors in Dili, the territory's capital, last November.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Political splintering to accelerate: Rejection of
constitutional reform likely to fuel infighting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA has tried no fewer than six times over the past 25 years to rewrite
its constitution. Each attempt has ended in failure or has hurt feelings
somewhere in the country.
It is thus not surprising that most politicians reacted to the resounding No
vote to the latest package of reforms by asserting it would be a long time
before they were willing to sit down again at a constitutional bargaining
table. The Canadian people are suffering an equally acute case of
'constitutional fatigue'.
But the chances are slim the issues at the heart of Monday's referendum  -
namely Quebec's demands for more power, the western provinces' sense of
alienation from the rest of the country, aboriginal self-government, and the
abolition of non-tariff barriers between the 10 provinces - will disappear.
Instead, the players involved in each issue are likely to search in coming
months for other ways to realise their goals. The result could be further
fragmentation of the Canadian political process, as regional groupings and
special interest groups turn up the volume on their demands.
The main battleground will almost certainly be Quebec. A jubilant Mr Jacques
Parizeau, leader of the separatist Parti Quebecois, saw the 56 per cent vote
against the Charlottetown reform package in the French-speaking province as
a mandate for nationalists to step up the sovereignty drive.
'We can now determine our future without being frightened again,' Mr
Parizeau said on Monday night.
By contrast, Mr Robert Bourassa, Quebec's Liberal premier, is firmly in the
federalist camp. 'We cannot conceive that disintegration of the federation
would be an advantage to Quebecois,' he said. Mr Bourassa faces the tough
job of convincing the electorate they have something to gain by remaining
within Canada.
Voters in other parts of the country showed on Monday that Quebec cannot
expect any special favours - such as the Charlottetown agreement's provision
of a permanent 25 per cent share of House of Commons seats. Mr Bourassa must
call an election within two years and, despite his heavy defeat in the
referendum vote, it is by no means certain he will meet the same fate in an
election.
The separatists have yet to translate the rejection of the Charlottetown
agreement into enthusiasm for independence. Despite the referendum result,
opinion polls show that support for a break-up of the country has actually
flagged in recent months.
Canada's 700,000 aboriginal people, who would have been among the main
beneficiaries of the Charlottetown deal, will also not take the referendum
result lying down. The package promised them a right to self-government,
enforceable by the courts after five years. Indian and Inuit leaders plan to
press as hard as ever for greater autonomy for their communities.
Ripples from the referendum will certainly be felt in federal politics as
the next general election, which must be held by November 1993, draws
closer.
The Bloc Quebecois, the federal wing of the Parti Quebecois, is hoping the
No vote in the referendum will translate into substantially higher
representation in the House of Commons. Any gains by the wing would be at
the expense of the ruling Progressive Conservatives, who currently hold a
majority of Quebec seats.
The Conservatives also have much to lose from defections to the
Alberta-based Reform party, which fought the Charlottetown Accord on the
grounds that it offered too much to Quebec. Since its inception four years
ago the Reform party has captured wide support in western Canada, with a
populist platform rejecting official bilingualism and wanting a stronger
voice for the west in Ottawa.
All three national parties - the Conservatives, the Liberals and the New
Democrats - thus face the prospect of a more divided and fractious
parliament after the next election. In the meantime the Conservatives, who
have held office at the federal level since September 1984, have the most
soul-searching to do in the months ahead.
In particular, Mr Brian Mulroney, Canada's prime minister, is expected to
give careful consideration to his future. Canadians have developed an
intense dislike for him, and his accomplishments - such as the dismantling
of restrictive energy policies, the US-Canada free trade agreement and a
sharp fall in the inflation rate - have done nothing to endear him to the
electorate.
In some cases, such as free trade and low inflation, Canadians see his
policies not as accomplishments but as a threat to living standards. One of
the reasons why voters rejected the Charlottetown pact was that many of them
identified it as Mr Mulroney's deal.
Unless the prime minister can reverse his poor public image, political
observers expect him to come under growing pressure to fall on his sword for
the sake of the Conservatives' chances in the next general election.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Tough challenge for Quebec's separatist leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUEBEC'S separatist leaders were jubilant yesterday at the resounding No
vote delivered in Monday's constitutional referendum, claiming the next
referendum in the mostly French-speaking province would be on creating a new
country.
Mr Jacques Parizeau, head of the separatist Parti Quebecois, said the only
options were separation of the province from the rest of Canada or a
massively revised federal arrangement.
'This time we said what we didn't want, the next time we will say what we
want,' Mr Parizeau told cheering crowds on Monday night. 'Quebecois are a
people, they are a nation, and very soon they will be a country.'
Monday's vote will strengthen the party's hand, analysts say, but its
leadership still faces a tremendous challenge in converting this to votes in
the next provincial election, which must take place by 1994 although it
could come earlier.
Mr Robert Bourassa, the province's Liberal prime minister, must now try to
tailor his message to gain the support of those who voted to reject the
constitutional package, which he supported. At a rally late on Monday, Mr
Bourassa defended the idea of keeping Quebec in the confederation with the
rest of Canada.
'We believe we will be able to build Quebec within Canada. That is the
policy of the Liberal party,' he said. 'I am convinced we will continue to
advance the cause of Quebec.'
Mr Bourassa, who boycotted any negotiations with the federal government and
the English-speaking provinces for about two years, put much of his
popularity and support on the line by returning to the bargaining table.
However, rejection of the Charlottetown Accord does not mean most
francophone Quebecois have abandoned hope for rejoining the Canadian
federation. They clearly want a better deal and one that provides them with
far more autonomy and more security as a French-speaking society.
Hard-core separatists in Quebec, the polls consistently show, represent not
much more than 20 per cent of the population.
And although many voters snubbed an accord they regarded as being dictated
by the nine English-speaking provinces, they were also expressing their
dissatisfaction with the federal government's economic policies.
Quebec has a 12 per cent unemployment rate and Montreal, particularly, has
been hard hit by industrial restructuring.
The province is 80 per cent French speaking and the No side prevailed in
almost all the francophone ridings and in Montreal, which represents nearly
half the total population of 6.5m.
Only the primarily English-speaking ridings in the western sector of
Montreal delivered a majority for the Yes camp.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS leaders in the EC have given President George Bush a narrow
endorsement, with 40 per cent saying he would be better for European
business than either of his rivals for the White House, Our Foreign Staff
writes.
An opinion poll of more than 1,400 business leaders in seven Community
countries put him five points ahead of Mr Bill Clinton. Mr Ross Perot was
backed by only 1 per cent, although he did re-enter the race after
interviewing had begun. The poll was conducted by Harris Research for the
UPS Europe Business Monitor. The preference for Mr Bush was strongest in the
UK, with 69 per cent indicating that he was the candidate who would do
business in Europe the most good, or anyway the least harm.
However, Mr Clinton was the favourite in four countries - France, Italy,
Belgium and the Netherlands (the last two were accorded a smaller weighting
in the poll). Germany backed the incumbent, by a 14-point margin.
Respondents in Spain found nothing to choose between the two men.

Mr Di Tella said no date had been agreed for the visit but he expected it

Preparations for a visit to Britain by President Carlos Menem and bilateral
issues - notably the Falkland islands - are likely to head the two

However, British officials fear a visit by Mr Menem would add to Prime
Minister John Major's political headaches. The government could face
criticism from within Conservative ranks if it was seen to be making

EL SALVADOR'S government has agreed to extend to December 15 the deadline by
which the country's former rebels demobilise, thereby breaking the impasse
that had threatened to scupper peace accords signed in January, writes
Damian Fraser.
FMLN rebels had agreed to demobilise by October 31, but missed deadlines
after claiming the state had not complied with pledges to give them land and
reform the military.
Under the new guidelines, 20 per cent of the forces will be demobilised on
October 31, another 20 per cent on November 20, and the final 20 per cent on
December 15. The government has in turn submitted to the UN proposals to
purge army officers found guilty of, among other transgressions, human

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE flight of capital from Canada, which many economists and bankers
predicted would follow a No vote in Monday's referendum, was nowhere to be
seen yesterday.
Instead, the Canadian dollar rose strongly, bonds staged a spirited rally
and banks cut their prime lending rate by half a percentage point to 7.75
per cent.
The chief economist at one Toronto securities firm said financial markets
had not only discounted the outcome of the referendum through a surge of
interest rates during the campaign, but did not view the negative vote as an
inevitable boost for Quebec separatists.
'The market doesn't care about the Charlottetown deal; it only cares about
Quebec separating,' he said.
However, Mr Ravi Bulchandani, senior economist at Goldman Sachs in New York,
cautioned that 'a slightly higher risk premium on Canadian financial
instruments is now probably a fact of life'.
Bond market analysts expect this risk to be factored into the price of
long-term bonds. While the spread between short-term US and Canadian
interest rates narrowed sharply yesterday, the gap on 30-year bonds was
virtually unchanged at 1.5 percentage points.
Interest rates are expected to drop further today at the weekly setting of
the Bank of Canada's bellwether bank rate. The rate stood at 7.37 per cent
last week, and could drop by a full percentage point today.
This would erase about half the increase which took place in September and
October as the central bank raised interest rates to defend a weakening
Canadian dollar. The Canadian dollar soared by almost half a cent yesterday
morning and finished the day at close to 81 US cents.
While a Yes vote might have led to an even bigger drop in interest rates,
economists are confident that bearish political factors will be overshadowed
over the next few months by Canada's bullish economic trends.
The inflation rate is running at just over 1 per cent, the lowest among
industrial countries, and the economy remains mired in recession. One
economist said yesterday the authorities were anxious to bring interest
rates down as quickly as possible in the hope of boosting consumer demand
during the Christmas season.

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN business leaders and many politicians yesterday called for a pause
in the long efforts to rewrite the constitution, and said attention should
be focused on the faltering economy, following the unequivocal rejection of
a constitutional reform package in Monday's referendum.
Mr Brian Mulroney, the prime minister, responded sombrely to the snub from
the electorate: 'The accord is history. . . the problems that faced us as a
nation remain,' he said. Those problems, he warned, could not be resolved
'in the foreseeable future at least, through constitutional reform.'
The Business Council on National Issues, which represents the chief
executives of 150 of Canada's biggest companies, called for an indefinite
deferral of any further attempt at comprehensive constitutional reform.
The council urged political leaders to turn instead to more flexible forms
of negotiation. It added that Canadian business's priority was to 'get the
economy moving and growing again'.
The extent of the No victory in the referendum was far greater than opinion
polls had projected. A majority of voters in six of Canada's 10 provinces
rejected the deal, known as the Charlottetown Accord, which was hammered out
in August by Mr Mulroney and leaders of all provinces.
Quebec separatists took heart from the province's vote against reform by a
margin of 56 to 42 per cent, vowing to translate the rejection into a drive
for independence for the francophone province.
Mr Jacques Parizeau of the Parti Quebecois and Mr Lucien Bouchard of its
federal affiliate, the Bloc Quebecois, plan to push Mr Robert Bourassa, the
province's Liberal premier, to hold a general election in the province as
soon as possible. If they win they have promised another referendum
specifically on sovereignty.
Voters in Ontario, where about a third of Canada's population lives,
approved the deal by only the narrowest of margins. Only three small
Atlantic provinces, which depend heavily on the federal government for
transfer payments, recorded an unequivocal Yes.
Those in favour of the deal, which was a carefully balanced compromise
between the demands of Quebec, western Canada and aboriginal people, found a
crumb of consolation, however, in the fact that the No vote was not confined
to any single region or population group.
Political analysts had warned that the worst possible outcome for Canadian
unity would have been strong support for the agreement in English Canada and
opposition in Quebec, or vice versa.
The most vocal opponents of the deal were Quebec separatists, who claimed it
offered the province too little, and western Canadian groups, who said it
gave Quebec too much. But many Canadians appear to have used their
referendum votes to vent their anger against the political and business
establishment in general over the recession and a range of unpopular
government policies.
Observers cautioned that the decisive No victory did not necessarily
indicate support in Quebec for a breakaway from Canada. However, Mr Bob Rae,
Ontario's premier, warned that Canadians were 'quite wrong' if they thought
separatism and other tensions would disappear.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Dirty tricks claim backfires on Perot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were signs yesterday that Mr Ross Perot's unsubstantiated charges of
dirty tricks against President George Bush's presidential campaign were
beginning to hurt the independent candidate in the eyes of the US
electorate, writes Jurek Martin in Washington.
The two latest public opinion polls, by ABC News and CNN/USA Today, restored
a double digit lead, 11 points in both cases, to Governor Bill Clinton, the
Democratic candidate. Both had Mr Perot at less than 20 per cent, while the
head of Gallup said in an interview his surveys found that support for the
independent candidate had peaked and that his 'favourable' ratings had
stopped going up.
Mr Bush yesterday described Mr Perot's charges that there was a Republican
plot to disrupt his daughter's wedding as 'crazy'. He thought Mr Perot's
self-financed campaign was, historically, 'most unusual' and, generally, 'a
little bizarre'. Throughout his swing through North Carolina on Monday, Mr
Clinton confined himself to disparaging both his opponents for apparently
investigating each other's children.
Media reports and commentaries have turned savagely critical of Mr Perot
who, in turn, has been critical of the media. Both the New York Times and
the Washington Post, in editorials, found it incredible he should now invent
another reason for leaving the race in July. The Times referred to 'traits
that bear directly on his fitness for office,' while the Post wondered about
his 'startling belief in secret manoeuvrings against him by malign forces
worldwide'.
If Mr Perot's popularity starts falling, the logical beneficiary is Mr
Clinton, who has been hurt most by his rise. Amid the latest polling
volatility, Mr Bush's support has remained flat, in the low 30s, while Mr
Clinton's has dropped from the upper to the lower 40s.
In his TV interview yesterday, Mr Bush expressed confidence he would win
next Tuesday because he felt he had earned the trust of the country, which
Mr Clinton had not. Asked if he liked Mr Clinton, he smiled and said: 'Yeah,
and I think he likes me.'
On the stump in New Mexico the president sought to lift the level of the
campaign in a speech about the economic and philosophical differences
between him and Mr Clinton. He described himself as a 'conservative
activist' and laid claim to some of the populist traits of both his
opponents.

FT  28 OCT 92 / El Salvador deal lifts peace hopes

<TEXT>
EL SALVADOR'S government has agreed to extend to December 15 the deadline by
which the country's former rebels demobilise, thereby breaking the impasse
that had threatened to scupper peace accords signed in Mexico City on
January 15, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City.
The FMLN rebels had originally agreed to demobilise by October 31, but
missed two deadlines after claiming the government had not complied with
pledges to give them land and reform the military.
Under the new guidelines, 20 per cent of the forces will be demobilised on
October 31, another 20 per cent on November 20, and the final 20 per cent on
December 15.
The government has in turn submitted to the UN proposals to purge army
officers found guilty of, among other transgressions, human rights abuses.
The confidential list of transgressors is reported to be more far-reaching
than many expected, and is said to include General Rene Emilio Ponce, the
Minister of Defence, his deputy and more than 100 senior and middle-ranking
officers.
Although some 40,000 civilians were killed in El Salvador's 12-year civil
war, only one senior officer has been imprisoned for human rights abuses.
The government's ability to purge the army is seen as a key test of whether
the army can be brought under civilian control, and will influence foreign
aid to El Salvador.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Perot claims of electoral 'dirty tricks' backfire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were signs yesterday that Mr Ross Perot's unsubstantiated charges of
dirty tricks against President George Bush's presidential campaign were
beginning to hurt him in the eyes of the US electorate, writes Jurek Martin
in Washington.
The two latest public opinion polls, by ABC News and CNN/USA Today, restored
a double digit lead, 11 points in both cases, to Governor Bill Clinton, the
Democratic candidate. Both had Mr Perot at less than 20 per cent, while the
head of Gallup said in an interview his surveys found that support for the
independent candidate had peaked and that his 'favourable' ratings has
stopped going up.
Mr Bush yesterday described Mr Perot's charges that there was a Republican
plot to disrupt his daughter's wedding as 'crazy'. He thought Mr Perot's
self-financed campaign was, historically, 'most unusual' and, generally, 'a
little bizarre'. Throughout his swing through North Carolina on Monday, Mr
Clinton confined himself to disparaging both his opponents for apparently
investigating each other's children.
Media reports and commentaries have turned savagely critical of Mr Perot
who, in turn, has been critical of the media. Both the New York Times and
the Washington Post, in editorials, found it incredible he should now invent
another reason for leaving the race in July. The Times referred to 'traits
that bear directly on his fitness for office,' while the Post wondered about
his 'startling belief in secret manoeuvrings against him by malign forces
worldwide'.
The condemnation of the political columnists has been almost universal.
Mr David Broder of the Washington Post, who had reported favourably on Mr
Perot's post-debate surge only last week, wrote yesterday that the
candidate's behaviour was 'odd and disturbing'. Mr A. M. Rosenthal in the
New York Times urged Mr Clinton and Mr Bush to stop treating Mr Perot with
deference so that he did not continue to blight US political life.
If Mr Perot's popularity starts falling, the logical beneficiary is Mr
Clinton, who has been hurt most by his rise. Amid the latest polling
volatility, Mr Bush's support has remained flat, in the low 30s, while Mr
Clinton's has dropped from the upper to the lower 40s.
In his TV interview yesterday, Mr Bush expressed confidence he would win
next Tuesday because he felt he had earned the trust of the country, which
Mr Clinton had not. Asked if he liked Mr Clinton, he smiled and said: 'Yeah,
and I think he likes me.'
On the stump in New Mexico the president sought to lift the level of the
campaign in a speech about the economic and philosophical differences
between him and Mr Clinton. He described himself as a 'conservative
activist' and laid claim to some of the populist traits of both his
opponents.
This was apparently the speech long promised for delivery by Mr James Baker,
the hitherto invisible White House chief of staff who is now accompanying Mr
Bush on his travels. It was deemed better for the president to voice it so
as to avoid the implication that he is weak on economic issues.
Mr Clinton, while never misses a chance to condemn 'trickle down economics',
has also been pushing his vision of a participatory economic democracy.
Throughout his North Carolina bus trip he sought to portray himself as a
non-conventional Democrat whose message was: 'We're going to empower people
to take control of their own lives, then hold them accountable for doing
so.'

EUROPEAN Community and other steel exporters yesterday accused US steel
producers of 'trade harassment' in mounting a series of anti-dumping and
anti-subsidy actions.
The 84 petitions by US producers, 38 directed against EC members, were filed
after talks on a multilateral steel accord collapsed, the EC told Gatt's
anti-dumping committee yesterday. The EC urged the US to scrap the actions.
The suits, involving 21 countries, had been filed though no increase in
steel exports to the US had occurred, and prices of EC steel were higher
than US producers', the EC said. About 2m tonnes of EC steel exports worth
Dollars 800m (Pounds 490.7m) a year were affected by the petitions.
The US was using its anti-dumping procedures to harass foreign competitors,
the EC claimed. It questioned if methods being used to assess dumping were
in line with Gatt's anti-dumping code. But under Gatt rules, the US action
cannot be legally challenged until duties are definitively imposed. The
complaints were echoed by other steel exporters, including Japan, Brazil and
Mexico.

EUROPEAN hopes of a final breakthrough in the Uruguay Round of world trade
talks were rekindled last night after the US signalled to the European
Community it was prepared to look at new ways to resolve the oilseeds row.
Chances of a deal had virtually collapsed at 2am yesterday, after Mr Ray
MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, told Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture
secretary, he could settle the oilseeds row only inside the framework of
reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) agreed unanimously by the EC
this summer. Mr Madigan said this would be insufficient to satisfy the US
soyabean lobby, and there was nothing further to discuss.
But later Mr Madigan contacted the EC side to indicate US willingness to
offer new oilseeds proposals.
Mr Madigan and Mr MacSharry are now expected to meet in the US this week to
try for political agreement on the Uruguay Round.
At the same time, however, Ms Carol Brookins, a US agriculture consultant
with close ties to the administration, cautioned that Mr Madigan would not
meet Mr MacSharry unless there was a possibility of substantial progress.
Yesterday's development offered the first clear sign of a deal. 'We are
continuing to negotiate for a solution politically acceptable to both of
us,' Mr MacSharry and Mr Madigan stated.
Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, was convinced a farm
deal was in reach.
This would pave the way for reform in the 15 trade sectors that the
108-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) has been
negotiating for six years.
Failure could unleash a trade war, with the US threatening punitive tariffs
on EC food exports and the EC retaliating. Yesterday the US seemed ready to
delay sanctions, but Ms Brookins said President George Bush had merely
delayed the move until after the US elections because he did not want to be
seen as acting just for electoral reasons.
The US wants the EC to cut its subsidised oilseeds output to 9m tonnes this
year. Mr MacSharry says the EC can deliver only what is in the CAP reform -
the price and production cuts now Community law.
Ivor Owen, Parliamentary Correspondent, adds: Prime Minister John Major
confirmed that in the last few days he had been in close touch with other
leaders in the EC and the US to urge early resumption of the Gatt talks.
The two sides were in touch and the US was 'holding off from taking trade
retaliation', he said.

FT  28 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Caricom faces its moment of truth -
Inability to create a valid customs union could spell disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 19 years of limited progress towards the creation of a regional common
market, the Caribbean Economic Community now faces its moment of truth. At
an extraordinary summit starting today, community leaders will, in effect,
decide whether or not the group can survive. They must establish if they can
create a valid customs union, which all members agree is a prerequisite for
the elusive common market.
The community, made up of 13 English-speaking countries, has been trying to
create the customs union for the past three years. Now there are veiled
warnings from technocrats and business leaders that little hope exists for
any meaningful integration of regional economies if it does not get it right
this time. Caricom could disintegrate. All members agree on the need for a
customs union, but the community is riven by differences over new tariff
levels, and whether changes should be made to the regime already implemented
by some countries. Problems have been compounded by perceived pressure from
the US and international financial institutions for large tariff cuts.
The common external tariff imposes low rates of duty on imports not
competing with goods produced within the community, but sets high rates on
any imports likely to injure domestic industry. Under the tariff, the
highest rate of duty within the community is 45 per cent, the lowest 5 per
cent. This replaced a structure in which tariffs ranged from 5 to 70 per
cent. Rates differ where the imports are raw materials or finished products,
with agricultural products given protection, while inputs for agriculture
are subject to low tariffs.
Some governments, such as Jamaica, say the tariff levels must be cut because
they are out of step with global tendencies to deregulated trade. Jamaica's
proposal for the then highest rate to be cut to 20 per cent started the
debate within Caricom and led to next week's summit. Other countries argue
tariff rates are higher than those they have been using, and must be reduced
because they are inflationary.
Mr George Price, premier of Belize, says the tariff rates must stay because
any change would hit small, open economies like his. He is willing to
consider tariff cuts at some stage, but gradually and on a set timetable.
Other countries backing retention of the tariff levels say their industries
need protection. Many depend heavily on customs revenue to support their
fiscal budgets; some argue than any, even marginal, tariff-rate cuts will
set back their efforts to balance their budgets. The narrow tax base of most
Caricom countries does not offer any alternative source of revenue.
The argument for retention of the tariff levels is supported by the region's
business leaders. Reducing the levels, they say, will cause extensive
dislocation and business closures in many countries in the community. The
business leaders recently concluded some governments were having a
'defeatist reaction' to criticism of the tariff levels, and were acting with
'indecent haste' because of external pressure. Evidence exists that the
community is being pressed from outside. Mr Erskine Sandiford, prime
minister of Barbados, has attributed a recent difficulty his administration
faced in concluding credit agreements with the International Monetary Fund,
the World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank to their wishes that
the highest tariff be cut at once to 20 per cent.
The US objection to Caricom's tariff levels is uncompromising. Mr Myles
Frechette, assistant US trade representative for Latin America and the
Caribbean, has repeatedly criticised the community. 'One of our concerns is
that the highest tariff rate is 45 per cent,' he said. 'In Central and South
America, the maximum is 20 per cent.' The leaders at today's summit will
worsen their problems if they attempt a compromise filled with derogations,
satisfying neither regional nor external critics. Failure to find a solution
will put the region's fragile economies at a disadvantage in a world moving
to deregulated trade and trade blocs.
Ironically, the summit was called to discuss not the common tariff but a
report by a commission headed by Sir Sridath Ramphal, former Commonwealth
secretary-general, on ways to integrate community economies further. There
will be little hope for further integration unless differences over tariff
levels are resolved.

FT  28 OCT 92 / World Trade News: US 'risks selling off airline industry to
foreign carriers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, yesterday warned the US
government it risked 'selling off the US airline industry' to foreign
carriers if it approved the Dollars 750m (Pounds 460m) investment by British
Airways in USAir without securing equal competitive opportunities in the UK
for US airlines.
His warning came amid growing signs that both the US and UK governments want
to accelerate talks to liberalise air transport between the two countries,
clearing the way for BA's acquisition of a 44 per cent stake in USAir.
US and UK negotiators resumed talks in Washington yesterday in an apparent
effort to reach an agreement before next week's US Presidential election.
This has worried the big US carriers including American, United Airlines and
Delta Air Lines, which are pressing their government not to rush into any
compromise likely to undermine their competitive position against BA.
In London yesterday, Mr Crandall said proposals tabled by both the US and UK
were unacceptable because they did not provide equal opportunities for US
carriers.
Mr Crandall, who was due to hold talks yesterday with Mr John MacGregor, UK
transport secretary, said any agreement should enable US carriers to have
open access to London's Heathrow airport, including necessary landing slots
to operate new services.
'What we are asking is simply to fly all the places where BA can fly,' he
said. 'We want to fly a lot of long-haul services from the US into Heathrow
and east of Heathrow in direct competition with BA.'
The US and the UK are considering phasing in open skies in exchange for
allowing BA to acquire its stake in USAir. Mr Crandall said air services
between the two countries should be totally and immediately liberalised.
American Airlines was not interested in acquiring a large stake in any
European carrier because none could offer access to the same number of
passengers as USAir would offer BA. 'The US domestic market accounts for 40
per cent of the world market.'
He claimed the big three US carriers would collectively lose Dollars 500m a
year in revenues if the BA-USAir deal went ahead without a balanced UK-US
liberalisation agreement. 'Both our workers and our stockholders would
suffer.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has told the groups which set Europe's technical
standards they must make those norms available to all users on fair,
reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, or risk losing their privileged
status.
The Commission's warning is contained in a paper published yesterday, which
tries to reconcile the often contradictory requirements of efficient
standardisation and intellectual property rights. The Commission believes
the process of standardisation is essential to achievement of the single
market. It has encouraged a small number of European standards institutes to
develop common European standards, giving priority to high-technology areas
such as telecommunications.
The Brussels paper says 'all persons wishing to use European standards must
be given access to these'. If standards bodies discriminate against
outsiders, for example, Japanese companies wanting to break into the EC
market, recognition of the standard under EC law could be withdrawn, or the
status of the standardisation institute 'reviewed', the Commission adds.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH American insurance companies will face potentially steep increases in
premium rates when they come to renew annual reinsurance programmes in
London over the next few weeks.
Underwriters at Lloyd's of London and in the wider company market have been
stung into action by losses from Hurricane Andrew, which devastated parts of
Florida and Louisiana in August.
'For the primary insurer the message for the future is simple. Reinsurance
is going to become scarcer and more expensive to buy,' Mr Dick Hazell,
deputy chairman of Lloyd's told a meeting of US insurers yesterday.
Insured losses from Andrew were recently estimated at Dollars 10.2bn (Pounds
6.2bn), but brokers and underwriters believe losses could exceed Dollars
14bn. Reinsurers can expect to pick up Dollars 8bn of the bill, with the
London market bearing up to 30 per cent of the cost. Mr Hazell said the
London market would offer less cover and higher limits. Policy terms and
conditions could be tightened.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community must strengthen the rights of the consumer,
streamline its laws, and make its decision-making more open to the public if
the single market is to be a success, according to a report requested by the
European Commission.
The long-awaited Sutherland report also calls for an ombudsman at EC level
or in each member state, possible compulsory courses in EC law for judges,
and an effort to allow individuals to seek redress in foreign courts in
certain single market disputes.
The Sutherland report - named after Mr Peter Sutherland, the former EC
competition commissioner, who chaired the study - is a comprehensive
investigation into how to make the single market fair, efficient and
user-friendly when it comes into force on January 1, 1993. It will be
presented to internal market ministers on November 10. It seeks to balance
member states' fears about an allegedly overbearing Brussels bureaucracy and
the need for effective policing of the single market to ensure that it
works.
Among the report's most important recommendations to avoid fragmentation of
the single market is a 'deeper partnership' between the Commission and
member states, mainly through officials working on an informal basis.
Despite some fears in Brussels that this might lead to unsatisfactory
trade-offs between countries, the committee believes that this balance is
the best practical application of 'subsidiarity'.
Other recommendations are:
Consultation at 'the earliest possible stage' by the Commission before it
proposes legislation.
Systematic consolidation of EC law and creation of a legislative
co-ordination unit inside the Commission to prevent unnecessary overlap.
Provision by states and Brussels of informal advice on redress for breaches
of EC law to those requesting it.
The rejection, at this stage, of a central clearing house to collect data on
infringements of the single market.
A new communications strategy to sell the single market's benefits. The
report notes that the EC has singularly failed in its efforts to promote the
Maastricht treaty.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Delors calls for joint effort to head off slump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CO-ORDINATED economic growth package for Europe to head off a potential
1930s-style slump is being urged on EC leaders by Mr Jacques Delors, the
European Commission president. Amid concern about the deteriorating economic
situation in Germany and its impact on faltering Italy and Britain, Mr
Delors is pressing leaders to discuss measures to reinforce monetary
co-operation, boost investment, and revive confidence.
Without such action, he believes, public support for the Maastricht treaty
on European political and monetary union will ebb further, casting doubts on
the goal of a single European currency by the end of the century.
In a speech yesterday to the European parliament in Strasbourg, Mr Delors
called for a debate on growth at the Edinburgh summit in December. He is
backed by Mr Henning Christophersen, financial affairs commissioner, who
said last week that the worsening situation should be at the 'core' of the
summit.
So far, however, Mr Delors feels he has been 'muzzled' by EC leaders worried
about the impact of comments on the financial markets, according to close
colleagues.
Britain's cool reaction has also been disappointing, according to a senior
Commission official. Mr Delors is understood to share some of Mr John
Major's concerns about the functioning of the exchange rate mechanism in the
run-up to the withdrawal of sterling and the Italian lira last month.
Mr Delors is said to be less impressed with Mr Major's solo effort to
kick-start growth, believing that a co-ordinated strategy inside the EC
would be far more effective. He has ordered staff, therefore, to prepare an
intensive analysis of the ERM crisis as well as new ideas to break the
deflationary cycle in Europe, to be presented if possible in Edinburgh.
His case for a new growth EC strategy amounts partly to a political comeback
after several bitter disappointments. 'He wants to reassert his influence,'
said an aide. But his initiative is also a recognition that the Maastricht
treaty's economic convergence criteria are leading inexorably toward
deflation in Europe, particularly in countries with large budget deficits
such as Italy.
He is therefore warning fellow commissioners that without compensatory
'cohesion' financing for the poorer EC members, there could be a
'catastrophe'. This financing is the centrepiece of the Delors II package
for increasing the EC's budget.

GERMAN car and commercial vehicle production will fall 7 per cent next year
as the national economy reaches the low-point of the current downturn, Mr
Karl Heinrich Oppenlander, president of the Ifo economics institute, said
yesterday.
Industrial production will fall 2 per cent, following a 1 per cent drop this
year, he said in a speech in Munich.
The sectors worst hit this year will show further, albeit smaller, declines.
Engineering, heading for a 6 per cent fall in output this year (the industry
association forecasts 5 per cent), will see production fall by up to 4 per
cent in 1993, Mr Oppenlander said.
Textiles would suffer similar falls, while clothing manufacturers, facing a
12 per cent fall this year, can expect a 4 per cent reduction next.
Claiming that the motor industry faced 'the hour of truth' as the
long-expected downturn came, he added that 'the automobile bosses are
prepared'. The industry association recently estimated that the total
workforce must be cut by 200,000 in the next few years. Mercedes-Benz has
already shed more than 10,000 workers this year.
Mr Oppenlander, who forecast a 'slight' economic recovery in the second half
of next year, accused the Bundesbank of keeping interest rates high for too
long and strangling the economy. However, he expected reductions in leading
rates before the end of the year.
East Germany's loss-making Eko steel plant on the Polish border is to be
rescued with an estimated DM1bn (Pounds 409m) in German and EC public funds
to prevent the economic collapse of the region, writes Leslie Colitt in
Berlin.
The decision was triggered when Krupp, the Ruhr-based steel group, said
yesterday it could not uphold an earlier offer to take over Eko because of
the depressed state of the European steel market.
A Treuhand official said the privatisation agency and the state of
Brandenburg would pay DM500m towards the rescue. The other DM500m would come
from the Bonn government and the EC. The money would be used for a new
electric steelmill and hot rolling mill which Krupp had intended to finance
with the Treuhand and Brandenburg.
Eko has 4,500 employees and is the main employer in the region.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Russia says IMF talks may be postponed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TALKS scheduled for mid-November between the Russian government and the
International Monetary Fund are likely to be postponed until next year
because of the worsening political climate in the country.
Mr Alexei Mozhin, head of the department for relations with international
financial institutions, said yesterday that 'normally we would have a
timetable fixed for negotiations with the fund - but the political
uncertainties in the country now make it impossible'.
The IMF negotiating team is scheduled to return to Moscow on November 10 for
the talks, which are critically important for the Russian economy.
Mr Mozhin said the government still 'would like to have an agreement with
the IMF as soon as possible'. So far, only Dollars 1bn of a promised Dollars
24bn package of support has been released by the IMF. A further allocation
of Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn can be paid only when the terms of a standby
agreement have been reached.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister with responsibility for
foreign economic relations, said yesterday that the monthly inflation target
agreed with the IMF earlier this year, of 9 per cent, was unlikely to be
reached, and that actual inflation could be double that. He warned that if
the government was forced to index pensions and stipends and double the
minimum wage, as decreed by the Russian parliament earlier this month, then
'we could slide into hyperinflation'.
Talks will start today in Paris on the former Soviet debt, variously
estimated between Dollars 70bn and Dollars 80bn. The Russian side will say
that it has practically no hard currency reserves, and that it can pay only
between Dollars 2.5bn and Dollars 3bn next year, with even that dependent on
the receipt of credits.
Mr Mozhin said the expected financing gap for next year, worked out by the
IMF and the government, was 'dozens of billions of dollars'. It included the
scheduled debt repayments for 1993 of Dollars 20bn, arrears from this year
estimated at around Dollars 8bn and a widening trade gap.
The rouble again plunged in trading in Moscow yesterday, losing 25 points
from Thursday's level to stand at Rbs393 to the dollar. It now stands at a
little over a third of its rate in July of 135 per dollar.

FT  28 OCT 92 / German economists see gloomy outlook: Institutes forecast
conjunction of east's stagnation and west's near-recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S five leading economic institutes have issued a decidedly gloomy
prognosis for the coming year, suggesting a dangerous conjuncture of
stagnation in east Germany and all-but-recession in the west.
Yet even that forecast is based on a series of crucial preconditions for
economic recovery, including a gradual recovery of the world economy, strict
control of government spending, modest wage demands, and, most important of
all, a relatively swift decline in domestic interest rates.
The headline figure of a 0.5 per cent growth rate for gross domestic and
gross national product next year in western Germany - compared with GDP
growth of 1.5 per cent and GNP of 1.0 per cent this year - thus requires a
clear relaxation of monetary policy by the Bundesbank.
Indeed, one reason for the expectation of a gradual recovery in the
international economy is that the Bundesbank will bring down its interest
rates sharply, thus allowing the rest of the European Community to follow
suit.
After a much more hopeful forecast for the German economy in the spring,
economists suffered a double disappointment when the international economy
failed to pick up and consumer spending in Germany remained sluggish.
Industrial orders have been declining for several months, and investment in
machinery and equipment is forecast to decline both this year and next.
'Given the obvious insecurity of consumers and investors, it cannot be
excluded that the economic downturn will actually accelerate, and last
longer than suggested,' they say. 'We do not think this is a probable
development, but the dynamics of a downturn, once it is under way, are very
hard to predict.
'Whatever happens, it requires strong positive signals to stabilise the
confidence of the economic actors in renewed economic growth.'
The institutes say that they 'assume such stimulation does indeed come
about, and that therefore the downturn will be limited to the coming six
months.'
Dr Heiner Flassbeck, of the Berlin-based German Economic Research Institute
(DIW), who co-ordinated the report, warned that there was a real danger that
the downturn in western Germany would have a knock-on effect in eastern
Germany, causing western investors to cut back on spending as their profits
were squeezed back home.
Already there are clear indications of a downturn in investment spending on
machinery and equipment in the west: it is forecast to fall from DM239.6bn
(Pounds 97bn) in 1991 to DM234.5bn this year and DM228bn in 1993. In the
east, in contrast, the forecast is for a rise from DM40.4bn in 1991 to
DM48.5bn in 1992 and DM56.5bn next year.
The report blames three developments for seriously unsettling the climate in
the west: the 'surprising' increase in the discount rate ordered by the
Bundesbank in July; the political debate on tax increases which began in
August; and the turmoil in the currency markets in September.
The belated change of course in interest rates signalled by the central
bank, when it cut the Lombard rate from 9.75 to 9.5 per cent in September,
was not enough to counterbalance the effect, they say.
As for eastern Germany, the problem was in coming up with any reliable
predictions at all, given the unreliability of the statistical base. The
east's labour market was in a 'desolate' state, with no improvement in
sight, in spite of official unemployment figures suggesting a decline in
joblessness. From a position at the end of 1989, when there were almost 10m
people economically active, there were today barely 6m, of whom 400,000 were
on job creation schemes. Official unemployment was 1.1m, or 14.6 per cent,
and 250,000 more were on short-time working. 'Real unemployment' - including
those on job creation schemes or re-training - was more like 2m, or one
quarter of the potential workforce.
The institutes argue that there ideally should be a renegotiation of wage
contracts across the board, to stop the process of wage equalisation with
western Germany until productivity in the east has caught up. Until then,
they warn, the gap will mean a severe disincentive to new investors, and an
encouragement of capital-intensive, rather than labour-intensive projects -
the opposite of what was needed.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Central Europe knocks on the Community door
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADERS of central Europe gather in London today for their first joint
summit meeting with the European Community.
All four of the prime ministers - from the Czech and Slovak republics,
Hungary and Poland - head fragile coalitions and bring with them a host of
domestic problems. These range from the bilateral dispute between
Czechoslovakia and Hungary over Slovakia's damming of the Danube river, to
nervousness about rising ethnic intolerance and conflicts and the need for
EC backing to ease the strains of transition to market economies.
All are likely to find that the Community, on present form, is ill-prepared
to offer real help.
The meeting is unfortunately timed. Proposed several months ago by Mr John
Major, as head of the EC presidency, to symbolise the EC's continuing
interest in the former communist countries, it finds Mr Major preoccupied
with his own political survival, and, together with Mr Jacques Delors,
European Commission president, deeply embroiled in the Maastricht
ratification process.
The 'deepening' of EC institutions enshrined in the Maastricht treaty was
conceived before the collapse of Soviet power in eastern Europe opened up
new perspectives for European unification. Rather than re-examine the whole
concept in the light of the changed realities, the EC decided to press on
with the Maastricht process. It then confirmed that it attached greater
priority to admitting the economically prosperous and politically stable
European Free Trade Association countries than the economically and
politically fragile countries to the east and south-east of Europe.
The EC has been prepared to concede only limited financial and technical
assistance, and make hard-fought trade and tariff concessions in bilateral
association agreements with the 'Visegrad 3' countries. They are named after
the Hungarian town where the three agreed in 1990 to co-ordinate their
approach to EC entry. Now Brussels is dragging its feet on similar
negotiations with Romania and Bulgaria, the de facto 'second tier' of
eastern Europe.
In practice the limited opening up to the east has been grasped with both
hands by all Visegrad 3 countries which have compensated for the collapse in
Comecon trade by sharp increases in that with the EC. With their eyes on
eventual Community entry, they have also diligently designed their reform
legislation to be EC compatible.
What the prime ministers, flanked by their finance and foreign ministers,
really want is a timetable for full-fledged membership of the Community.
Above all, they seek assurance that the EC takes them and their problems
seriously. What they most fear is being left on the doorstep while their
domestic political, economic and security problems become insoluble against
a possible worst case scenario of spreading civil war in Yugoslavia and
economic collapse and political chaos in the former Soviet Union.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Geneva negotiators present draft constitution for Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATORS at the Geneva conference on former Yugoslavia yesterday
presented a draft constitution for Bosnia-Hercegovina aimed at preserving
the territorial integrity of the republic and preventing it from being
divided into three separate cantons.
However, it is unlikely that the constitution will persuade Mr Mate Boban,
head of Bosnia's Croat forces, and Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the
republic's Serb forces, to stop the fighting. Last year, both men, backed by
the republics of Serbia and Croatia, agreed to cantonise Bosnia as a means
of eventually annexing Croat- and Serb-controlled regions to these two
republics. The plan, which would have left the Moslem population with an
insignificant slice of Bosnia, was tacitly endorsed by Lord Carrington,
former chairman of the EC-sponsored peace conference on the region.
Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the co-chairmen of the Geneva conference,
yesterday said the document was 'a unique constitution' that would provide a
framework for the preservation of Bosnia-Hercegovina's sovereignty, based on
the concept of a central government with about 10 regional governments
having authority over language, education, police and law enforcement.
Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the United Nations and European Community
chairmen of the conference, said the constitution would be 'subject to very
strong' human rights provisions. However, it remains unclear how the
constitution will be implemented, or how it could end the war in Bosnia.
Negotiators at Geneva have repeatedly warned Serbia and Croatia they will
not tolerate any carve-up of Bosnia, saying that sanctions on Serbia would
be maintained, and even imposed on Croatia if the latter tried to annex the
Croat-held region of western Hercegovina.
Growing pressure on Croatia has led to tension between Croatian President
Franjo Tudjman and Mr Boban. This partly explains why Croat forces in Bosnia
have stepped up their campaign against the Moslems to consolidate their grip
over a large swathe of Bosnia before the constitutional principles are
implemented.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Ukraine's PM vows to fight corruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOWING TO fight corruption, Mr Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine's newly-appointed
prime minister, yesterday purged ex-communist functionaries from his cabinet
and replaced them with industrialists and nationalist politicians.
In a hard-hitting speech which won the applause of parliament, Mr Kuchma
asserted that 'the wholesale theft of the country is taking place . . .
Government officials have used chatter about market reforms to disguise
their incompetence and dishonesty'.
As a specific example of corruption, he cited this year's re-export of 8m
tonnes of Russian oil. Mr Kuchma said the re-export of oil sold by Russia at
subsidised rates had unfairly enriched bureaucrats and left Ukraine with an
energy shortage. Among other examples, he named Mr Volodymyr Horiunov, head
of the state oil concern and an associate of Mr Vitold Fokin, the former
prime minister, saying his refinery had re-exported fuel without a state
licence.
As the Ukrainian president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, looked on, Mr Kuchma won
parliament's approval for a new cabinet which will exclude a troika of
ex-communist functionaries - former deputy prime ministers Mr Valentyn
Symonenko, Mr Oleh Slepichev and Mr Konstantyn Masyk.
Mr Ihor Iukhnovsky, a respected physicist from western Ukraine who led the
nationalist block in parliament before Ukraine became independent, takes the
number two job as first deputy prime minister. Mr Vasyl Ievtukhov, leader of
Ukraine's industrial lobby, was also appointed a deputy prime minister.
The key ministries of defence and foreign affairs were left untouched, but
Mr Kuchma, who took a trip to Moscow just a week after becoming prime
minister, called for a thaw in Ukrainian-Russian relations.
'This government will put an end to the economic cold war with Russia,' he
said.
Judging by his appointment and his brief statement to parliament, Mr Kuchma
seems intent on reshaping the former Soviet Union's second largest economy
in the image of the efficient but state-dominated military industrial
complex where he built his career.
The 'order' he promises is likely to be order of an old-fashioned variety:
Mr Kuchma, who spoke warmly of the Chinese economic model, lambasted
Ukraine's reform-minded central bank for what he described as its preference
for lending to commercial banks rather than bailing out Ukraine's state
factories.
Mr Kuchma asked for and obtained an instant change in the constitution to
bring under cabinet authority the central bank and the State Propety Fund,
the body which oversees privatisation.

Hungarian trade figures released yesterday demonstrated export resilience in

Budapest.
Exports rose 12.5 per cent in the first three-quarters of 1992 compared with
a year earlier, while imports fell back 2 per cent, leaving trade in
balance. Deliveries slowed over the year as Germany, Hungary's largest
trading partner, lost economic momentum. Nevertheless, the Hungarian
government hopes that exports will lift the the economy in 1993.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Major ready to take on Tory Euro-sceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday signalled his readiness to face down his
Euro-sceptic opponents on Maastricht with an unprecedented move to set out
his case personally to all Conservative backbench MPs tomorrow.
However, he used a private meeting last night with a small group of Tory MPs
to play down speculation that he will call a general election if defeated
over the treaty.
The meeting marked the beginning of a concerted government operation to head
off the threatened Conservative revolt in next week's Europe debate.
It followed a public warning by Mr Major to Tory MPs against 'isolating
ourselves' and of losing influence in the European Community.
Mr Major's decision to address tomorrow a full meeting of the 1922 committee
 -the group that embraces all Tory backbenchers - was clearly intended to
underline the prime minister's seriousness about pressing on with the
Maastricht bill.
Last night he was helped by pro-Europe Tory MPs agreeing to campaign more
actively in support of the cabinet line.
He will also be encouraged by Denmark's move to overcome the country's
referendum result on Maastricht. It will weaken his opponents argument that
he should wait until the Danes move before proceeding with the treaty's
ratification.
But amid a feverish atmosphere at Westminster, rightwing Tories were
intensifying attacks on Mr Kenneth Clarke, the pro-Europe home secretary -
accusing him of manoeuvering the prime minister into ratifying Maastricht
with unnecessary speed.
Earlier, senior cabinet ministers and government business managers met to
discuss how to proceed towards next Wednesday's crucial paving debate.
Downing Street officials said that no conclusions had been reached over how
to phrase the motion for debate or on what shape it might take. A decision
will be taken by the full cabinet at its weekly meeting tomorrow.
Nonetheless, senior ministers involved in the talks appear to have backed
what is believed to be Mr Major's preference for a substantive motion,
rather than draw back from a head-on confrontation with the Euro-sceptics by
tabling a technical 'adjournment' motion.
In the Commons, Mr Major appeared to press his personal commitment to
ratification and to castigate opposition parties for threatening to oppose a
paving motion.
His rigorous rebuff was paralleled by Mr Hurd who used a speech to the
European Parliament in Strasbourg to challenge Labour's European
credentials.
Mr Hurd said the opposition's promise to vote against the government next
week indicated a 'change for the worse' in its attitude.

FT  28 OCT 92 / CBI report adds to economic gloom: Further job cuts expected
as business confidence and manufacturing output fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S manufacturing industry is expected to cut 25,000 jobs a month at
least for the rest of the year, the Confederation of British Industry said
yesterday.
In the first of its quarterly Industrial Trends Surveys carried out since
the departure of sterling from the European exchange rate mechanism, the CBI
reported a sharp drop in business confidence and further falls in output
over the past four months.
The survey showed sterling's decline had improved confidence on export
prospects, which rose to its highest level for more than five years. But
slowing growth abroad was reflected in a growing number of companies citing
foreign political and economic conditions as likely to limit their ability
to win export orders.
The more than 1,300 manufacturing companies responding to the survey
remained overwhelmingly gloomy about the general business outlook with most
expecting a further fall in output and orders.
Output fell for the 11th successive quarter in the period to October, and
with inflationary pressures remaining low, the number of of companies
cutting domestic prices was the highest since the 1950s.
Foreign exchange markets, already nervous about political uncertainty in
Britain, reacted sharply to the survey. In London, sterling closed near its
three-year dollar low at Dollars 1.5790, down almost 1 cent on the day and
almost 7 cents this week. It finished 2 pfennigs down on the day at DM2.4225
and edged lower in New York, where it closed at Dollars 1.577 and DM2.4095.
In early Far East trade today it was quoted at Dollars 1.58125 and DM2.411.
Share prices were buoyed by prospects of another cut in interest rates, but
gains were tempered by sterling's weakness, political uncertainty and the
pessimistic CBI survey. The FT-SE 100 share index gained 8.2 to 2,669.6.
The CBI survey - carried out between September 23 and October 14, but before
the latest base rate cut - came a week after the British Chambers of
Commerce predicted that the UK was falling into a 'second leg' of recession.
Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs committee, said that
cost and price increases remained extremely low despite the threat of rising
import prices. He added that the lack of confidence among both businesses
and consumers justified a further reduction in interest rates. 'But just as
important is the need for the government to provide a clear and coherent
explanation of its economic strategy now that the pound has been withdrawn
from the ERM.
'That should include a commitment to maintain public spending on capital
programmes while bearing down on the cost of providing public services', he
said.
The CBI survey showed investment intentions had weakened to their lowest
level since July 1991, with fewer companies authorising increased spending
on buildings, plant and machinery over the next 12 months. Expectations of
price rises were the lowest for any quarter since October 1966.
In the Commons, Mr John Smith, the Labour party leader, challenged Mr John
Major, the prime minister, to explain how he could draw comfort from the CBI
survey which, he said, predicted 'jobs will be down, output will be down,
orders will be down, investment will be down and confidence will be down.'
'The British public are now sick and tired of failed economic policies, as
well as bogus economic promises of recovery which are never ever fulfilled',
Mr Smith said.
Mr Major said the survey showed export optimism was up on July, output
expectations were up on September and that, for the first time, more
companies reported a fall in unit costs than those reporting an increase.

FT  28 OCT 92 / UK schools at bottom of class
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITONS will be the waiters, porters, cleaners and lavatory attendants of
Europe unless their schools improve, a leading independent school headmaster
warned yesterday.
Speaking in Rouen, France, to the Independent Schools Association, Mr Peter
Owen, its chairman, called for urgent reforms to stop Britain dropping
further behind its continental rivals.
'Who will be the manual workers of the coming decades?' he asked. 'Unless we
act positively, it will be the children passing through British schools
now.' He said Britain's education system was 'woefully inadequate' for most
children, failing to stimulate them or provide adequate qualifications.
Mr Owen, head of Rushmoor School, Bedford, said UK education was 'in crisis'
because of low staying-on rates, poor vocational training, high failure
rates at A-level and weaknesses in language teaching. His conclusions on
language are borne out by a survey of UK companies dealing with foreign
tourists which found that only one-third are equipped to deal with
customers' language requirements.
In the single market, Mr Owen said, if a British job vacancy was advertised
across Europe, at least half the applications would come from foreigners
with fluent English and technical and managerial qualifications.
'The British applicants perhaps left school at 16, or at 18, with poor
results,' he said. 'They have no other qualifications, but have picked up a
little varied experience at the times when they have been in work.'
The ISA's Rouen conference has followed a recent pattern of independent
school heads decamping to the continent to laud 'Europe 1992' and lament the
crisis in British education.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Yeltsin to ban extremist front

<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin responded to increasingly vociferous threats
to his authority by deciding yesterday to ban a coalition of communists and
fascists and warn the west of the 'terrible danger' posed by Russian
extremists.
His latest statements foreshadow a possible crackdown at home and, on the
eve of debt negotiations and a conference on aid for Russia, a last-ditch
attempt to persuade the west to throw its political and economic weight
behind his reforms - even if they are watered down.
Russian officials suggested that the country's relationship with the
International Monetary Fund could become a casualty of the political
instability there, which they cited as a reason for not being able to set a
date for talks on a full standby agreement.
Mr Yeltsin said he had ordered the preparation of a decree banning the
National Salvation Front - which wants his removal and an end to
western-style market reforms - because the organisation called 'for the
overthrow of legally constituted authorities'.
A manifesto produced by the Front leadership said it would stick to
constitutional methods to achieve its aims, but some participants at the
Front's founding congress on Saturday hinted that violence and conspiracy
were part of the scenario.
It is not clear what the ban will mean, as the Front includes several
deputies who are due to attend a December 1 meeting of the Russian
super-parliament that will seek to unseat the government. However Mr Yeltsin
ordered Russian diplomats to explain the dangers of such organisations to
the west, where they 'do not yet understand this'.
Mr Yeltsin's authority faced a further challenge when the chairman of the
Russian parliament used a self-styled parliamentary security force to
'guard' the Izvestia newspaper in violation of a presidential decree which
establishes its independence.
The newspaper's editor, Mr Igor Golembiovsky, said he had received
assurances that the parliament's media committee would ask the
Constitutional Court to challenge parliament's decision last week claiming
control over the Izvestia publishing complex. But some of his colleagues
feared the arrival of armed officers was a prelude to a forcible takeover.
The political uncertainty in Moscow may already be pushing the president
into the arms of the so-called centrist Civic Union movement, which wants
the removal of key radical reformers in his cabinet, a law and order
crackdown, and more leniency for inefficient state enterprises.
But Mr Yeltsin also said he would 'not sacrifice' either Mr Yegor Gaidar,
the acting prime minister who launched Polish-style shock therapy reforms in
January, or Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the pro-western foreign minister.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister with responsibility for
foreign economic relations, said yesterday that presidential rule - a
euphemism for a more authoritarian regime - was still premature.

After the hurly-burly of Wapping, Murdoch and The Times, Charles Wilson was
no doubt overjoyed, when in 1990, he was asked to be editor-in-chief of
Robert Maxwell's Sporting Life.
Sunday For Monday, the horse in which he had a stake along with a bunch of
Times journalists, hadn't exactly set the world alight. But Charlie Wilson
must have been looking forward to nothing more exciting in prospect than a
steady series of race meetings.
But it didn't work out like that. First he became editor-in-chief of Mirror
Group Newspapers, then he had to handle the world's press when Robert
Maxwell went missing from his yacht. Then there was the trauma of the daily
revelations of missing money. And the papers had to keep coming out through
it all.
Now he is really getting into his retirement by becoming managing director
of MGN to chief executive David Montgomery, also a former News International
editor.

Terry Smith might be a hard act to follow, but you would have thought his
successor would have lasted more than 10 days.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew must have been hoping things were settling down when it
handed the ejected Smith's UK research desk to Peter Beck in addition to the
continental European counterpart he was already running. But he too is off -
to Paribas Capital Markets as head of the rather smaller equity research
department.
Smith was fired at the beginning of September after becoming embroiled in a
legal dispute with his employers about the publication of his book
Accounting for Growth. He and Beck had been sparring partners for a while,
and colleagues say Beck had for some time been ogling the UK patch. UBS P&amp;D
claims Beck is going for personal reasons, but his departure seems to have
mystified senior management.
Enter Hector Sants, vice-chairman and head of equities, who will 'for the
time being' have the research department reporting directly to him. This
leaves Bill Seward, who had been overall head of research, in charge of
economics and equity markets strategy.
Sants is still bravely claiming the Smith debacle 'has done us no damage as
far as relationships with institutional clients go'. Until the bank
acknowledges at least internally that there's a problem, this little saga
looks set to run and run.

Sam Nunn had always seemed to be one of the more down-to-earth members of

Forced to respond to reports in the Weekly World News, an always reliable

fact, a space alien.
'I confess. It's amazing that I've been able to keep it a secret for 54

Perhaps Nunn's origins account for the staunch support he has always given,
as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, to the 'Star Wars'
anti-missile defence projects of the Reagan and Bush administrations.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
That bespectacled Australian scuttling down the Strand with his face hidden
behind a newspaper on Monday was probably Neil Pickard, the New South Wales
agent general.
John Fahey, the premier of New South Wales, told parliament in Sydney
yesterday that he had dismissed Pickard after receiving 'inconsistent and
unconvincing' explanations for unauthorised travel in continental Europe
last week.
To make matters worse, Fahey had had a spot of difficulty contacting Pickard
to convey the news of the termination of his ADollars 200,000-a-year job.
It was only when the premier got through to the doorman and conveyed the
urgency of his message that his call was actually returned.
Pickard flies back to Sydney in only slightly more controversial
circumstances than those in which he left from down under last year.
The former energy minister came to London courtesy of Nick Greiner, the then
NSW premier, after Pickard lost his state parliament seat following an
electoral redistribution.
But this was rather inconsistent with Greiner's campaign promises to end the
'jobs for the boys' syndrome which has long dogged the state, and
contributed to Greiner's own downfall earlier this year in a corruption
scandal surrounding another appointment.
Meanwhile, Fahey's decision not to replace Pickard may unnerve the other
four Australian agent generals left in London. Justifying a presence that
has more to do with the states' relations with Britain in a bygone colonial
age becomes increasingly delicate when the richest and most populous state
is willing to let the Australian High Commission do the job.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Letter: Marketing domination that inhibits the small
airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From A J LUCKING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It comes as a shock to learn from your leader, 'Favourite airline'
(October 26), that British Airways European fares are cheap. Perhaps they
are to the 'ENO' (expense no object) market segment, but the other half
resent being forced to pay business-class fares by the European flag
carriers, now that they have eliminated economy fares on nearly all the
routes. Since 1970, the ferries' share of UK business travel to Europe has
risen from 11 per cent to 29 per cent, including a sharp 6 per cent rise
since the slump started.
Many of the European airlines' costs are about twice US levels, and yet they
make a margin of more than 15 per cent on the business fares, while losing
about 12 per cent in the much larger rear cabins, as a result of excessive
discounting. Staff productivity in America and Australia is up to twice
European levels, and airline salaries high, too.
The reason that the small low-cost airlines have made so little impact is
that the 'big brothers' dominate the marketing channels. Via incentive
('override') commissions they persuade travel agents to book with them. They
meet the fares of the newcomers on the very few routes where they operate,
while maintaining their high fare structure on all the other routes ('spoke
biasing'). They persuade the hungry small airlines to carry their connecting
traffic at less than economic rates. A 1990 Civil Aviation Authority report
showed that Dan-Air was receiving 16 per cent less than the lowest inclusive
tour fare - ie only 20-25 per cent of the on-demand fare - for London-Paris
connecting traffic. Big tour operators, particularly when traffic is weak,
use their buying muscle to force down the non-public fares charged for big
groups. The smaller companies are more vulnerable than the large, which are
by no means exempt - an important reason for the losses in their rear
cabins.
In his February Brancker memorial lecture, the chairman of the CAA predicted
that the continental flag carriers would not compete for the local European
traffic, but only for the 'feed' to their profitable intercontinental
services. Hence, the demise of Dan-Air, a truly independent airline, is
especially bad news.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Foreign Affairs: Behind closed doors - Governments are
conspiring to restrict the right to political asylum in the EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The speaker of the British House of Commons revealed on Monday that the
Maastricht treaty is not her fav-ourite bedside reading. She is 'only a
quarter of the way through'. That means, presumably, that she is still
wrestling with the bits about economic and monetary union.
Perhaps she should allow herself to skip, like Miss Prism in The Importance
of Being Earnest. ('You may omit the chapter on the rupee. It is altogether
too sensational.') The sexier bits of the Treaty on European Union are to be
found near the end.
I recommend especially Title VI, 'provisions on co-operation in the fields
of justice and home affairs'. This, along with Title V (on foreign and
security policy), is one of the two 'pillars' of the proposed union which
the British government is so pleased to have kept separate from the EC
proper: an inter-governmental affair, in which national sovereignty will be
preserved. That, indeed, is the main basis of Prime Minister John Major's
claim that the treaty marks a reversal of the EC's trend towards ever
greater centralisation. It means, in reality, that ministers reckon to
decide these matters among themselves, without the intrusion of public
scrutiny or debate.
But if Miss Boothroyd turns to Title VI, Article K6, she will find that, if
Maastricht ever comes into force, 'the Presidency and the Commission shall
regularly inform the European Parliament of discussions in the areas covered
by this Title'. Worse, the presidency is actually to 'consult' the
parliament, and even ensure that its views are 'taken into consideration'.
The parliament, moreover, will be allowed to put questions or make
recommendations to the Council of Ministers; and will be required to hold an
annual debate on the progress made.
Under Article K9 the council is empowered, if it unanimously so chooses, to
bring the whole caboodle under full EC procedures; and an appended
declaration says the council will at least 'consider' doing so in the case
of asylum policy - the first of the 'matters of common interest' covered in
Title VI - by the end of 1993.
These provisions will certainly constitute an improvement, in terms of
democracy, on the way the asylum issue is being handled now. Last week BBC
Radio 4 revealed a 'draft resolution on manifestly unfounded applications
for asylum', which the British presidency is proposing for adoption by the
Edinburgh summit in December. This document, prepared by the 'ad hoc group
immigration', is dated Brussels, July 1 1992 (the first day of the British
presidency) and marked confidential.
The ad hoc group is a purely inter-governmental body after Mr Major's own
heart, unsullied by any contact with the Commission, the European
Parliament, or indeed national parliaments, let alone the wretched media.
Meeting behind closed doors, it has - perhaps not surprisingly - drawn up a
policy for closing the doors of Europe on as many refugees as possible. The
draft resolution seeks to restrict the right of asylum to those covered by
the 1951 Geneva Convention on the status of refugees.
This defines a refugee as a person who 'owing to well-founded fear of being
persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a
particular social group, or political opinion, is outside the country of his
nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail
himself of the protection of that country'. It has generally been taken to
mean that each individual must demonstrate that he (or she) personally would
be targeted for persecution if he returned to his own country. Thus it
excludes the great mass of refugees in the common understanding of the term,
who are most often people driven from their homes by war.
According to immigration lawyers, even victims of torture or inhuman and
degrading treatment are not always held to qualify. Only 25 per cent of
asylum applicants in the UK in recent years have been held to fulfil the
Geneva criterion; yet only 15 per cent have had their applications rejected
outright. The remaining 60 per cent were allowed to remain on grounds other
than the Geneva Convention.
The draft resolution declares smugly that 'those who fear violations of
their human rights should if possible remain in their own countries, and
seek protection or redress from their own authorities or under regional
human rights' instruments'. It lays down that 'inter-continental movements
are seldom necessary for protection reasons alone'. Third-world refugees, in
other words, should no longer expect to find refuge in Europe. Let them stay
in countries neighbouring their own - such as Jordan, for instance, where no
fewer than one person in four is recognised as a refugee.
That may seem very callous in that it puts the greatest burden on the
poorest countries. But there is a sort of logic to it, in as much as
European countries, once they allow in a refugee, can hardly avoid giving
him or her the same level of social security as the rest of their
population, which in the case of many third-world refugees implies a much
higher standard of living than the one they enjoyed at home.
Harder to justify is the draft's insistence that refugees are entitled to
asylum only in the first 'safe' country they reach. This doctrine will often
prevent a refugee from reaching a country where he would be better able to
support himself, either because he has relatives there or because he speaks
the language.
Of course, the ad hoc group has not made such proposals out of malice.
European electorates expect their governments to maintain a tough
immigration policy, and that is very difficult to combine with a generous
asylum policy. Much is claimed about would-be 'economic' (that is,
voluntary) migrants who allegedly use asylum procedures to jump the
immigration queue. No doubt they exist, and there would be more of them if
asylum were made easier to obtain. But even bona fide fugitives can reach
unmanageable numbers, or at least numbers that exceed the compassion and
hospitality of the resident population.
In Germany that point has been reached, as Chancellor Helmut Kohl
acknowledged in his speech on Monday. With an estimated 60,000 asylum
seekers arriving this month alone, the time for emergency measures has
arrived.
Sadly, a tougher asylum policy is bound to be one of them, and it will have
to be a European policy if other EC members wish to retain free movement for
their own nationals in and out of the German market. But it should be
debated openly, not in hole-and-corner ad hoc groups; and in order to be
more generous - or less hard-hearted - west Europeans should be prepared to
share the burden equitably, rather than leave the countries closest to the
area of conflict to take all the refugees.
They should also recognise that the best place to deal with refugee problems
is at source. If they find the rise of xenophobia in Germany alarming, one
answer is to do more to stop the war and the systematic expulsions which are
forcing people in ex-Yugoslavia to flee their homes. Through the refugee
problem, war in the Balkans is gnawing away at west European security.

Sir, If the Institute of Fiscal Studies is flying a kite for the government
as it contemplates raiding the piggy bank of the state pension, it must do
better than proffer Mr Andrew Dilnot's convoluted logic ('Means to a public
spending end', October 19). Seemingly the 'better-off minority' with an
occupational pension 'averaging Pounds 65' are to contribute towards topping
up flat-rate pensions of Pounds 54 a week or Pounds 67 for a married couple
by foregoing their own state pensions. No mention of course of the tax they
will pay on their pension income, nor that they will have paid for their
state pension through the National Insurance contributions, which they had
every reason to take into account when planning their own pension provision,
as indeed, in the case of company pensions, did their employers. Are they to
sacrifice their own standard of living and see it depressed to the level of
those they are allegedly helping? No doubt they can move house down market
and perform a further economic service to the nation and its masters.
Justice, it seems, flies out of the window when the bills for economic
incompetence come home to roost. Paul Baker,

FT  28 OCT 92 / Letter: VAT charge on food not illogical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL D VARCOE-COCKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Poynor (Letters, October 24) considers the logic and consistency of
the UK's system of charging VAT on food could have been devised by Lewis
Carroll and advocates a uniform rate for food.
Mr Poynor fails to understand the principle behind the zero-rating of most
food and the normal (17.5 per cent) rate applied to the rest: unless the
food is supplied in the course of catering or consists of snacks or
confectionery, it is zero-rated. The logic for charging snacks and
confectionery is that they are either not really essential or are luxuries.
With the tens of thousands of food lines available in stores there are
obviously going to be some grey areas, but even Mr Poynor's 'most whimsical'
example of frozen yoghurt is easy to explain. If it can be 'spooned when
frozen' and eaten immediately it falls within the snack or confectionery
category: if it has to be defrosted it falls within the general category of
necessary human food and is zero-rated. Equally logical is the taxation of
pet food and zero-rating of other animal feeding stuffs: the feeding of
livestock is (pace vegetarians) necessary to provide food, whereas the
keeping of pets is mostly an unnecessary luxury.
A uniform rate - at the 6 per cent implied by Mr Poynor - would be unfair on
those who buy little or no snack foods and confectionery and detrimental to
the less well-off.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I must disagree with Mr A J Gooding (Letters, October 23). I believe
that it would be unwise to increase house building at this time. We have
never had so many empty houses - the problem in getting people to buy them]
The fact is that purchasers are not prepared to pay the asking price for the
properties on offer.
What used to be a commendable objective to own your own home had become in
recent years a path to untold riches, or so we were led to believe. And it
was double MIRAS which helped to fuel this myth. I do not accept that
additional tax incentives should be offered.
I believe that property prices must continue to fall until they become
affordable. The only other option would be to allow inflation to increase in
order to ease the mortgage repayment problem. The high price of property
does not relate to the cost of production but to the expectation of capital
gains.
Too much of Britain's wealth is tied up in property. However, there are many
desperately needed infrastructure projects in the pipeline which would
improve our manufacturing ability and provide employment in the construction
industry. We should take advantage of the competitive rates on offer.

<TEXT>
THE civil servant responsible for overseeing the government's energy policy
has been moved to a new post following last week's row over pit closures,
the Department of Trade and Industry said last night.
But the department denied that Mr Robert Priddle, a deputy secretary at the
DTI, was taking the blame - rather than ministers - for the political
embarrasment faced by the government when it was forced to backtrack over
the proposals in the face of a Tory revolt.
Mr Priddle has switched jobs with the head of the department's corporate and
consumer affairs division - a job of equal rank.
The DTI said it had been decided that, with the government committed to
reviewing the pit closure programme, it was time for a 'fresh pair of hands'
overseeing energy policy. Asked if Mr Priddle was being moved because of his
performance in the job, the DTI said: 'We do not see it in that light.'
By convention, civil servants are rarely blamed for policy failures.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Britain isolated over HDTV plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK has become increasingly isolated among European Community members in
the debate over the EC's proposed subsidy to television broadcasters for the
development of a European high definition television standard.
Most members are reported to be moving closer to finalising a plan for Ecu
850m (Pounds 680m) in subsidies to help broadcasters in the transit-ion from
conventional to high definition broadcast-ing.
Agreement on most aspects of the plan, apart from the most contentious issue
of the level of the proposed subsidy, is expected within the next few days.
Such agreement paves the way for discussions at a forthcoming meeting of
European telecommunications ministers in Brussels next month to focus on the
issue of the level of subsidy.
The UK, however, is opposed to any subsidy and is in the minority on this
issue, in spite of its presidency of the Community.
At a meeting of the EC's Telecommunications Council in June, the UK opposed
the EC's proposal for a subsidy to broadcasters of Ecu 850m as 'totally
unacceptable'.
'We will oppose any expenditure until we see . . . a convincing business
case (for a subsidy),' Mr Edward Leigh, the technology minister, said at the
time.
That business case was put forward in the form of a report prepared for the
commission which was on the whole favourably received by member countries.
While the level of subsidy is likely to be a source of debate among member
countries, the UK appears to be alone in remaining fundament-ally opposed to
the sub-sidy.
'We are working on coming up with a response to the commission's study,' a
spokesman for the Department of Trade and Industry said.
Meanwhile, a consortium including Dixons, the electrical retailer, Sony, the
consumer electronics manufacturer, and BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster, has
proposed a lower level of subsidy to broadcasters which could be a
compromise solut-ion.
However, a level of subsidy significantly lower than the proposed Ecu 850m
is unlikely to achieve the objective of the commission's action plan to
create a critical mass of broadcasts to stimulate the market for high
definition TV.

   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE mayor of Buenos Aires, a key political appointee, was forced from office
on Monday evening by a deepening financial crisis that has left Argentina's
capital virtually bankrupt, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires.
Mr Carlos Grosso, appointed by President Carlos Menem in 1989, had to leave
after failing to impose order on the city's chaotic administration. His fate
is a warning to other local government leaders seeking to restore financial
order.
Although no precise figures are available, Buenos Aires appears to have a
1992 budget deficit of between Dollars 270m and Dollars 690m (Pounds 423.3m)
 -equivalent to 11-29 per cent of the total budget.
Mr Saul Bouer, the new mayor, is one of Mr Menem's hard men. Formerly
federal treasury secretary and public works secretary, his specialty is
ruthless pruning of jobs.
He has already promised to increase property taxes in wealthy neighbourhoods
and sack one in eight employees; conservative estimates say the city has
120,000 workers.
Mr Grosso can point to some notable achievements. The city is cleaner than
before and he has privatised collection of taxes and traffic fines. But he
sealed his fate by announcing he would 'temporarily' stop paying contractors
and renegotiate unpaid bills. The contractors, especially Waste Management
of the US which collects the city's rubbish, threatened to suspend services.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Doubts over market in health care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S health care reforms are failing to create an internal
market as planned, according to a survey from accountants Arthur Andersen
released yesterday.
Nearly 80 per cent of hospital chief executives and unit general managers
did not believe the National Health Service objective of creating an
internal market is being achieved.
More than 70 per cent, however, said the reforms had resulted in
improvements in overall efficiency, quality of service, average length of
occupancy and waiting lists.
The survey questioned senior executives from 50 hospitals across England in
July, and spanned those from existing trusts, non-trusts and units applying
for trust status.
About 70 per cent said that community relations had remained the same or
worsened since the reforms, and a third said staff morale had deteriorated.
The most significant problems in implementing the reforms included the
adequacy of information, the timetable established, relationships with
purchasers, quality of management and internal resistance. The survey
suggested there was less sharing of information with other hospitals than in
the past.
Only just over a tenth said information systems were adequate for their
needs and there was little consensus over the most appropriate indicators
for monitoring performance.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS of Grupo Torras, the Kuwait Investment Office's (KIO) troubled
Spanish industrial holding company, yesterday rejected the company's 1991
draft accounts, AP-DJ reports from Madrid.
In a statement, Grupo Torras said the holding company's advisors had
recommended that shareholders reject the accounts at a general shareholders'
meeting in Madrid.
However, shareholders agreed to submit the unapproved accounts to the
Spanish stock exchange commission within the required time limit.
The commission has given Grupo Torras until tomorrow to make public the
accounts, carried out by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which are reported to reverse
the consolidated net profit of Pta3.96bn (Dollars 36.4bn) initially claimed
by Torras to a loss of Pta44.4bn.
Although Grupo Torras is not traded on the Madrid stock exchange, several of
its holdings - including the food products company Ebro Agricolas SA and the
chemicals concern Ercros SA - are listed.
The shareholders' meeting had been delayed by an on-going investigation of
the previous management of Grupo Torras, which was replaced by a new team in
May, said Mr Mahmoud Al-Nouri, acting chairman.
The new management brought in KPMG Peat Marwick, the international
accounting group, in an attempt to discover why the group has made huge
losses despite the Dollars 4bn that the KIO has injected into its Spanish
investments since 1986.
The preliminary accounts for 1991 show a net loss of Pta44.44bn against a
profit of Pta3.83bn previously, a loss before extraordinaries of Pta33.7bn
(loss of Pta14.05bn), and an extraordinary loss of Pta10.74bn against a gain
of Pta14.05bn.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Gains tax switch on assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VALUATION of a gift of business assets for capital gains tax purposes
can be deferred until those assets are sold, under a new statement of
practice issued by the Inland Revenue, Andrew Jack writes.
The guidance, numbered SP8/92, applies to taxpayers with shares in an
unquoted, trading company which they or their family control.
As from now it says that claims for gift holdover relief will normally be
accepted automatically by the Revenue, and that valuations may be deferred
until the time when these assets are disposed of.
The voluntary arrangement requires the consent of both the donor and the
recipient of the assets. Anyone can continue to agree valuations and
calculate the gain with the Revenue at the time of the transfer if they
wish.
In practice, capital gains tax liability may be deferred for many years or
may never be incurred because the assets continue to be transferred so there
is never a capital gain.
Holdover relief applies when the recipient of the gift agrees to assume the
full capital gain on the asset which would have accrued to the donor.
Until now, valuations have had to be calculated and agreed with the Revenue
at the time of the transfer.
The Revenue said the new procedures have been introduced in part to reduce
the compliance burden for taxpayers.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Government may cut OECD budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is considering cutting its contributions to the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development - a move which could lead to a
sharp reduction in the organisation's assessment of member countries'
economic performances.
Just over 6 per cent of the OECD's budget comes from the UK. The Foreign
Office - which last year contributed Pounds 5.2m to the OECD - is seeking
support for its reduction from the other 23 members.
If the British move is successful, the budget allotted to the OECD's core
economic activities, including annual surveys of member countries and
twice-yearly economic forecasts, could be reduced.
The proposal comes at a time of Treasury sensitivity about independent
assessments of the UK economy which is still struggling to emerge from its
longest recession for 50 years.
The UK delegation to the OECD said a high value was put on OECD economic
work, but refused to comment on the proposed cuts because discussions on the
overall budget were in progress.
In order to succeed, Britain will have to convince other members that some
of the organisation's economic output is expendable. British representatives
will stress that world and domestic economic conditions are forcing it to
seek cuts in its contributions to all international organisations.
Britain is also anxious to see 'efficiency improvements' which could affect
the organisation's economic studies.
However, some member countries place a higher value than others on the
surveys and forecasts and would be unhappy to see the OECD's economic
activities reduced.
One reason for the UK unease is the possible inclusion of criticism about
the domestic economy in January's annual survey.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Dan-Air job loss aftermath feared
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE takeover of Dan-Air by British Airways is having repercussions on
employment in the UK aviation industry beyond the 1,600 Dan-Air job losses
expected after the BA rescue.
FLS Aerospace, the UK-based aircraft maintenance subsidiary of FLS
Industries, the Danish industrial conglomerate, said it was being forced to
shed about 700 jobs - or 27 per cent of its UK workforce - as a direct
consequence.
Davies &amp; Newman, Dan-Air's parent company, sold the financially troubled
airline's engineering division in January last year for Pounds 26m to FLS.
Under the deal, FLS was entrusted with the maintainance of Dan-Air's fleet.
Only six months ago, Dan-Air extended the contract by three years, but FLS
said BA's agreement last Friday to take over Dan-Air for a nominal Pounds 1
had made void the deal. As BA had switched the bulk of Dan-Air's fleet
maintenance to its own engineering division, FLS said it would have to cut
staffing by about 700 over the next three weeks.
Although BA has just signed a five-year maintenance contract with FLS
involving mainly widebody jets, FLS said the contract would cover only 25
per cent of its original Dan-Air workload.
BA has said it will keep only 12 of Dan-Air's 38 narrowbody aircraft
establishing a low-cost short-haul Gatwick operation employing between 400
and 600 of Dan-Air's permanent staff of 2,000.
BA's Dan-Air rescue is facing escalating opposition from smaller UK airlines
which claim that it will seriously undermine competition and the
government's multi-airline industry policy.
British Midland Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Air UK and Britannia are jointly
lobbying against the deal, calling for an investigation by the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.
BA has warned that it will not complete the Dan-Air rescue if it is forced
to lose routes or landing slots or if the deal fails to win rapid regulatory
approval.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Average pay advantage in public sector revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVERAGE weekly pay for full-time workers in the public sector has been
higher than the average in the private sector for every year since 1973,
excluding the years 1988 to 1991, according to previously unpublished
figures from the Department of Employment.
The figures also reveal that average pay in the public sector remains at a
low point, relative to the private-sector average, compared with much of the
1970s and 1980s.
Both sides in the current debate about a public-sector pay freeze will draw
some comfort from the figures. The government has been basing its case for a
pay freeze, or squeeze, on the fact that public-sector pay has been rising
much faster than that in the private sector in the past two years.
It also points to the findings of its New Earnings Survey - published last
month - that from April last year to April this year average pay in the
public sector once again overtook that in the private sector.
Union officials in the public sector, however, will point to a less
favourable relative position. In 1976, for example, average pay in the
public sector was 113.7 per cent of average pay in the private sector and in
1981 it was 110.4 per cent. It fell to a low of 96.5 per cent in 1990 and
rose in 1991-92 to 101.5 per cent.
Mr Chris Trinder, of the Public Finance Foundation, the independent research
body, said the swings in average pay were largely due to political pledges
made to win the votes of public-sector workers at general elections.
The highpoint of 1976 was reached following pay-review pledges for the
public sector made by the incoming Labour government in 1974.
Similarly, in 1981 the first Thatcher government had just implemented the
pay rises recommended by the Clegg Commission.
Some pay analysts believe that it is not illuminating to look at average pay
in the two sectors and point out that average pay for male workers in both
blue-collar and white-collar jobs is higher in the private sector.
The reason for the higher overall average in the public sector is the higher
proportion of white-collar jobs , generally better paid than blue-collar
jobs, and the much higher pay for women in the public sector.
Pay analysts also point to the fact that averages can be misleading at both
ends of the spectrum. Lower-paid workers tend to do well in the public
sector while higher-paid workers do much less well in comparison with the
private sector.
Nonetheless Mr Trinder highlighted the much bigger average rises in pay in
the public sector in the last two years compared with the private sector.
He also stressed that every increase of 1 per cent in the public sector's
Pounds 70bn pay bill adds Pounds 750m to the total. 'A 1 per cent increase
in pay is equivalent to about 60,000 jobs,' he said. 'If the government can
present that trade-off effectively then it may be able to sell a squeeze on
public-sector pay.'
The first real test of the government's resolve on public-sector pay will
come early next month when the pay formula for firefighters - which since
1978 has guaranteed them a pay rise in line with the upper quartile of male
manual workers - is due to be implemented.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Exports provide slight relief for manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry's latest survey of Britain's
manufacturing sector contains only two optimistic notes on the economy -
prospects for exports have improved and inflation remains subdued.
All other indicators point to a further slowdown in manufacturing output.
Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs committee, said:
'Manufacturing industry is clearly very depressed and there is little sign
of an increase in activity, with conditions remaining difficult both at home
and abroad.
'This recession carries greater risks for industry than the 1980/81
recession did,' he added, warning that industry was having to cut costs
dangerously 'close to the bone'.
The results of the quarterly survey of industrial trends, which covers 1,308
companies employing 2m people, showed a sharp fall in manufacturers'
optimism about the general business situation.
Manufacturing orders and output also fell in the past four months, making
this the eleventh successive quarterly survey to show a fall in production.
The results tied in with the gloomy findings of a survey by the British
Chambers of Commerce last week, which suggested that business slid into a
second leg of recession last month.
The good news from the survey was that sterling's depreciation since Black
Wednesday, September 16, has boosted manufacturers' hopes for higher exports
in the coming year. One third of the manufacturers surveyed said they were
now more optimistic about export prospects.
But while export sentiment staged its sharpest improvement since July 1987,
recent political turmoil, including the upset of Black Wednesday, caused
business confidence to weaken severely. Only 12 per cent of businesses were
optimistic about the general business situation, against 35 per cent who
were gloomy.
Manufacturers expect orders and output to continue falling over the next
four months in spite of the improvement in export prospects. Although the
survey was carried out after the first of two recent cuts in base rates,
manufacturers were unconvinced about an economic recovery.
Sir David said industry was suffering from an acute lack of confidence and
that this justified a further reduction in interest rates.
Over the past four months 41 per cent of companies reported that total new
orders were down, against only 13 per cent which registered an improvement.
Output has also fallen sharply since July, with 35 per cent of companies
reporting a fall compared with 10 per cent reporting an increase. Nine out
of 10 companies said the lack of orders was the factor most likely to limit
output in the next four months, the highest figure for almost 10 years.
The outlook for employment was particularly dismal. The number of people
employed in manufacturing industry continued to fall in the past four
months, at a faster rate than anticipated. The July survey had expected
unemployment growth to slow down.
The CBI said it now expected manufacturing employment to fall by 25,000 a
month at least until the end of the year.
Inflationary pressures remain very weak in spite of sterling's devaluation.
The survey recorded the highest number of companies reducing domestic prices
since the late 1950s. Export prices have also declined in the past four
months, with 22 per cent reporting a fall and only 6 per cent an increase.
Unit costs fell for the first time since the survey began in June 1958. The
survey showed that costs per unit of output had fallen for 22 per cent of
companies over the past four months compared with 17 per cent reporting an
increase. Only a slight rise in costs is anticipated in the next four
months.
The survey pointed towards further retrenchment on capital spending.
Investment intentions have weakened to their lowest level since July last
year and fewer companies are expecting to authorise increased spending on
buildings, plant and machinery over the next 12 months. More than half of
the companies surveyed cited uncertainty about demand as the factor most
likely to limit investment spending and 41 per cent cited inadequate net
returns as a constraint.
Sir David said that the government needed to initiate a more open discussion
of monetary policy. 'We need to have a broadly based discussion about ways
in which other institutions might participate in directing monetary policy.
The outcome of such discussions could be some form of independent central
bank,' he said.
The CBI said it did not favour an early return to the European exchange rate
mechanism.
A survey published yesterday by the Finance and Leasing Association showed
that only 29 per cent of its members expected any improvement in business
confidence this year, down from 61 per cent three months ago.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Salary review bodies could be overridden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first signal emerged yesterday that the government is considering
overriding the pay review bodies, which recommend pay rises for nearly a
third of public sector workers.
The Department of Health postponed a meeting at which Dr Brian Mawhinney,
minister of state for health, was to present oral evidence to the pay review
body covering about 600,000 nurses and midwives.
The department said another meeting would be scheduled after the Autumn
Statement on November 12. It said the ministers and officials would then be
able to give their evidence in a 'full and up-to-date economic context'.
The five pay review bodies are independent of government, but ministers are
able to 'give direction' to the bodies over what government can afford.
Government may also reject the findings of the bodies or, less dramatically,
phase in their recommendations as they have done four times over the last
nine years for nurses.
Health union officials, however, speculated that the Autumn Statement might
include some sort of 'pay norm', or a temporary suspension of the pay review
bodies which cover nurses and allied professions, the armed forces,
teachers, doctors and dentists and people on top salaries.
The pay review bodies are currently taking evidence and would normally make
recommendations to their respective secretaries of state and the prime
minister in January.
The bodies have traditionally recommended relatively high settlements and
have contributed to the much faster increase in public-sector pay relative
to that in the private sector over the past two years.
The bodies would be an important target of the government in its move to
restrain public-sector pay - it is widely assumed it would like to keep
public-sector pay to about 2 per cent or freeze it altogether in 1993-94.
Legally, the government could suspend all pay review bodies except the one
governing teachers which has a statutory basis.
The teachers' review body was set up under an act of parliament last year.
Once the government has referred a review of pay to the body - as it did in
July - it has to make a recommendation.

FT  28 OCT 92 / People: New treasurer for WPP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Martin Sorrell's marketing services group, WPP, will soon get a new
treasurer, Paul Richardson, currently deputy treasurer with Hanson.
Richardson is due to take over from Derek Hawkins in early January next
year, though Hawkins is likely to continue to be associated with WPP in a
consultancy capacity.
WPP has seen a trail of treasurers since 1990, including Simeon Galpert,
then Chris Coles, before Hawkins took over early this year. Richardson, 34,
graduated from the University of East Anglia in 1979, with a degree in
economics and computing. He travelled and worked in Spain for a year before
joining (as it then was) Thomson McLintock, where he trained as a chartered
accountant. He joined Hanson in March 1984.
Richardson says he looks forward to his new post as a 'great opportunity,
now that WPP has turned the corner after its refinancing agreement with the
banks'.

FT  28 OCT 92 / People: The revolving door at Lucas and TI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tony Edwards was yesterday confirmed as the new chief executive of TI
Group's Dowty division, the rival aerospace business to Lucas Industries,
where, as recently as August, he was due to take over as chief executive.
The move represents not only an extremely rapid change of heart by Sir
Anthony Gill, chairman and chief executive of Lucas, and his board which
decided in August that Edwards had not established himself as a successor.
It is also demonstrates fleet of foot by TI. After taking over Dowty in
June, TI placed Sid Taylor, formerly managing director of operations, in a
temporary role at Dowty.
He was to introduce TI culture and financial reporting systems into Dowty
and to begin a strategic review of the division's development in the
aerospace area. His position had always been planned to be temporary but a
permanent chief executive with detailed knowledge of the aerospace industry
had not been expected on board as quickly as Edwards is now due to arrive.
TI woke up to the opportunity earlier this month. Following Sir Anthony's
confirmation during the presentation of Lucas's interim results that Edwards
would not take over, TI pounced via a headhunter.
Edwards arrives at TI after two years at Lucas and experience at Bombardier
of Canada and General Electric in the US.
From November 16 he will take over the role of deciding the strategic
development of the Dowty aerospace division.
Meanwhile Taylor will move back to head office where he will keep TI's three
operating divisions - seals, pipes and aerospace - in touch with the latest
world developments in manufacturing practice and research relevant to its
manufacturing areas being conducted outside the group.
TI has now appointed chief executives in all three divisions: all report to
Christopher Lewinton, chief executive and chairman, who in turn is expected
to relinquish the chief executive position once the Dowty acquisition is
more fully integrated.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judith Church, national health and safety officer for MSF, the technical and
professional union, has been elected to Labour's National Executive
Committee. She is the first woman to hold one of the 12 seats reserved for
trade union representatives, rather than one of the five seats reserved for
women.
After graduating from Leeds University in maths and phil-osophy, she did
voluntary work in Africa for two years. Returning to the UK, she spent brief
spells in both the chemical and food processing industry before, in 1981,
taking up a post as a factory inspector with the Health and Safety
Executive. During one such inspection, in a concrete manufacturing plant,
she recalls making her mark permanently by stepping confidently into a
trough of unset concrete.
In 1986, she left the HSE and went to work for ASTMS, the white-collar union
which subsequently merged with TASS, the technical union, to form the
600,000 strong MSF.
She stood as the Labour candidate for Stevenage in the April general
election, but failed to win the seat.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Denmark unveils plan for treaty compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK last night unveiled a plan aimed at solving the impasse in the
European Community over the Maastricht treaty on monetary and political
union.
The plan is designed not only to reverse the Danes' rejection of Maastricht
in a referendum in June but also to give momentum to ratification of the
treaty in other countries, notably Britain.
The carefully phrased package of proposals, backed by seven of the eight
parties in the Danish parliament, includes opt-outs from a future common
currency and from a European defence force. The Danish government hopes it
can persuade its EC partners to go along with the proposals and then win a
Yes vote in a referendum next year.
The Danish 'national compromise' plan was disclosed just as Mr John Major
was fighting to win over waverers in Britain's Tory party. By revealing its
stance now, the Danish government has neutralised arguments in both the
Conservative and Labour parties that a British vote on ratification should
wait until the Danes have shown their hand.
The Danes' narrow vote against Maastricht threw the Community into disarray,
which deepened in recent months as France showed itself passionately divided
over the treaty and as currency turmoil led to the withdrawal of sterling
and the Italian lira from the exchange rate mechanism.
Mr Poul Schluter, the prime minister, said Denmark was seeking legally
binding wording for opt-outs, without a time limit, but the opt-outs would
not be irreversible.
The demand for an opt-out from a common currency was largely expected. The
Danes have also expressed reservations about common citizenship and law
enforcement.
The Danes want guarantees with sufficient political weight to win a
referendum, while meeting their EC partners' insistence that the Maastricht
treaty should not be renegotiated.
If the Danes insist on a separate protocol covering an opt-out on monetary
union, this might amount to a treaty amendment requiring further
ratification.

FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Cost cutting gains at British Syphon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH SYPHON Industries, the industrial group which is 70 per cent owned
by management following an attempt to take the company private in 1989,
yesterday announced an 11 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds
2.71m to Pounds 3.02m, for the six months to June 30.
The result was struck on sales down 14 per cent at Pounds 19.7m. Mr Bryan
Morrall, chairman, said the gains had been made through cost cutting and
tighter working capital. Operating profits rose 13 per cent to Pounds 1.5m.
The group, which has cash deposits of Pounds 30m, also stressed its
determination to seek a suitable acquisition at the earliest opportunity. It
is likely to pay for a purchase with shares and would use the cash to pay
off a target's debt.
Any paper deal would dilute both the management and Mr Nathu Ram Puri who,
with his private conglomerate Melton Medes, controls 25 per cent of British
Syphon. Mr Puri's stake barred management from taking the group private in
1989.
Mr Morrall said an acquisition would be in the interests of all
shareholders. A paper deal would create a market for the shares and, in
effect, return the company to the public arena.
British Syphon has been actively looking for an acquisition in the
manufacturing sector. It was reported to have been the suitor for Mosaic
early this summer, before withdrawing at the last minute. During the first
half, it took a Pounds 400,000 extraordinary charge for the costs of an
aborted acquisition.
Mr Morrall said the ideal target would roughly double British Syphon's
market capitalisation of Pounds 30m at last night's share price of 88p.
The group is to pay an interim dividend of 2p; it only returned to the
dividend list after four years, with a payment of 3p, in December. Mr
Morrall said part of the reason for resuming dividends was to increase the
attraction of an all-paper offer.
Earnings per share were 11 per cent ahead at 5.9p (5.3p).

FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: USX halves dividend on energy
side as net falls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
USX, the US steel and energy group, yesterday reported third-quarter net
income of Dollars 10m, down from Dollars 28m a year ago, amid weak markets
for steel and refined oil products, and announced it was halving the
dividend due to holders of its energy stock.
USX has divided the shares in the consolidated group into two separate
issues which track the fortunes of its Marathon oil business and its US
Steel subsidiary.
Mr Charles Corry, the chairman, said the dividend on Marathon stock had been
cut from 35 cents to 17 cents 'to maintain financial strength and
flexibility' while continuing to invest heavily in projects which were
expected to enhance its production profile from late-1993.
'Marathon group's profitability and cash-flow have been negatively affected
by depressed refined product margins in 1992,' he added. These stemmed
mainly from low petroleum product price levels relative to crude oil.
The group also announced it would adopt two new accounting standards in the
fourth quarter - FAS 106 and FAS 109 - and would restate its first-quarter
figures to account for these non-cash items. US Steel's income would be
reduced by around Dollars 1.2bn and Marathon's by some Dollars 275m to
Dollars 375m.
Marathon reported third-quarter net income of Dollars 17m, or 5 cents a
share, compared to Dollars 23m, or 8 cents, in the third quarter of last
year. Sales were Dollars 3.4bn, compared to Dollars 3.5bn before. US Steel
reported a net loss of Dollars 7m, or 13 cents a share, compared to net
income of Dollars 5m, or 9 cents a share, on sales unchanged at Dollars
1.3bn.
The figures were dragged down by start-up costs for the new slab caster at
the company's Mon Valley Works, near Pittsburgh, and weak markets for
tubular products. Prices remained stable but at levels below the same period
of 1991.

MR JOHN REED, the chairman of Citicorp, warned yesterday that the bank's
holdings of bad property loans would mount next year, as would the number of
property fore-closures.
He also said that more jobs would have to be cut in Citicorp's domestic and
international operations as part of a sustained effort to rein in costs.
In an address to a financial services seminar in New York, Mr Reed said that
because of the sluggishness of the economy, and the continued problems with
non-performing loans, any improvement in the bank's earnings would have to
come from cost savings.
He predicted, however, that Citicorp's operating margin would improve
slightly in 1993.
Mr Reed expects the bank to raise between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn in
capital through a variety of measures and earn an after-tax gain of as much
as Dollars 800m from the sale of assets during next year.

CHEVRON, one of the biggest US oil and gas groups, yesterday reported a 21
per cent rise in third-quarter net earnings to Dollars 378m, or Dollars 1.11
a share, compared with Dollars 313m, or 90 cents, a year ago.
Stripping out special items and foreign exchange in both years, Chevron said
earnings doubled to Dollars 419m, or Dollars 1.23, from Dollars 210, or 60
cents. Revenues advanced 11 per cent to Dollars 11.1bn, from Dollars 10bn.
Chevron, like its competitors, said earnings were boosted by higher prices
for crude oil, US natural gas and US refined product.
The results were helped by reorganisation and cost-cutting, which
contributed to an 11 per cent reduction in operating expenses from last
year's third quarter.
The weak economy, however, took a toll on profits from Chevron's chemicals
business and international refining and marketing. Domestic petroleum
operations were hurt by Hurricane Andrew, which disrupted production in
August and September.
Mr Ken Derr, chairman and chief executive, said fourth-quarter results would
include further cost reductions. The company also expects an after-tax gain
of about Dollars 375m from the stock-for-property swap with Penzoil.
During the quarter, US exploration and production profits soared to Dollars
253m, including gains of Dollars 62m from special items, from only Dollars
29m last year, including one-time gains of Dollars 10m. Chevron's average
crude oil sales price rose 99 cents a barrel to Dollars 17.94, while average
natural gas prices climbed 40 per cent to Dollars 1.75 per thousand cubic
feet.
Refining and marketing brought in earnings of Dollars 73m, including
one-time charges of Dollars 21m, compared with a loss of Dollars 10m a year
earlier, which included environmental provisions of Dollars 53m.
Chevron's chemicals business lost Dollars 7m in the quarter compared with
earnings of Dollars 44m last year. International refining and marketing lost
Dollars 4m in the quarter, compared with profits of Dollars 136m, which
included a favourable tax adjustment of Dollars 62m.

EASTMAN KODAK, the world's biggest producer of photographic equipment,
turned in third-quarter net earnings of Dollars 189m, or 58 cents a share,
against a deficit of Dollars 118m, or 37 cents, a year ago.
Excluding one-time charges in both years, Kodak said its underlying net
earnings rose 4 per cent to Dollars 330m, or Dollars 1.01, from Dollars
317m, or 97 cents. Sales in the three months were up 5 per cent to Dollars
5.18bn from Dollars 4.93bn.
Kodak warned earlier this month that it would take a Dollars 140m, or 43
cents, charge in the third quarter, when many analysts had expected a more
moderate charge of Dollars 45m, or 14 cents.
Looking to the fourth quarter, Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman and chief
executive, said: 'We believe we can deliver results in line with general
expectations, notwithstanding an economic background considerably less
supportive than what was foreseen by many.'
For the first nine months, Kodak had net earnings of Dollars 847m, or
Dollars 2.61, on sales of Dollars 14.78bn, against income of Dollars 417m,
or Dollars 1.28, on sales of Dollars 14.34bn last year.

FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas dips to
Dollars 15m loss in third quarter
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK

<TEXT>
MCDONNELL DOUGLAS, the financially-stretched US aerospace group, yesterday
announced a third-quarter loss of Dollars 15m after taking a Dollars 167m
after-tax charge to strengthen the wings of its controversial C-17 military
transport, which were damaged during stress tests at the start of this
month.
The company announced a drop in both revenues and profits at its commercial
aircraft division and an increase in the debt burden of the aerospace side
of the business.
The loss for the period would have been even larger without a Dollars 37m
gain from the sale of TeleCheck Services, a cheque acceptance service.
The Dollars 15m loss worked through at 39 cents a share, and compared to
profits of Dollars 77m, or Dollars 2.02 a share, in the same period of last
year. Revenues dropped from Dollars 4.45bn to Dollars 3.96bn.
The C-17, which McDonnell Douglas is developing for the US military, has
been dogged by delays and cost over-runs. The company said the quarter's
charge reflected the estimated cost of strengthening the wing, and the
growth of other costs in test, assembly and procurement. The charge also
provided increased reserves for estimated work remaining on the programme.
Excluding the C-17, operating earnings in the company's military aerospace
business totalled Dollars 122m, up from Dollars 99m, thanks to increased
earnings from the F/A-18 Hornet, the AH-64 Apache and AV-8B Harrier
programmes.
The missiles and space business had Dollars 78m in operating earnings for
the quarter, compared to Dollars 18m a year ago.
However, the commercial aircraft side saw earnings dip from Dollars 92m to
Dollars 52m, which the company said was due mainly to higher research and
development spending. It delivered 20 MD-80 twin jets during the quarter,
compared to 40 a year ago, and eight MD-11 trijets, up from six.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Survey of Aluminium (5): Old cans for new - Recycling / The
use of reclaimed cans as a raw material
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'GIVE ME a girl at an impressionable age, and she is mine for life,' says
the eponymous teacher in Muriel Spark's novel The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.
This is certainly the hope of the Aluminium Can Recycling Association
(Acra), which over the past three years has set about educating the UK
public about the wonders of the aluminium can. This year surveys show that
53 per cent of the population aged between seven and 14 say they recycle
their cans, compared with only 30 per cent of adults.
Marketing campaigns, the setting up of 350 recycling centres, collection
points at more than 1,000 supermarkets and high profile campaigns on
children's television have succeeded in giving aluminium a 'green' image.
Schools and charities have caught on to the fund raising possibilities.
Aluminium also appears to be getting the upper hand in its battle with
steel, which is after all just as recyclable. But aluminium's high intrinsic
value more than covers the cost of separating it out before it enters the
waste stream. Steel is more cheaply recovered by waving a magnet over
refuse.
Mr Francois Pruvost of Pechiney told an international aluminium conference
in Oslo last month that during the last three years about 60 per cent of
newly built canning lines in Europe are using aluminium as the raw material
versus 40 per cent for steel. 'We expect the aluminium share of the market
to progressively reach 65 to 70 per cent towards the end of the century,' he
said.
In the UK itself the decision by Coca-Cola to convert its canning lines to
aluminium will largely contribute to the metal taking 72 per cent of the
market in 1993, compared with only 40 per cent in 1989.
Mr Pruvost pointed out to the conference that aluminium could not afford to
rest on its laurels. 'Packaging is 10 times more important for aluminium
than for steel and the two piece beverage can is 160 times more important
for aluminium than for steel. Research and development efforts in packaging
and cans are therefore given a much higher priority in the aluminium
industry than in the steel industry and this also makes me optimistic about
the future.'
Acra feels that it is doing well in the UK, the biggest market for canned
beverages in Europe, with per capita consumption of about 125 cans. This
year out of a total beverage can consumption of 7.2bn, aluminium accounted
for 4.3bn cans; next year the metal's market share is expected to be 5.4bn
cans from a total of 7.4bn.
The association is aiming to meet the European aluminium industry's target
of recycling 50 per cent of all aluminium can production by 1995. The extent
of its ambitions can be seen by the fact that at the end of last year only
15 to 16 per cent was recycled. In the US and Australia more than 60 per
cent of drink cans are recycled.
The industry has had to expand its recycling infrastructure to feed a Pounds
28m facility at Warrington in northern England dedicated only to can
processing. The plant was established last year by Alcan of Canada, and is
the first of its kind in Europe.
Last year Warrington, which will ultimately have a capacity of 50,000
tonnes, processed 2,180 tonnes of used cans and other aluminium scrap
collected by Alcan. While it has already processed 2,259 tonnes of UK cans
in the first half this year, it is having to import the rest of its
feedstock, mostly from the US.
However, in August Acra opened the last of seven regional centres in the UK
where scrap merchants and other collectors can exchange cans for cash. These
'aggregation centres' enable merchants to take 250kg loads of used cans to
collection points close by instead of having to deliver direct to Warrington
or to the Swansea collection centre operated by the Aluminium Company of
America (Alcoa). Merchants get the same factory gate price as paid at
Warrington (about Pounds 700 a tonne) and receive their cash between seven
and 10 days after delivery.
In the rest of Europe (including the European Free Trade Area countries)
aluminium accounted for nearly half the 21bn cans consumed. Of these about
21 per cent were recycled - twice the percentage in 1987. Sweden, which has
a mandatory deposit scheme on cans, had the highest recycling rate at 85 per
cent, followed by Iceland at 75 per cent and Switzerland at 50 per cent.
Aluminium is a relative newcomer to the food and drink industries, appearing
first in 1958 with the revolutionary easy open end. Improvements are still
being made. Mr Pruvost of Pechiney said that the thickness of can bodies had
been reduced by 45 per cent and can ends by 15 per cent over a 20-year
period.
But the industry is under no illusions that mere technology will win the
packaging battle. 'We have a 50 per cent recycling target for the
mid-1990s,' said Mr Alexander Wirtz, chairman of the European Aluminium
Association's packaging committee. 'In order to achieve it we need the
support of consumers, retailers and municipalities.'
Environmental concerns should help to give aluminium the edge, he feels.
'The challenge of the 1990s is, I believe, ecology - it is important we
improve across Europe our waste management practices. Aluminium's life cycle
is ideally suited.'

FT  28 OCT 92 / Survey of Aluminium (6): Alloy] alloy] - LME launches scrap
metal contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY 12 MONTHS ago the chances of a contract in aluminium alloy getting off
the ground were put at just 50-50 by some members of the London Metal
Exchange. The subject was a hot potato, arousing passionate debate between
the industry and the exchange for more than two years.
The contract, for trading in alloy made from recycled scrap, has now been
running for three weeks , and it looks as though the LME's cautious approach
and painstaking ground work will pay off. The exchange has a lot riding on
the new contract. Leaving aside the high grade aluminium contract (which
replaced the initial aluminium contract) and the relaunched tin contract,
the aluminium alloy contract is its first new product for 13 years.
The arguments against the contract are familiar. 'It will open the market up
to speculators and gamblers, which is not in our best interests,' said one
US alloy producer.
The Organisation of European Aluminium Smelters and the Japan Aluminium
Alloy Refiners Association said were flatly against the contract. But events
have shown that they cannot afford to ignore it. Traders were already making
money from the contract before the market officially opened on October 6.
'Interest is very high,' said Mr Hans Murmann, jointmanaging director of
Metallgesellschaft's London subsidiary. We have traded many thousands of
tonnes.' He pointed out that the LME's timing - all important in the launch
of a new contract - looked good. 'Secondary aluminium smelters are losing
money because of the poor state of the economy and they are pleased to let
the LME have metal for ready cash.'
Mr Ralph Kestenbaum, chairman of the LME's aluminium alloy committee, said
that on the unofficial market in August and September alloy had been traded
at a Dollars 10 a tonne premium to the primary aluminium contract, and also
at a Dollars 65 discount. This showed that the primary contract was not a
satisfactory proxy for alloy and the new contract was needed.
The first fortnight of trading has been slow, but this is hardly surprising
given the depressed state of the base metals markets. Mr John Wolff, LME
chairman, said: 'It will take time to bed down. But it is a very large
market and growing.'
Secondary aluminium production is about 4.5m tonnes a year, mainly of
automotive grade alloy. The motor industry uses more than 70 per cent of
production. By the time of the contract launch 47 alloy brands had been
registered by producers, between them accounting for about 2m tonnes a year
output.
The contract specifies three grades for delivery - German DIN 226, Japanese
AD12.1, and US A380-1. These represent the basic - or in the words of one
trader 'bog standard' - die-casting specifications in Japan, Europe and the
US, the three main consuming regions. Although the three chosen grades vary
slightly they are designed for the same function - automotive die-casting -
and consequently in practice there is little difference in their prices.
The contract is in US dollars, covers lots of 20 tonnes and can be traded 15
months forward.
Hitherto, pricing in the industry has been archaic, according to Mr Martin
Abbott, the LME's director of marketing, and some people felt it was
hindering the development of the industry. Prices were assessed and
published by the trade and the trade press - a system unsuitable for a large
volume business with many aparticipants.
The industry tended to ignore the published price and offer discounts. There
was no hedging for forward fixed price contracts, said Mr Abbott. Hedging
against the exchange's primary aluminium contract was ineffective, as the
secondary market was driven by different factors and price movements could
diverge.
Smelters have had to pay for their scrap metal purchases by the end of a
calendar month. They have been selling their aluminium alloy to consumers
who should pay within 60 days. But in present economic conditions consumers
often keep suppliers waiting 90 days.
Now smelters - always seen as the key to the success of the new contract -
can hedge against movement in both aluminium scrap and aluminium alloy,
locking in firm futures prices for both.
The LME regards itself as a risk management forum, with delivery of metal to
one of its warehouses as a system of last resort. Storage of aluminium alloy
has been one of the most contentious issues surrounding the new contract.
Some suggest that the alloy - which contains some copper or zinc - oxidises
in a few days.
So far the LME has authorised 12 warehouses for aluminium alloy, spread
between France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK and the US. All have
the necessary temperature and humidity control equipment so that the onset
of oxidation can be minimised.
What effect the contract has on the industry remains to be seen. Some
traders suggest that the impact will be profound as it threatens the price
cartels alleged to exist in Japan and Germany. The Japanese, however, point
out that none of their production reaches the free market as it is all sold
under contract on a long-term basis.
If the contract takes off, the industry will certainly never be the same
again.

mid 1990s because of delays in building new smelting capacity and rising
demand from car makers

THERE MIGHT be a nasty shortage of aluminium from the mid-1990s onwards,
because the industry has been forced to shelve many capacity expansion
projects it will urgently need by then.
This would be embarrassing for an industry which, though suffering
short-term difficulties, is confident it has a bright future. Aluminium's
recyclable value and light weight enable producers to promote it as a
'green' metal, a natural for the era in which we live.
The industry also anticipates a big surge of demand from car makers, similar
to the boost it received in the 1980s when beer and soft drinks producers
moved to aluminium cans.
Yet, Sumitomo Corporation of Japan, one of the world's biggest metals
trading groups, estimated recently that an aluminium shortage might bite as
early as 1995. It suggested that by then annual demand for the metal would
outpace supply by 1.23m tonnes.
Nearly 1m tonnes of new capacity is coming on stream this year and next but
'after that we can find no plans to increase output capacity,' Sumitomo
pointed out.
Mr Harry Helton, executive vice president, metals and raw materials, at
Reynolds Metals, second-largest of the US aluminium groups, calculates the
industry needs to build 13 new smelters costing about Dollars 1bn each by
the year 2002 if it is to keep pace with the expected demand growth. But the
industry is at present delaying work on new smelting capacity and 'this
might lead to a very tight supply situation at the end of the 1990s'.
He explains: 'We can't go to shareholders and ask for a new smelter until we
can see a sustained upswing in the aluminium price.' The industry needs to
see a sustained price of 80 cents to 85 cents a lb (Dollars 1,763 to Dollars
1,873 a tonne) before it could reasonably start investing again, he says.
Last year aluminium on the London Metal Exchange averaged 59.1 cents a lb
and in December the price reached its lowest level ever in real terms. It
was then below 50 cents a lb at which point about 75 per cent of western
world smelting capacity was operating below its cash cost of production.
Half-way through October this year the average price so far in 1992 was only
57.86 cents and again it was dangerously near that all-time low.
Plummeting prices have been caused mainly because the western industry has
been engulfed by an unstoppable tidal wave of metal from the former Soviet
Union.
Last year, in its desperate search for foreign earnings, the Commonwealth of
Independent States exported more than 1m tonnes of aluminium to the west -
equivalent to the output of four modern smelters and a near 7 per cent
overnight addition to the western supply of new metal. (During the 1980s the
Soviet Union exported between 250,000 to 300,000 tonnes a year to the west.)
Without the flood from the CIS the industry could have coped with
international recession and would this year have faced only a modest supply
surplus caused by stagnating demand.
The industry reacted to the CIS flood by shutting western capacity either
permanently or temporarily - 995,000 tonnes of it. There were permanent
closures last year in Austria, Brazil, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy and
Mexico totalling 372,000 tonnes.
However, this year 900,000 tonnes of new annual capacity has started up. It
could not be held back. Pechiney's new smelter in Dunkirk, France, was
rushed into operation as quickly as possible because it has only a limited
time to benefit from extremely low power prices from Electricite de France,
which has a temporary power surplus.
At the Alouette smelter in Quebec, where VAW Aluminium is technical manager,
Mr Otto Niederhofer, president of VAW Aluminium Canada, says the consortium
which owns the smelter considered holding back because of poor market
conditions but this would have been too costly. Mr Bond Evans, president of
Alumax which owns the Lauralco smelter in Quebec, says with some irony: 'The
timing of Lauralco's start-up is unfortunate but four years ago, when we
gave the go-ahead, it was difficult to forecast the failure of Communism and
the break-up of the eastern block. Lauralco was a strategic move for the
future and we don't look for a payback on any new smelter in less than seven
years.'
But, wherever possible, the industry has shelved most of its potential
smelter projects. Venezuela, the lowest-cost aluminium producer, has
suffered most from this trend. Three projects have been shelved, dashing the
country's hopes of building its aluminium capacity to 1m tonnes by the end
of the century.
The industry has been battening down the hatches in other ways. Capital
investment has been cut to the bone to save cash until prices improve. But
many observers suggest prices will not improve until there are further
substantial cuts in output. Mr David Morton, chairman of Alcan, told the US
Aluminium Association last month that the industry's short term
supply-demand imbalance could last several years if the logical response -
taking out high-cost production capacity - was not forthcoming.
Calling for immediate action, Mr Stewart Spector, author of the New
York-based Spector Report, says: 'It looks as if the aluminium industry
could self-destruct if producers take no action to cut production. The world
economy for the most part has stalled. Over 900,000 tonnes of new primary
aluminium ingot capacity will be fully operational in a few months. Ingot
prices are falling. Aluminium producers seem to be on some other planet.'
According to Mr Tony Bird, of the UK-based Anthony Bird Associates
consultancy organisation, between 1.4m and 2m tonnes of present aluminium
capacity do not have a long-term future. Most of these high-cost, 'problem'
smelters are in Europe but there are also some in north west US.
European executives suggest the situation is more complex than a study of
costs would suggest. For example, Mr Jochen Schirner, chairman of VAW
Aluminium's management board, admits that 'at present LME prices most
smelters should close - but that is ridiculous'. He says that VAW's smelter
on the Rhine is sizeable - 211,000 tonnes a year - and its power contract is
'not bad'. VAW's other three smelters are smaller, from 70,000 to 120,000
tonnes, but 'they are all good technically and environmentally. The two in
north Germany have power contracts to 1995-96 and within that contract
period they will continue.'
Although it is fighting to conserve its cash, there is no sense of crisis in
the industry as there was in the early 1980s after oil supply shocks sent
the cost of energy soaring.
As Mr Dag Flaa, chairman of the European Aluminium Association, points out,
demand for aluminium last year reached a record 15.13m tonnes, a 3.6 per
cent increase on the 1990 level. Ten years ago the industry was using only
80 per cent of capacity. Today the rate is 96 per cent. 'This is again a
confirmation of aluminium's strong position and future potential.'
The European association expects aluminium demand to resume a 3 per cent
annual growth pattern when the recession ends - the same growth rate
forecast by Sumitomo when preparing its previously-mentioned estimates for
aluminium supply and demand in the mid-1990s. However, Reynolds' Mr Helton
used a more-conservative 2 per cent in concluding 13 new smelters are needed
by 2002.
Aluminium sales are likely to ease back this year a little, particularly as
even the weather has conspired against the industry. Unseasonably cool
weather in the US cut cold drinks sales there and triggered a 3.9 per cent
drop in shipments of aluminium for beverage cans. Aluminium also plays a
solid role in building and construction, a market in recession for the past
two years.
The industry reckons there is still much future demand growth to come from
packaging - most of the world has a long way to go to catch up with North
America in this respect - and car makers.
Recycling makes good commercial sense for the industry. It takes a great
deal of energy to produce new aluminium but that energy is 'stored' so that
it can take as little as 5 per cent of the original energy to recycle the
metal. Also, the capital cost of a plant to re-melt aluminium is only about
one tenth the cost of a primary smelter.
There have been worries that aluminium's relatively high price and, more
importantly, price volatility arising from trading on the London Metal
Exchange, might dent its prospects in the automotive industry. However, the
aluminium producers believe they have already solved that problem. For
example, Mr Yale Brandt, vice chairman of Reynolds, says: 'We have told the
auto companies that, if the volume of aluminium they want is high enough, we
would make the metal available on a cost-related basis. But we must cover
the cost of replacing capacity and other things.'
Meanwhile, the industry can't wait to get moving out of recession. According
to Mr Allen Born, chairman of Amax, 'the aluminium industry is gathering
steam and heading for tighter market conditions in 1994 and 1995. That
translates to a solid base of aluminium demand and higher prices for the
long term.'

FT  28 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Sweden and Finland seek fresh foreign
funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO Scandinavian sovereign borrowers are expected to tap the Eurobond
markets later today in D-Marks and French francs.
Sweden is said to be raising FFr5bn in a five-year deal priced to yield 45
to 50 basis points over comparable maturity French Treasuries, while Finland
is expected to announce a DM1bn five-year Eurobond. Other sovereign
borrowers are also said to be testing the waters for fresh funds.
The issue is said to be attracting muted interest from domestic French
investors, who found Finnish 11-year French franc Eurobond launched earlier
this year hard to digest.
Dealers said that, despite the glut of issues in recent weeks, the markets
had shown a reasonable capacity to absorb the supply. After its DM2bn issue
earlier this month, the deal is expected to offer Sweden a somewhat narrower
spread of roughly 15 basis points over London interbank offered rates than
the 30 basis point margin on its previous issue.
However, there has been considerable discussion about exactly what
advantages will accrue to these sovereign borrowers once the funds are
swapped back into the domestic currency.
In Sweden, for instance, domestic interest rates for five-year money are
lower than rates achieved following a swap from D-Marks.
With the domestic markets unable to provide cash an the scale needed by
Sweden, however, the borrower may have no option other than to raise funds,
albeit at higher cost, in other currencies.
Meanwhile, two more Mexican corporate borrowers tapped the Eurobond market
yesterday, seeking a total of Dollars 350m of five-year debt, and more are
lining up to follow suit.
Grupo Televisa, Mexico's largest producer of Spanish-language television
programmes, assigned a 10 per cent coupon to its five-year Dollars 200m bond
and priced it at 410 basis points over comparable US Treasuries at 99.961
per cent, for an effective yield of 10.01 per cent. Chase Investment Bank
was lead underwriter for the deal.
Late yesterday, Morgan Stanley International said it would offer Dollars
150m of five-year Eurobonds for Empresas la Moderna, a Mexican cigarette
distributor. The bonds are to be priced at 425 basis points over US
Treasuries later today.
Other Mexican borrowers preparing to tap the market are Vitro, Mexico's
largest glass manufacturer, and Dina, a domestic truck and bus manufacturer.
The collapse of equities prices on the Mexican stock markets three months
ago has prompted companies searching for expansion capital to consider
borrowing money rather than selling shares.
Separately, Deutsche Bank described its DM100m issue for its Deutsche
Finance Netherlands subsidiary as a block trade private placement for sale
to retail investors through its own network. Morgan Stanley's DM100m
seven-year reverse FRN for DSL Bank pays a coupon of 9 1/2 per cent for the
first year and 20 per cent less two-times six-month Libor thereafter.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Strong gains in US on low inflation figure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A BIG drop in consumer confidence, good news on inflation and a successful
two-year auction helped bond prices post strong gains yesterday, despite a
better-than-expected third-quarter gross domestic product report.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/8 at 95
21/32 , yielding 7.614 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  5/32
at 99 1/2 , for a yield of 4.255 per cent.
Although the early news of a 2.7 per cent rise in third quarter GDP
surprised the market, which had been expecting a smaller gain of about 1.5
per cent, prices held steady. Most analysts said the data did not tell the
whole story, and argued that the revised GDP figure would give a clearer
indication of economic conditions during the quarter.
Investors were also cheered by the low measure of inflation in the GDP
report. Prices did not take off until the Conference Board announced that
its consumer confidence index had fallen from 57.3 to 53.0 in September. The
big fall in confidence pleased the market because it suggests that consumer
spending could be especially weak in the final quarter. Later, strong demand
at the two-year auction also buoyed sentiment.
UK government bonds surged on rumours of a sharp cut in interest rates,
gaining more than half a point on the day after a volatile session.
The gilt market opened on a weak note, mainly due to dissent within the
Conservative party over the Maastricht treaty, but prices later picked up on
speculation about a cut in the base rate.
Dealers said prices were further boosted by gloomy economic news from
Germany yesterday. A report released by Germany's five leading economic
research institutes forecast weak economic growth and low inflation in 1993,
raising the market's hopes of a cut in interest rates in Germany and
elsewhere in Europe.
The 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 opened at 119 and fell to 119.00 in the
morning before recovering to end at 120.00.
GERMAN government bonds rallied following gloomy forecasts from Germany's
five leading economic research institutes, as the predictions of poor growth
and low inflation next year rekindled hopes of a cut in domestic interest
rates.
However, the bund market later lost some of its gains on profit-taking, to
end little changed on the day.
The Liffe bund futures contract rose from 91.41 to a high of 91.70, before
dropping back to end the day at 91.48.
JAPANESE government bonds climbed to new highs in the cash and futures
markets, spurred on by domestic buying early in the trading session.
The December futures contract reached 107.26, its highest level since
February 1989, but later fell back to close at 107.15, against an opening of
107.02.
In the cash market, the yield on the No 145 issue moved from 4.79 per cent
at the opening to end at 4.77 per cent, as dealers noted strong demand among
domestic institutions for ten-year bonds. Dealers said that some investors
had hoped to see an easing in interest rates this week, possibly in
conjunction with the quarterly meeting of the Bank of Japan's branch
managers, which started yesterday.

FT  28 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Hopes dwindle for new
agreement on capital requirements - IOSCO Conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and TRACY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospect of financial regulators agreeing on common capital standards
for banks and securities firms has become dim and distant, write Robert
Peston and Tracy Corrigan.
Not only is there little chance of peace breaking out between securities
regulators, who are negotiating under the umbrella of the International
Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), but they are also at
loggerheads with their bank counterparts, grouped on the Basle Committee for
banking supervision.
The Basle Committee recently submitted a proposal to IOSCO's technical
committee, which would exempt banks from the requirement to carry capital as
a protection against possible losses on the bulk of bond holdings.
Mr Richard Breeden, chairman both of the US Securities and Exchange
Commission and the IOSCO technical committee, said IOSCO members were united
in opposing the Basle committee's stance.
However, such unity between IOSCO members has not been the norm this week.
In a dispute over the capital standard to be applied to equity holdings, the
SEC has been leading one camp and the UK's Securities and Investments Board
the other.
The row hinges on the extent to which a securities firm or bank should be
able to reduce the capital it carries as cover against the risk of losses on
equities by hedging.
In its simplest form, hedging consists of matching a holding of equities
against contracts to sell equities, or short positions. The theory is that,
if share prices fall, the value of the short positions will rise, offsetting
the loss.
Mr Breeden said that the SIB-backed proposal would allow a securities firm
to carry capital equivalent to only 2 per cent of the sum of its long and
short positions, if that firm had a perfectly hedged book as defined by the
proposal.
That compares with the SEC's current minimum of approximately 15 per cent
and its counter-proposal to Iosco of an 8.75 per cent minimum.
'How does it serve our duty of protecting the public by cutting capital
requirements?' Mr Breeden asked.
He is intent on preventing IOSCO repeating the mistakes he believes were
made by the Basle Committee, when its members agreed a capital adequacy
standard for bank loans, which has been implemented over the past two years.
Mr Breeden said the economic consequences of this standard have been
disastrous. US banks have been providing too few loans to companies and
investing their funds predominantly in government bonds, he said, because
the standard imposes a high capital cost on loans and a zero cost on
purchases of government bonds.
He wants IOSCO to have more modest ambitions than the Basle Committee, which
some securities regulators regard as the model for IOSCO's technical
committee. He believes that IOSCO should be a 'clearing house of ideas', not
a rule maker.
Though other securities regulators may not agree, they cannot ignore him,
since the US securities market accounts for approximately 50 per cent of the
world's equity trading.

FT  28 OCT 92 / International Equities: Markets braced for flurry of Asian
issues

<TEXT>
ASIAN companies are set to launch a stream of international equity issues in
the next few weeks, with offerings from Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and
India.
Investment bankers point out that Far Eastern names are likely to account
for much of the activity in the international equity markets in the
immediate future, as recent turmoil in Europe's financial markets has led
some European companies to postpone their offerings.
The largest of the Far Eastern deals is Hyundai Motor's proposed Dollars
150m issue of global depository receipts, expected next month.
Johnson Electric, a Hong Kong micro-motor manufacturer, plans to launch a
Dollars 60m global equity offering, with Morgan Stanley and Robert Fleming
as lead managers.
President Enterprises, Taiwan's largest general retailer and food
manufacturer, is planning a Dollars 70m offering of global depository
receipts in the first half of November, lead-managed by Credit Suisse First
Boston.
Investors can expect three offerings from India in the next few weeks - from
Grasim, the cement, textiles and fibre group, Essar Gujarat, an iron
company, and Hindalco, an aluminium producer.
Grasim had to delay its Dollars 90m offering this summer when trading on the
Bombay stock exchange was halted. The offering is now expected in
mid-November, with Citicorp and Merrill Lynch as joint lead managers.
However, investors are likely to be wary of the latest Indian offerings
after their experience with Reliance Industries earlier in the year. Shares
in Reliance suffered a sharp fall after the global offering, and many
investors were annoyed when Reliance increased the size of the issue from
Dollars 100m to Dollars 150m.

FT  28 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Further weakness in IBM drags
Dow lower
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US markets failed to draw strength from a better-than-expected third-quarter
economic growth report, and by the close prices were mostly lower with IBM
again dragging down the Dow Jones Industrial Average, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
The Dow finished 8.38 lower at 3,235.73, although off its trough for the day
when the average had been down more than 20 points. The more broadly based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 closed up 0.32 at 418.48, while the Amex composite
ended up 0.49 at 376.65 and the Nasdaq composite down 1.97 at 596.95.
Turnover on the NYSE was busy at 210m shares.
Investors ignored the week's most important economic data, the gross
domestic product report for the third quarter which showed a 2.7 per cent
rise in output between July and September. Although it was a bigger increase
than analysts had expected, it failed to inspire confidence in the outlook
for the economy, and most forecasters are still predicting a slower rate of
growth in the final quarter of the year.
The market was not helped by a big fall in the Conference Board's September
index of consumer confidence, which dropped from 57.3 to 53.0 last month.
Although the figures sparked a welcome rally in bond prices, the Treasury
market's gains failed to lift sentiment in the equity market.
Among individual stocks, IBM could not shake the sellers that have
devastated the stock since the company announced disappointing quarterly
earnings a week and a half ago. IBM fell another Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 65
3/4 , a new low for the year, in turnover of 3.2m shares. This latest drop
was sparked by newspaper reports that suggested a bleak outlook for the
computer mainframe market.
Other big stocks were also hit by sellers. General Motors, which has yet to
announce a successor to its ousted chairman, Mr Robert Stempel, fell Dollars
1 7/8 to Dollars 32 3/8 . Xerox plunged Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 76 after
the company announced third quarter earnings of Dollars 135m and a Dollars
444m provision related to the restructuring of the group's Crum &amp; Forster
unit.
Xerox also warned that there may be a need for further provisions. Northern
Telecom rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 36 1/2 in turnover of 1/2 m shares on
news of third quarter net income of 46 cents a share, slightly lower than
the 48 cents a share earned at the same stage last year.
RJR Nabisco firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 8 1/4 in turnover of almost 3m
shares after the company announced net income of 18 cents a share for the
third quarter, up from 7 cents a share a year earlier.
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended higher in active trading, following Monday's defeat of
a package of constitutional changes in a national referendum.
According to preliminary data, the TSE 300 index rose 10.45 points, or 0.32
per cent, to close at 3,286.44. Advances led declines 322 to 225, volume of
38.2m shares was below Monday's 39.2m, and trading value rose to CDollars
395.6m from the previous CDollars 244m.
Industrial products and banking were up 1.48 per cent and 1 per cent,
respectively. Consumer products rose moderately, energy stocks were flat.
Golds and mining decreased 1.90 per cent and 1.95 per cent, respectively. In
all, eight of the 14 stock groups ended higher.

FT  28 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Futures-related buying
supports Nikkei

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of lower interest rates and a rally in the bond market prompted a rise
in the futures market, and futures-related arbitrage buying supported the
Nikkei average, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average rose 173.93 to 17,185.26 after a low of 16,997.89 and
a high of 17,215.65. Although light profit-taking pushed the index below
17,000 in early trading, hopes of a cut in the official discount rate
prompted buying towards the end of the morning.
Volume remained low at 150m shares against 136m, as most investors remained
on the sidelines. Dealers, who have supported volume in recent weeks, were
also absent on the last day of trading for October accounts.
Advances led declines by 502 to 389 with 195 issues remaining unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 8.83 to 1,297.53 and in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.09 to 1044.67.
In the absence of long-term buyers, trading by brokers dominated activity.
Mr Warren Primhak, senior trader at Baring Securities, noted that companies
that have made progress in restructuring operations provided a potential
trading theme for traders.
Pharmaceutical stocks were active ahead of a conference on viral diseases.
Shionogi rose Y40 to Y840 and Daiichi Pharmaceutical gained Y20 to Y1,660.
Nikken Chemicals, the most active issue, rose Y70 to Y1,160 on hopes for a
cure to Alzheimer's disease. Snow Brand Milk added Y18 to Y813 and Takeda
Chemical Y10 to Y1,250.
Lion, the toiletries maker, gained Y10 to Y635 on optimism over its
restructuring plan, which was announced earlier this month.
Leading electronics makers rose on bargain hunting. Hitachi added Y15 to
Y725 and Toshiba gained Y15 to Y582. Traders said no surprises were expected
from their interim profits for the six months to September, which were due
to be announced after the close.
In Osaka, the OSE average added 18.12 to 18,743.93 in a volume of 19.4m
shares.
Roundup
HONG KONG recorded its largest one-day gain since August, while other
markets in the region were mixed.
HONG KONG reversed Monday's loses on institutional buying, with the Hang
Seng Index advancing 155.54, or 2.6 per cent, to 6,218.01. Turnover fell to
HKDollars 3.1bn from HKDollars 4bn.
Some analysts said that positive economic fundamentals outweighed the
current political difficulties between Governor Chris Patten and China over
the future of democracy in the colony after 1997.
TAIWAN, however, fell to its lowest level since June 1989 as concern about a
slowdown in economic growth deterred activity. The weighted index lost 22.93
at 3,647.97 in a turnover of TDollars 6bn.
The finance sector registered the steepest falls with the three big
commercial banks losing between 50 cents and TDollars 1.00.
SINGAPORE rose sharply as blue chips were actively sought and volume
exceeded 100m shares for the first time in five months. The Straits Times
Industrial index rose 24.44 to 1,390.91 as gains led falls by 238 to 35.
Among the actives, Singapore Press Foreign rose 70 cents to SDollars 13.80
and OCBC Foreign put on 60 cents to SDollars 10.60.
KUALA LUMPUR closed off the day's highs on profit-taking, with the composite
index finishing 3.25 higher at 633.32 in a volume of 185.6m shares.
SEOUL firmed slightly on late institutional buying after further uncertainty
as to whether Kim Woo-choong, chairman of Daewoo, will stand as a
presidential candidate. Shares in Daewoo's eight listed companies closed
limit-down, while the composite index rose 1.36 to 584.10 in a turnover of
Won763.6bn.
MANILA showed a slight recovery after last week's fall and Monday's closure
because of flooding in the capital following a typhoon. The composite index
gained 0.73 to 1,322.14 in a combined turnover of 348m pesos.
AUSTRALIA extended Monday's fall with a further decline in the All
Ordinaries index of 14.1 to 1,436.6. Some analysts said that the market was
waiting for economic data due later this week.
Turnover of ADollars 225.1m was boosted by heavy volume in Foster's rights,
which finished 2 cents lower at 6.50 cents. The ordinary shares lost 6 cents
to ADollars 1.16. News Corp resisted the downward trend with a 14-cent gain
to ADollars 24.26.
NEW ZEALAND weakened in lacklustre trading with the NZSE-40 losing 2.47 to
1,383.44 in a low turnover of NZDollars 16m.

FT  28 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Politics and the economy depress
Johannesburg - Why investors are nervous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fragile international equity markets, poor growth prospects and a gloomy
domestic political scene have created a very nervous mood on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE).
In spite of a 3.5 per cent recovery last week, the overall index is still 19
per cent off its high for the year of 3,749, achieved on June 5th, closing
at 3,007 yesterday. The industrial index, which closed at 3,995, is 15 per
cent off its year high while the gold index, at 822, recently hit a
seven-year low.
Despite these corrections, there is broad consensus that the market is
likely to go lower in the short term. Mr Rob Lee, of the Board of Executors
financial institution, said that the recent correction was a case of the
market catching up with reality, having previously defied the deteriorating
political and business climate. The fundamentals, meanwhile, had worsened.
'Ratings are still high while expectations are much worse than they were,'
said Mr Lee.
The gloomier sentiment is closely related to the dawning realisation that
economic recovery in the main western economies will be slower than
anticipated. South Africa is traditionally drawn out of recession by a
commodity upturn, which now looks as though it may be delayed until 1994.
There is also concern about the possibility of a sizeable downward
correction in the Dow Jones, which the JSE traditionally tracks closely.
Some analysts also blame the spill-over effect from tight global liquidity,
which is depressing world markets and economies.
Prospects for domestic growth are little to get enthusiastic about. South
Africa's GDP is likely to fall by about 1.5 per cent this year and average
growth forecasts for next year are only about 1 per cent.
These poor fundamentals have already filtered over into bad corporate
results, with the expectation of worse to come. Profit forecasts in recent
weeks have stressed overwhelmingly the likelihood of weaker earnings in the
year ahead.
The traditional shortage of scrip argument as a support for the JSE is also
undermined by potentially large cash calls on institutions: a R600m (Dollars
140.2m) rights issue from Stanbic, R1.3bn being sought for the Alusaf
project and about R2bn for the Royal group's acquisition of Del Monte Foods
International.
While the JSE is to a large extent mirroring international trends, there are
also two factors that lend domestic flavour: the severe drought, which the
Reserve Bank has estimated could knock 1.8 percentage points off GDP growth
this year, and politics.
Following a two-year honeymoon period, when expectations of the political
reform process tended towards the euphoric, the last three months have seen
a mood of considerable, possibly exaggerated, pessimism set in. Although the
current gloom probably has more to do with poor economic fundamentals, it
could certainly do with a political fillip.
While the installation of an interim government might until recently have
done the trick, cynicism about the political process has reached the stage
where the market is probably likely to regard a new government only as
introducing further uncertainty. Mr Tony Gibson, of the Syfrets group, said:
'The longer you wait, the more good news you need to attract people back.'
Sentiment has been further undermined by the dramatic plunge in the value of
the financial rand, the investment currency for foreigners, earlier this
month. A weak financial rand normally boosts share prices, but the failure
of this to happen has highlighted the nervous mood among investors.
Mr James Inglis, of Liberty Asset Management, predicted a sharpening
polarisation of the market as funds chase the increasingly small pool of
'Rand Club' stocks which have the ability to continue raising earnings -
especially defensive stocks like Premier and Tiger Oats in the food sector
and financials such as Liberty and Stanbic - while allowing others to
languish.
Mr Gibson foresaw continued vulnerability on the JSE until at least
mid-1993. He said one of two things had to happen: either strong earnings
growth would come through in the next six months, or current market ratings
would unwind. Of the two, the latter appears more likely.

FT  28 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bundesbank keeps investors
guessing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS were cautious ahead of the Bundesbank's council meeting tomorrow,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT turned lower as hopes that the Bundesbank would ease interest
rates at its Thursday meeting began to fade. However, in the present mood of
uncertainty and speculation, comments by one central bank member just before
the close were interpreted by some that there was still room for manoeuvre.
The DAX index responded by coming off the day's low of 1524.41 to finish
down 8.72 at 1,533.77. Turnover was a moderate DM4.6bn after DM4.7bn.
Schering made one of the day's biggest advances with a rise of DM21.50 or 3
per cent to DM698.00 on a buy recommendation from Nomura Research. Mr Harald
Gruber, the analyst, said that 'the higher net interest income and a better
pharmaceutical performance will more than offset any possible setbacks in
agrochemical profits in 1993'. He forecast a 1993 EPS of DM46.70, after
DM44.40 in 1991, rising to DM55.50 in 1994.
Porsche performed even better, gaining 6.5 per cent, on an old rumour, later
denied, that Volkswagen was interested in taking it over. The shares leapt
DM30 to DM485 while Volkswagen slipped DM1.20 to DM270.70.
Mannesmann fell back on a downgrade by James Capel, the shares finishing
DM4.30 lower at DM215.00. The London broker said that it had lowered its
forecast for 1992 and 1993 earnings because of the deterioration in European
capital goods investment and reduced demand for steel.
PARIS had another see-saw day, driven by arbitrageurs, and the CAC-40 index
ended 3.74 higher at 1,774.48 in slim turnover of FFr1.9bn. There was little
news around to give the market direction.
Among individual stocks, Paribas dropped FFr12.50 or 3.6 per cent to
FFr330.50 on news that it was lowering the sale price of Ciments Francais to
Italcementi to compensate for the recent disclosure of losses. Ciments
Francais dropped FFr29 or 9.1 per cent to FFr290 in very light volume on
news that it expects a loss for 1992.
Elsewhere, a stronger dollar helped Saint-Gobain to rise by FFr11 to FFr498
while Lafarge fell back FFr5.10 to FFr301 on profit-taking after its recent
rise. Peugeot dropped FFr14 to FFr523 and there was a report of stock on
offer in London.
MILAN ended mixed as the market shook off most of its early losses. The
Comit index eased 0.81 to 418.89 in turnover estimated at near Monday's
L197.1bn. Trading was disrupted early on by a breakdown in the telematico
screen trading system.
Shares in the state food group Sme were suspended by Consob pending an
announcement from the company regarding the recent market rumours that it
was about to be privatised.
News that Paribas and Italcementi had agreed that the Italian company would
pay FFr500m less than originally agreed for a controlling stake in Ciments
Francais sent shares in Italcementi and the holding company Italmobiliare
higher. Italmobiliare had been fixed down L620 at L33,530 but reached
L35,300 in after-hours trading. Italcementi rose L210 or 2.6 per cent to
L8,200. Pastorino issued a buy note on Italmobiliare yesterday, saying that
the value of its underlying assets were completely neglected by the market.
AMSTERDAM edged higher on a firmer dollar and the CBS Tendency index rose
0.3 to 104.8.
Fokker remained in focus in spite of a further delay in the announcement of
takeover terms with DASA. The shares closed 60 cents up at Fl 18.80.
Unilever advanced 90 cents to Fl 191.40 as the market anticipated good
results next week, while DSM lost another 70 cents to Fl 84.70 ahead of
tomorrow's third quarter figures.
ZURICH was slightly easier as the market consolidated in the absence of
fresh news. The SMI index lost 3.5 to 1,927.4 in light volume.
UBS bearers were the most active on the day rising SFr2 to SFr835 while
Volksbank shed some of the gains made on Monday with the cooperative shares
slipping SFr35 to SFr770.
BRUSSELS closed narrowly mixed, as the Bel-20 index eased 4.84 to 1,129.96.
Among the day's gainers were retailers with Delhaize up BFr20 to BFr1,640,
supported by the stronger dollar.
MADRID eased in low volume with the general index closing down 1.28 at
198.74. Among the banks, Popular lost Pta80 to Pta9,620 while Santander went
against the trend following its recent rise in interim earnings with a gain
of Pta70 to Pta4,095.
STOCKHOLM finished steady to higher in spite of firmer domestic interest
rates. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 1.9 to 724.8 in turnover of
SKr402m after SKr357m.
HELSINKI continued to rise as domestic interest rates eased further. The HEX
index rose 6.8 to 716.4 in turnover of FM41.6m.

FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Standards watchdog begins to bare its teeth
 -Recent rulings by the Financial Reporting Review Panel underline a change
in style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE NEW decisions in the last two weeks from the Financial Reporting
Review Panel, the UK's accounting standards watchdog, have each provided new
lessons in the way the body is beginning to operate.
Now entering its second year, the panel has issued 10 public statements on
companies' accounting policies, including two announced on Monday against
British Gas and SEP Industrial Holdings, a USM-quoted engineer.
All but the first four have taken place under the chairmanship of Mr Edwin
Glasgow, who was appointed in February.
Some already detect a change in style since he took charge.
The ruling against British Gas, and another concerning Trafalgar House
earlier this month, showed that the panel was not afraid to tackle large
companies nor topics which require substantial material change in financial
figures.
Demanding that British Gas present accounts for the nine months, after last
year changing its year-end to December 31 rather than for the preceding 12
months, will reduce pre-tax profits by nearly Pounds 1bn for 1991. Amending
Trafalgar House's 1991 accounts cut pre-tax profits by Pounds 83m and
reduced shareholders' funds by Pounds 20m.
Although it is a much smaller company, the ruling against SEP is also
significant. The panel agreed with the qualification in the accounts by
Bloomer Heaven, the auditors, that SEP's failure to depreciate some freehold
property breached SSAP 12, the standard on depreciation or the diminution of
assets.
The auditor said the company should have made a provision of Pounds 89,000
and taken an additional extraordinary profit of Pounds 158,000 from the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary to reflect depreciation.
More important than the specific details, the SEP ruling reaffirmed the
panel's belief that SSAP 12 should remain in force.
There was a danger earlier this year that the standard might be seen as no
longer credible or enforceable.
In the only public statement so far that does not suggest a breach of
accounting standards, the panel said in February that Forte had not
contravened SSAP 12, even though it did not depreciate its buildings.
The company did agree to provide more information in future accounts of its
depreciation policies.
The panel said the difference was that Forte had conducted valuations to
ensure that the value of its property had been maintained or increased, in
accordance with the requirements of SSAP 12. SEP had simply assumed that
expenditure on upkeep would more than compensate any deterioration of its
warehouses.
But the ruling against British Gas raises the possibility of a new
precedent. The panel said the company's action contravened the 1985
Companies Act but added that directors had not intended to mislead. That
could provide an excuse for other less scrupulous companies looking for
excuses.
Most companies have accepted the panel's rulings without too much resistance
 -although often after considerable grumbling and legal wrangling.
For example, Mr Paul Curson, group financial controller and an associate
director of SEP, believes his company's approach to depreciation was more
accurate.
'We were very pleased to be treated so lightly by the panel,' he said. 'I
support what the panel is doing, and the amounts concerned were not material
so we accepted (the ruling).'
Trafalgar House pushed the panel close to its ultimate sanction: the power
and money to take a company to court and force it to restate accounts.
Trafalgar was initially unwilling to co-operate, but ultimately backed down
and complied.
Nonetheless, the panel has so far limited its punishment well below this
level. Apart from negative publicity, no company has yet been forced to do
more than adjust its comparative figures in its next set of accounts - or in
one case publish amendments in a normal results circular.
Miscreants could be required to reprint and re-circulate to all shareholders
the set of accounts being criticised.
Even the panel's wording in its statements remains circumspect and
diplomatic, avoiding inflammatory words such as 'reprimand' or 'criticise'.
One concern being voiced is that the selection process of companies'
accounts for the panel's scrutiny is faulty. Most being examined have
visible signs of discrepancy with accounting standards: either a qualified
audit report or disclosures in the notes.
The more troubling practices may be more thoroughly concealed and escape
attention.
Others argue that the panel should extend its remit to consider other
corporate financial information such as interim accounts, takeover documents
and directors' reports.
A final criticism is the relatively slow speed of action by the panel, which
is staffed by part-time professionals.
Here at least it has been able to take steps for improvement. Last month it
appointing three new members: Mr Kit Farrow of Kleinwort Benson, Mr Roger
Looker of Rea Brothers and Mr Christopher Swinson, a chartered accountant.

FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Alliance Resources suspended pending
negotiations on board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIANCE RESOURCES, the Louisiana-based oil and gas company, was yesterday
suspended at 9 1/2 p pending the outcome of negotiations with Manx Petroleum
over the reinstatement of former Alliance chairman Mr John O'Brien.
The company is likely to announce the appointment of administrative
receivers if the negotiations fail.
The suspension comes just a day before a winding up order presented by
Alliance's former broker, Girozentrale Gilbert Eliott, was to have been
presented in court. The petition, which claims Alliance owes the broker
Pounds 38,346 in flotation fees, has been postponed for a week.
Mr O'Brien, who is also managing director and a substantial shareholder in
Manx Petroleum, was ousted from his position as chairman of the struggling
USM-quoted resources company just two weeks ago.
Manx, which is chaired by resources entrepreneur Mr Algy Cluff, claims that
in seeking to get rid of Mr O'Brien, Alliance defaulted on a management
agreement signed in May. As a result, Manx is demanding immediate repayment
of loans to Alliance totalling Dollars 770,000. Alliance is disputing the
amount claimed by Manx.
The management deal agreed in May, which resulted in Mr O'Brien becoming
chairman, set out terms for a Dollars 200,000 loan to the cash-starved
Alliance and management fees of Pounds 10,000 a month be paid to Manx.
The fees were to have been paid in arrears beginning in April 1993.
A letter sent to the Alliance board by Mr O'Brien before he became chairman
also set out conditions for his acceptance of the post, which included an
eventual all-paper bid by Alliance for the unlisted Manx Petroleum.
The compromise being negotiated last night is likely to result in the
reinstatement of Mr O'Brien. At least two of the three remaining board
members are expected to step down.

FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Jupiter Tyndall tops Pounds 3m after
acquisition push
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUPITER TYNDALL, the fund management and banking group, yesterday announced
pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.16m for the six months to June 30 1992.
The figures reflected the acquisition of Tyndall Holdings, announced in
August 1991.
Mr John Duffield, chairman of Jupiter Tyndall, said, therefore, that the
interim results published last year were not directly comparable.
Mr Duffield said that about 55 per cent of profits came from the investment
management division, where funds under management stayed constant at Pounds
950m.
Mr Leonard Licht, formerly of Mercury Asset Management, has joined the group
as head of the investment division.
He has been given a 'golden hello', believed to be about Pounds 1m, which
will be treated as an exceptional item in the year's accounts.
It is also proposed to grant Mr Licht a special option scheme, which will
need the approval of shareholders at an extraordinary meeting.
The board is planning to bring in three further option schemes; for domestic
employees; for overseas employees; and for executives.
Jupiter has spent much of the year in dispute with investment trusts in the
former Tyndall stable and has lost two management contracts.
However, earlier this week it won victory in its efforts to have three
representatives appointed to the board of one former Tyndall trust, CST
Emerging Asia.
The banking division was able to maintain deposits at Pounds 350m, despite
the loss of some funds following the sale of the Jersey Trust administration
business.
After tax of Pounds 575,000 and minority interests of Pounds 151,000,
earnings per share were 7.02p.
An interim dividend of 3p is declared.
In last year's interim results, pre-tax profits for the four months to
end-June were Pounds 455,000, earnings per share were 2.69p and the interim
dividend 2p.
Mr Duffield said 'The economic climate has, always, many uncertainties and,
in fund management, profits must always be sensitive to the respective
levels of the stock market.
'Subject to these matters, I am confident of the prospects of our group.'

FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: French prepare for les beaux oiseaux
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH will not know quite what has hit them but Bernard Matthews'
'bootiful bird' turkey advertisments - 'les beaux oiseaux ' perhaps - are
about to take France by storm.
Under siege at home from imports and consumers whose allegiance has switched
to cheaper chickens, the turkey king, is to lead an expeditionary force
across the Channel.
Early in the new year Bernard Matthews, the Norfolk-based poultry
manufacturer, is to launch a nationwide, multi-million pound TV campaign to
develop the prepared turkey meat market.
The company believes French taste for prepared turkey can be developed from
scratch into a market even bigger than in the UK.
The stakes are high. Ten years ago the UK market did not exist but is now
worth Pounds 150m of sales, according to Mr David Joll, managing director of
Bernard Matthews.
French turkey consumption is the highest in the EC but almost all of it is
in the form of whole birds.
The assault on the French market has only been made possible by passage into
law of the European Community's meat preparation directive allowing the
export of prepared meats. Bernard Matthews has, however, received additional
approvals from the French Ministry of Agriculture.
Mr Matthews will personally lead the marketing of the 7 products which are
to be introduced and exported from Norfolk and Suffolk through a
distribution network based in Normandy.
Bernard Matthews has promised supermarket groups like Carrefour and Leclerc
four nationwide TV campaigns in the first year backed up by promotions and
regional support.
The company has been researching the market for 18 months and said that the
French have the fastest growing per capita frozen convenience products
market in the EC.

FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Levercrest launches Pounds 1.3m rights
issue to fund fresh strategy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LEVERCREST, the playground equipment, street furniture and rubber safety
surfacing maker, is raising Pounds 1.3m net through a rights issue and will
execute a new strategy to pursue acquisitions in the engineering sector.
This will be achieved under a new chairman, Mr Ian Orrock.
Mr Orrock, assisting the board for the last three months as a consultant, is
now a director and will become chairman following an EGM on November 19.
The rights issue is on a 13-for-4 basis at 10p per share, and will be used
to reduce borrowings substantially, rationalise and improve manufacturing
processes, and strengthen sales and marketing functions.
The group will change its name to Roxspur and move from the USM to a full
listing.
In the 14 months to May 31, the group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds
755,000 (Pounds 364,000) from turnover of Pounds 5.46m (Pounds 5.52m).
Losses per share were 13.6p (5.9p).
Trading was difficult, there was a sizeable loss through the 'substantial'
theft of raw materials and finished goods, and exceptional charges of Pounds
54,000.
The current year began satisfactorily and there were indications that local
authority spending would be higher.

FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: STV chief takes up share options worth
Pounds 767,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GUS Macdonald, managing director of Scottish Television, has exercised
options to buy 179,600 STV shares at a total cost of Pounds 191,111. At last
night's close they were worth Pounds 766,892, giving him a paper profit of
Pounds 575,781.
He masterminded STV's coup last year in winning renewal of the franchise
with a bid to the Independent Television Commission of only Pounds 2,000.
However, the company said these share options were granted several years ago
and had no direct connection with the licensing round.
Mr Macdonald, 52, who started work as a fitter in a Clyde shipyard, joined
STV in 1986 from Granda Television, where he had worked on World in Action,
was head of current affairs and presented programmes such as Right to Reply
and What the Papers Say.
Last year's low bid was a financial coup for STV which was unopposed in the
tenders and therefore certain to retain its franchise. It made the company
one of the UK's most profitable broadcasters for its size.
STV spent nearly Pounds 4m on its campaign, the main plank of which was
forming and paying for alliances with the leading independent producers in
Scotland.
Any outsider, therefore, found it difficult to sign up the
programming-making talent necessary for a credible bid.

to Carclo Engineering
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GM Firth is selling almost all its stake in Arthur Lee to Carclo Engineering
Group. If accepted by Firth shareholders Carclo will hold 29.99 per cent of
Lee.
Carclo is paying 80p a share for a 10.52 per cent holding and has
conditionally agreed to buy a further 11.53 per cent at the same price. The
second deal is subject to approval but holders of 43.3 per cent of Firth
have indicated their intention to accept.
Firth has also reached agreement with its bankers for the provision of
continuing bank facilities subject to certain asset sales and the provision
of a Pounds 350,000 loan by Mr Michael Wilkinson, chairman and chief
executive of Firth, to Clarkes of Stillington, a Firth subsidiary.
The loan, which is secured on steel owned by Clarkes, also requires
approval.
The result will be a cash inflow to Firth of about Pounds 5.8m reducing bank
borrowings to Pounds 8.8m.

FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: GrandMet confirms Spanish talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAND METROPOLITAN, the UK-based food and drinks group, confirmed yesterday
that its drinks division is in talks with Gonzalez Byass of Spain.
Confirmation that International Distillers &amp; Vintners is in serious
discussions with the Spanish group follows speculation in the Spanish press
about a possible link.
GrandMet said the discussions could lead to international distribution
agreements and IDV taking a stake in the Spanish company.
Gonzalez Byass is one of the few remaining Spanish family controlled drinks
companies with international brands. It owns Soberano, the leading Spanish
brandy in the domestic market and Tio Pepe, the fino sherry.
It is understood to be interested in developing links with a larger partner
in order to facilitate international marketing of its brands.
GrandMet for its part is interested in expanding its stable of brands.

FT  28 OCT 92 / Himalayan obstacle to Indo-Pakistani ties: Kashmir remains
the main issue preventing good relations between two neighbours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST WEEKEND, Kashmiri separatists again attempted to storm the border
between India and Pakistan, the third such effort this year. The march,
initiated by political parties in Pakistan-held Kashmir, was aborted when
Pakistani troops opened fire on the marchers, reportedly injuring 28, and
arrested their leader, Mr Amanullah Khan.
Despite its failure, however, the attempt has caused a further setback to
relations between the two countries, which had appeared to be improving
after talks in August.
India accuses Pakistan of not doing enough to defuse tension on the border,
though Pakistan claims it could do no more to deter marchers.
Both sides do agree that neither could allow Kashmiris to violate the Line
of Actual Control, one of the world's most heavily guarded borders. India's
defence minister, Mr Sharad Pawar, stated categorically that India would
repulse any violation of its borders. Pakistan said before the march that
'Pakistan shared the sentiments of the people who desire to cross', but at
the same time was 'aware of its responsibilities'.
Kashmir has been the dominant issue preventing good relations between the
two neighbours since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947. They have
fought two wars over it, and the situation remains very tense.
Both sides face domestic pressures to hold on to their respective parts of
the troubled Himalayan territory. Neither Delhi nor Islamabad is
particularly concerned about apparently growing desire among disillusioned
Kashmiris for an independent state.
India regards the 1972 Simla Agreement (an instrument of peace signed by the
two after Pakistan lost a war on the Bangladesh issue in 1971) as the basis
for further bilateral negotiations. Pakistan insists on interpreting the
instrument of peace in the light of a United Nations resolution of 1948,
providing for an internationally supervised plebiscite, through which
Kashmiris could choose between India and Pakistan  - there is no third
option.
In August, talks at the level of foreign secretary  - top civil servant  -
generated more optimism than any such exercise in the past. Yet the mutual
suspicion built up over four decades has subsequently clouded the
improvement in relations, raising doubts about whether any real progress
could be made. The most significant outcome of the August talks was
agreement to discuss the Kashmir issue, under the Simla Agreement, breaking
a 26-year deadlock.
The initiative came from Pakistan, but both sides privately admitted they
were responding to increasing international pressure, especially from the
United States, which traditionally supported Pakistan in the cold war era
but now has improving relations with New Delhi.
India, which has 400,000 troops in Kashmir to control the insurgency there,
contends that Kashmir is a 'domestic dispute'. It demands that Pakistan
stops supporting terrorism in the Kashmir valley, and India's northern state
of Punjab. India also wants Pakistan to desist from internationalising the
issue  - there has been tremendous global pressure on India to improve its
human rights record in Kashmir.
Mr Shaharyar Khan, Pakistani foreign secretary, on a recent visit to New
Delhi, denied any 'government-sponsored support' from Pakistan. 'Terrorism
is a problem we have to tackle jointly,' he said.
In an atmosphere of deep mutual recrimination, Kashmir has virtually crowded
out other bilateral issues.
However, there has been progress even since June this year, when an Indian
diplomat was abducted, beaten and expelled from Pakistan and India responded
by expelling two Pakistani diplomats.
The two countries have signed a code of conduct on the treatment of
diplomatic personnel between the two countries. They have also agreed on a
range of military confidence-building measures.
Both India and Pakistan would benefit greatly from a further improvement in
relations.
Economic reform programmes initiated by both countries require a stable
political climate, and cuts in defence expenditure would help increase the
slow pace of economic growth. Trade between the two neighbours, which is
virtually non-existent, would also augment both economies.

FT  28 OCT 92 / UN's Somalia envoy offers to quit in row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Mohammad Sahnoun, the United Nations special envoy for Somalia, has
offered to resign after being reprimanded by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the
secretary-general.
Mr Sahnoun has been sharply critical of the UN's handling of the breakdown
of law and order in Somalia and the subsequent famine, which is claiming an
estimated 1,000 lives a day.
A highly regarded Algerian former ambassador to Washington and Paris, Mr
Sahnoun enjoys the confidence of the Security Council, key members of which
hoped to find a compromise satisfactory to the two men. He was under strong
pressure last night from member states to carry on with his duties in a
country that has posed multiple problems for the UN. Commenting on the
resignation offer, Mr Jean-Bernard Merimee of France, current president of
the Security Council, said it would be hard to find a UN official for
Somalia who would be so effective. American diplomats said they hoped Mr
Sahnoun could be persuaded to stay on.
In television interviews and other statements during a visit to New York
last week Mr Sahnoun faulted the UN for sitting on its hands for months
after the downfall of Mr Siad Barre, the former Somali leader, in January
1991. He went so far as to call for an international investigation of the
tardy response and mishandling of the situation. Mr Sahnoun recently
accompanied Irish President Mary Robinson on a tour of Somalia and the
Kenyan border. Afterwards, she joined the critics, particularly faulting the
UN refugee agency for failing to provide even basic facilities in camps in
northern Kenya.
The secretary-general's break with Mr Sahnoun, who has returned to
Mogadishu, apparently reflects bitter feelings in international relief
agencies, which strongly resented the envoy's criticisms.
Ironically, Mr Boutros Ghali has also been strongly critical of the Security
Council's role in the Somali crisis. Earlier this year he said its actions
were too little and too late.
It is the secretary-general's first serious staff dispute since he took
office in January.

FT  28 OCT 92 / US officials 'destroyed Iraq papers': Congressman claims
loan guarantee documents shredded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIALS of the Bush administration were accused yesterday of having spent
the past weekend shredding documents pertaining to US government loan
guarantees for Iraq.
Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House banking committee, who has been
investigating US aid to Iraq, said in a press conference yesterday he was
informed of the alleged shredding in a telephone call from 'a senior career
employee' at the Department of Agriculture.
Mr Gonzalez and other senior members of Congress yesterday also accused
President George Bush of helping to arm Iraq before its August 1990 invasion
of Kuwait and then trying to cover up US government involvement.
In a letter to Mr Edward Madigan, secretary of agriculture, Mr Gonzalez said
he was told the alleged shredding encompassed all memos and records of
telephone calls that would link government officials to decisions made about
the extension of loans to Iraq that were backed by guarantees from the
Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), the export guarantee arm of the
Agriculture Department. Mr Gonzalez urged Mr Madigan to investigate the
allegations.
The Texan Democrat, who has been spearheading congressional investigations
of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) scandal, said he was also concerned
that some of the CCC documents supposedly shredded might have related to
BNL. Nearly Dollars 1bn of the more than Dollars 5bn of unauthorised Iraqi
loans made by BNL's Atlanta branch were backed by US government guarantees
provided by the CCC.
Mr Gonzalez's claim was supported by aides to Senator Patrick Leahy, who
chairs the Senate agriculture committee. The aides said they had received
calls about the alleged shredding last Friday and one Senate staffer who
went to the Agriculture Department found all of the shredding machines being
brought to one room.
Senator Leahy wrote to the Agriculture Department yesterday asking that all
Iraq-related documents be secured. The senator said yesterday the CCC loan
guarantees for Iraq helped President Saddam Hussein to acquire nuclear
technology and weapons of mass destruction rather than food.
Mr Gonzalez charged yesterday it was 'quite clear that from day one it has
been the policy of the highest levels of the Bush administration to mislead
the Congress and, more importantly, the public into thinking that our
government played no role in arming Iraq.'

THE EC may consider retaliatory action against US attempts to reinforce its
trade embargo on Cuba. President Bush approved the Cuban Democracy Act last
weekend. The EC had warned the act might break international trade law. A
Brussels spokesman said: 'Mr Frans Andriessen (trade commissioner) regrets
Mr Bush's decision.'
EC officials were examining the legislation to see if retaliatory action was
necessary, possibly under Gatt or OECD rules. The Commission is concerned
the act would force US and Cuban trading partners to comply with US
prohibitions on trade, even if they lie outside US jurisdiction.

CZECHOSLOVAKIAN Airlines has completed the second and final stage in a
Dollars 141m debt offering to pay for five Boeing 737 aircraft.
The Dollars 113m, 12-year issue was set at a fixed rate of 7.02 per cent and
is backed by the Export-Import Bank of the US.
It is the first time aircraft acquisitions have been financed through a
fixed rate Exim-backed public offering, according to Citicorp, which co-led
the issue with Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale New York.
Citicorp was also co-underwriter with JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch. It
expects the debt to be rated AAA by Moody's and Standard and Poor's, the
credit rating agencies.
CSA, the Prague airline in which Air France and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development bought a 40 per cent stake earlier this year,
took delivery of the five Boeings in July. The aircraft are now in service
on European and Middle Eastern routes.

form joint brokerage firm
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEAN Witter Financial Services, the securities brokerage arm of retailing
group Sears, Roebuck, plans to form a jointly-owned brokerage firm with
NationsBank, the fourth-largest commercial bank in the US, that will sell
mutual funds and other investment products to bank customers.
The new company, Nations Securities, will begin operations early next year
with 400 investment professionals located in NationsBank's branches in nine
US states. The company also intends to market products and services to other
US commercial banks.
Although still subject to regulatory approval, the agreement is the latest
example of how the once-strict divide between the commercial banking and
securities businesses, enshrined in the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, is being
dismantled.
Several big banks, including JP Morgan and Bankers Trust, are already major
players in the securities underwriting business, and only last week the
Federal Reserve gave Republic Bank of New York approval to open a securities
brokerage.
The joint venture is also an attempt by companies from two increasingly
inter-connected industries to exploit their respective strengths.
Dean Witter will provide the brokerage expertise and distribution channels
of a big Wall Street firm, while NationsBank will provide wide customer
reach through its branches, as well as the financial muscle of a major bank.
Other banks are likely to follow in NationsBank's footsteps. The sharp fall
over the past two years in the interest-rate earned on bank savings
products, such as certificates of deposit, persuaded many bank customers to
look elsewhere for higher returns on their money.
By offering customers in-house access to a wide range of higher-yielding
investments, NationsBank and other banks hope to stem the outflow of
deposits caused by the sharp fall in the returns earned by bank savings
products.

   TORONTO, SEATTLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL TRUST, the Canadian financial services group controlled by Toronto's
Bronfman family, has retreated with a bloodied nose from the US by selling
its Seattle-based network of former savings and loan institutions.
Washington Mutual Savings Bank of Seattle will pay Royal Trust USDollars
663m for Pacific First Financial, which operates 134 branches in three
western US states and has assets totalling Dollars 6.5bn.
However, the Canadian company will take over Dollars 600m to Dollars 700m of
Pacific First's real estate loan portfolio as well as investments in markets
where Washington Mutual has no presence.
About one-third of the loans are non-performing and are expected to be
liquidated over the next four years.
Royal Trust has agreed to buy up to Dollars 150m of preferred shares in
Washington Mutual as part of the capital which the US group plans to raise
to finance the purchase of Pacific First.
Royal said it would take writedowns totalling CDollars 75m (Dollars 60.4m)
as a result of the sale. This includes CDollars 55m for goodwill and
CDollars 20m in loan loss provisions. Royal's total investment in Pacific
First was USDollars 691m.
Royal Trust bought a string of savings and loan companies in 1989 and 1990
and later stitched them together into Pacific First as part of an ambitious
international expansion. While Royal Trust has a strong presence in Canada,
its experience outside the country has largely been an unhappy one.
Besides selling Pacific First, it has spun off or closed most of the
businesses it acquired in its 1986 purchase of Dow Chemical's financial
services business.
Mr Michael Cornelissen, Royal Trust's chief executive who spearheaded the
thrust into foreign markets, recently announced that he was leaving his job.
Mr Kerry Killinger, Washington Mutual chairman and chief executive, said the
bank expected the deal to lift earnings and lower its non-performing assets
ratio, Reuter adds from Seattle.
'We've indicated in our schedules that the asset quality that we're bringing
across should be excellent,' Mr Killinger said. The size of Pacific First's
possible problem loans had been considered a potential obstacle to sale of
the bank.

FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: SC Johnson to acquire Drackett
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRISTOL-MYERS Squibb, the world's third-biggest pharmaceuticals company, is
selling its Drackett household product business for Dollars 1.15bn in cash
to SC Johnson &amp; Son, a privately-held consumer products company.
Bristol-Myers announced in July it intended to sell Drackett in a move to
sharpen its competitive edge in the drugs industry.
Drackett contributed about Dollars 600m to Bristol-Myers's Dollars 11.2bn
1991 sales. Analysts had expected the business to fetch about Dollars 1bn to
Dollars 1.25bn.
On Wall Street, shares in Bristol-Myers rose Dollars  1/2 to close at
Dollars 66 5/8 but disappointment with its performance this year has driven
the company's share price down from a 52-week high of Dollars 90 1/8 .
Bristol-Myers's place in the changing pharmaceuticals market is unclear. The
company reported profits growth of only 5 per cent in the first nine months
of this year, against Merck's 17 per cent improvement in the same period.
The disposal of Drackett is an important step as the company increases its
focus on health care.
Mr Viren Mehta, partner at Mehta and Isaly in New York, said: 'Drugs
companies need to be able to maintain a high-risk high-profit
pharmaceuticals business. The Drackett sale will free up the management
resources to concentrate on pharmaceuticals.'
Drackett's products, including Windex and Drano, have a strong presence in
the consumer products market, but sales for the business have been flat to
lower this year, and its marketing costs are high.
The Drackett sale leaves Clairol as Bristol-Myers's largest
non-pharmaceuticals business. Mr Mehta expects the company eventually to
divest Clairol, 'but Bristol-Myers management comes from Clairol and there's
probably a sentimental attachment to it.'
Bristol-Myers expects to record a substantial special gain once the sale of
Drackett is completed.
The Drackett acquisition will strengthen SC Johnson's position in the
home-care industry. The company has annual sales of about Dollars 3.3bn. Its
products include Pledge, Shout and Raid. SC Johnson plans to divest
Drackett's consumer furniture care and air freshener brands, which are
product lines where it already has a strong market presence.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US ratings agency, yesterday cut its ratings on SC
Johnson's commercial paper and senior debentures to reflect the additional
debt to cover the purchase.

FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: Stockholm SE unveils
privatisation plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCKHOLM Stock Exchange yesterday broke new ground when it announced
plans to privatise and operate on a fully commercial basis from the start of
next year.
Mr Bengt Ryden, the exchange's president, said: 'It is probably a unique
international event to have a stock exchange publishing a prospectus for its
own privatisation.'
The move was first signalled by the Swedish government earlier this year and
is part of a wider shake-up which will remove the bourse's monopoly over
share trading from January 1 1993.
Mr Ryden said the exchange's new status would improve efficiency and ensure
it was well placed to respond to competition.
A new share issue will form part of the conversion process, raising SKr30m
(Dollars 5m) through the issue of 250,000 shares at SKr120 each.
The 350 companies and other organisations associated with the exchange are
being given the opportunity to become its new owners, with allocations being
carried out on the basis of the sum of exchange fees paid since 1988.
This will result in the largest owners being the leading banks - SE Banken,
Nordbanken and Handelsbanken - Volvo and the Swedish National Debt Office,
with a combined holding of more than 30 per cent.
Next year there will be some restrictions on trading in the new shares, but
from 1994 they will be freely tradeable.
Like many of the companies it lists, the performance of the bourse will from
now on be measured in terms of ratios and rates of return.
To help eligible investors make up their minds, it indicated that pro-forma
profits for 1992 would amount to SKr10m. The price/earnings ratio is 4.2 and
the equity/assets target is 40 per cent. There will be no dividend this
year.
It also warned that 'during the next few years, considerable investments in
information technology are anticipated.' The first hint of a rights issue?
Procordia, the Swedish pharmaceutical and food conglomerate, is bidding for
the minority shares in Pierrel, the Italian pharmaceutical group.
Procordia, which already owns 72 per cent of Pierrel, is offering just over
SKr100m (Dollars 17m) for the rest of the company. This equates to L2,150
for each voting share and L1,150 for each non-voting share.
Earlier this year, Procordia paid SKr500m, or L2,650 per voting share, to
buy its current stake from Fermenta, the Swedish industrial group.
Pierrel's voting shares were trading at around L1,600 and its non-voting
shares at around L600 when they were suspended, pending yesterday's
announcement, on the Milan and Turin stock exchanges last week.
The formal tender for the shares will take place between November 4 and 11.

HERSHEY Foods, of the US, has withdrawn its bid to acquire Freia Marabou and
will sell its 18.6 per cent interest in the the Norwegian chocolate and
confectionery group to Kraft General Foods, a subsidiary of Philip Morris,
AP-DJ reports from New York.
The decision follows the recent announcement that Kraft had won control of
more than 75 per cent of the Norwegian group's capital in response to its
Dollars 1.5bn takeover offer.
The Kraft offer is conditional upon government approval, which is not
expected for several months.
If concluded, the transaction would result in Hershey receiving an after-tax
gain of about Dollars 40m at current exchange rates.

Metra, the Finnish diversified industrial company, is looking for foreign
investors to subscribe for its planned loan of a maximum amount of FM700m
(Dollars 144m), Reuter reports from Helsinki.
The board is to ask an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on November 5 for
the right to issue the loan, said Mr Klaus Gronbarj, executive
vice-president. The issue would be considered as equity, he said.
*****
Lafarge-Coppee, the French cement and building materials group, holds 91 per
cent of the votes and 85 per cent of capital in Swiss Cementia after its bid
for the minority shareholdings, Reuter reports from Zurich.
Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), managing the swap offer for Lafarge, said
that the offer had been extended beyond its scheduled October 28 expiry,
until November 11. Lafarge held 53 per cent of Cementia's capital and 73 per
cent of votes before the bid.

FT  28 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Paribas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Paribas has certainly got its come-uppance. Yesterday's embarrassing offer
to Italcementi and Mediobanca means the French bank has to hand back FFr500m
of the FFr6bn it received for a controlling stake in Ciments Francais, as
well as subsidising the French cement company's treasury operations. Less
financial engineering and more attention to basics like due diligence is the
obvious lesson.
The proposed settlement clearly leaves a hole in Paribas' earnings, which in
the absence of significant operating profits were always expected to be
reliant on capital gains this year. While there may be other deals in the
pipeline to fill the gap, the market would still be unwise to expect more
than FFr1.5bn.
Such disappointments may already be in the price, but the wider issue is the
damage which the episode could do to Paribas' relations with international
investors. It may be another sign that the portfolio strategy works well in
a bull market, but that it is much harder to carry off with conviction in
current market conditions.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM led by the Babcock International engineering group is offering
to underwrite a Pounds 267m project to complete work on new submarine docks
at Rosyth in Scotland, in an effort to save the dockyard.
The guarantee by Babcock, Wimpey Construction and NNC, a subsidiary of
General Electric Company of the UK, means that they would carry
responsibility for any cost overruns.
Babcock International has a 65 per cent interest, alongside Thorn EMI, in
the company which has been operating the state-owned Rosyth Royal Dockyard
since 1987.
It is fighting to prevent its work on nuclear-powered submarines being moved
to the Devonport yard at Plymouth. Rosyth managers have said that if that
happened the yard, which employs 4,000 people, would face closure.
Up to now Rosyth has carried out all refitting and refuelling of Britain's
Polaris ballistic-missile submarines. Work on other nuclear-powered
submarines has been split between the yards.
Construction of the new facility at Rosyth began five years ago in order to
provide a dock big enough for the Trident submarines which will replace the
Polaris boats. The Pounds 267m would be in addition to more than Pounds 120m
already spent on the project.
DML, Devonport's operator, is bidding to take over all the submarine work
with a rival project that it says could be completed for Pounds 170m.
Babcock, however, claims that the Devonport project, based on adapting
70-year-old docks to meet nuclear safety requirements, could prove much more
expensive than planned.

<TEXT>
FIFA, world soccer's governing body, and the Italian organisers of the 1990
World Cup broke EC competition rules by giving one tour operator the right
to sell World Cup package tours.
The European Commission yesterday showed Fifa and the Italian authorities
the yellow card for encouraging a monopoly in the sale of tours, but decided
not to fine them since it was the first time Brussels had formally condemned
a sporting event's ticket sales system.
However, Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, pledged to crack
down on any future infringements of Community competition law by organisers
of sporting events.
Earlier this year, the Commission persuaded the Olympic committee to change
its ticket distribution policy, allowing sought-after tickets for the
Barcelona Olympics to move freely across EC frontiers.
In the case of the World Cup, the Commission said it had been concerned only
about the monopoly over package tours. It said restrictions on general
ticket sales had been justified for security reasons.
But other tour operators had satisfied the Commission that they could easily
have offered competing package tours to the World Cup, without undermining
safety. Fifa and the Italian authorities accepted this during the
Commission's investigation.

TANDEM Computers of the US made a strong comeback in its fourth quarter
after restructuring earlier in the year. The manufacturer of fault-tolerant
computer systems reported record fourth-quarter and full-year revenues.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 27.2m, or 25 cents a share, on the
high side of Wall Street expectations, in spite of an Dollars 8m pre-tax
restructuring charge. Last year it reported net earnings of Dollars 2.9m, or
3 cents, for the quarter. On Wall Street, the stock price closed Dollars 2
higher at Dollars 13.
Fourth-quarter revenues were Dollars 576.3m, up 13 per cent from Dollars
509.1m in the same period last year.
In the first quarter of fiscal 1992, Tandem took a Dollars 98m pre-tax
restructuring charge for job cuts and consolidation of operations. This
resulted in a net loss for the year of Dollars 41.2m, or 38 cents a share
when a fourth-quarter charge of Dollars 8m is included.
In 1991, the company earned Dollars 35.2m, or 33 cents. Revenues for the
year rose 6 per cent to Dollars 2.04bn from Dollars 1.92bn in 1991.
Revenues increased in all geographic regions, Tandem said, with
international sales lifted by 'an outstanding quarter and year in Canada'.
Although European results were mixed by country, total revenues reached
record levels.
'We remain cautious about the future,' said Mr James Treybig, president and
chief executive.

FT  27 OCT 92 / BNF denies link in cancer test cases
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Nuclear Fuels was accused in a civil lawsuit yesterday of causing or
contributing to the cancer that affected two children whose fathers worked
at the Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria.
The High Court test case, on which up to 40 other claims may depend,
includes allegations that nuclear radiation damaged the fathers' sperm or
the mothers' eggs and resulted in genetic injury. BNF is contesting the
hearing, which is expected to last between six months and a year.
In the first case, Mrs Elizabeth Reay of Hensingham, Cumbria, is claiming
damages over the death of her daughter Dorothy of leukaemia in 1962, aged 10
months. Subject to a final ruling on liability, her damages have been agreed
at Pounds 150,000. That includes compensation for loss of her daughter and
for anguish suffered by her and her husband George, who died of cancer in
the 1980s.
The second claimant is Miss Vivien Hope, 27, who was successfully treated
for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma - re-lated to leukaemia - but was left partly
disabled and infertile. Personal injury damages have been agreed at Pounds
125,000.
BNF denies any link between the levels of radioactivity at Sellafield -
formerly Windscale - and the incidences of childhood leukaemia.

TWO four-storey buildings collapsed into the streets of central Cairo
yesterday, witnesses said, Reuter reports from Cairo.
It was not immediately clear how many people were hurt. Scores of young men
struggled to move the rubble with their hands, the witnesses added.
Women wailed and screamed at the site as ambulances and rescue teams fought
their way through heaps of rubble and choking dust to evacuate casualties.
Witnesses said an old building had collapsed into a new one and they both
fell onto the streets.
'At least one badly injured person was taken away on a stretcher,' a Reuter
reporter said from the scene.
It was impossible to determine whether the buildings collapsed because of
the earthquake which hit Egypt on October 12, killing 552 people and
injuring some 10,000.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Washington link to Iraq Super Gun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush administration granted an export licence in 1989 that enabled Space
Research Corp, the Belgian military research company controlled by the late
Dr Gerald Bull, to send sophisticated US technology to Iraq's Super Gun
project, according to US government documents.
The documents, obtained by the Financial Times, include a 1989 Commerce
Department licence for the export of a supercomputer and other
high-technology items used to design the projectile to be shot from the
Super Gun. The gun was a 1,000mm cannon constructed to shoot projectiles
over long distances.
Dr Bull, the Canadian rocket scientist who worked for Iraq's President
Saddam Hussein on the gun, was murdered in Brussels in 1990. There was
speculation he had been assassinated because of his work on Iraqi arms
projects.
The US documents will be detailed in Senate testimony this morning by Mr
Henry Gonzalez, the House banking committee chairman who has spearheaded
congressional investigations of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) Iraqi
loans scandal. Mr Gonzalez has previously confirmed that Dr Bull's company
was financed by BNL's Atlanta branch.
The latest revelations appear to conflict with other public and private
statements from the Bush administration:
In April 1990, for example, a cable sent to US embassies by Mr James Baker,
then secretary of state, said the administration had learned of Space
Research Corp's involvement in Iraqi missile programmes. The cable, also
obtained yesterday, urged the governments of Britain, France and others to
clamp down on exports from Dr Bull's company to Iraq.
In February 1991, according to another new document, State Department
officials were advised to say they had not approved 'any exports of
equipment or technology by Bull or companies associated with Bull to Iraq'.
The 1989 export licence clearly stated Dr Bull's US exports would be shipped
from Baltimore to Brussels and then on to Iraq.
The documents, along with statements made by Dr David Kay, former inspector
of Iraq's weapons projects, also directly contradict the assertion made by
President George Bush during a debate last week that no US technology went
to Iraq's weapons programmes.
In Washington yesterday the Justice Department said it had named Mr J.
William Roberts, a federal prosecutor from Illinois who was appointed to a
senior job during the Reagan administration, to head a new BNL task-force
investigation.
He is to help follow up leads relating to possible criminal conduct of
officials of BNL's Rome headquarters, and allegations of wrongdoing by Bush
administration officials.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S package of constitutional reforms appeared early today to be
heading for a decisive defeat in several key provinces as votes in
yesterday's referendum were counted.
Soon after polls closed it was projected that a clear majority of voters in
Quebec had rejected the agreement, aimed mainly at defusing the
French-speaking province's moves to break away from the confederation.
The Yes forces also appeared to be facing an unexpected defeat in the
central province of Ontario, which is home to about a third of Canada's
population and which was assumed to be solidly in favour of the so-called
Charlottetown Accord. The No side led by 52 per cent to 48 per cent in the
province about an hour after polls closed.
The referendum is not binding, but defeat in either Quebec or Ontario would
be the death knell for the accord, which was signed in August by the leaders
of all 10 provinces and is supported by Canada's three leading political
parties.
Mr Frank McKenna, premier of the eastern province of New Brunswick, said the
reform package had been 'mortally wounded' by the Quebec result.
Opponents of the agreement were critical of a provision which guaranteed
Quebec 25 per cent of the seats in the House of Commons, in perpetuity. The
campaign in Quebec against the agreement was led by separatists arguing it
failed to meet the province's demands for wider powers.
The agreement also provided for greater representation for western and
Atlantic provinces and the transfer of some powers from the federal
government to the provinces.
Supporters of the agreement had predicted that a rejection would lead to
years of economic and political uncertainty and, possibly, the eventual
break-up of the country.

BBA, the component maker for automotive, aviation and industrial markets,

The offer comprises ADollars 42m cash and the issue of 18m new shares in

BBA is hoping that the offer will be accepted in respect of 70.5 per cent or
more of the shares which would reduce its 57 per cent stake in Pacific BBA

The UK-based group no longer wants to assume the total debt of companies in
which its Australian subsidiary has a 51 per cent stake.
Mr Peter Clappison, finance director, said: 'We are planning to reduce our
controlling stake in Pacific BBA to allow it to grow without hindering our
balance sheet.'
Siddons Ramset, which has debt of about Pounds 12m, made pre-tax profits of
ADollars 4.3m in the year to June 30.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (13): Growth continues despite conflict
 -Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO have one civil war may be considered unfortunate, but to have two is
inexcusable. This seemed to be the view of international tourists who,
having tentatively placed Sri Lanka on the map during the 1970s, promptly
removed it as the island gained a reputation for bloody civil strife.
Tourist arrivals had grown rapidly in the 1970s to a peak of 407,000 in
1982. Annual growth was running at an average 24 per cent from 1976-1982.
The outbreak in 1983 of government hostilities with the Tamil Tigers quashed
hopes of further expansion. Arrivals dropped dramatically, even more so when
violence - previously confined largely to the north and east - erupted in
the south with the attempted insurrection of the People's Liberation Front
(JVP).
By 1987, the number of visitors had dropped to a mere 180,000, a level from
which it failed to recover in 1988 and 1989. Discounting was so fierce that
a night in a five-star hotel was being offered for as little as Dollars 7.
Few would have predicted the impressive upturn witnessed since then. Boosted
by the virtual annihilation of the JVP in the south and by the temporary
halt of fighting with the Tigers, the number of visitors began to grow,
reaching 317,000 in 1991. This marked an increase of 6.7 per cent over the
previous year, bucking the world trend in tourism which was hit hard by
recession and the Gulf war.
Growth continued in spite of the renewed outbreak in June 1990 of fighting
in the north and east - out of bounds to tourists - as Sri Lankan
authorities gradually persuaded the international industry that most of the
island remained safe.
In terms of foreign exchange earnings, growth has been even more
satisfactory with receipts of Dollars 155.6m in 1991; some 17.4 per cent
over 1990.
That trend seems likely to continue and even accelerate. Arrivals in the
first eight months of this year are 27.7 per cent up on the same period in
1991, according to figures from the Ceylon Tourist Board. The board
estimates that total arrivals for 1992 will be at least 380,000.
The government, says Mr N. U. Yasapala, director-general of the tourist
board, is keen to promote the sector both for its foreign exchange earnings
and for its ability to provide employment. According to the central bank,
tourism in 1991 accounted for 64,800 jobs - 27,000 directly and 37,800 in
ancillary sectors.
Keen to capitalise on such benefits, the government has commissioned a
10-year tourist 'masterplan' drawn up with the help of Horwath Consulting of
the UK. The plan, a draft of which is due to be published in November, sets
a target of 874,000 air arrivals by the year 2001 - more than double the
1982 peak.
Mr Martin Gerty, director of Horwath Consulting, says the plan calls for the
upgrading of existing hotels, the development of more up-market resorts, and
the improvement of facilities around cultural sites which need to be more
'visitor friendly'. Mr Gerty says such infrastructure was severely run down
in the 1980s, but he thinks it remarkable that it was maintained at all.
There may also be the need for additional airport facilities to those at
Colombo's international airport because aircraft unable to land during bad
weather are presently redirected to Madras in southern India. One
possibility is development of the military airfield at Hingurakgoda on the
east of the island, particularly if ethnic tensions subside.
Such ambitious plans for tourism, especially at a time of budgetary
constraints, will require substantial private sector investment. The
government has accordingly extended tax incentives already enjoyed by
export-driven companies to investors in tourist infrastructure.
Some local observers feel such incentives have been too generous, allowing
already profitable concerns to avoid tax. Mr S. T. Fernando, deputy governor
of the central bank, counters that new investment must be encouraged
following the collapse of tourism in the mid-1980s.
Some 25 projects are being considered, worth an estimated total of Dollars
120m. These would add 2,350 graded rooms to the island's stock which now
stands at 9,680 - 18,950 beds.
Obstacles to growth remain. Most immediate is increasing anxiety among
certain groups that an expanded tourist sector would have a negative
cultural and environmental impact. There is concern that more tourists would
encourage drugs and prostitution - there are already an estimated 800 people
infected with the HIV virus - and that hotels will monopolise resources such
as land, power and water.
The government was recently forced to abandon plans for a showcase Dollars
40m holiday complex at Chilaw on the west coast because of protests by the
Roman Catholic Church. The Buddhist clergy, an extremely powerful political
force, is threatening the future of other schemes.
Mr Gerty feels that such protests can be dissipated by outlining some of the
sector's potential benefits, such as employment. Tourism will, he says, have
limited environmental impact as resorts will not be permitted to sprout up
piecemeal but will be strictly controlled according to a planned development
strategy.
Another obstacle to growth may be Sri Lanka's over-reliance on certain key
markets. Western Europe makes up more than 60 per cent of total tourist
traffic, with Germany, France, the UK and Italy representing nearly 80 per
cent of that share. North America provides a paltry 3 per cent of arrivals.
Fashions change quickly and the 'discovery' of a new long-haul destination
could jeopardise Colombo's plans.
The most serious question mark, however, remains Sri Lanka's international
reputation. Despite recent evidence that Colombo is winning the public
relations battle in reassuring the public of the island's safety,
international confidence remains fragile. If, on the other hand, the civil
war ends, prospects for growth would be excellent and the potential for
achieving a million visitors annually would become realistic.
Assuming, however, that civil strife staggers on, it would only take a few
well-publicised incidents of violence or a period of political instability
for the country's tarnished image to resurface. That would effectively end
the growth of the past few years and Sri Lanka would return to the
backwaters of the tourist industry.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (14): Networks need to be expanded -
Infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF Sri Lanka is to maintain the impressive levels of growth achieved over
the past few years, it will have to expand its communications and power
networks.
As things stand, roads, telecommunications and power supply are, at best,
adequate. They will rapidly become overburdened if the economy continues to
grow at current rates.
The government, says Mr Akiel Mohamed, power and energy secretary, is well
aware of the need to develop the nation's infrastructure. It is, for
example, keen to expand electricity supply and diversify from hydro-power,
which can be erratic.
Of Sri Lanka's 1,250MW installed capacity, about 1,000MW is hydro-power.
Severe drought earlier this year drastically cut supplies, forcing the
government to impose a 25 per cent surcharge on electricity. Some
manufacturers were forced to cut production.
'Hydro-power cannot meet the demands of foreign industry, so it is exactly
with that in mind that we are pushing for the expansion of thermal
generation,' says Mr Mohamed.
Central to Colombo's plans is a proposed 300MW coal-powered station in
Trincomalee, a deep-water port in the strife-torn eastern province. A
feasibility study was prepared in the 1980s and five consortia have recently
been shortlisted. The government hopes the power station will be operational
by 1996.
The consortium, due to be chosen at the start of 1993, will be expected to
build the Dollars 450m power station on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) or a
build-own-operate (BOO) basis. It would sell electricity to the national
grid - for a fixed period under the BOT arrangement and indefinitely under
BOO.
'We hope in future to have all our thermal generation funded by the private
sector,' says Mr Mohamed. He admits it might be more difficult to persuade
private companies to fund hydro-power which requires huge initial
investment.
Mr Mohamed says he is not concerned about terrorist attacks on the planned
power station in Trincomalee, a city often targeted by the Tigers. But he
concedes that terrorists could attack the supply line which will feed
electricity from the station into the national grid.
This presents a serious disincentive to foreign companies to invest, but
donors are believed to have expressed willingness to fund an insurance
policy that would cover sabotage.
The government's decision to build infrastructure in the east is part of its
'hearts and minds' policy to win support through economic development. Plans
are also being considered to build a second international airport in the
region, at Hingurakgoda.
The overall aim in the power sector is to build up installed capacity to
2,200MW by the year 2000, a level that would easily meet the expected annual
7 per cent growth in demand. Contingency plans could accommodate increased
electricity requirements of up to 14 per cent a year, says Mr Mohamed.
The government, although keen to shift the emphasis to thermal generation,
hopes to build several mini-hydro schemes of up to 5MW to service
agricultural estates. Initial outlays would not be excessive and the private
sector could become involved. There are no immediate plans to privatise the
national grid.
There are also ambitious proposals to upgrade and expand other areas of
infrastructure, not least in the field of telecommunications which is
undergoing rapid change.
Over the past few years the existing network has been overhauled and 70 per
cent of the exchange capacity connected to an integrated digital system. The
once highly erratic system is becoming far more dependable.
Direct international dialling, introduced in 1980, is available to 85
countries. A new international exchange and a satellite earth station are to
be installed by the end of the year as part of a Dollars 41m scheme financed
by the Asian Development Bank.
There are still, however, far too few telephones. In 1991 state-owned Sri
Lanka Telecom operated 175,000 lines including extensions, only 1.1
telephones per 100 people. There is a waiting list of more than 60,000 and
customers say it can take up to 1 1/2 years to have a phone installed.
Demand is forecast to reach more than 500,000 by 1995.
Sri Lanka Telecom intends to install 200,000 more lines by the end of 1993
and has invited foreign companies to submit joint venture proposals.
Interest has already been shown by American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T)
of the US and by companies from Singapore, Korea, and New Zealand, according
to Mr Asoka Gunasekera, posts and telecommunications secretary.
World Bank funding of Dollars 57m has been secured to increase exchange
capacity in Colombo and between some of the island's principal cities.
Deregulation is already under way. Licences for value-added services such as
cellular telephones and electronic mail have been issued to private
companies. As an initial step to transferring the telephone system to
private ownership, Sri Lanka Telecom, a state-sponsored corporation, took
over administration of the network from the telecommunications department
last year.
The government is also keen to encourage private sector participation in the
road network. It is planning to build a parallel road between Colombo and
Katunayake airport, as well as between the capital and Galle in the south.
All 'A' class roads radiating from Colombo are currently being upgraded with
assistance from the World Bank and the ADB.
Finally, the government is keen to expand the capacity of its ports and
develop the island's potential as a transshipment route and centre for
shipbuilding and repair.
Lloyd's List earlier this year ranked the port of Colombo as the best in
south Asia and among the best 25 in the world. Colombo, which is extending
its container facilities, handled more than 10m tons of cargo last year.
The best natural harbour in Asia is at Trincomalee, but its commercial
potential has not been properly exploited because of the security situation
in the east.
Sri Lanka's ability to deliver adequate infrastructure to foreign companies
will be of key importance in its bid to reach the status of newly
industrialised nation. A good transport network - capable of moving large
quantities of goods from the interior to ports and airports - will also be
vital in the development of the country's export base.
State funds are in short supply. The response of the private sector will be
crucial in the years ahead.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (8): Long-term potential should soon
become clearer - Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN visiting the Colombo Stock Exchange floor it is advisable to take
ear-plugs. Respectably dressed traders compete with each other to secure
deals by bawling prices at high decibels. Mr Ravi Peiris, the general
manager of the exchange, smiles wryly and says: 'The people sent here by
brokers tend to have loud voices'.
Despite a history stretching back almost 100 years, it is only recently that
the stock exchange has come to life. A share market was inaugurated in
Colombo in 1896 when companies wishing to finance tea plantations raised
funds by offering shares to the public.
The market, however, was characterised by inactivity and was almost
destroyed by the nationalisation policy adopted by the 1970-1977 government
of Mrs Sirima Bandaranaike.
Even after the election of the United National Party government in 1977,
with its espousal of liberal economic policies, the then-titled Colombo
Securities Exchange struggled for survival. Mr Peiris admits 'awareness was
so low, people thought we were providing personal security services'.
Since 1990, the government has progressively dismantled a tax structure
which had been a disincentive to equity investments. In the past two years a
15 per cent withholding tax on dividends, a 100 per cent tax on the transfer
of shares and all capital gains taxes have been removed.
The response has been a surge in daily turnover from just SLRs1.5m in 1989
to SLRs25m this year. Market capitalisation has also jumped from about
SLRs18bn in 1989 to more than SLRs80bn last year, although a slide in share
values in the past 10 months has seen it decline to about SLRs75bn.
The growth of the market has coincided with a move to computerise the
workings of the exchange, starting from the back office.
Whereas the open 'out-cry' system of making deals is used on the trading
floor, all clearing and settlement is fully automated. The system - which
cost just Dollars 135,000 and became operational in September 1991 - gives
Colombo the technological edge over most emerging markets which still rely
on physical transfer of scrips to complete deals.
In the relative peace of his office - the trading floor rumbles in the
background - Mr Peiris watches the real-time deals on his computer console.
The information is simultaneously transmitted to the 11 licensed brokers and
to 'retail shops' operated by two leading brokers, where the general public
is invited to punt on the market.
However, while Colombo can feel satisfied with the progress made so far, it
still ranks among the smallest of the emerging markets.
Only 60 of the 186 listed companies are actively traded and trading volume
is so low as to make it difficult for large investors to move in and out of
positions rapidly.
There are also signs that domestic enthusiasm is waning and companies have
found it increasingly difficult to raise capital through the market.
While SLRs2bn in new issues was raised in the first seven months of the year
and rights issues totalling SLRs1.2bn were also launched, underwriters have
had to step in with several offers not fully subscribed.
The creation of four unit trusts this year also hurt the equity market.
While the trusts can invest in equities, brokers say all but a fraction of
their funds have gone into time-deposits and low-risk treasury bills. The
trusts, which carry generous tax incentives for investors, attracted SLRs2bn
which might otherwise have been placed in equities.
Since last December the Colombo index has fallen by one-fifth in what
brokers politely call 'a correction'. But as Mr Anura Wickremasinghe,
director of brokers Forbes and Walker says: 'I'm surprised the market didn't
collapse. It only dropped 20 per cent. In that context, it's a very strong
market.'
The longer-term potential of the market should soon become clearer with the
imminent arrival of five foreign brokers - Jardine Fleming, Smith New Court,
Sasoons, Development Bank of Singapore and Crosby Securities  - to compete
with the 11 local brokers.
Mr Ajit Gunewardene, managing director of CKN Fund Management, believes
foreign brokers will 'add value to the market in terms of research. The
market needs a new infusion of expertise to expand further'.
Leading local brokers hope to maintain a sufficient market share through
their network of domestic clients and accept that, without the attention of
foreign investors, the market will stagnate.
'We bring a lot of potential buying power for Sri Lankan equities,' explains
Mr Timothy Beardson, chairman of Crosby Securities (Hong Kong), although he
adds that 'International institutions are likely to hold back for a year or
two' before committing funds to Colombo.
In June the government agreed to allow foreign investors to own 100 per cent
of most listed companies and about 25 regional funds run by international
financial institutions have started investing in the market.
The government's privatisation programme should help improve the market's
liquidity with its policy of broadening the base of share ownership. The
government has divested 21 companies to date (excluding the plantation and
transport sectors) and a further 40 are slated for privatisation by next
June.
Colombo has also avoided the regulatory scandals suffered by other emerging
markets such as Bombay and Jakarta, with strict rules on disclosure.
Brokers are confident they can allay investor's concern over the continuing
separatist war in the north and east of the country, so long as national
economic growth can be maintained.
Mr Wickremasinghe believes investor familiarity is the key to a market's
success. He points to the willingness of US investors to deal in the Manila
stock market, which enjoys daily turnover of about Dollars 7.5m, despite the
Philippines' volatile political record.
Brokers also point to China's stock exchanges which have boomed despite
uncertainty over the future direction of the communist government, and to
Thailand where political turmoil has led to record trading on the Bangkok
bourse.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (7): Who reaps benefits of economic
growth? - Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS in Colombo express their avid support for the government's liberal
economic policies. In the past three years, business has picked up, offices
have been refurbished and the freeing of exchange controls has allowed
foreign banks to repatriate profits.
Government officials, however, are not so enamoured with the banks and claim
they are monopolising the benefits of economic growth. The government has
adopted a campaign of moral persuasion to convince banks that, unless the
'trickle down' to poorer sections of the population is increased, social
unrest may re-emerge.
The response from banks has not been encouraging. One executive noted
bluntly: 'I'm not going to lend on the basis of a threat of insurgency two
years down the line'.
Sri Lanka is not alone among developing countries in experiencing the rude
shock that, upon liberalising the economy, banks prove reluctant to fund the
government's social agenda. Despite its frustration, however, the government
is unlikely to alter its policy of reducing the state's role in the banking
sector.
In the short-term, this will require firm action in restructuring the two
state banks and setting a timetable for banks to comply with Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) guidelines, particularly on capital
adequacy. Sri Lankan banks' capital requirements are based on a percentage
of customer deposits, a standard not recognised internationally.
The two state banks, Bank of Ceylon and the People's Bank, account for about
70 per cent of total lending and dominate the industry. But years of
mismanagement and political interference have left them undercapitalised and
with a large volume of non-performing loans.
Central bank officials will only describe the state banks' capital adequacy
ratio (CAR) as 'low' and the requirement for new capital as 'substantial'.
Private bankers suggest the two banks have a CAR of about 4 per cent of
risk-weighted assets, compared to 8 per cent under BIS guidelines.
The central bank is also reluctant to publicise the state banks'
non-performing loans but these may be as high as 30 per cent of their
portfolios, according to bankers.
A World Bank plan to split each state bank into two companies - one to take
the substantial burden of debt and be slowly run down, the other to emerge
as a financially sound and efficient enterprise - was rejected by the
government.
This followed concern, government officials say, that the plan would entail
the closure of many rural branches and the retrenchment of staff. The
government has also ruled out a World Bank suggestion that the two banks be
privatised.
'We are not moving towards privatisation. We are moving towards
commercialisation - making them commercially viable entities - which may
achieve the same result as that of privatisation,' explains Mr S. T.
Fernando, deputy governor of the central bank.
The private banks in Sri Lanka - 17 foreign and four domestic - are in
better shape, although many do not fully recognise their non-performing
loans and may need to increase capital to satisfy the BIS.
It remains uncertain when the guidelines will be implemented. A deadline of
January 1 next year had been set but government officials now concede the
state banks will be unable to meet that date. Central bank rules demand that
the guidelines be enforced on all banks simultaneously.
Other weaknesses of the sector include a volatile interbank rate which, due
to the dominant role of the two state banks in the interbank market, can
vary over 20 percentage points in any one week.
Central bank officials say they would like to see generally lower interest
rates. But they add that until a long-term capital market is established, it
will be impossible to decide how low a short-term interest rate should be.
Banks currently offer deposit rates of 15-17 per cent and lending rates
anywhere from 18-23 per cent, giving a spread on high risk loans of up to 8
per cent. On their dollar offshore accounts, banks are offering around two
percentage points above Libor for deposits.
Government treasury bills, of which there are about SLRs75bn outstanding,
give about 18 per cent interest - a real interest rate, once inflation is
deducted, of 7 per cent. This has led many banks with excess dollars to buy
rupees on the interbank market and invest in treasury bills.
While the treasury bills have helped to fund the government's budget
deficit, their high interest rate has undermined its campaign to persuade
banks to lend to the productive sector. As one central bank official notes:
'With a risk-free investment providing 18 per cent, why look around for
productive investment which carries a risk?'
While the task of restructuring the sector is a big one, the government and
central bank have maintained a decent record at tackling important issues.
In particular, they have followed an International Monetary Fund
prescription of limiting the growth of bank credit.
The banking sector's assets, made up primarily of customer loans, grew from
SLRs81bn at the end of 1990, to SLRs102bn last June. In September, the
central bank demanded that banks placed with it the rupee equivalent of 13
per cent of onshore foreign currency deposits. This removed SLRs1.3bn from
the banking system, tightening the government's control over money supply
and reducing banks' ability to lend.
'Banks certainly do feel the pinch of keeping this money sterile here and
not earnings interest, but that is part of the game. We have to maintain a
certain amount of monetary discipline,' says Mr Fernando.
Bankers say, however, that the decision marked the breakdown of an informal
dialogue between the central bank and private financial institutions over
policy changes.
Central bank officials say it reflected their growing confidence in
supervising the economy. Mr Fernando says: 'There was no necessity for
discussion with the commercial banks, because the central bank was quite
convinced it was a decision in the right direction'.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (9): Confrontation may be looming -
Labour and Trade Unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MERVYN DE SILVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ORGANISED labour in Sri Lanka is once again restive, and confrontation
between the traditionally powerful unions and the Premadasa administration
cannot be ruled out.
The government has sought to trim the fat from its bloated civil service and
wage freezes have begun to affect living standards of lower middle-class
public servants.
Last month, a 28-day work-to-rule paralysed Colombo port and many ships were
diverted to Singapore. As the costs mounted, the government agreed to
negotiate.
The strike was supported by opposition political parties and by the
pro-opposition press. Unions rejected offers from shipping agencies of
'incentive allowances' for unloading urgent cargo. In the end, the ports
authority agreed to talks.
Interestingly the chief negotiator was not the ports authority chairman, but
Mr R. Paskaralingam, President Ranasinghe Premadasa's top economic adviser
and chief negotiator with international donor agencies.
The government was keen not to have the prospects of economic growth wrecked
by union activity.
Colombo port, considered the best in south Asia, has a long history of
labour unrest. The port was nationalised in the 1950s, a move that increased
the power of unions which soon began to organise wild-cat strikes.
Mr Lee Kuan Yew, former prime minister of Singapore, once said that the
economic success of his island state was 'largely because of Ceylon's
failure'. He said that, before that period, Colombo had been known as the
'Clapham Junction of the east' (after a busy London railway station), but
had wrecked its future through the mishandling of labour and ethnic
relations.
The jibe is one with particular potency for the Premadasa administration
which is attempting to engineer precisely the type of economic miracle
achieved in Singapore.
Recent union unrest has not been an entirely economic affair. Opposition
political parties, increasingly desperate after 15 years in the political
wilderness, may be tempted to use trade unions as a stick with which to beat
the Premadasa administration.
The opposition, led by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, has a long-standing
alliance with the traditional 'Marxist' left, which in turn controls many
trade unions.
Mr Premadasa, however, has shown himself prepared to negotiate with unions
as in the case of state bank employees. The government, seeking to
reconstitute the two state banks, chose not to seek outright confrontation,
but instead offered a 'golden hand-shake' in order to cut staff. Moreover,
the administration stopped short of privatisation, instead choosing to
'commercialise' the banks.
And the unions are not wholly bent on confrontation. Replying to private
sector critics, Mr Tennekoon Rusiripala, president of the bank employees
union, explained: 'We appreciate how the political, economic and social
environment is changing, and we do not wish to be left behind in the race.
Our concept is that trade unions should be essential partners in any
dialogue on social progress.'
Government handling of organised labour has not always been so deft. In
September it was rash enough to introduce an 'emergency maintenance of
exports' regulation, banning any form of trade union activity in the free
trade zones.
The legislation had been introduced in response to foreign investors, now a
fast-expanding community, which had requested 'protection' from labour
unrest. The government miscalculated that it could get away with what were
universally described as 'draconian' measures.
In the face of strong protest - including outbursts from opposition benches,
threats from the unions, and strongly-worded resolutions by human rights
groups - the government was forced to back down and withdrew the regulation.
Despite such periodic confrontations between government and unions, last
year the amount of labour unrest actually fell. There were about 100 strikes
involving 57,000 workers in the private sector, a big improvement in terms
of working days lost over 1990.
Such improved labour relations may be hard to maintain. Both the
implementation of the IMF programme, as well as the government's aggressive
policy of attracting foreign investment, are likely to provoke periodic
confrontations between organised labour and the government.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (5): Religious and political roots -
Separatist war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Sri Lankan civil war, which erupted in 1983 from the long-smouldering
volcano of Sinhalese-Tamil ethnic tensions, shows few signs of abating.
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) continue their guerrilla war in
pursuit of an independent Tamil state in the north and east. The government
remains firm in denying them that goal. Talks with the Tigers have broken
down.
Fourteen months of relative peace, during which the LTTE held negotiations
with the newly-elected administration of President Ranasinghe Premadasa,
ended abruptly in June 1990 when the Tigers attacked several police
stations. The army retaliated fiercely, setting in motion a further period
of bloodletting during which as many as 10,000 people have died.
Years of conflict have produced a refugee crisis in which as many as 1.5m
people have been 'uprooted, displaced or exiled', according to the British
Council for Refugees. It is a war which, says Mr Neelan Tiruchelvam,
director of the Colombo-based independent Centre for Ethnic Studies, has
seen the 'progressive brutalisation of all areas of society'. Neither the
army nor the LTTE, he says, have shown regard for human rights.
In the latest incident, earlier this month, Tigers were reported to have
killed about 190 people, largely Moslem civilians, in raids on four villages
in the northern Polonnaruwa district.
Civil strife has also stifled economic growth. Military expenditure soaks up
about 12 per cent of the budget and foreign investors are wary of committing
themselves to a country at war.
The outbreak of fighting in 1990 marked the third stage of the conflict,
which first flared up in 1983 after LTTE terrorist attacks provoked a wave
of anti-Tamil riots.
The war entered its second phase in 1987 following the signing of the
Indo-Sri Lankan accord which drew up the framework for a long-term solution
to the Tamil question. The accord, however, rapidly broke down as Indian
peacekeeping troops became embroiled in battle with the LTTE.
Mr Premadasa, after his election as president in December 1988, negotiated
the withdrawal of Indian troops and began discussions with the Tigers. The
collapse of talks in June 1990 led directly to the third phase of the
conflict from which the country shows few signs of emerging.
Since then security forces have prosecuted the war with venom and in recent
months have turned their attention to Jaffna peninsula, the Tigers'
principal stronghold. Government troops have started to capture rebel-held
towns within the peninsula, although officials deny there is any imminent
intention to take the regional capital, Jaffna.
The army has been emboldened by India's decision in May to ban the Tigers,
held responsible for the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. India's move has
deprived the separatists of their main ally and has helped to stem the flow
of weaponry that is smuggled across the Palk Straits which separates Sri
Lanka from India.
The LTTE may be down, but it is not out. The army admits to having lost
nearly 900 men this year. In August the Tigers scored what was publicly
acknowledged as a 'devastating blow' when a landmine killed many senior army
officers, including Maj-Gen Denzil Kobbekaduwa, military commander of the
north. He was widely regarded as a peacemaker, seeking long-term solutions
to the crisis.
With the net closing upon them in the north, the Tigers have turned their
attention to the east, which represents the biggest obstacle to peace.
Moslem Tamils, whom the Tigers feel have betrayed the Tamil cause, have
become a particular target.
Tamils constitute only 40 per cent of the eastern province, but the Tigers
claim it as part of their ethnic constituency. The LTTE says successive
governments have pursued a policy of 'colonisation', peopling the east with
Sinhalese in order to water down Tamil influence.
The tangled roots of Sri Lanka's civil strife are both religious and
political. Sinhalese Buddhists, described by one commentator as a 'majority
with a minority complex', make up 75 per cent of the population but fear the
assertion of Tamil statehood as a threat to Buddhist culture.
The Buddhist clergy in particular, says Mr Tiruchelvam, 'believes that its
sacred duty is to protect Buddhism in the ocean of Hinduism that is India'.
The southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, home to 60m Tamils, is only 20
miles from Sri Lanka.
Tamils, in turn, feel discriminated against, largely in the areas of
language and employment. When the British withdrew from the island in 1948,
English-speaking Tamils dominated the civil service. However, they soon
found themselves subject to pro-Sinhalese laws rendering Sinhala the
official language, and introducing a quota system to improve Sinhalese job
prospects. Education became largely segregated.
The Sinhalese felt such policies were a means of redressing historical
inequities. To the Tamils they were the start of a Sinhalese assault.
Much of this legislation has since been toned down. Tamil is now 'an'
official language (although Sinhala remains 'the' official language) - and a
system of provincial councils, aimed at devolving power, has been
established. A referendum in the eastern province on potential merger with
the north has never gone ahead because of continued fighting.
Caught in this ideological crossfire is President Premadasa who has shown
himself willing - at least publicly - to negotiate with the Tigers. His room
to manoeuvre is limited. Cede too much and he will antagonise the powerful
Buddhist hierarchy. Cede nothing, and he faces the prospect of interminable
war.
According to Mr Tiruchelvam, Mr Premadasa - who has effectively already
begun his re-election campaign - has little to gain from a swift settlement.
'There are no short-term benefits in forging a political solution, as
whatever initiatives he made would produce some sort of backlash in the
south.'
Yielding too much to the Tigers would render him almost unelectable,
according to Mr Tiruchelvam. Recent peace proposals put forward by a senior
cabinet minister were quickly dropped when it became clear that Sinhalese
stalwarts were not prepared to stomach a deal.
There is, says Mr Tiruchelvam, one chink of light. Last August, 'for the
first time in our history', an all-party parliamentary select committee was
set up to put forward peace proposals. The committee provides a forum for
talks with moderate Tamil groups, such as the Eelam People's Democratic
party and the Tamil United Liberation Front.
Any lasting solution must be forged on an all-party basis. Too often in the
past, political parties have whipped up chauvinist fervour for purely
short-term electoral gain.
The fact that President Premadasa has not followed India's lead in banning
the Tigers leaves open the possibility of future negotiations.
The president has set several preconditions for direct talks with the LTTE,
including the demand that they lay down their arms. Prospects of this
happening remain slim and so, in the meantime, the fighting continues.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (6): Crucial component - Exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COLOMBO'S attempt to increase and diversify exports is a crucial component
of its ambitions to join the league of newly industrialised nations.
Since it took tentative steps towards economic liberalisation in 1977, the
aim has been to move away from the traditional mainstays of tea, coconut and
rubber towards development driven by value-added exports.
Much has already been achieved. By 1991 industrial goods accounted for about
60 per cent of export earnings, compared with only 33 per cent in 1980. That
figure is expected to rise to 65 per cent this year.
The range of value-added goods has also grown. Over the past six years, the
catalogue of export items has risen from 60 to about 400, according to
government officials. In addition to textiles, exports include chemicals,
petroleum products, leather and plastic items, agro-industrial goods, as
well as cut gems and diamonds.
There is still plenty to be done, particularly if Sri Lanka is to wean
itself from an over-reliance on the textile industry which still accounts
for half of manufactured exports. First, it will need to attract more
foreign capital, a requirement that has led Colombo to accelerate its
programme of investment liberalisation.
To that end President Ranasinghe Premadasa has, in effect, declared the
entire island a free trade zone, offering investment incentives to virtually
all newcomers. With the exception of strategic industries - such as weapons
manufacture - companies setting up export-led businesses will automatically
benefit from a package of incentives including tax holidays, access to
foreign exchange, duty-free import of equipment and repatriation of profits.
Such benefits were previously restricted to companies established under the
auspices of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission (GCEC) which runs Sri
Lanka's free trade zones, of which there are now three. The GCEC, set up in
1978 to 'spearhead export-led development', marked what Mr Frank Weeraratne,
deputy director-general of the commission, calls a 'watershed' in economic
policy.
The commission's task was to promote foreign investment, boost exports,
provide employment and facilitate a transfer of technology. All were to be
achieved by shifting the economy from its 'restrictive, highly-regulated
system'.
Under the latest reforms, GCEC authority has been extended to cover
island-wide export-led investments. The GCEC - shortly to be renamed the
Board of Investment - will act as a 'one-stop shop' for investors, cutting
out bureaucratic delays and wooing foreign capital, says Mr Weeraratne.
The extension of incentives is in part a response to the disappointing level
of foreign investment which, until last year had not risen above Dollars 40m
annually, mainly from other Asian countries.
The latest World Bank country report says these levels of foreign investment
should be compared with competitors such as Thailand and Malaysia which, in
1989, attracted inflows of Dollars 1.7bn and Dollars 1.8bn respectively.
The finance ministry is not unduly alarmed by such comparisons. 'East Asian
investors are traditionally quite wary,' says one senior official.
'Investment was quite slow to begin with in Thailand and Indonesia as well.
But, now we have succeeded in establishing macroeconomic stability and, to a
reasonable extent, political stability, we are confident that inflows will
improve.'
In addition to broadening the incentives available, the scope of projects
qualifying for benefits is also being enlarged. Infrastructure, tourism,
provincial development and 'flagship' companies - with an investment of more
than Dollars 50m - are among those qualifying.
The legacy of bureaucracy, however, may be hard to shake off and the GCEC
needs to prove itself capable of acting swiftly and efficiently. New
incentives are coming in so rapidly that there have been complaints that the
GCEC has been applying them inconsistently.
Mr K. Gunaratnam, chairman of the Export Development Board, admits: 'We can
be inconsistent in the treatment of foreign investors.'
Mr Gunaratnam says there is also a public relations battle to be won.
Investors must be convinced that the civil war is regional and presents no
barrier to conducting business on the rest of the island. The country's
advantages, such as a well-educated, 'reasonably cheap' labour force as well
as its strategic position, should be stressed, he says.
Mr Weeraratne at the GCEC believes the battle is already being won and
speaks of a 'phenomenal increase in investment'. The figures have yet to
bear out such unbridled optimism, but foreign interest has undoubtedly been
provoked.
The number of GCEC-approved projects has begun to climb, reaching 507 by
June 1992. Manufactured exports are outstripping growth in other areas. The
value of industrial exports rose from SLRs41.5bn in 1990 to SLRs 50.7bn in
1991 and is expected to reach SLRs66bn this year.
Most encouraging of all are signs that foreign inflows are beginning to
rise. Donors estimate that direct investment was Dollars 50m last year
(against Dollars 32m in 1990) and will rise to between Dollars 70m and
Dollars 120m in 1992.
Given current trends, donors say it is realistic to expect annual inflows of
Dollars 300m-Dollars 400m by mid-decade. An end to civil conflict, as in so
many areas of the island's economic development, could spur even faster
growth.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (2): Rapidly shedding state controls -
The economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SRI Lanka, embarked on a vigorous course of economic liberalisation, is
rapidly shedding the vestiges of an inward-looking state-controlled economy.
Instead, the country is diversifying from a traditional agricultural base by
attracting export-oriented industry.
There are three main obstacles to the success of the government's economic
plans:
Almost every developing country has the same economic agenda and is
competing to attract foreign capital;
Recession among developed nations has reduced the pool of available capital;
Sri Lanka is still experiencing a costly and destabilising civil war.
There is, however, cause for optimism.
With single-minded determination, Sri Lanka's economic technocrats have
charted a path through the minefield of fratricidal war into a period of
tentative growth.
Gross domestic product (GDP) growth rose from 2.3 per cent in 1989 to 6.2
per cent in 1990 and 4.8 per cent in 1991. Although it is forecast at 4.5
per cent this year, a severe drought in the first few months wiped out about
1 per cent potential growth.
Between 1978-1991, the share of agricultural produce in total exports fell
from 79 per cent to 31.5 per cent. Last year, tea - Sri Lanka's main
agricultural export - accounted for 21 per cent of exports, compared to 48.5
per cent 13 years earlier.
In the same period the share of manufactured items rose from 15 per cent to
60 per cent of total exports. The textile and garments sector has been
particularly strong, rising 27 per cent last year to Dollars 850m and
accounting for more than half of total manufactured exports.
There has also been a recent increase in the direct foreign investment
(excluding the stock market) which Sri Lanka has attracted, increasing from
Dollars 32m in 1990 to an expected Dollars 70m-Dollars 120m this year.
Donor agencies predict flows of direct foreign investment will reach Dollars
300m-Dollars 400m a year by the second half of the decade.
In its efforts to attract foreign investment, the government has offered
generous tax holidays and freedom from all import and export tariffs for
export-oriented businesses, coupled with the right to remit profits.
Ministry of finance officials say that all possible incentives are in place
and it is now a question of marketing the reforms.
Donor agency officials, however, question the government's emphasis on tax
holidays, which for new export-oriented businesses can extend up to 20
years, equivalent to the production life of many factories.
In giving these tax breaks, the government has cut itself off long-term from
an important source of revenue.
'It's true, but we just can't help it,' explains a ministry of finance
official. 'We had a plan to abolish the tax holidays, but then Vietnam,
Bangladesh, India and Pakistan opened up. Unless we offer matching returns,
it will be difficult to compete.'
Donors have asked the government to reconsider, arguing that foreign
companies are attracted more by cheap labour, a literate workforce, reliable
infrastructure and minimal bureaucracy, than the generosity of the tax
structure.
Many businessmen agree. One executive of a multinational in Sri Lanka says:
'We don't go chasing tax holidays. If we make a profit, we expect to pay
some tax.'
On the domestic side, an ambitious programme to privatise state enterprises
has begun with 21 companies already removed from the government's books.
A restructuring of the economically important, but loss-making, tea sector
has led to a majority of plantations being returned to private management.
Steps have also been taken to open the stock market to foreign investors,
promote domestic share-ownership and develop unit trust and bond markets.
All this has been done with the active support of international donors who
last February pledged Sri Lanka Dollars 825m in, mostly concessional, aid
for the year.
Aid might increase, in the manner of a 'peace dividend' if a solution to the
conflict is found.
Although the government has moved rapidly in its economic reforms, much
remains to be accomplished if longer-term recovery is to be secured.
While exports have increased in value, so have imports and the trade
deficit, which stood at Dollars 1.02bn last year, remains worryingly high.
Remittances from Sri Lankans living abroad help narrow the deficit, but
continuing high flows of foreign aid are essential to balance the country's
books.
The flow of foreign direct investment has increased but, as the World Bank
warned in its 1992 country report, Sri Lanka remains a marginal recipient in
world terms.
There are signs that recent economic growth has been consumer- rather than
producer-driven. Commercial bank loans to the consumer sectors have grown,
while loans to the commercial and industrial sectors have shown a relative
decline.
The size and make-up of the government budget is also in urgent need of
redress.
The budget deficit has been reduced from almost 16 per cent of GDP in 1988
to a forecast 8.8 per cent of GDP this year, in line with International
Monetary Fund targets, but should be lowered still further.
The recent reduction of the deficit has been achieved through a cut in
public investment, down from 16 per cent of GDP in 1982 to just 5.7 per cent
in 1990, rather than on recurrent expenditure.
Donors have warned that this situation must be reversed if Sri Lanka is to
maintain the quality of infrastructure required to attract private
investment.
There is, however, strong pressure on recurrent expenditure. As a result of
the continuing civil war, the defence budget has risen from 1.3 per cent of
GDP in 1983 to 4.1 per cent last year.
In addition, the cost to government of caring for more than 1m people
displaced by the conflict amounted to SLRs4.9bn or more than 1 per cent of
GDP last year.
Expenditure on social welfare programmes in 1991, deemed essential by some
government officials if further civil disruption is to be avoided, amounted
to SLRs7.8bn.
With these levels of recurrent expenditure, economists are sceptical whether
Sri Lanka can average more than 5.5 per cent GDP growth a year,
significantly below its potential.
Despite the best efforts of government technocrats, the civil war remains
the decisive factor in the economy.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (4): An astute campaign - Privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's programme to privatise state-owned enterprises had a slow
start after first being mooted in 1987. The programme was born when three
other issues dominated the government's agenda: civil war in the north of
the country, insurrection in the south and a presidential election in
December, 1988.
It took until November, 1989, for the first company, United Motors, to be
freed from state ownership. Since then, 21 companies have been divested,
raising more than SLRs5bn in revenue. Government officials are confident
they can sell off the remaining 40 of those currently on offer by next June.
This may be over-optimistic given the limited resources at the government's
disposal to value and market the assets, and to evaluate bids.
The government has also sold off some of the best companies first and may
struggle to persuade private investors to take up the serious loss-makers.
As with the privatisation of the plantation and transport sectors, which
have been conducted under separate programmes, a rump of unprofitable
companies is likely to remain in government hands.
The issue of whether to continue subsidising or to liquidate these companies
remains unresolved. The privatisation programme, however, is gathering
momentum and most potential pitfalls are behind it.
It has been backed by an astute awareness campaign which, using an ancient
fertility symbol as its mascot, has renamed privatisation 'people-isation'.
Mr Tissa Jayasinghe, who heads the privatisation programme at the Ministry
of Finance, explains that the media campaign was 'written in a provocative
manner, because we wanted feed-back. We wanted to provoke debate.'
One advert detailed the cost, about Dollars 500m, of subsidising state
companies between 1984-86. 'Nobody had really exposed this before. There was
a lot of hue and cry,' says Mr Jayasinghe.
The privatisation of United Motors, through the sale of 90 per cent of its
listed shares to the public, took place against the backdrop of the People's
Liberation Front (JVP) insurgency. The remaining 10 per cent holding was
split between the company's employees and Mitsubishi of Japan.
The privatisation commission warned that the issue would fail but the
government pushed ahead, determined not to allow the insurgency to undermine
its economic programme and to fulfil its commitments to international
donors.
Underwriters were left holding more than two-thirds of the shares at an
issued price of SLRs11 per share. 'Banks were crying about it at the time,'
admits Mr Jayasinghe, and opposition parties called for the programme to be
scrapped.
The government's response, now considered by officials to have been a
mistake, was to sell the next company, Thulhiriya Textile Mills, to a single
buyer, Kabool Spinning and Textile of South Korea.
In commercial terms, the sale was a success. Kabool paid Dollars 6m for the
company and has since invested a further Dollars 20m. One fifth of the 3,000
employees were surplus to requirements when the company was sold, but the
workforce has since been expanded to 3,600.
The method of privatisation - selling a company in its entirety to a foreign
buyer - was controversial. As Mr Jayasinghe explains, in theory 'state
enterprises are owned by all the people, and when you divest you must allow
people a right to take a share'.
The government has now produced a formula which, although flexible, provides
a standard for privatisations to follow.
The government aims to sell a majority shareholding, usually 60 per cent, of
a company to a corporate investor based on the criteria of price,
credentials and future plans for investment.
A 30 per cent tranche of shares is then sold to the public with the aim of
creating a broad base of about 35,000 shareholders.
The remaining 10 per cent of shares are distributed to employees on the
basis of length of service. With the value of the shares they receive often
many times their annual salaries, there has been little employee resistance
to privatisation.
The opening up of the stock market to foreign investors, and the imminent
arrival of five foreign broking houses in Colombo, should help the
government's drive to find investors for forthcoming issues.
The most serious question hanging over the programme is the viability of
those companies yet to be sold, some of which carry a heavy burden of debt.
A government policy barring privatised companies from making employees
compulsorily redundant is also likely to hamper the sales of the more
marginal businesses, especially those which currently enjoy high tariff
protection.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (1): Strife must be resolved - Given a
brief respite from political instability, Sri Lanka has shown its economic
potential with a surge of business activity - a feat which underlines just
how great a tragedy the country's recent past has been
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SRI Lanka has high aspirations. The talk within government and business
circles is of the island joining Malaysia as one of Asia's emerging
industrialised nations, with Colombo, the capital, modelling itself on the
city-state of Singapore.
For a country which remains racked by a separatist war in its north and
east, and which is recovering from a Marxist insurgency in the south, such
economic pretensions might seem misplaced.
President Ranasinghe Premadasa, however, has pursued a vigorous economic
reform policy since his 1988 election.
State corporations are being sold off or returned to private management, and
Sri Lanka has adopted a generous tax regime to attract foreign investment.
The economic response to the state's withdrawal has been encouraging.
In 1989 the government quelled a four-year civil insurgency in the south,
instigated by the People's Liberation Front (JVP) - a banned Marxist
political party. And with the resumption of normal business activity, GDP
grew by 6.2 per cent in 1990.
Growth this year is unlikely to exceed 4.5 per cent, but would be higher
except for a severe drought in the first quarter. This surge in economic
activity has mostly come from the south-west of the country, around Colombo.
Given a respite from political instability, Sri Lanka has given notice of
its economic potential, a fact which underlines how great a tragedy the
country's recent past has been.
The country entered the 1980s with its population, currently 17m, enjoying a
90 per cent literacy rate, and social indicators the envy of other
developing nations.
Located off the south-east tip of India, Sri Lanka is well-positioned as a
trade and shipping hub, linking the sub-region with the Middle East, Europe
and Asia.
Simmering ethnic tensions, however, between the minority Tamils and the
majority Sinhalese, erupted into civil war in 1983.
As the scale of the conflict escalated, economic policy received a low
priority. In the past 10 years, at least 30,000 government soldiers, Tamil
Tiger separatists and civilians have died in the conflict.
The two-year intervention of an Indian peace-keeping force from 1987 failed
to broker an accord and the prospects for peace have again deteriorated.
Nearly 900 government soldiers have been killed this year, including Maj-Gen
Denzil Kobbekaduwa, military commander of the north, killed by a landmine in
August.
Between 1986-1989, the government had also to confront the JVP insurgency
which brought the economy, and business of state, to a virtual halt.
By 1988, when the government began its counter-offensive in earnest, about
1,000 members of the ruling UNP party had been assassinated. In 1989 the
three main leaders of the JVP were killed by security forces and the
insurgency was effectively quelled. An estimated 25,000 civilians died in
the struggle.
The horrors of the period make the subsequent economic upturn all the more
remarkable, but building the confidence of the international business
community in Sri Lanka will be a slow process.
A steady start has been made. Direct foreign investment inflows have
increased from Dollars 32m in 1990 to an expected Dollars 70m-Dollars 120m
this year. Donors expect the flow to increase to Dollars 300m-Dollars 400m a
year by mid-decade.
Tourists have returned, with at least 380,000 expected this year, more than
double the arrivals in 1987.
The Colombo stock market has opened to foreign investors and is providing an
important new source of corporate funding. Market capitalisation has grown
from SLRs18bn in 1989 to SLRs75bn this year.
Although the country is running a large trade deficit, the value of
industrial exports has more than doubled in the last four years to SLRs50bn
in 1991.
The government has begun to market its reforms to international investors,
but it is too early to label Sri Lanka a success story.
Much remains to be done on the economic front, including the need to
rationalise and lower tariffs, and make the rupee freely convertible.
Foreign investment is a fraction of what the country needs to provide
employment for those entering the labour market. Textile and garments
dominate the growth of new industry, with little investment in higher value
sectors such as electronics. More important, politics may yet bar the way to
further economic progress.
While supporters of Mr Premadasa attribute recent economic growth to his
strong leadership, his critics describe him as authoritarian, with a low
regard for the country's democratic traditions.
The president's position has recently been bolstered by the collapse of a
parliamentary move to impeach him alleged abuse of power and the refusal by
the supreme court to annul the result of the 1988 election on the grounds of
electoral misconduct.
Continuing dissent within the Bandaranaike family, which leads the main
opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party, has also improved Mr Premadasa's
prospects of winning a second presidential term in an election he must call
by December 1994.
His overriding problem, however, remains the continuing war with the Tamil
Tigers, who have been firm in their demand for an independent state.
Aside from the loss of life, the government has to care for more than 1m
displaced people, while in the Tamil-held Jaffna peninsula a generation of
children have been schooled in warfare.
All Mr Premadasa's options carry the possibility of failure, given the deep
animosity between the Tamil Tigers and the government. Opposition parties
are liable to use any peace proposal to accuse Mr Premadasa of capitulation.
The government could opt for an all-out effort to crush the Tigers, but the
army has been severely weakened by the loss of senior officers and success
cannot be guaranteed.
An attempt to re-open negotiations might be made, but the separatist leaders
have shown little inclination for a compromise settlement. The move would
also risk a backlash from the Sinhalese majority in the south.
An all-party parliamentary committee - in which Tamil parties, but not the
Tigers, are represented - has been created to find a resolution to the
conflict. However, agreement is far from assured and any resolution could
still be rejected by the Tamil Tigers.
The final option for Mr Premadasa is to continue with the current stalemate,
at least until elections are complete, with the constant flow of casualties
that this entails.
However, this course means maintaining a defence budget, running at 4 per
cent of GDP a year.
It would mean further cuts in public investment to meet donor targets for
government expenditure - and would undermine the long-term prospects for
economic growth.
The progress made in the past three years is a cause for optimism. The
success of the enclave economy in the south west shows what can be done. But
if Sri Lanka is to realise its full potential it must resolve its civil
conflict.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Sterling more liquid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HUGE liquidity problem that dogged the sterling cash market last week
eased yesterday after the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 800m
at the start of its market operations, writes James Blitz.
On Friday, the cost of borrowing money overnight peaked at a staggering 100
per cent because of acute shortages of sterling that were felt by commercial
banks. Yesterday morning, there was more volatility in the short-dates as
players expected the shortage of cash to keep the 'overnight' very high.
However, the Bank eased the situation by forecasting a deficit half the size
of what was expected, and by offering a 25-day repurchase agreement. The
cost of 1 month money eased to 9 1/8 per cent offered, from a previous close
of 9 1/2 per cent, although the 3-month offered rate remained at 8 per cent.
Overnight money closed at around 11 per cent offered.
That said, the market remains extremely nervous because of uncertainty over
the government's policy on base rates. The run-up to the chancellor's
Mansion House speech on Thursday is likely to be nerve-racking for dealers,
as they toy with the idea of punting on another rate cut.
There is plenty of scope for thinking that the shortages have not gone away,
either. The market is bracing itself for the traditional liquidity problem
that comes at the end of each month, when accounts need to be settled. There
are also some Pounds 5bn outstanding in the system following the Bank of
England's forex intervention on 'Black Wednesday'. 'What happens when the
Bank's special lending facility to the market dries up later this year?' was
the question put by one discount house dealer yesterday.
Trading in sterling futures reflected the easier cash situation, with the
December contract rising 13 basis points to a close of 93.52. In contrast to
that bullishness, the December Euromark futures fell back 6 basis points
yesterday after Bundesbank officials took a hawkish view on the prospect for
near-term cuts in German interest rates. It closed at 91.48, a level that
would see the German discount rate unchanged between now and Christmas.
French franc futures closed unchanged at 90.94 after the Bank of France
drained the cash market of liquidity and failed to cut rates.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Bundesbank comments ignored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUNDESBANK officials yesterday issued strong hints that another cut in
official German rates would not be announced at their council meeting on
Thursday, but that did not stop the D-Mark weakening against most
currencies, writes James Blitz.
As usual, the market is in two minds about whether to expect another cut in
official German rates this week. On the one hand, the German central bank
has carefully eased money market rates down to a level 75 basis points below
the Lombard rate ceiling. On the other hand, recent comments from Bundesbank
officials on monetary policy have leaned on the hawkish side.
Yesterday, Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, added to the
hawkishness by saying that lower German rates were more likely to occur
through money market operations than through cuts in key lending rates. Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank President, added that the Bundesbank saw
no reason to sound the all-clear on monetary policy, and that price
stability remained the central bank's primary goal.
Yet, these comments were ignored in a market which is confident that German
rates will be cut soon, perhaps even this week. The dollar strengthened
against the D-Mark in European trading, peaking at DM1.5435, and closing up
nearly a pfennig at DM1.5385. The Spanish peseta also strengthened
considerably, closing at Pta70.69 from a previous Pta71.58. Like other
exchange rate mechanism currencies, the Spanish currency rallied as
expectations of a realignment of the ERM failed to be met at the weekend.
The Italian lira rallied particularly strongly. There is growing confidence
in the Italian currency, and in the prospect that it will re-enter the ERM
sooner rather than later. Yesterday, the lira closed at L863.3 to the D-Mark
from a previous L876.1.
The damage that Britain's political turmoil is doing to sterling is all too
clear from the fact that, even in this environment, the pound managed to
lose nearly 3 pfennigs against the D-Mark to close at DM2.4425. The pound
also lost more than 2 1/2 cents against the dollar, closing at Dollars
1.5870, a seventeen month low against the US currency.
Sterling was specifically undermined Mr John Major's threat to call a
general election if Conservative backbenchers fail to ratify the Maastricht
bill in parliament.
If the situation worsens, the pound could threaten the historic low of
DM2.3690 reached in the aftermath of 'Black Wednesday.' There could be more
volatility in the sterling/dollar exchange rate, because of the dollar's
upward direction.
Mr Neil Mackinnon, chief economist at Citibank, said yesterday that sterling
could drop to Dollars 1.20 next year.

silver trading costs

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UP-FRONT cost of trading precious metals futures on the New York
Commodity Exchange (Comex) has fallen for the second time this month, making
it even cheaper to trade those contracts.
Comex yesterday lowered the minimum margin, or good-faith deposit, that it
requires customers to put down to trade futures on gold, silver, platinum,
palladium, and copper. The smaller deposit requirements reflect flat price
action in those contracts in recent months.
Most US futures exchanges, including Comex, calculate margins on a formula
linked to a commodity's price volatility. An exchange official explained
that, despite recent weakness in precious metals prices, long-term price
movement in these contracts, particularly in silver futures, has held narrow
ranges. Comex last lowered margins on October 14.
The exchange's requirement for a small customer to trade one gold futures
contract fell to Dollars 931 yesterday, compared with Dollars 1,064 two
weeks ago and about Dollars 1,300 a year ago. The silver margin fell to
Dollars 665 a contract, from Dollars 798 two weeks ago and about Dollars
1,064 a year ago.
So far this year volume in the Comex's precious metals pits is below the
1991 level and sharply below the 1990 turnover, which included the turmoil
linked to the Gulf war. J
In the first nine months of 1992, Comex silver volume dropped to 2.4m
contracts, from 3.3m in the same period in 1991. Comex gold volume, while
gaining in September, is also down, at 4.8m contracts in the first nine
months, compared with 5m last year.
Precious metals prices are in an extended slump, partly because of the
deflationary aspects of the world economy, analysts say, and more recently
because of sizeable sales by producers.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Caught in
a game of snakes and ladders - Sterling's devaluation has reinjected an
element of uncertainty into farm economics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOOD news for British farmers is that since the devaluation of sterling
last month guaranteed prices for some European Community-supported farm
commodities have risen. The bad news is that many of the production costs of
those same commodities have also gone up as a direct result of the
devaluation. Sadly the snakes that will add to costs are rather longer and
larger than the modest ladders which have increased prices.
While sterling was in the exchange rate mechanism and its value was locked
within a narrow band, EC price guarantees for the UK farmers were relatively
stable. Notorious 'monetary compensatory amounts' - payments to compensate
for differences in value between real pounds and so-called green pounds in
cross-border, intra-community trade - had almost disappeared.
However, since the pound was suspended from the ERM it has fallen against
the D-Mark by well over 20 per cent and against most other European
currencies by almost as much.
Farm prices are calculated in European currency units (Ecus) and MCAs were
introduced to inhibit opportunistic exports from one member state to another
in order to cash in on currency fluctuations and to reflect differences in
production costs.
But the actual levels of MCAs, set on a weekly basis, are subject to
political decision as well as currency value. As sterling has fallen, MCAs
have lagged behind the face value of sterling decline.
A further complication - for instance with cereals, the key commodity - is
that the intervention system, under which surplus stock is bought and stored
until it is needed, domestically or for export, does not begin these days
until November 1. So, although the official 'green pound gap' for cereals
has risen from almost nothing to 11.7 per cent since sterling was suspended
from the ERM the spot price for October delivery feed wheat, for instance,
has gone up by only Pounds 8 to Pounds 116 a tonne, with prices for the
supported November position Pounds 7 to Pounds 8 higher.
This is a welcome and unexpected bonus for farmers with the appropriate
commodities to sell, because the benefits have not been restricted to
cereals.
Sugar beet, for instance, which is being harvested now, will be worth a few
pounds a tonne more than anticipated. Finished lamb prices, which normally
decline in the autumn, rose for a week or two - although French buyers, who
take most UK lamb exports, soon got together to force the price down again.
But beef cattle - which should, according to the increased face value of the
guaranteed price, have made more money - failed to respond.
The EC single market, which is scheduled to come into operation at the
beginning of 1993, is supposed to abolish MCAs altogether. It was originally
expected that all community currencies would, by then, be stable within the
ERM and that there would be no further need for measures to equalise farm
prices.
But with sterling still floating, mainly downwards, some traders say that in
order to provide UK farmers with guarantees of equal value to those across
the channel, the intervention price of feed wheat, for example, might have
to be raised as high as Pounds 140 per tonne.
It is almost inconceivable that this will be allowed to happen. Quite apart
from giving a confusing and entirely inappropriate signal to UK grain
growers (who are still smarting over the introduction of acreage set-aside
to cut production by 15 per cent), such a price rise would add unacceptably
to the costs of producing livestock, which consume much of the grain. In all
the chaos of recent weeks, however, nobody really knows what will happen.
All that is clear is that while sterling remains outside the ERM pricing
farm products will be a game of chance.
Moreover, specialist livestock farmers who buy grain but do not produce it
are already having to pay substantially more for animal feed. Standard
rations for pigs, for instance, went up by about Pounds 5 a tonne
immediately after devaluation, not only because of the effect on home-grown
grain but also because most of the protein in the form of soyabean meal and
fishmeal has to be imported. Further substantial monthly increases are
expected while the present uncertainty lasts.
The UK imports many other requisites for the production of crops and
livestock. Many crop protection chemicals and animal health products are
supplied from continental countries as well as the US and the costs of these
will inevitably rise in line with sterling's devaluation. In most cases this
will amount to considerably more than will be compensated by MCAs and the
EC's system of green money. As already explained these are in any case
scheduled to disappear in two months.
Farm machinery will be similarly affected. The UK's machinery manufacturing
capability has been allowed to run down in recent years and the country now
imports about 60 per cent of the tractors and 70 per cent of the farm
implements it needs. Again, many of these come from Germany, with some from
France, Italy, Denmark and the Netherlands, among others. Very soon the
effects of sterling's devaluation will be seen in the prices of such
machines.
In the meantime, a small window of opportunity has appeared for the
relatively few farmers fortunate enough to be selling products such as grain
at prices higher than budgeted
Some farm machinery importers refused to trust the long-term value of
sterling and purchased foreign currencies forward before that fateful
bungy-jumping performance in September. Now they are passing on that
currency advantage to those farmers with money to spend.
It may seem strange to outsiders but such is the competition in the
over-supplied farm machinery business and so thin have been sales in the
last few years that importers and dealers feel they have no alternative.
Undoubtedly they also hope that by cashing in on the temporary advantage of
having 'cheap' money they will help push competitors who did not have the
foresight or the cash flow to plan ahead into bankruptcy.
But when that forward-purchased money is used up the whole of UK agriculture
will face the full effects of the sterling devaluation. Full compensation
through any future EC system is a pipe dream. And prospects for the kind of
national top-up that farmers in several other EC countries receive, quite
legally under the terms of common agricultural policy reform, look bleak
against planned treasury cuts.
The recession that has affected British farmers for at least the last seven
years seems set to continue.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia may press for better
diamond deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA will press for an improvement in the terms of a five-year deal giving
South Africa's De Beers a virtual monopoly on the country's sales of rough
diamonds, if an influential Russian parliamentarian gets his way.
Mr Leonid Gurevich, who co-chairs a state commission examining the Russian
diamond industry, has complained that the agreement signed in 1990 by Soviet
authorities is 'not a partnership'. He said that other diamond-producing
countries such as Australia had obtained much better terms from De Beers,
which controls 80 per cent of the rough (uncut) diamond market through its
London-based Central Selling Organisation.
Mr Gurevich also rejected what he called 'blackmail' by De Beers, which
suggested that Russian complaints would only damage Russian interests by
further weakening an already depressed diamond market.
He said that at a meeting requested by De Beers on Thursday evening he had
challenged Mr Gary Ralfe, the head of the CSO, who is also in charge of
relations with Russia, to prove that the relationship was fair.
'I said 'help me' (prove this). He answered with an attack. He said they are
thinking about whether to renew the present agreement. . . I told him he was
strongly exaggerating the losses we would face if the relationship broke
down. I explained to him that it would be a catastrophe for De Beers but not
for Russia.' Mr Gurevich also said he had received from Mr Ralfe media
reports on the Russian diamond business with a note from him claiming that
such articles were harming the market.
Welcoming the creation of a new Russian-Yakutian joint stock company as
ending internal divisions over control of Russian diamonds, Mr Ralfe said
before meeting Mr Gurevich that he did not expect Russia to renegotiate
their present agreement.
But Mr Gurevich told a different story. Despite Mr Ralfe's assertion that Mr
Gurevich was 'not running the diamond business', the parliamentarian said he
would press for changes before the present deal expires in 1995.
He complained that while Australia could sell 15 per cent of its diamond
exports independently of the CSO, Russia could sell only 5 per cent. Even
then, the independent Russian sales, intended to test the prices fetched by
the CSO, could only be conducted in Moscow.
Mr Gurevich said: 'Can we talk seriously about this if there is no diamond
market in Moscow? We want to sell these diamonds abroad on the free market.'
Almazyuvelirexport, the state organisation that handles diamond sales and
signed the agreement with De Beers for the now defunct Soviet Union, agreed
yesterday that there was room for improvement. But Mr Pavel Kovilin, the
deputy director of Almazyuvelirexport, said his organisation would press for
changes only after the agreement expired.
He also claimed that the Moscow sales. which were attended by buyers from
all continents, fetched prices representative of the world market.
Although he has no formal role in running the Russian diamond business, Mr
Gurevich is capable of mobilising opinion against the present arrangements
if informal pressure for a better deal from De Beers does not work.

So far Australia's Broken Hill Proprietary, the UK's RTZ (through Kennecott,
its US subsidiary) and De Beers of South Africa have been the only prominent
international companies known to be active in the hunt. Altogether 5.2m
hectares (13m acres) have been staked.

production at Antwerp

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, said yesterday that it will close
its Antwerp propylene plant until the end of the year, but warned of a
future closure unless market conditions improved.
Statoil owns the plant jointly with Himont of Italy in a venture called
North Sea Petrochemicals. Statoil's share of investment in the facility was
NKr1.1bn (Pounds 110m), of which 60 per cent covered the propylene plant.
The petrochemicals complex, which came on stream last year, also comprises a
polypropylene plant, which will remain in operation.
Difficult market conditions prompted the temporary closure. 'Recession and
surplus capacity are pushing prices for plastic raw materials like propylene
down to the lowest levels ever seen. At the same time feedstock prices for
propane are rising,' Statoil explained.
The propylene facility has annual production capacity of 400,000 tonnes and
the polypropylene facility has an 180,000-tonne capacity. The two-month
closure will result in a loss of 30,000 to 40,000 tonnes of propylene.
After overcoming a number of technical problems, the facility resumed normal
production in August at 60 to 70 per cent of capacity.
Statoil said propylene prices had fallen to between DM400 and DM450 (Pounds
162 and Pounds 182) a tonne in the fourth quarter from DM600-DM650 last year
while in recent weeks feedstock prices have risen rose to Dollars
195-Dollars 205 a tonne from Dollars 180.
In the first half of this year Statoil's petrochemicals division plunged
into a loss of NKr172m from a profit of NKr100m in the same period last
year. The company, due to report third-quarter figures in the next couple of
days, warned of a deepening in losses by the division.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium upturn forecast for
1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM companies will have to wait until early 1995 before the metal's
price recovers to a level they would regard as reasonable, suggests the
Anthony Bird Associates consultancy in its latest market analysis.
It predicts that, at present exchange rates, aluminium will average 58.7
cents a lb (Dollars 1,294 a tonne) this year and 57.8 cents next year before
showing a modest recovery to 62.7 cents in 1994.
Bird estimates that the industry's average production costs today are 54
cents a lb but 'the relative position of the high-cost European smelters has
continued to worsen, largely as a result of exchange rate changes. The cost
position of the European industry is now becoming very unpleasant indeed.'
Further production cuts among European aluminium smelters can be expected,
Bird suggests, and smelters in the Commonwealth of Independent States are
too inefficient to continue exporting to the west at the present pace.
However, excess stocks of aluminium in the west will remain high for some
time and Bird does not expect supply and demand to be in balance until early
1995.

THE GOLD price fell to the lowest level for several weeks yesterday as the
bullion market came under pressure from European selling, particularly
German and UK. But support held at just above Dollars 341 a troy ounce. Some
traders suggested that gold might trade down to Dollars 340 an ounce without
uncovering stop-loss selling orders. London Metal Exchange base metals
prices mostly held steady during the afternoon. ZINC traded quietly in a
narrow range for most of the day, but short covering was triggered when some
buying pushed the three months price above Dollars 1,130 a tonne. The three
months COPPER price continued to fluctuate either side of Dollars 2,250 a
tonne with trade buying still supporting the market on dips but little
follow-through evident. TIN and NICKEL prices sustained early falls
following news of British Steel's production cut, but traders said this was
a 'knee-jerk' reaction, and that the news would not make much long-term
impact on the markets unless there was a round of substabtial European
production cuts.

FT  27 OCT 92 / International Bonds: NTT five-year deal favourably received
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE Eurodollar bond offerings emerged yesterday, as borrowers rushed to
take advantage of swap opportunities at the short end of the market.
Expectations that dollar interest rates are set to rise soon have increased
the number of fixed-rate payers keen to lock in rates in the swap market,
causing three-year swap spreads to widen sharply.
Investor demand for dollar securities remains rather slim, due to the soft
tone of the US bond market, although some European retail investors are said
to be showing an interest in the sector as a means of taking a view on the
currency.
Of yesterday's three new issues, Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone's Dollars 200m
five-year deal via JP Morgan, priced to yield 44 basis points over the
comparable US Treasury, fared the best. The deal was considered fairly
priced for a relatively rare, top-quality borrower and avoided the
overloaded three-year area of the market, where attractive swap spreads have
focused attention.
Finnish Export Credit's Dollars 200m three-year deal via Goldman Sachs was
considered fairly priced at 99 basis points over the curve, but Finnish
credits are currently a difficult sell.
Credit Local de France also tapped the three-year area, with a Dollars 200m
offering priced at 42 basis points over the curve, which also met sluggish
demand.
Of the recent batch of three-year offerings, General Electric Capital
Corporation's Dollars 200m deal launched at 45 basis points over the curve
late last week has already tightened to 37 basis points, but oversupply is
hampering further deals.
Elsewhere, Northumbrian Water reopened the Eurosterling bond market with a
Pounds 100m 10-year issue, which benefited from a rally in the gilts market.
Lead manager Credit Suisse First Boston attributed demand from the UK, Asia
and Europe to the market's eagerness for current coupon paper. Continental
European investors in particular prefer not to take the capital loss
involved when buying bonds at a premium to their par value. The deal was
priced at 85 basis points over the comparable gilt issue, which was
described as slightly aggressive. but right for the environment.
Meanwhile, pricing will take place today of a Dollars 200m issue for Grupo
Televisa, the Mexican media concern which is making its debut in the
international capital markets.
Chase Investment Bank is arranging the offering, which is part of Televisa's
Dollars 400m Euro-medium term note programme.
The bonds will be priced to yield 410 basis points over the five-year
Treasury, indicating a coupon of around 10 per cent at a small discount to
par. The proceeds will help fund recent acquisitions.

FT  27 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Milan to trade most shares on
new system by next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOST shares listed on the Milan stock exchange will be traded on its
controversial new screen-based system by the middle of next year, according
to Mr Lucio Rondelli, chairman of Generale Telematico di Borsa (GTB), the
company setting up and managing the system.
However, he gave no precise date for the shift to full screen-based trading.
The system, introduced last November, currently covers 35 shares which
together account for about 25 per cent of the capitalisation of the stock
market's equity index.
Mr Rondelli defended the system, which has been subject to a series of
embarrassing break-downs. Many of the problems for the network, which now
serves 224 screens, 68 of them in smaller regional exchanges, stemmed from
problems outside GTB's control such as faulty phone lines he said.
The unreliability of the system, which has been at its most erratic at
moments of heaviest turnover, such as at the opening of the bourse, have led
to criticisms from brokers and calls for suspension pending remedial work.
The system has recently been subject to an 'audit' by a specialised software
house to see whether the bugs are based in the software or require further
heavy investment in new computer hardware. While some problems have arisen
from software factors, such as the compulsory pauses which occur during
heavy trading periods, several recent breakdowns are believed to have
stemmed from human error.
Mr Rondelli admitted problems had arisen, but these did not affect the
'substantial validity' of the system, which might eventually need 'some
corrections'. He added that shares in a few companies which had a very
limited float of stock might not be covered by the screen-based system, but
that 'solutions will also be found for these cases'.

FT  27 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Iosco setback over common
capital requirements - Iosco Conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS to reach agreement on common capital requirements for securities
firms and banks hit another obstacle over the weekend when US securities
regulators held out for tougher standards than those sought by other
regulators.
The International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco), a grouping
of securities regulators from more than 50 countries, discussed the issue of
capital requirements, at the start of its annual meeting in London.
The organisation's technical committee, chaired by Mr Richard Breeden, who
heads the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, will meet again tomorrow
morning in an attempt to resolve the issue, which has already been under
discussion for more than three years.
A meeting of the committee on Sunday failed to agree on the amount of
capital that securities firms must set aside to cover the risk of holding
securities.
Mr Breeden is said to be holding out for a 4 per cent capital requirement to
cover the risk, while other regulators are arguing that 2 per cent would be
enough for any firm holding a large, diversified portfolio of securities -
as opposed to individual securities, which would carry a 4 per cent
requirement.
A recently-agreed European Community directive on capital adequacy includes
the 2 per cent requirement. When the directive is implemented, EC securities
firms will have to maintain their capital at a level equivalent to 2 per
cent of their gross positions in securities and 8 per cent of their net
positions - calculated by taking account of long and short positions and
hedging strategies.
Regulators yesterday raised the possibility of most Iosco members agreeing
to the 2 per cent requirement, with the US left on the outside.
However, such a compromise would damage Iosco's standing, regulators say,
because of the international reputation of the SEC.
If the SEC were left on the outside, it could also prove difficult to
persuade bank regulators - grouped in the Basle Committee on banking
supervision, rather than Iosco - to agree to the proposal.
The Basle committee has virtually concluded its own deliberations on capital
requirements for securities trading by banks in parallel talks.
The lack of an agreement by Iosco is holding up plans to push ahead with
joint action on the issue, which has been stalled for much of this year.
If the new capital requirements were imposed by individual securities
regulators, without the agreement of the US, trade in US equities could
shift offshore, to regimes with less stringent requirements.
A compromise has been under discussion which if enforced would have the
effect of preventing this migration of business to offshore centres without
imposing a common international capital requirement.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Bunds ease as hopes of imminent rate cut
dashed

GERMAN government bond prices dropped a quarter of a point as senior
Bundesbank officials yesterday stressed the central bank's commitment to
price stability, dashing the bund market's hopes of an imminent cut in
rates.
Dealers said the bund market had hoped to see a cut in key interest rates as
early as Thursday. However, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president,
and Mr Hans Tietmeyer, his deputy, stressed in separate speeches that the
Bundesbank was not about to abandon its tough anti-inflationary policies. Mr
Tietmeyer said a departure from monetary policy aimed at stability would be
irresponsible.
Medium and long-dated bunds fell as the statements were seen as killing any
hope of an imminent cut in interest rates. The Liffe gilt futures contract
opened at 91.81 and rose to a high of 91.93 early in the session, but ended
the day at around 91.46.
SUPPLY pressures and continued uncertainty ahead of next week's presidential
election left US Treasury prices unchanged-to-weaker in slow trading
yesterday.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/32 at 95
11/32 , yielding 7.642 per cent, but well off its lows for the day. The
two-year note was unchanged at 99 13/32 , yielding 4.306 per cent.
Prices slipped from the start as market players sold off some of their
inventories ahead of this week's auctions of new government securities. The
Treasury is due to sell Dollars 15bn in two-year notes later today, followed
by another Dollars 10.75bn in five-year notes tomorrow. The next quarterly
refunding programme also looms, and with so much new supply in the pipeline
investors and dealers are nervous about the outlook for the market.
The presidential race was also to blame for the subdued nature of trading.
The unexpected revival of Mr Ross Perot's standings in the polls only served
to heighten investor nervousness about the outcome of next Tuesday's vote.
POLITICAL and economic worries combined to push down UK government bond
prices, although the gilt market later recovered some of its losses to end
only slightly lower or unchanged on the day.
Dissent within the Conservative party over the prospects for European
economic and monetary union and worries about inflation following the
release of the latest quarterly figures from the Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) depressed the market, dealers said.
The CBI data suggested that the decline in pay settlements may have bottomed
out.
The 9 per cent gilt due 2008 edged up from 101 5/8 to 101 21/32 while
shorter-dated issues slipped.
Dealers estimate the Bank of England may have sold up to half of its new tap
stock yesterday. On Friday, the Bank announced it would offer Pounds 1bn of
a newly-created stock - the 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998.
The new stock is partly-paid and dealers expect most of the proceeds will be
used to buy back the Pounds 750m outstanding of 9 per cent stock due
1992/96.
'The Bank is taking advantage of falling yields and replacing a relatively
high coupon stock with a lower coupon issue,' said one dealer.
JAPANESE government bonds slipped on profit-taking following their rally at
the end of last week.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 opened at 4.78 per cent and ended at 4.795
per cent, corresponding to the low price of the day.

FT  27 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Korean companies press for
foreign funds - Growing demands for easier access to international capital
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KOREAN companies are no strangers to international capital markets. Since
the mid-1980s, Korea's largest corporate names have launched a growing
number of issues of convertible bonds, bonds with warrants and, more
recently, yankee bonds. In doing so, they have taken advantage of the
cheaper borrowing costs and longer maturity of funds available in
international capital markets.
But, as Korea's Ministry of Finance proceeds cautiously with financial
liberalisation, Korean companies are pressing for further freedom to tap
international markets.
Many want controls on overseas borrowing to be lifted to reduce their
funding costs and improve the international competitiveness of their
products at a time when Korea needs to boost export growth.
Under current regulations, Korean companies may only tap international
capital markets if the proceeds are used for investment in overseas
operations or for financing imports of advanced foreign technology. In other
words, they cannot borrow cheaply abroad and repatriate the funds to finance
domestic operations.
Mr Chang-Lok Kim, director of international finance at the Finance Ministry,
says: 'Our chief concern is that the money (raised abroad) would be
transferred back to Korea and would increase the money supply.' The
government wants to keep money supply growth - measured by M2 - at about
18.5 per cent.
But the ministry is aware of companies' funding concerns. Mr Kim adds: 'Our
ultimate goal is to allow Korean companies to borrow abroad to support their
domestic operations because we would like to see the free movement of
capital.
'The problem is: how do we reconcile allowing the money to support their
domestic operations without it having an impact on the domestic money
supply?'
Until the Finance Ministry allows the free movement of capital, companies
must apply for permission to raise funds abroad and then queue up to wait
their turn. One investment banker in Seoul says: 'The demand for funds
greatly exceeds the amount permitted by the ministry.'
It is not difficult to see why demand should be so great. Domestic sources
of financing are difficult to obtain or relatively expensive.
Prices on the South Korean stock market have been falling steadily over
about the last three years. The Korea Stock Price Index (KOSPI) has tumbled
from a high of 1,007.77 on April 1 1989 to a low of 459.07 on August 21 this
year, although it has since climbed back up to close at 582.74 yesterday.
Investors, disenchanted with the performance of their equity holdings, are
therefore less willing to stump up cash for new share issues.
Bank loans are available, but not always easy to obtain, as banks must meet
government credit allocation guidelines.
In the domestic bond market, yields on corporate issues are around 15 to 16
per cent, which is high by international standards. Added to this, most
corporate bond issues have a maximum maturity of only three years.
Korean companies - many heavily indebted already, with gearing ratios of
about 350 per cent on average - complain of the shortage of funds and high
cost of borrowing.
Samsung Electronics, Korea's largest electronics company is one case. If it
borrows on the domestic bond market, the cost of funds is likely to approach
17 per cent, once domestic interest rates and underwriting and bank
guarantee fees are included.
But if it borrows in international capital markets, it estimates the cost of
funding would be 8.5 to 9.0 per cent, taking into account the yield on its
paper and the forecast depreciation of the won.
Samsung spends about Dollars 900m a year on research and development, of
which Samsung Electronics accounts for the lion's share - an estimated
Dollars 650m. Mr Young-Key Hwang, executive director and group treasurer at
Samsung, says: 'The availability of funds is one of our main problems, as
well as the cost of funds.'
Mr Hwang argues that Korean companies that produce high-technology goods -
such as Samsung Electronics - are not competing so much with the domestic
companies as with the international names, such as Sony and Hitachi. 'We are
the largest R &amp; D spender in Korea - we realise it is the only way we can
survive the 1990s,' he says.
Other research-intensive companies, such as Hyundai Motor, would also like
to see greater freedom to raise funds in the international markets. 'We
would like to be able to use the proceeds from international financings for
our (domestic) expansion programme, and we do not think that would hurt the
economy,' says Mr Bang-Joo Lee, managing director of Hyundai Motor Company.
He adds this would allow Hyundai to compete more effectively with foreign
manufacturers.
Both Hyundai Motor and Samsung Electronics plan to raise money in the
international markets shortly. Hyundai hopes to raise Dollars 150m in global
depository receipts next month, using the money to buy high-tech equipment
from Japan for the development of its third generation of Excel cars.
Meanwhile, Samsung Electronics is preparing to sell Dollars 200m of 10-year
bonds in the US and to use the proceeds to import semi-conductor
manufacturing equipment from the US, Japan and Germany. The issue is
expected to be a 144A placement, which has fewer disclosure and SEC
regulatory requirements than does a straight public bond issue. The company
hopes to be able to raise funds at rates close to those in the public bond
market.
Samsung Electronics will be the first Korean company to launch such a bond
issue since the Finance Ministry opened the door to this form of borrowing
in September. Investment bankers in Seoul hope that other Korean companies
will follow suit and use the 144A placement route in future, especially if
existing limits on overseas financing are eventually lifted.

FT  27 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: New rules on international
equity offerings proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Primary Market Association has announced important changes
to its recommendations for international equity and debt offerings.
IPMA says the recommendations amount to a new code of conduct for
international equity offerings. 'We believe we have come up with a credible
code of conduct for equities to match our debt code,' said Mr Dirk Hazell,
secretary-general of IPMA.
Two levels of disclosure are required of the lead-manager, covering
corporate and market information. One is for countries from within
'specified jurisdictions' - EC and EFTA countries, the US, Japan, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand - and a stricter one for offerings from developing
countries.
The main effects for debt and equity-related debt instruments will be to
increase further the transparency of the lead manager's operation of
stabilisation; reduce the period within which fees are to be paid to 30 days
from 45 days - where they are not payable on closing; and to abolish the
grace period of 14 days for interest on late payment of fees. They apply
from November 16.

FT  27 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Gencor falls 10% in year of
weak commodity prices

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENCOR, South Africa's second-largest mining house, yesterday announced a 10
per cent fall in attributable profits for the year to the end of August.
The results reflect weak international commodity markets, which particularly
affected Gencor's mining operations, where attributable profits fell by 21.5
per cent.
Mr Brian Gilbertson, executive chairman, said that considering the difficult
commercial environment, the group had done well to limit the fall in
underlying operating profits - excluding one-off items - to 1 per cent, down
to R1.17bn (Dollars 399m).
Taking into account one-off items, transaction surpluses and an increase in
the number of shares issued following a R2bn rights issue in February, total
attributable profits fell by 10 per cent to R1.26bn from R1.40bn and
earnings per share by 17 per cent to 98.8 cents from 119.5 cents. The
dividend was increased to 45 cents per share from 43 cents.
A divisional breakdown of contribution to attributable profits shows that
the mining, metals and minerals arm, Genmin, contributed R391m, or 32 per
cent; Sappi, the forest products group, R189m, or 15 per cent; Malbak, the
industrial arm, R131m, or 10 per cent; Engen, the energy group, R259m, or 20
per cent; and investment arm Genbel, and other investments, R317m, or 25 per
cent.
Mr Gilbertson said that with few exceptions the average export prices
received were well down on the levels in the previous year. The limited
depreciation of the rand against the dollar was not sufficient to offset the
effects of domestic inflation.
He said decisions on the two large capital projects the group has on the
drawing board - the R6.7bn Alusaf aluminium smelter project and the R2.5bn
Columbus stainless steel joint venture - were 'imminent'.
He was confident of a 'fair degree' of local institutional support for
Alusaf, which is seeking to raise R1.2bn.
Mr Gilbertson confirmed that unbundling of Gencor remained a 'distinct
possibility', but it was on hold pending clarification of issues such as
marketable securities tax.

THE Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), the world's largest futures exchange, is
negotiating to link its new electronic trading terminals to an
over-the-counter stock trading network operated by the Cincinnati Stock
Exchange.
The deal would be a first for a US futures exchange, and demonstrates that
the CBOT is making aggressive plans to expand beyond its traditional futures
and options businesses.
The announcement was made at the launch of the CBOT's Project A, a local
electronic trading system that will trade during the CBOT's regular market
hours.
Initially, the exchange is offering futures on barge freight, two varieties
of zero coupon bonds, and an option on long bonds on Project A. However, Mr
William O'Connor, CBOT chairman, says the system will be used to list a
variety of non-traditional products, and provide access for CBOT members to
markets for cash government securities and stocks. The Cincinnati Exchange
does not have a trading floor, and operates entirely through a 'black box'
computer system. It is an affiliate of the CBOT's neighbour, the Chicago
Board Options Exchange. CBOE members own the majority of the seats on the
Cincinnati exchange.

SHARP, the Japanese electronics company, yesterday reported a 36.2 per cent
fall in parent pre-tax profits to Y26.27bn (Dollars 215.32m) in the first
half to September.
Sharp will be followed today by other electronics companies, including NEC,
Fujitsu and Matsushita Electric Industrial, whose interim results are likely
to be much worse.
Sharp's fall was stemmed by relatively strong sales of office and industrial
equipment and components, including liquid crystal display screens, where
Sharp is the world's leading manufacturer. Sales in this area advanced by 5
per cent to Y285.8bn. Total sales fell 3.4 per cent to Y583.6bn, led by a
6.4 per cent decline in domestic sales to Y304.4bn.
Sales of television and video equipment fell 11.6 per cent to Y134bn. Audio
and communication equipment sales fell 21 per cent to Y56.2bn. Home
appliance sales were relatively stable, off 1 per cent to Y107bn. Net
profits dropped 39 per cent to Y14.5bn.
Sharp projected full-year pre-tax profits of Y53bn, a fall of 25 per cent.

HIGHER base metals prices and expanded copper production helped Asarco, the
US integrated mining company, post earnings of Dollars 18.6m, or 45 cents
per share, in the third quarter, from Dollars 10.3m, or 25 cents, in the
corresponding 1991 quarter.
Sales dipped to Dollars 489.6m, compared with Dollars 493.4m in the third
quarter of 1991.
Third-quarter earnings included a dividend of Dollars 2.1m from Asarco's
52.3 per cent ownership of Southern Peru Copper Corporation.
For the first nine months of the year, Asarco reported earnings of Dollars
30.4m, or 74 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.435bn. That compares with Dollars
33.7m, or 82 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.417bm for the 1991 period.
Asarco's average realised price for copper rose 9 cents in the third quarter
to Dollars 1.13 per pound. Lead prices gained 6 cents to 31 cents per pound,
and zinc prices rose 14 cents to 61 cents per pound. The company said it saw
declines in its average prices for gold and silver.
The company indicated that fourth-quarter results could weaken since prices
for copper, lead, zinc, and silver had declined since the end of the third
quarter.

<TEXT>
ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit-maker, yesterday announced a sharp rise in
first-quarter profits, putting more pressure on Campbell Soup, the US food
company, to increase its ADollars 8.80-a-share hostile takeover bid.
Mr Bill Purdy, Arnotts' chairman, said net profits for the three months to
September 30 rose by 33.9 per cent to ADollars 17.53m (USDollars 12.59m)
from ADollars 13.09m a year earlier.
Mr Purdy said the board expected the increase in full-year profits to be 'at
least in line' with the the first quarter.
The result reflected a significant increase in earnings from Arnotts' core
biscuit operations, together with a modest recovery by its Macadamia nut
division.
Mr Purdy said the improvement followed restructuring, a return to core
activities and the successful introduction of new products, which had led to
higher productivity and better profit margins,
Turnover fell 6.5 per cent to ADollars 186.7m, reflecting the sale of a
number of loss-making businesses. The group said sales of core businesses
were 7.5 per cent higher. Net profits were ADollars 40m in the year to June
30 after abnormal restructuring costs of ADollars 11.8m.
Campbell is seeking a 17.2 per cent stake in Arnotts to add to its existing
33 per cent shareholding. The bid values the company at ADollars 1.2bn, but
Campbell would pay only ADollars 209m to gain control.
Arnotts shares have traded above the offer price since the bid was announced
two weeks ago. The shares closed 1 cent higher on the Australian stock
exchange yesterday at ADollars 9.13.
Mr Tony Sullivan, Arnotts' finance director, said the 'very good result'
suggested that Campbell's offer 'severely undervalues the company.' He said
a fair price would be more than ADollars 11 a share.
However, Baring Brothers and Burrows, the investment bank which is advising
Campbell, said the result would not force Campbell to increase its offer.
Baring said the profits were 'under estimates made by several leading
analysts, and are no better than the consensus figure among analysts of
ADollars 70m.'

QUEBECOR Printing, North America's second-largest commercial printer, was
helped by rising efficiency, lower interest costs and lower taxes to a 71
per cent gain in net profit for the first nine months of 1992.
The group, controlled by Quebecor, the Montreal-based publisher, posted
earnings of Dollars 36m, or 74 cents a share, against Dollars 21m, or 52
cents, a year earlier on revenues of Dollars 1.05bn, compared with Dollars
998m.
Third-quarter net profit was Dollars 16.9m, or 32 cents a share, against
Dollars 11.4m, or 29 cents, a year earlier on revenues of Dollars 360m, up
from Dollars 346m. The company made one acquisition during the quarter.
The group operates in all major sectors of commercial printing from inserts
and directories to bank notes. With acquisition of the former Maxwell
Graphics two years ago, two-thirds of its business is in the US.
Bramalea, the property group controlled by the Bronfman family of Toronto,
has another three weeks to modify its five-year restructuring plan to
satisfy senior debenture holders.
A six-hour meeting in Toronto last week with the holders of CDollars 525m
(USDollars 423.30m) of debentures was adjourned to November 19.
The restructuring is designed to deal with the company's total debt of more
than CDollars 4bn.

FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: Tokyo's stores lament loss of
big spenders - The older, luxury shops have been hit particularly hard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE times a day, a gaggle of mostly elderly people gather at the heart of
Mitsukoshi's flagship store in the historic heart of Tokyo's Nihombashi
district to listen to a recital on the shop's mighty 800-pipe organ.
The same man has played the organ for the past 40 years. His audience's
loyalty is a symbol of the enduring role Mitsukoshi plays in Japanese
retailing.
Mitsukoshi originated the idea of the Japanese department store in the late
17th century as a place where shoppers could buy almost anything. A store is
meant to provide all-round entertainment - music, restaurants, cinemas, at
Mitsukoshi a theatre and at Seibu a children's playground - in order to
attract shoppers.
The trouble is that since last spring people have been pouring through the
stores in their millions but have been buying less and less.
Sales at Tokyo department stores fell 8.7 per cent last month compared with
last year, the seventh consecutive monthly fall and the sharpest yearly fall
since statistics began to be collected in 1965, apart from the drop in April
1989 induced by the introduction of a consumption tax.
The drop in demand comes after five years of unprecedented growth that
encouraged many, including Mitsukoshi into costly expansions that will take
much longer than expected to pay off.
Mitsukoshi has invested about Y200bn (Dollars 1.64bn) in the past five
years, while Tobu spent Y100bn on its main store in Ikebukuro on the
outskirts of central Tokyo. Sales as Mitsukoshi's newest store in the
Shinjuku area of central Tokyo are 30 per cent down on plans.
Few executives in the industry expect the downturn to end soon. Mr Isao
Kubokawa, Tobu's managing director, explained: 'This recession could be more
serious and last longer than other recessions. One reason is that this
recession involves banks and real estate companies which have never been in
recession before, as well as the car and electronics industries which have
not usually suffered.'
The sales decline started last year with luxury goods - art and jewellery -
which were fashionable in the years of the Japanese bubble economy.
This has hit particularly the older luxury stores such as Takashimaya and
Mitsukoshi, where the top-floor luxury goods department is deserted, the
calm rarely ruffled by customers. It is a ghostly reminder of the hey-day of
the bubble economy.
By this spring, overall sales started to fall because consumers cut back on
more everyday purchases, particularly clothes.
Throughout the retail sector people are trading down to buy cheaper goods.
Mr Kubokawa said: 'They would have bought four shirts, now they are buying
only one, and they are looking for cheaper shirts.'
An executive of Isetan, the most fashionable of the stores, says that
younger consumers are buying casual clothes rather than the expensive
designer brands which were fashionable in the late 1980s.
In August, the decline started to affect staples such as the food sold in
the expansive basements below the stores as people turned to cheaper
supermarkets.
The fall in sales is having an alarming impact on department store finances.
For example, Isetan expects sales this year to be below last year, the first
annual decline in its 106-year history. It expects profits to fall for the
second year running, the worst results since the recessions of the
mid-1970s.
Tobu expects its investment in Ikebukuro will now take up to six years to
pay off compared with the original two years.
As yet the stores have taken only tentative steps to cut costs. At Tobu,
which has a wealthy parent in the form of the private Tobu railway, Mr
Kubokawa said: 'We have to be patient. Costs will be cut through natural
wastage over the next three years.'
Mitsukoshi, which is more financially vulnerable, is cutting management jobs
by 30 per cent and severely reducing executive bonuses.
With costs being cut at a much slower rate than sales are falling, it is
inevitable that department store profits will continue to fall this year and
possibly next year as well.
What might distinguish the younger more dynamic stores such as Tobu, Seibu
and Isetan is their determination to respond by more aggressive marketing.
They are all stress value for money, where two years ago they were selling
designer chic.
Tobu has introduced an own-label brand of cheaper products to catch
consumers as they trade down to cheaper goods.
Isetan's energetic management is implementing a medium-term plan to stress
profit growth rather than sales growth.
The heart of Tokyo has long since shifted away from Mitsukoshi's home - the
conservative, traditional low city of Nihombashi - towards the the neon
wonderlands in the outlying consumer-commuter conurbations of Shibuya and
Shinjuku in the high city, on the hills at the edge of Tokyo.
This recession will hasten a similar shift in the department store industry
as leadership shifts from the older, slower moving famous names to the young
pretenders in search of their crowns.

ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit-maker, yesterday announced a sharp rise in
first-quarter profits, putting more pressure on Campbell Soup, the US food
company, to increase its ADollars 8.80-a-share hostile takeover bid.
Mr Bill Purdy, Arnotts' chairman, said net profits for the three months to
September 30 rose by 33.9 per cent to ADollars 17.53m (USDollars 12.59m)
from ADollars 13.09m a year earlier.
Mr Purdy said the board expected the increase in full-year profits to be 'at
least in line' with the the first quarter.
Campbell is seeking a 17.2 per cent stake in Arnotts to add to its existing
33 per cent shareholding. The bid values the company at ADollars 1.2bn, but
Campbell would pay only ADollars 209m to gain control.
Arnotts shares have traded above the offer price since the bid was announced
two weeks ago.
The shares closed 1 cent higher on the Australian stock exchange yesterday
at ADollars 9.13.

<TEXT>
PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, yesterday unveiled an 18
per cent improvement in underlying first-quarter earnings, reflecting higher
sales in overseas markets and favourable exchange rates.
The Cincinnati, Ohio-based company said its results also benefited from
lower costs and improved margins in the US.
P&amp;G's recent decision to pull out of its unprofitable 100 per cent fruit
juice business muddied earnings comparisons.
Excluding a Dollars 200m after-tax reserve for the juice business, P&amp;G
turned in net earnings of Dollars 631m, or 89 cents a share, compared with
earnings of Dollars 536m, or 76 cents, a year earlier.
Including the provision, the company earned Dollars 431m, or 60 cents, in
the latest quarter.
Sales advanced 9 per cent to Dollars 7.88bn from Dollars 7.21bn.
Wall Street reacted to the results by marking Procter &amp; Gamble's shares
Dollars 2 1/2 higher at Dollars 53 1/2.

<TEXT>
FLETCHER Challenge Canada suffered a net loss of CDollars 18.8m (USDollars
15.08m) for the three months to September 30, compared with a loss of
CDollars 16.3m for the same period last year.
Mr Doug Whitehead, the president and chief executive officer for Canadian
operations, said the result was marginally better than expected and was an
improvement on the net loss of CDollars 20.1m recorded in the preceding
quarter to June 30.
Sales for the September quarter declined to CDollars 207m from CDollars 252m
a year ago.
The decline resulted mainly from production lost during a month-long strike
in the British Columbia pulp and paper industry, lower newsprint prices, and
the absence of lumber production from the Hammond sawmill which was sold in
December 1991.
Mr Whitehead said the improvement in the June quarter was encouraging as it
was achieved in spite of the strike.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE sliding price of nickel has led Inco, the western world's largest
producer, to slash its dividend by more than half, despite reporting higher
third-quarter earnings.
Inco said yesterday that it had cut its dividend from 25 US cents to 10
cents. The Toronto-based company has already announced production cuts and
other austerity measures, and said yesterday that additional steps may be
taken.
Third-quarter earnings rose to USDollars 10.6m, or 9 cents a share, from
Dollars 4.5m, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues dropped to
Dollars 607.4m from Dollars 663.6m. The latest figures include an Dollars
18.8m charge to cover the cost of voluntary retirements at the company's
Sudbury operations in Ontario.
Nickel prices realised during the third quarter slipped to Dollars 3.47 a
pound from Dollars 3.90 a year earlier. But this was offset by a sharp drop
in the cost of sales and operating expenses, from Dollars 560m to Dollars
488m, and a slight improvement in copper and cobalt prices.
Deliveries of nickel were almost unchanged at 112m lb in the third quarter
while shipments of copper rose from 40m to 44m lb. But Inco said part of the
improvement in third-quarter earnings was due to higher deliveries of metal
produced at its own facilities.
Inco blamed a sharp rise in Russian exports and the delayed recovery in
major industrial economies for the sinking nickel market. The London Metal
Exchange three-month price has tumbled further since the end of the third
quarter and is now only slightly above Dollars 2 per lb.

<TEXT>
PHILLIPS Petroleum, the Oklahoma-based energy and chemicals group, yesterday
posted a third-quarter profits advance, lifting net income to Dollars 99m,
or 38 cents a share, from Dollars 56m, or 21 cents. Revenues edged ahead to
Dollars 3.13bn from Dollars 3.11bn last time.
Mr C. J. Silas, chairman and chief executive, said exploration and
production earnings were helped by higher prices, particularly for domestic
natural gas and natural gas liquids.
Earnings from downstream operations were hurt by higher feedstock costs and
plant turnrounds. The results, however, were distorted by extraordinary
items.
In the 1992 quarter, Phillips recorded one-time gains of Dollars 6m from an
asset sale and Dollars 789m from revised estimates of tax obligations. These
were partly-offset by one-time charges of Dollars 19m from gas imbalance
positions and Dollars 12m related to an oil pricing dispute.
Excluding these items, Phillips earned Dollars 51m in the quarter, against
adjusted earnings of Dollars 13m.
For the first nine months, net income stood at Dollars 89m, or 34 cents,
against Dollars 179m, or 68 cents. Revenues rose to Dollars 8.98bn from
Dollars 8.89bn.
Stripping-out one-time items, Phillips earned Dollars 122m at nine months,
against Dollars 234m.
Third quarter results from Unocal, the California-based energy group, were
also muddied by one-time items which brought net income to Dollars 11m, or 1
cent, after dividends on preferred stock, compared with earnings of Dollars
9m, or 4 cents, a year earlier.
Excluding special items, Unocal earned Dollars 65m, or 24 cents, in the
latest quarter, against Dollars 23m, or 10 cents. Revenues were Dollars
2.51bn against Dollars 2.68bn.
For the first nine months, it earned Dollars 117m, or 46 cents, on revenues
of Dollars 7.6bn, compared with Dollars 89m, or 38 cents, on revenues of
Dollars 8.13bn.
Eliminating one-time items, nine-month earnings were Dollars 143m, or 57
cents, against Dollars 96m, or 41 cents, last year.

MOSS BROS, the clothing outfitter, more than trebled pre-tax profits, from
Pounds 102,000 to Pounds 354,000, in the half year to July 25, helped by a
strong showing by its hire business.
Sales were up 3 per cent to Pounds 23.9m (Pounds 23.3m) boosted by a first
time contribution from last year's purchase of Dormie from Sears Menswear.
Turnover was up 1 per cent on a like-for-like basis, reflecting an increase
in sales across all the groups activities, which include Cecil Gee, Savoy
Taylors Guild and Suit Co. The hire division increased its market share by 2
percentage points to 38 per cent.
Mr Rowland Gee, managing director, said: 'When we went into the recession we
said these are the economic conditions in which we have to trade. What we
have now may be normality. It is no longer a case of trying to forecast when
the recession is going to end.'
Accordingly, Mr Gee said the company had reduced the number of suits sold at
a discount by keeping stocks low.
Earnings per share rose from 0.14p to 1.42p. The interim dividend is held at
1.5p to be paid on December 4.

FT  27 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Berisford winds up its coffee trading
associate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERISFORD International, the property and commodities group, announced an
agreement that will result in the winding up of Rayner Coffee International
(RCI), its 45 per cent-owned coffee trading associate.
Berisford, which nearly went into receivership in 1990, is now little more
than a shell, with its businesses reduced to a UK property portfolio and
some small agribusinesses in California.
Having dealt with RCI, the group wants to build a new core business through
acquisitions in the services and manufacturing sectors. It is interested in
the US, where it has considerable unused tax losses.
Berisford said a programme of asset sales had reduced its obligation to RCI
from Dollars 115m (Pounds 70.5m) in September last year to Dollars 45m. The
group agreed to pay RCI's bankers Dollars 45m by March 31 next year.
Berisford said its restructuring would cap its financial obligations to RCI
and eliminate guarantees to RCI.
Berisford is paying RCI Dollars 26m for assets where it expects some further
limited recovery in the long term. The amount will be set against secured
debt owed by RCI to Berisford.
Having reached this agreement, RCI's directors have asked Berisford, as the
only secured and largest unsecured creditor, to petition for the winding up
of RCI. Berisford said the impact of these events was covered by provisions
in its accounts.
Berisford said it had realised Pounds 21m from asset sales since March this
year and expected to generate sufficient funds from other agreed and planned
disposals to achieve a positive net cash position during the current
financial year, in spite of the repayment of the Dollars 45m by its year-end
on March 31.
Mr Alan Bowkett, Berisford's chief executive officer, said that while he
regretted the demise of the coffee business, this deal freed Berisford from
the drain imposed on its resources by RCI.
Berisford's shares closed unchanged at 16p, giving the group a market value
of Pounds 79.4m.

<TEXT>
TI GROUP, the aerospace, seals and tubes group, has sold most of the capital
goods division of its specialist Thermal Technology business for Pounds 38m
to a wholly owned subsidiary of Ruhrgas of Germany.
TI expects to receive an additional Pounds 4m for changes in the net assets
of the business since last December.
The sale will involve a net loss of Pounds 10m after goodwill written off on
acquisition is written back through the profit and loss account in line with
the new accounting treatment.
Mr Christopher Lewinton, TI chairman, said the sale was consistent with the
group's strategy of concentrating on the three core businesses - Bundy
tubes, Crane seals and Dowty aerospace.
The Thermal Technology division makes vacuum and other tightly
temperature-controlled furnaces for the aerospace and automotive industries.
Mr Richard Cropper, commercial director of Dowty Group, which is now part of
TI, said Thermal Technology had been considered a core business but the idea
has since been discarded. TI started to build the division in 1981 and
expanded through the 1986 acquisition of Ipsen.

FT  27 OCT 92 / UK Company News: New faces shine in Wellcome beauty contest
 -A search for fund managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAD to have been one of the hottest competitions for a fund management
mandate in some time. Wellcome Trust, the medical charity, announced last
March it was seeking a group of managers for its entire Pounds 2.75bn
investment portfolio and would keep an open mind about applicants.
Not only was it the largest mandate ever awarded in Britain, the portfolio
is among the most prestigious yet put out to contract.
The result was that 237 hopeful fund managers announced their desire to
enter the beauty contest, some of them the brightest stars of the business.
The intense competition was even more surprising given that Wellcome made it
clear it intended to pay what are euphemistically known as competitive fees
for the business.
Yesterday, Wellcome Trust announced the results of its search. While some of
the winners would have been obvious candidates to any casual observer of the
industry, the list contained several surprises.
It was, according to Mr Roger Gibbs, chairman of the Trust, a fascinating
exercise.
To assist in the task, Wellcome appointed R Watsons, a firm of consulting
actuaries which frequently advise pension funds and investment bank J Henry
Schroder Wagg. The initial exercise cut the list to 55 potentials, who,
after further investigation, were pared down to 20.
The 20 managers were invited to a 'beauty parade' at the end of September
and early October.
'All 20 had something to offer,' Mr Gibbs said. 'It was an extremely
difficult decision.' Of the 20, 15 were extremely strong candidates, he
added.
The selection criteria specified the most recent five year investment
performance and performances stretching back as far as could be determined.
Furthermore, Mr Gibbs said, Wellcome was looking for quality of management
with a view to security.
Mr Gibbs declined to be drawn on which firms made presentations at the final
beauty parade. But the shortlist did include the four managers which had
originally been appointed in 1986: Fleming Investment Management Ltd,
Henderson Pension fund Management Ltd, Morgan Grenfell Asset Management and
James Capel, the stockbroker. Fleming's corporate finance team had also lead
managed the sale of the Wellcome shares.
When the eight winners were chosen however, two of Wellcome's current fund
managers, James Capel and Morgan Grenfell Asset Management were conspicuous
by their absence.
Also absent was the UK largest and most formidable pension fund manager,
Mercury Asset Management, which is believed to have been 'disappointed' at
its failure to be selected.
As a charity, the Trust had not only to choose those advisers it considered
best, but had to be seen to be doing so as well.
As a consequence, the winners will have survived one of the most rigorous
selection processes in recent memory.
The size and prestige of the business, and the Trust's charitable status,
also appear to have enabled the Trustees to negotiate remarkably slim
management charges. Thus, the financial gains may be a lot slimmer than
usual.
Wellcome is believed to be paying at or just below the bottom of the scale
for pension funds under management at 0.15 per cent of funds under
management.
Pensions consultants said that Wellcome's list of chosen managers in many
ways reflects a growing trend in the industry to shift money to 'specialist'
fund managers with a particular style focusing on a narrow market segment.
While the selection of Edinburgh-based Baillie Gifford is likely to raise
eyebrows, pension consultants said its reputation has been quietly growing
for some time. Acquiring a reputation as a retail fund manager, Baillie
Gifford has recently won a number of pension fund accounts.
The firm has won kudos for its investment approach that, instead of
assigning fund managers to individual accounts, divides investments up
geographically.
Thus, several fund managers may be responsible for a single account and as
the firm shifts its view of various markets, funds will move about within
it.
Newton Investment Management Ltd, winner of a 'performance' mandate from
Wellcome, has made its reputation as an aggressive investor in equities.
'The key to Newton's success is that they back their convictions to the
hilt' said one pension fund consultant. As a result, the firm has stayed
with investments other fund managers might have abandoned and achieved
impressive returns.
Wellcome Trust's portfolio was swollen in the summer when it sold some of
its shares in Wellcome, the drugs company.
The sale added more than Pounds 2bn to its investment holdings which had
first been put out to fund managers in 1986 when the Trust floated the
company's shares. The Trust also retains a 40 per cent stake in the company,
valued at Pounds 3.5bn.
Apart from the eight fund managers chosen, the Trust also employs Morgan
Stanley to run an international fixed interest portfolio. Barclays de Zoete
Wedd Investment Management set up a Pounds 500m index fund when the sale
closed at the end of July.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS TO Heron, the heavily indebted property group, who are meeting to
discuss restructuring proposals on Thursday, are happy that Mr Gerald Ronson
should remain as chief executive.
However he is thought likely to give up the chair since the restructuring is
expected to involve a large element of debt being swapped into equity,
substantially cutting the proportion of the equity controlled by the Ronson
family and its charitable trusts.
In many recent cases where companies have sought help from their creditors,
the banks have demanded the departure of existing management.
In Heron's case, though, Mr Ronson is seen as capable of handling the
controlled disposal of assets which will be recommended to the group's
creditors as the best way of recouping their loans. The group owes about
Pounds 1.4bn to its banks and bondholders.
An external non-executive chairman is expected to be appointed.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME TRUST, the medical charity, yesterday surprised the fund management
industry by its choice of eight investment managers to handle its Pounds
2.75bn portfolio.
The total includes more than Pounds 2bn raised this summer through the sale
of some of the trust's shares in Wellcome, the pharmaceutical company, but
not its remaining 40 per cent stake which has a market value of Pounds
3.5bn.
The trust's mandate was the largest ever awarded in the UK investment
industry and the successful firms are expected to gain considerable prestige
from their appointment. Wellcome is also said to have succeeded in
countering the trend towards higher fees in the industry, paying roughly
0.15 per cent of funds under management, well below average.
The list of eight, chosen from 237, was surprising as much for the names
omitted as those included.
Two of the charity's existing investment managers, Morgan Grenfell and James
Capel, were not reappointed. Mercury Asset Management, the largest UK fund
manager, although a finalist, was not selected. MAM declined to comment,
although it was said to have been disappointed. Morgan Grenfell said
yesterday it was disappointed to have lost Wellcome Trust as a client but
did not regard this as a severe setback.
By contrast, the successful candidates included two relatively small firms
with a 'boutique' image and a reputation for shrewd stock-picking:
Edinburgh-based Baillie Gifford &amp; Co and London-based Newton Investment
Management.
Hambros Bank, also chosen, is expected to specialise in managing the trust's
portfolio of gilt-edged stock.
The other appointments included two of the firms already handling parts of
the portfolio, Fleming Investment Management and Henderson Pension Fund
Management. Also chosen was Schroder Investment Management, which has been
interim manager of the funds since the sale proceeds were received in
August. The two other fund managers are Gartmore Pension Fund Managers and
Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management.

FT  27 OCT 92 / British Gas to restate results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS has agreed to restate the 1991 figures to be published in its
next set of annual accounts following discussions with the Financial
Reporting Review Panel, the UK's accounting standards watchdog.
The panel ruled that the company's decision to change its year-end from
March 31 to December 31 last year, but then publish its results for the 12
months to December 31 contravened the 1985 Companies Act.
Under section 223 (3) of the act, it should have shown the results only for
the nine months from April 1 to December 31. British Gas has agreed to amend
the comparable figures in its accounts for the current year, which will
reduce 1991 pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.47bn to Pounds 496m.
The panel has agreed to take no further action. It could have forced British
Gas to reissue the last set of accounts, which would have proved costly
since it has more than 2m shareholders.
Mr Nicholas St John, group chief financial accountant at British Gas, said
the company had publicised its decision and shown the nine-month figures in
summary accounts and a note to the full accounts.
He said use of 12-month figures had been approved by its auditors and the US
Securities and Exchange Commission but no comparable process with the panel
before publication was available in the UK.
It wanted to show 12-month figures to reflect the fact that two-thirds of
profits were generated in the first quarter of the year, reflecting the
highly seasonal demand for gas. The panel said it accepted the directors'
assurances that there was no intention to mislead and that the company acted
in good faith.
The decision potentially raises a precedent by which other companies might
argue before the panel that they had contravened accounting regulations but
were not attempting to mislead.
However, Mr Sidney Treadgold, secretary to the panel, said yesterday: 'Each
case is addressed on its merits and no precedents are being set. The panel
felt it right to record the directors' intentions but our criterion must be
conformity with the (companies') acts.'
British Gas changed the year-end as many joint ventures and subsidiaries
account for that period.

FT  27 OCT 92 / GM's revolution devours its creator: Martin Dickson analyses
the future for the world's biggest industrial company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Revolutions throughout history have had a habit of devouring their own.
Yesterday the revolution shaking up General Motors swallowed up and spat out
its chairman, Mr Robert Stempel, the man who set in motion the current
upheaval just 10 months ago.
Mr Stempel, 59, whose booming voice and tall frame disguised a gradualist,
consensus approach to decision-making, resigned after irresistible pressure
to quit from the GM board.
Over the past month its non-executive directors had come to believe that the
moderate chairman was not addressing the company's problems with sufficient
urgency, nor communicating the sheer scale of the battle facing GM to his
troops.
The result was a campaign of discreet Stempel-must-go lobbying and
far-from-discreet leaks to the press, creating confusion inside and outside
GM as to who was running the world's largest industrial company.
Mr Stempel's resignation statement yesterday spoke bitterly of 'the chaos of
the past several weeks'. The United Auto Workers' union sharply attacked the
board's 'tactics of management by rumour, newsleak and innuendo'.
The chairman's departure raises two questions: who will succeed him? And
will the changes at the top help or hinder GM's race against time as it
tries to return its loss-making North American car operations to the black?
Later this week GM is expected to report third-quarter losses of up to
Dollars 850m (Pounds 521m) because of its problems in North America, where
the company has been losing market share for more than a decade yet has
failed to cut either manufacturing capacity or bureaucracy.
Mr Stempel, who took over as chairman in August 1990, finally grasped the
nettle in December last year when he announced the first stage of a plan to
remake GM North America - the closure of 21 plants and elimination of 74,000
jobs by the mid-1990s.
However, the slow progress of the revamp led non-executive directors last
April to stage a coup. They replaced Mr Stempel as chairman of the board's
executive committee with Mr John Smale, the leader of the outside directors.
They also ousted Mr Lloyd Reuss, group president and head of North America,
replacing him with Mr Jack Smith, who was formerly in charge of
international operations and turned round GM Europe in the 1980s.
Mr Smith has speeded up the pace of change, but board members evidently felt
that the 'shock effect' of the April coup was in danger of wearing off,
without a tougher example from the chairman.
Over the past two months, in particular, there has been some
counter-revolutionary muscle-flexing from the UAW, which has staged three
local strikes over threatened job cuts, while outside parts manufacturers
have been resisting attempts by GM to cut costs of its components.
Whatever else it may do, Mr Stempel's resignation will certainly produce a
shock. He is, after all, the first chief executive of this complacent,
insular and bureaucratic business to be ousted since Mr William Crapo
Durant, the founder of the company, was forced out in 1920.
The new chairman is expected to be Mr Smale, 65, the leader of April's
non-executive coup, though he may wish only to serve on an interim basis
until a successor is found.
Mr Smale, a long-time GM non-executive director, is a former chief executive
of consumer products group Procter &amp; Gamble, and made a name as a marketing
man in the 1950s when he got the American Dental Association to support the
company's fluoride toothpaste.
A quiet, methodical man, who in a rare interview three years ago described
himself as a 'dull fellow,' Mr Smale has a reputation for preparing his
strategy in immense detail and then following it through fearlessly,
irrespective of unpopularity.
He brings to GM one vital quality which Mr Stempel and Mr Reuss clearly
lacked: the status of an outsider, though one with a reasonable
understanding of the company's business, untainted by ties with the status
quo and willing to crack heads hard to achieve his goals. Mr Smith, by
virtue of having risen on GM's international side, is also something of an
outsider.
The two are expected to announce a shake-up over the next few weeks.
It is also likely to unveil a more generous employee job buy-out programme,
designed to reduce tensions with the UAW, and name the last of the 21 plants
due for closure. And, in spite of denials, rumours also persist that one of
GM's marques, Oldsmobile, may also be eliminated.
A sharp rise in GM's share price since the start of the Stempel resignation
rumours shows that Wall Street approves of the company's tougher, more
urgent tone.
Yet the hurdles ahead remain formidable. GM's US car market share is still
slipping, and will not be easily or quickly turned around.
Mr Smale, if he indeed becomes chairman, faces extremely delicate
negotiations with the UAW over job cuts and health benefits, and his P&amp;G
experience has not prepared him for dealing with a tough, determined union.
And morale within the company is low, especially after the rumours of the
past few weeks. Denying suggestions of Oldsmobile's demise last week, the
marque's general manager summed up the mood: 'Right now you're looking at
one pissed-off cowboy'.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Kohl threatens tax rise to fund unity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUSSELDORF
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday spelt out for the first time the dramatic
increase in the costs of German unification, and threatened early tax rises
if government, opposition, employers and trade unions could not agree
rapidly on a 'solidarity pact' to help finance them.
Opening the annual congress of his Christian Democratic Union in Dusseldorf,
he confirmed that new government revenues will have to be found from 1995
onwards to finance debt servicing costs of at least DM40bn (Pounds 16bn) a
year on accumulated east German debts of DM400bn.
Even more urgently, the cost of a radical reform of the German railway
system, including the integration of services between the two halves of the
country, cannot be financed from existing resources, he added.
That is likely to mean some form of tax increase, probably a petrol tax
rise, in the course of 1993, according to senior officials.
It all added up, the grim-faced chancellor told his party faithful, to 'the
hour of truth' for a united Germany. The country could manage only if every
sector of society took part.
Mr Kohl also warned that a slowdown in the economy next year will reduce tax
revenues by DM10bn, without allowing for any increase in spending in the
east.
The Economics Ministry is forecasting growth in western Germany of only 1.0
to 1.5 per cent next year, against previous forecasts of 2.5 per cent.
However, advance indications were that the country's five main economic
institutes, in their annual report to be released today, were projecting
even slower west German growth next year, at only 0.5 per cent. One of the
five, the Ifo institute in Munich, also gave separate figures yesterday
showing a sharp fall in industrial confidence.
Mr Kohl said the central government and the 16 federal states also had to
agree urgently on a new formula for sharing the burden of an extra DM50bn to
DM60bn in spending in the east of the country, to come into effect by 1995.
Stopping short of talking openly of tax increases, he said that
'improvements in revenues are urgently necessary to cope with the financial
inheritance' of the former East Germany. In 1995 the government must take
over a debt of at least DM400bn, he said, DM250bn from the Treuhand
privatisation agency and a further DM150bn in accumulated debts of the
Communist regime, with a debt servicing cost of around DM40bn a year.
He made it clear the increased state revenue in 1995 should be directly
linked to servicing those debts, but did not say how the money should be
raised.
The threat of tax increases has angered Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister and
leader of the Christian Social Union, the coalition partner in the
government. He is furious that it will mean immediate pressure for drastic
budget savings.
Mr Waigel is due to appear at the congress tomorrow amid considerable
anxiety over what he will say. So far his only comment has been to describe
the proposed tax increase as 'about as useful as a hole in the head'.

FT  27 OCT 92 / British Steel to cut production by 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH STEEL is to cut production by up to 20 per cent in the current
quarter, underlining the disarray in the recession-hit European steel
industry.
The announcement yesterday led to a 10 per cent fall in British Steel shares
to 56p - against 125p at privatisation in 1988 - and raised fears that the
company would make further job cuts.
British Steel, already one of Europe's most efficient steel-makers, would
not say how it planned to achieve the reduction in its 'liquid steel-make',
which it blamed on a further deterioration in the demand for steel products
in recent weeks, both in the UK and export markets.
It denied a report immediately after the announcement that the reduction
would definitely lead to short-time working, but admitted job cuts could not
be ruled out.
Production in the final quarter of British Steel's fiscal year - the first
three months of 1993 - will be reviewed in the light of market conditions
prevailing at the time, the company said.
British Steel has a number of options for achieving the production cut short
of outright job reductions. It could introduce short-time working at smaller
plants, while shift patterns could be altered at the larger plants, most of
which operate on a continuing basis. This would mean that individuals would
work fewer shifts each week.
The company said in June that employment would be below 42,000 by the end of
the fiscal year, compared with 44,800 at the end of March. Following the
closure in June of the Ravenscraig plant, employment is currently 41,500.
Yesterday's announcement confirms the gloomy picture emerging from the
European steel industry, which earlier this year had begun to believe the
recession was ending as prices started rising after a steep two-year
decline.
But prices have slipped back again in recent weeks, owing partly to the
political and economic crisis in the UK, and to broader economic factors in
Europe which have dented customers' confidence. On top of that, relatively
small quantities of allegedly unfairly-subsidised eastern European imports
have further depressed prices.
British Steel is among the 15 big European Community steelmakers which
earlier this month asked the European Commission for financial aid to cover
50,000 redundancies planned over the next three to four years.
They also want 'guidelines' on production, consumption, exports and imports,
and swift action against unfair competition from outside the EC.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Gap narrows in trade dispute: EC and US closer to resolving
differences on food exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANCES of the European Community and the US resolving their bitter food
exports disputes - the key to a deal on the Uruguay Round of world trade
reforms - appeared to improve last night as the two sides narrowed their
differences.
Senior EC officials feared that the US was about to press the button on its
programme of punitive tariffs on Dollars 1bn (Pounds 625m) of EC food
exports, held in abeyance during last-ditch efforts to settle the row over
the Community's subsidised oilseeds regime.
The belief in Luxembourg was that Mr James Baker, the former US secretary of
state now running President George Bush's re-election campaign, had taken a
more central role over co-ordination of the American side of the tangled
negotiations. However, as Mr Bush's chief of staff, Mr Baker is charged with
co-ordinating all aspects of administration policy.
It is understood the US may target France in a reduced package of sanctions,
imposing tariffs on Dollars 300m worth of French products. The US 'hit list'
originally had Dollars 2bn of products on it, and the administration
indicated it would cut this to Dollars 1bn. By targeting a still smaller
amount, the US hopes to prevent a wider trade war. It is also likely to wait
at least 30 days before imposing any sanctions.
There were still hopes yesterday that Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture
commissioner, would meet Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, in New
York tomorrow, to set both sides' political seal on progress in talks on
Sunday and yesterday. Mr MacSharry, just before briefing EC agriculture
ministers on the talks in Luxembourg yesterday, said the New York meeting
was 'still up in the air'. A senior Commission official said, however, that
an aircraft was on standby to take the EC's farm trade negotiator to the US.
The Luxembourg talks, in the margins of a scheduled council of agriculture
ministers, centred on keeping the EC together behind the Commission's
negotiation stance in the face of French attempts to prevent any Gatt
settlement before the US presidential election on November 3.
France has never accepted that a Uruguay Round deal, aimed at liberalising
world trade, should place formal restraints on its subsidised cereals
exports, one of the main items in its balance of payments. Mr Jean
Pierre-Soisson, the new French agriculture minister, sought to rally support
among six of his colleagues at a dinner in Paris on Sunday night, before
yesterday's council meeting in Luxembourg.
Mr Ignaz Kiechle, the German farm minister, insisted after the Paris meeting
that 'France is not isolated' over cereals exports. His government in Bonn
says a Uruguay Round conclusion is a top priority to get Europe's economies
moving again.
Technically, any deal on an overall Uruguay Round package cannot be vetoed
by France, since it is subject to the EC's weighted majority voting system.
France would not be called on to vote, however, until an EC-US deal was
reached - and the figures being examined by Brussels and Washington
negotiators are not far from Paris's informal position on cereals exports.

FT  27 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Lucas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For Lucas to lose one potential chief executive may be regarded as a
misfortune; to lose two looks like carelessness. There may well be good
reasons why the Lucas board decided not to appoint David Hankinson chief
executive and why it subsequently changed its mind about appointing Tony
Edwards; both may equally have good reasons for leaving the company. But
given that Lucas has troubles enough already - paying an uncovered dividend
and operating in very difficult markets - news of boardroom problems is the
last thing it needs.
The generous gloss on events might be that the directors, having made a
mistake, had the courage to admit it. Less generously, it is difficult to
have confidence in the judgment of a board which cannot even decide
correctly on its own composition. Lucas has been criticised for reacting to
the recession too late. The company's best response to the latest trauma
must be to implement its restructuring plans quickly. It would also help if
its optimistic view of future earnings proved well founded.

FT  27 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Skandia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Skandia's decision to scale back all its international reinsurance
operations rather than accept a firm cash offer may leave the market
thoroughly confused. Walking away from a partial flotation of the US
business last month was curious enough - although the Dollars 18 a share
offered by institutional investors was arguably a little mean. Last week's
trade bid, on the other hand - which Skandia rejected - was Dollars 2 a
share higher and would have netted Dollars 500m to relieve its debt burden.
This is surely a consideration for a company which makes extensive use of
commercial paper and recently had its credit rating cut.
Perhaps Skandia simply wanted to avoid the embarrassment of booking a loss
on the disposal. The broader question is whether a much-reduced Skandia can
make sustainable profits in a volatile, commodity business like reinsurance.
By specialising in casualty business it may be able to carve a niche. But
like Mercantile &amp; General, Prudential's reinsurance subsidiary which was cut
down to size this month, lower premium income will leave Skandia more
heavily geared to losses on the tail of reinsurance business already
written.
The withdrawal of capital by the likes of Skandia and Prudential is hardly
likely to bring about a hardening of rates. Even giants of the industry such
as Munich Re and Swiss Re have less than 10 per cent of the market each: for
every krona or pound of capital taken out, there is a D-Mark or Swiss franc
waiting to come in. Besides, the market is shrinking as direct insurers opt
to self-insure. The big players will, no doubt, use the latest round of
hurricane damage as an excuse to push for higher rates. Whether the market
or the regulators allow this to happen is less certain.

FT  27 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Storehouse
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hats off to Storehouse for some pretty impressive dealing. To get Pounds 78m
for a problem-child like Habitat, which the Storehouse management does not
have time to fix, must be satisfying. Finding someone to buy the
surplus-to-requirements Richards chain for an equally full Pounds 30m is all
the more so. Of course both Sears, the proud new owners of Richards, and the
Stichting Ingka Foundation, which has bought Habitat, have reasons for their
purchases. Sears can argue that Richards fills a gap in its coverage of the
womenswear market, while the SIF wants to develop a furniture brand to
complement its Ikea stores.
Both will have to work hard to justify the price they have paid, but SIF has
the more difficult task. True, the foundation is not publicly quoted and so
perhaps can afford to take a relaxed view, but sorting out Habitat's
troubles is a rather different proposition from that of exporting the
successful Ikea idea. With much apparently expected of the current Habitat
management, they will have to come up with better ideas than the failed move
into edge-of-town sheds.
Storehouse is left with some cash, and two businesses which it argues fit
logically together. Both BhS and Mothercare sell to families with young
children and aim to buy on advantageous terms because of the group's size.
Storehouse must make those backstage savings work if it is to avoid the
notion that once Mothercare has been sorted out it should go the way of
Habitat and Richards.

FT  27 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: A question of Trust
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To the outsider at least yesterday's Pounds 9.5m out-of-court settlement
between Drayton Consolidated Trust and Invesco MIM is highly unsatisfactory.
Obviously if this were another Guinness or Blue Arrow - which it is plainly
not - the Serious Fraud Office would have been on the job by now. It is not
every day, though, that a fund management group agrees to hand back to its
client the equivalent of 10 years' hard earned fees, as well as consciously
paying Pounds 3m over the odds to purchase two of its unquoted investments.
The lack of transparency may not be important for the narrow self interest
of long-suffering Drayton shareholders. It would be reassuring to know the
assumptions on which the payments have been calculated, but no doubt County
and Cazenove have extracted the best terms in the circumstances. What is
perplexing in a wider context, though, is the nature of the problem. It is
obviously more than lousy stock picking, since there are plenty of other
red-faced investment managers which have seen the asset values of their
unquoted portfolios plunge 50-60 per cent over the last five years. Judging
by yesterday's statement, however - which refers to all the circumstances of
Invesco MIM's management of Drayton Consolidated - there is more to it than
just the disastrous episode of the investment in the Scottish confectionery
manufacturer Alma. Shareholders in both camps might like to suck it and see.
Perhaps the real trouble is that the City does not wish to hold up a mirror
to Invesco MIM. There is no suggestion of anything illegal - but by all
accounts full disclosure of what happened at Drayton Consolidated would
raise delicate issues such as multiple directorships, cross-holdings, and
co-investing by employees. There has been a lot of talk about corporate
governance lately; the City has some catching up to do.

course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN H GILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Britain's prime minister need not risk his government's neck over the
Maastricht treaty in order to deal with his Euro-rebels ('Tory Euro-rebels
renew defiance over Maastricht', October 26) because he can achieve his ends
in a much less dangerous manner.
He should make a virtue out of the fact that parliament, and in particular
his own party, much more accurately reflects the doubts of its electorate
than does the legislature of virtually every other Community member state.
He should propose a free vote not only on next week's 'paving debate' but
also on the line-by-line consideration of the Maastricht bill. (This, of
course, has the additional benefit of outflanking Labour's position.)
In this way, he can give a powerful and popular impetus to the UK presidency
by focusing (as he has already intimated) on the 'democratic deficit' and
the absolutely critical need to address the concerns of the citizens of
Europe.

Heath Insured, the yacht his company is sponsoring in Chay Blyth's British

the first leg of the race, in third place. So Mackenzie-Green ditched the
telegram he had planned in favour of some doggerel for the skipper Adrian
Donovan.
I thought I'd explained that the worst
You could do on leg one was come first.
And I gave you my word
If you only came third
That I'd want Chay's full fee reimbursed]
Perhaps if you master the knack
Of threatening the crew with the sack
Then your megalomania
On the way to Tasmania
Will give them th'incentive they lack.
There then follows, from the comfort of BR, another verse of hearty
congratulations. He had penned it all by Woking.

When it comes to making investing in stocks and shares sound fun, Jim
Slater, the former boss of the failed Slater Walker financial conglomerate,
is not in the same league as America's Warren Buffett. Even so, his new
investment handbook, The Zulu Principle, contains some useful tips.
Although Slater is no longer a corporate predator, he still thinks like one.
He worries, for example, when a company's finance director doesn't have a
reasonable shareholding in the company he works for, and the chapter on
creative accounting is worth reading if only because Slater Walker used to
be a prime exponent of the art before it went under.
As for the odd name of his new tome, Slater admits it was his wife's idea.
She had read a four-page article on Zulus in the Readers Digest. 'From that
moment on she knew more than I did about Zulus,' says Slater, who believes
that the same principle of building up specialist knowledge is the key to
investment success.

If Bill Clinton makes it to Pennsylvania Avenue, the messages will no doubt

Now might not be a good time to start reading Tolstoy, since there is only
one day to go before the world ends.
'Jesus will come in the feast of trumpet' on October 28 1992 according to an
advert in USA Today International, paid for by the COC Mission from South
Korea.
The Mission cites several biblical quotations as authority, notably the
reference to the 'strengthening of the EC as economic giant' apparently to
be found in Daniel chapter 2, verses 40-43.
Turning to the King James' version, one finds no reference to Jacques
Delors. Instead, the passage begins 'And the fourth kingdom shall be strong
as iron; forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things; and
as iron breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.' The verse
is about as clear as an EC directive.
Never mind nit-picking. You will want to know how to prepare for the end of
the world. 'Make sure the grace of blood of the cross' says the Mission
(grammar will presumably go out of fashion after Armageddon) and 'give up
your fleshly life'. But most important, the Mission commands 'Do not receive
the mark 666, bar code on the forehead or right hand]' Sounds tricky, but
most of us might just about manage it.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Observer: Replacing homo Lucas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It used to be said in the City there were two types of men; homo sapiens and
homo Lucas.
Lucas Industries' reputation for inbred management has once again reared its
head with the departure of Tony Edwards, who was to have taken over from Sir
Anthony Gill as chief executive at the end of the year.
In 1989 Lucas brought in two senior managers from the outside; David
Hankinson as finance director and Tony Edwards as head of the aerospace
division. Shortly, both will have gone.
The 62-year-old Sir Anthony is chairman and chief executive, and has
effectively been acting as finance director while a replacement for
Hankinson was found. In the year in which he would normally have been
expected to retire he has also taken on an extra non-executive directorship,
at Tarmac.
Quite why the board changed its view about the flamboyant Edwards is not
clear - though the turn of events may give some quiet satisfaction to
Hankinson. Some analysts believe he did not think Edwards was yet ready for
the top job, and he left a month after Edwards was confirmed as Sir
Anthony's heir apparent.
How have the non-executive directors acquitted themselves in all this? Sir
Anthony has lined up a formidable array - several through headhunters rather
than anything smacking of the old boy network. Six out of ten board members
are independent, with a depth and variety of experience ranging from Sir
Colin Southgate to senior Credit Lyonnais banker Philippe Souviron.
It looks like an ideal Cadbury prescription - but for all that the
management succession is less than ideal.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Letter: The myth that only large airlines can survive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD BRANSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his gloom at the prospects for independent airlines George Williams
(Personal View, October 20) comes dangerously close to swallowing the myth
that only the largest airlines can survive - a triple fallacy.
First, smaller airlines are more innovative, free of the large airline
tradition of eradicating consumer choice. For example, Virgin Atlantic has
pioneered an unrivalled range of popular developments, including seat-back
videos for every passenger, limousines, masseuses, lounges on board and a
new class of travel for full-fare Economy passengers.
Second, smaller airlines deliver a better product. This is the service
industry par excellence. In choosing airlines, passengers attach great
importance to the care, courtesy, enthusiasm, friendliness, respect and
efficiency with which the airline's people treat them, on board and on the
ground. Large airlines' conspicuous lack of these qualities led me to set up
Virgin Atlantic Airways in the first place. Now our high service standards
enable us to compete successfully with six out of the world's 10 largest
airlines.
That success is absolutely dependent upon our staff understanding the
importance of their jobs and recognising their own personal contribution.
Personal commitment is important to passengers, but rarely found in large
airlines.
Third, smaller airlines are more efficient. For example, the largest airline
has admitted costs at least 25 per cent above those of its smaller
competitors, contributing to inflation by wasting several million pounds a
day of passengers' money.
So smaller airlines suffer no lack of advantages - but they do lack the
chance to use them. A barricade of obstacles to airline competition is still
tolerated by governments. Government-imposed exile to Gatwick helped kill
off many independent British airlines. That obstacle at least has gone, but
now there is another: historical precedence in the allocation of vital
airport take-off and landing slots.
There could not be a more anti-competitive measure, but it is still
tolerated by governments and may even be reaffirmed in the EC under the
British presidency.
Get rid of these needless obstacles to competition; crack down hard on
predation before it can damage smaller airlines; and ban state subsidies to
airlines. Then leave smaller airlines to compete. They can and they will, to
the great benefit of consumers.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Letter: Prudence should continue to have merit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEREMY C KILNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Having spent nearly 10 years as chairman of the financial committee of
a successful local authority, perhaps I could comment on the suggestion that
the taxpayer should compensate the local authorities which lost money with
the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The higher the return on
money lent, in theory and in practice, the higher the risk; and those
placing the money should have been made aware of that. The particular
circumstances of the largest loser - the Western Isles - gives cause for
concern.
I see no reason why those of us who are prudent should always be expected to
bail out the foolish - if we did, prudence would have no merit.

</HEADLINE>

   From Mr PHILIP MICKELBOROUGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Simmonds (Letters, October 24) may or may not be justified in
unfavourably comparing a British with a Belgian bank, merely because the
latter offered him 6 per cent more sterling for BFr50,000 in the UK.
He should also have changed Pounds 1,000 into BFr at both banks in Belgium,
and compared the ratio offered there with that in the UK. Then he could have
decided whether the disparity reflected British banking greed, or the
different values of foreign currency to domestic and foreign banks.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Letter: Losses not a pointer to pit viability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW GLYN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You reported ('TUC challenges claim of losses at 10 pits', October 21)
British Coal's statement that the 10 pits due for closure after the 90-day
consultation period were making losses of Pounds 31m 'in the financial year
since April' and that this debarred them from having 'a role to play under
any economic scenario'. Two points should be made about this figure. First,
there is a strong seasonal element (holidays etc). In the first quarter of
1991-92 pits in the Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire coalfields recorded only
10 per cent of their profit ('operating cash flow') for the year; and in the
first two quarters only 22 per cent. Partial results for an (unspecified)
early part of the financial year are therefore not a reliable indicator of
the year's results.
Second, even if the pits were on the road to annual losses, this would not
be a reliable guide to future prospects given variability in mining
conditions. The experience of all 50 pits over the past five years reveals
36 instances of losses in one year being followed by profits in the next,
and this has already happened in five of the 50 threatened pits.
Mr Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, repeated in the House of
Commons on October 21 that what distinguished the 10 was that 'they are
losing money now'. Even if this were true over the past few months for each
and every one of them (which British Coal has refused to reveal), it would
be a quite unreliable guide to their future financial prospects, let alone
their potential economic contribution. The government and British Coal have
given absolutely no justification for separating out the 10 and excluding
the 9m tonnes they produce and the 7,000 miners who work in them from what
is supposed to be a thoroughgoing review of energy policy and the position
of UK coal.

FT  27 OCT 92 / A bitter pill to swallow: Price constraints threaten to
undermine the sales and earnings of leading drugs companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of a victory for Governor Bill Clinton in the US presidential
election has hit US pharmaceuticals stocks. Since the Democratic convention
in July, the shares which were the market's favourites last year have fallen
by more than 10 per cent on average.
The sharp decline has been prompted by fears that a Clinton administration
might introduce controls on drug prices, following the lead of other
countries. Ministries of health in nearly all the largest markets are
planning measures to slow the growth of drugs spending through price cuts or
freezes.
Such pressure threatens to undermine sales and earnings growth, leading
eventually to a restructuring of the world's pharmaceuticals industry.
In August, for the first time, Germany's Krankenkassen - the health
insurance organisations which provide cover for everyone in work - slashed
the amount they were willing to pay for drugs, cutting prices on average by
5 per cent. The reductions, followed by a two-year price freeze, are part of
a package that observers believe could slice drugs groups' profits in
Germany, the world's third-largest market for pharmaceuticals, by a quarter.
In Italy, the world's fourth-largest market, the treasury - which sets drugs
prices - has refused to allow any further increases.
Meanwhile, in Japan, the world's second-largest market, the ministry of
health has cut drugs prices by 8 per cent on average this year. The prices
of some medicines have been reduced nine times in the past 14 years.
But it is in the US, the world's biggest market for pharmaceuticals and one
of the last, with Denmark, in which drug prices are not set by the
government, where the implications of price curbs could be most serious.
Companies are already voluntarily limiting their prices in the hope of
avoiding legislation, but their efforts may be too late to prevent it.
The reason for worldwide pressure on prices is that healthcare budgets in
almost every developed country are out of control. A combination of rising
demand for care from ageing populations and increasingly expensive medical
technology has sent health spending spiralling.
Germany spent about 9 per cent of gross national product on healthcare in
1989 compared with 6 per cent in 1970. Last month, the German health
ministry warned that the Krankenkassen could register a deficit in western
Germany alone of DM10bn (Pounds 4bn) this year because the cost of
healthcare would outstrip contributions.
In the US, healthcare expenditure has risen from 7 per cent of GNP in 1970
to 12 per cent in 1990. Over the same period the proportion of the costs met
by federal and state authorities has increased from 22 per cent to 41 per
cent. The rest is paid by individuals and private health insurers.
Governments, faced with such rising healthcare expenditure, have preferred
to target the prices and volumes of drugs prescribed rather than trim
spending on politically sensitive areas such as hospitals and doctors.
The dilemma is particularly acute in the US where American congressmen
threatened the industry with legislation following the publication in August
of a report by the US General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress. The report showed that the price of some drugs (see accompanying
chart) had increased by more than 200 per cent over the past six years,
compared with an overall rise in the consumer price index of 26.2 per cent.
Congressman Pete Stark, Californian Democrat and chairman of the House Ways
and Means health subcommittee, said the report demonstrated there was no
justification for the steep price increases in prescription drugs. He blamed
'corporate greed'.
'The drugs companies are using their monopoly status to make a killing on
very sick people,' he said after the report's publication.
Mr Paul Freiman, chairman of the US Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Association, says the war of words over prices is partly the reason why
relations between the government and the American pharmaceuticals sector is
at its lowest point for 30 years.
The response from global drugs groups has been defensive. They argue that,
by setting their sights on prices, governments are aiming at the wrong
target.
'Expanding healthcare budgets are not a drug-driven phenomenon. In the UK,
the proportion of health expenditure represented by drugs has only risen
from 9 per cent in 1960 to 10 per cent in 1990,' says Mr Jim Attridge,
international business operations manager at ICI's pharmaceuticals division.
'That isn't much of an increase.'
Expenditure on drugs accounted for 14 per cent of total US healthcare costs
in 1960, according to Mr Peter Lauper, head of pharma-economics at
Ciba-Geigy in Switzerland. By last year the proportion was down to 7 per
cent, although overall spending on drugs was up. Over the same period, much
of the rise in healthcare spending was generated by the cost of running
hospitals and doctors' surgeries. Mr Lauper says expenditure on hospital
staff and other costs represented 34 per cent of healthcare spending in the
US in 1960, and had reached 45 per cent in 1990.
Nevertheless, drugs companies admit their case is not helped by their
traditionally high profit margins and returns on capital. At Glaxo,
worldwide pre-tax profit margins were 31.4 per cent last year, while those
of SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare and consumer products
company, were 25.6 per cent. Merck, the US giant and the world's largest
drugs group, had margins last year of 36.8 per cent.
During the fatter years of the late 1980s, such pre-tax margins attracted
little attention. But while other industries' earnings have plunged during
the current recession, those of the pharmaceuticals groups have been
conspicuous by their strength.
The industry defends its profits by arguing it needs to invest in research
and development. American groups, for example, now spend about Dollars 11bn
a year researching and bringing new drugs to market, compared with Dollars
4.5bn five years ago.
Many diseases still have no cure, ranging from Aids to Alzheimer's. Given
adequate resources, the industry claims, it can find them. More than 90 per
cent of medicine discoveries are developed by the drugs industry, according
to the US pharmaceutical manufacturers association. American companies
discovered 47 of the top 97-selling drugs launched between 1975 and 1889.
Countries with lower prices and profit margins, such as France, do not
develop best-selling medicines because they do not earn enough to plough
into R&amp;D, the US industry alleges.
One snag with this argument is that the industry's high margins are
calculated after the costs of R&amp;D have been deducted. In other words, the
substantial profits achieved by most of the industry are banked after
companies have met their R&amp;D expenses. If they did not spend as much on R&amp;D,
their profits would be greater.
American politicians have so far been unimpressed by voluntary undertakings
by the industry to control its prices. Merck, Upjohn, Hoechst-Roussel,
Bristol Myers Squibb, ICI and Pfizer have all introduced measures holding
down some or all of their prices. So far, companies supplying a third of the
US market have promised to keep price rises in line with the consumer price
index, according to the industry association.
In spite of such undertakings, global pressure on pricing is unlikely to
disappear. The ensuing structural change, according to Mr Viren Mehta,
partner at Mehta and Isalay, the New-York healthcare investment group, is
producing 'a bifurcation of the industry between the haves and the
have-nots'.
The haves, according to Mr Mehta, are those companies with development
departments which have the expertise and scale necessary to bring drugs to
market quickly in the US, Europe and Japan. They also have strong marketing
skills to exploit the new medicines to the full. He describes them as M&amp;D -
marketing and development - groups. Among them, he lists Merck and Pfizer of
the US, and Glaxo of the UK.
The have-nots are those groups with few new products and expiring patents.
These weaker groups, which used to generate profit growth through price
increases, have been particularly hard hit by the recent pricing
constraints.
In the third quarter of this year, for example, the US group Bristol Myers
Squibb reported pre-tax profits growth of 5 per cent, while Upjohn's
increase was only 1.4 per cent. Eli Lilly recorded a loss of Dollars 268.5m
after restructuring charges. In contrast, Merck, one of the 'haves',
increased earnings by 17 per cent.
The polarisation of the industry could be followed by consolidation among
the have-nots. Mr Martyn Postle, a pharmaceuticals industry consultant at
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the management consultancy group, says: 'In 1989 the top
25 companies had about 50 per cent of world pharmaceuticals sales. By the
end of the decade the top 15 groups will control half of the market.'
Economies of scale among the leading M&amp;D groups would allow them to reduce
the proportion of turnover spent on marketing and R&amp;D. Mr Paul Krikler,
industry analyst at Goldman Sachs, the stockbroker, says leading companies
could reduce their sales and general administration costs to about 25 per
cent of turnover - Glaxo currently spends about 40 per cent of turnover on
sales and administration.
Further costs could be saved through the rationalisation of pharmaceuticals
manufacturing, an area of significant over-capacity. Drugs groups have
duplicated manufacturing plants, particularly in European countries, where
they have used the promise of local investment to negotiate higher drugs
prices from governments. Glaxo has manufacturing capacity in 42 sites in 31
countries.
The cost-cutting has already started. Last week, Eli Lilly said it was
spending Dollars 519.6m on restructuring its operations, including
manufacturing. Syntex, a US group, also announced a restructuring plan
during the same week.
Through such cost-containment, some of the larger groups may become stronger
global competitors. But for the weaker companies, the trend towards
government-imposed price constraints in the world's main markets threatens
their survival.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Two principles for Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR A COUNTRY more than 3,000 years old, four years and eight months is a
very short time. In angrily dismissing the modest plans of Mr Chris Patten,
Hong Kong's governor, for political reform and threatening to reverse them
when it regains sovereignty over the territory on July 1 1997, China has
signalled that it is quite prepared to wait him out. For Beijing, this is
merely the last irritating chapter in its attempts to wrest the best harbour
on its coast back from duplicitous Britain.
For Mr Patten, however, failure by China to respond in any way to his
proposals would be damaging, despite his bold challenge to Beijing to come
up with better ones. Hong Kong people will increasingly feel that the
broadening of the democratic base is pointless if, instead of being on the
'through train' to Chinese rule which negotiators have been attempting to
create, they seem to be accelerating straight into a set of buffers.
China's position may be bluster. Mr Patten will have expected a hostile
response in Beijing - though perhaps not the degree of vilification whipped
up by the Chinese press - but his gamble must remain that China will feel
bound either to negotiate or to acquiesce.
Popular support
The best reason for hope that it will eventually respond is that it is in
China's political and economic interests to do so. By overtly seeking - and
apparently winning - broad popular support in Hong Kong, Mr Patten has
touched Beijing on a very raw nerve. The integration of the Hong Kong
economy with that of the neighbouring regions of China should have
progressed still further by 1997.
The Communist party wants the region to be the next industrialising tiger
while remaining under its control, already a difficult balancing act. The
last thing Beijing wants is militant opposition among the best-off 6m people
at the heart of it. The sacrifices involved in precipitate action by Beijing
would be far greater than at Tiananmen Square in 1989.
Popular support is Mr Patten's strongest weapon - which makes it all the
more important that he do everything he can to carry all quarters of Hong
Kong society with him. Support from ordinary Hong Kong people is important
in order to keep the goad in China's back. Backing from the business
community, which appeared to be showing the first signs of anxiety
yesterday, is equally important. Many pillars of that community have
favoured a softly, softly approach to China, feeling that this best
safeguarded their future. Mr Patten's view is that prosperity would be best
protected by his proposed changes. He will have to convince them that he is
right.
Airport row
Two principles are involved in planning Hong Kong's future: first, that its
citizens should be as free as possible; and second, that prosperity should
be assured. Mr Patten is right to bind them together, but some in Hong Kong
worry that the first will get in the way of the second.
The main symbol of future prosperity for many local businessmen is Hong
Kong's Pounds 13bn airport project. It, too, has become embroiled in the
current political row. China's reaction to Mr Patten's proposals clouds the
prospects for a quick agreement on airport financing, and that must mean
that the project's future is in doubt.
This would not, however, be the disaster that people in the business
community are likely to paint it. Hong Kong already has a good - if crowded
 -airport, and others are being built nearby. Hong Kong does not need a new
airport at any price.
Britain's change of style in dealing with China comes very late. It may be
seen by history as the last, possibly futile, gesture in a botched
withdrawal which has done little justice to the citizens of one of the most
successful parts of Britain's former empire. But Mr Patten's attempt to
boost democratic choice within the framework of Britain's agreement with
China deserves support. The effort, however late and limited, is worthwhile.
The fact is that it is in China's interest that Hong Kong people should be
confident about the future and have a new airport. Mr Patten has not acted
unilaterally. He has made proposals. Beijing should discuss them with him
instead of abusing him.

FT  27 OCT 92 / The Tories' hung party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since U-turns are so much in fashion, here is one of mine. It no longer
appears to me to be 'almost certain', as I have been saying recently, that
Mr John Major will survive as prime minister for another four years. This is
not a turn very far around the U. There is no suggestion that Mr Major is
definitely, or even probably, for the chop. In fact the odds are still in
favour of him keeping his job. It is just that there seems no end to the
series of misfortunes that fate has decided to inflict upon his premiership.
It has therefore become prudent to visualise scenes in which he steps down.
One such was conjured up by a leading Eurosceptic in a hotel foyer during
the recent Conservative party conference in Brighton. The conversation had
passed beyond the technicalities of a formal challenge, of the kind that
felled Lady Thatcher. Nothing of the sort seemed likely to happen. Then Mr E
Sceptic said 'what about this?' whereupon he put his arm around my shoulders
and, adopting the manner and voice of Sir Marcus Fox, proclaimed: 'Prime
minister, the members want you to spend more time with your family . . .'
The obvious reply was, 'but if that happened you would get an even more
Europhile prime minister than Mr Major, since the candidates are . . .', to
which Mr Sceptic replied: 'If we must choose from three peas in a pod, let
us at least have a competent pea.'
This exchange was quickly forgotten, but over the past few days it has
returned to haunt me. The spectres began to reassemble as Sir Marcus,
chairman of the backbenchers' 1922 committee, scuppered the plan to close 31
coal pits. Then last Thursday a gang of Europhobes ambushed a regular
meeting of the '22, much in the same manner as militant members of the far
left once hijacked Labour party and trade union assemblies. The executive of
the committee emerged to say that Mr Major's plan to reopen parliamentary
debate on the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty was premature.
That should have been brushed aside as an opening skirmish in a long
drawn-out parliamentary battle. After all, it is now clear that what was
elected on April 9 was not a Conservative government with a majority of 21,
but a hung parliament in which the two parties that most loathe one another,
the Thatcherites and the Majorites, stand beneath the Tory flag. The
difficulty is that the government has no idea of how to operate in a hung
parliament; the notion that one exists is so abhorrent to Conservatives that
they will find it hard to accept my half-joking suggestion that it does.
After the '22 spoke, Number 10 Downing Street decided to reassert the
principle of a parliamentary majority. On Saturday the prime minister's
office allowed (encouraged?) newspapers to report that if the government
loses the vote on the Maastricht debate due on November 4 a general election
will follow. The Labour party would be well placed to win it. This threat
was unwisely timed, as Mr Major himself seemed to acknowledge in a radio
interview on Sunday and the party chairman, Sir Norman Fowler, appeared to
be shouting out loud yesterday. No sane government ties a hand-grenade round
its waist and threatens to pull the pin if it does not get its way. For Mr
Major and his colleagues to do so is a clumsy confidence trick.
So grave have matters become that the Labour party has been roused from its
post-electoral slumber. It seems ready to compromise on its commitment to
the Maastricht treaty in the hope of damaging the prime minister. The time
is not right, its shadow ministers are saying; the Danes have not yet spoken
 -anyhow the upcoming vote is a matter of confidence in the government, of
which the opposition naturally has none. If there are votes in sophistry,
Labour will romp home next time.
The likely outcome, of course, is that the government whips and business
managers will find a way out, as they did over coal last week. But it is
trickier now. A motion that stresses confidence in the government will
attract a negative vote from Labour and the Liberal Democrats but should
minimise the number of Maastricht rebels. A motion that stresses the merits
of the treaty makes it harder for Labour to vote against, but will maximise
the Thatcherite party's vote. A soft motion - to adjourn the house, say -
exposes the government's weakness. These equations contain too many unknowns
to make prediction easy.
Tradition has it that governments get their way in the end. Tradition is
probably right. If so, Parliament will - eventually - ratify Maastricht, in
which case the prime minister's fortunes may begin to take a turn for the
better. There is, however, a chance that it will not - that the whole
endeavour will be cast aside on Wednesday week, or before the winter is out.
If that unlikely accident happens, it will be hard to say what point there
is in Mr Major carrying on.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Britain and Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE increasingly tense run-up to next week's debate in the House of
Commons, the future of the Maastricht treaty is starting to become confused
with the survival of Mr John Major, or even with the future of his
government. This is to miss the main point: the Maastricht treaty must be
ratified by Parliament because it is in the interests of Britain that it
should be ratified.
It is obvious that this treaty is not perfect; and it is easy to cavil at
particular ingredients. But the whole menu is a broadly based programme of
further integration in a wide range of policy fields, which represents the
best political compromise the 12 governments were able to reach at their
Maastricht summit 10 months ago.
Some parts of the treaty now look rather over-ambitious; others may seem
over-cautious or plain inadequate. Last month's currency crisis in the
exchange rate mechanism has cast a cloud over the feasibility of the
programme for Economic and Monetary Union; it now seems uncertain when or if
weaker member states will be in a position to join in moves towards monetary
union, and unlikely that even the strong currencies can reach monetary union
before the end of the decade. Conversely, it is clear that the treaty
provisions for developing a common foreign and security policy rest much
more on rhetoric than substance; this political lacuna has been underlined
in practice by the meagreness of the European response to the Yugoslav
crisis.
Coherent action
But the Community needs to develop. The logic of the single market dictates
closer economic integration; the geopolitics of Europe requires effective,
coherent action from the western part of the continent. Agreeing effective
mechanisms in response to these needs is a complex matter involving much
compromise. Maastricht was just such a compromise: not a series of final
solutions, but an inescapable agenda.
No one can pretend that the treaty as a document is simple, lucid or
elegant; some people pretend that it is unintelligible. But its general
objectives are clear, large and unmistakable: to carry the process of
European integration a large stride forward, without unnecessary
centralisation of powers, and to extend it on a broad front into new fields
such as foreign policy, perhaps defence one day, justice, immigration and
social welfare. On immigration, for example, member states naturally wish to
preserve a high degree of autonomy, but only the foolish pretend that
national responses alone can deal with the scale of potential migratory
pressures bearing down on the Community from all sides. Maastricht or no
Maastricht, common action is needed.
Common interests
This extension of the process of European integration does not derive from
some dogmatic and abstract federalist ambition. It is in Britain's interests
to take part in the process of European integration, because Britain and its
European partners have increasingly broad interests in common, and share
more and more problems which they can better tackle together.
The British government has resisted any binding commitment to take part in a
single currency, and the British political establishment may not think in
Community terms as instinctively as some of its continental counterparts;
but the central reality is that Britain is a European country with European
interests and European problems, and it needs European policies which can be
developed with its European partners.
That is the function of the European Community: to enable the member
governments jointly to develop common policies. The most misconceived and
misleading ingredient in the Maastricht treaty, was the attempt to pretend
that Emu would be an automatic mechanism leading unstoppably to a single
currency. Nothing in the Community has ever been or can ever be that
automatic; this is a Community of sovereign governments which are
permanently engaged in negotiation and decision-making. And in such a
Community, Britain has everything to gain; the only thing it need fear is
that it may mistakenly exclude itself, by retreating to some anachronistic
isolation.
This was the platform on which all three political parties fought the
general election in April. Now they must deliver.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Arts: Showtime at Aldeburgh with Britten and Weill - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aldeburgh's autumn festival is a much more concentrated affair than its big
summer sister, an extended weekend of concerts focused upon Britten and his
musical relationship with just one other composer. The chosen partner this
year was Kurt Weill: four programmes provided comparisons of their
orchestral, vocal and instrumental works - the Sinfonia da Requiem set
against Weill's Violin Concerto and Second Symphony, Weill's early string
quartet paired with Britten's First, and so on as well as concert
performances of Brecht and Weill's Threepenny Opera and Happy End.
The two composers met just once, in Maine in August 1940, when Britten was
at work with Auden on their ballad opera Paul Bunyan and Weill was
completing the score of what would be his first Broadway success, Lady in
the Dark. Coincidentally it was the time when their styles reached their
closest approach, not through any shared European background (though early
Britten and European Weill have much more in common than it might seem at
first hearing) or their political radicalism, but because of the effect of
the American musical on their music.
For Britten it was to be only a passing phase (like the spoiled attempt to
study with Berg, another tantalising might-have-been), for Weill it had
already become the only way forward.
Saturday evening's concert at the Maltings offered the most direct
opportunities for comparison. Nine numbers from Weill's Knickerbocker
Holiday were followed by a selection from Paul Bunyan, and Britten's cabaret
songs were mingled with extracts from Johnny Johnson and Lady in the Dark.
It was a fascinating piece of programming, full of charming juxtapositions,
and wonderful to hear again the music of Bunyan; the Prologue in particular
belongs among Britten's most magical creations, a source he was to plunder
on several occasions in his subsequent operas.
Knickerbocker Holiday may not be so consistently memorable, the
extraordinary 'September Song' excepted; it's easy to see why, though, its
thinly disguised parable on the dangers to New Deal liberalism fell foul of
the conservative lobby. The shards from 'Johnny Johnson', the first of his
New York works, woven into the second half seemed instantly fresher and more
effective. Only the orchestral dimension was missing. The show songs were
given with an accompaniment of two pianos and percussion, inevitably ironing
out the differences between Britten's relatively 'straight' scoring and
Weill's more idiomatic Broadway sound.
The BBC Singers conducted by Simon Joly were the mainstay of the programme,
moving between styles with great aplomb and intelligence. The soloists were
Angeline Reaux, totally winning in Britten's 'O Tell me the truth about
love' and 'Stop all the Clocks' and HK Gruber. Gruber was a curious choice;
however admirable he is as a baritone/speaker in his own music and other
pieces written for him, his thick Austrian tones seemed out of place here -
almost plausible in Knickerbocker Holiday (set among the Dutch colonists of
New Amsterdam in the 17th century) but quite wrong for the ballads of Bunyan
and not nimble enough for the show songs.
A small cavil, though, in what was a thoroughly entertaining and revealing
evening.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Arts: Today's Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is surprisingly little opera on television these days, considering how
popular it is supposed to have become in the last few years. (I suspect too
much significance has been attributed to that single snatch of 'Turandot'
used in the World Cup sig tune, yet opera surely is more popular). But today
brings the real thing: Otello (7.25 BBC2), live from Covent Garden with
Domingo in the title role, Kiri Te Kanawa as Desdemona, and Sergei Leiferkus
making his debut in the role of Iago. The occasion, sponsored by Boeing, is
particularly special since it marks the 80th birthday of Sir Georg Solti who
conducts at the Royal Opera House in the presence of the Prince and Princess
of Wales. The work is sung in Italian with English subtitles. In the
interval (about 8.40) Jeremy Isaacs, director of the Opera House, talks to
Solti about his career.
C4's arts magazine Without Walls (9.00) ends its sequence about sexuality
with Howard Schuman examining claims that DH Lawrence was a homosexual. The
second half is devoted to 1961: the year of the E-type Jaguar. Omnibus
(10.25 BBC1) provides a profile of artist Avigdor Arikha whose work has
progressed from abstract to figurative.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Arts: A powerful, primitive vision - William Packer admires
the work of Alfred Wallis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fifty years ago the Cornish painter Alfred Wallis died a pauper forgotten by
the community of artists which had patronised him and neglected as a serious
painter. Now his work is much in demand, and the anniversary of his death is
being celebrated by exhibitions in St Ives, Exeter and London and by a
revised edition of the biography by Sven Berlin, long out of print, Alfred
Wallis: Primitive (Redcliffe Press: paperback: Pounds 9.99).
It is a sad story which Berlin told with passion and anger shortly after his
hero's death. Berlin had worked in Cornwall as a young man before the second
world war and made use of his intimate acquaintance with the farming and
fishing communities of West Penwith to gather up the stories and
circumstances of Wallis's long, cantankerous and difficult life. In the
preface to the first edition in 1943, he wrote: 'Some will say, why trouble?
The paintings speak for themselves. True: they do. There is already too much
rubbish written on art. That is why I wish to talk mainly about the man.'
His memoir is thus an invaluable, irreplaceable account.
Now, almost half a century later, Berlin's anger has faded. However, in the
preface to his new edition, he says: 'To think back is often painful. A
friend told me he recently went into a gallery in Mayfair and asked the
price of the Alfred Wallis painting in the window. Pounds 8,900, was the
reply: we have had several. They sell as soon as they come in] He's very
popular . . .'
This simply confirms Wallis's reputation as an artist and the underlying
seriousness of his work. However, the difficulty in assessing Wallis now
relates not to price or value but to critical status. Berlin's own epithet,
Primitive, is the real problem, for it suggests an otherness of culture
which now seems more and more unsustainable. Wallis was untutored, natural
perhaps, but not primitive.
Yet it was clearly a sense of otherness that set Wallis apart even from his
own community in his lonely old age as a widower. Then it was, at the age of
about 70 in the mid-1920s, that he began to paint, using whatever materials
came to hand. He painted images of what he knew and remembered of his days
at sea, indeed still saw with his inner eye. Those paintings of his last 20
years captivate us still, with theirpowerful, authentic vision of a vanished
world.
The strength derives not only from the charmingly odd and natural images but
very much from the conviction and authority with which they are done. These
things are true paintings, properly realised in the paint itself, the colour
wonderfully controlled, the composition quite as secure and strong as it is
original and unexpected. His paintings work to their own pictorial logic and
such is his belief in his world that we too entirely share it. Natural
painter, maybe, but a painter nevertheless, and few have ever painted ships
and the sea so lovingly, so knowingly and so well.
These strange and beautiful things, set out to dry at his door, soon caught
the eye of more conventionally sophisticated artists who came to St Ives and
found themselves in Back Road West from time to time. We must remember that
the primitive, the art of the native peoples of Africa, the New World and
the South Seas, was very much the currency of the avant-garde in those days,
legitimised by Picasso and Matisse and their confreres in Paris well before
the First World War. The young Ben Nicholson and Christopher Wood were most
certainly alive to such things, and we can readily understand their interest
and excitement at coming upon Wallis and his work for the first time.
Whether his was to be an influence actually exerted upon them, or was rather
an example they deliberately chose to draw upon, the effects were manifest
soon enough in their own work. But they by no means treated him as an equal
and fellow artist. To Nicholson and Wood and their friends, Wallis may as
well have come from another, lesser order of creation, to be treated kindly
of course, indulged and even flattered, but not taken too seriously.
Primitive, in short, got in the way, and the line between patronage and
exploitation becomes hard to draw.
Take for, example, this letter from Ben Nicholson, early in 1929. 'Dear Mr
Wallis, Many thanks for the new paintings. There are some lovely ones among
them, and we like them very much. Mr Wood and Mrs Nicholson both liked one
of them as much as any you have done . . . I am sending back four and have
kept nine as follows - one 3s, two 2s, six 1s: 13s, Post 1s. 6d: 14s. 6d,
and enclose cheque for 14s. 6d &amp; hope this is correct?' Berlin goes on to
say that collectors worked out a scale of charges, 'going up to 8s for the
larger ones.' Of course 1s was worth more in those days (about the
equivalent of Pounds 1 today). But even so, 8 shillings]
However, these patrons thought they were helping, for Wallis as often as not
would give his work away to the sympathetic visitor. He died in the
workhouse, unsupported by his artist friends, and was only saved from the
pauper's grave he dreaded by the painter-critic, Adrian Stokes, who gave
Pounds 4.10s for a proper plot. The Salvation Army did at least give him a
decent funeral. Bernard Leach, the potter, made the golden lighthouse that
marks the grave, but 'got only about Pounds 19 to cover his costs. Few
subscribed and none were very generous . . .'

Lane Gallery, St Ives, until October 31: Gordon Hepworth Gallery, Exeter,

FT  27 OCT 92 / Arts: Patriotic feel to Elgar's 'Caractacus' - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The echoes of the final chorus might have reached Westminster, if not
Brussels. For Elgar's long-neglected oratorio Caractacus the time may have
come: this patriotic work tells the story of the ancient Britains'
resistance to Roman conquest and in its final peroration hymns 'the text of
Britain's teaching, the message of the free'.
One has a vision of local Conservative Party choirs up and down the country
suddenly deciding to do the piece and the publishers running out of copies.
As far as Sunday's performance at the Barbican Hall was concerned, however,
the timing was fortuitous. Richard Hickox and the London Symphony Orchestra
have been pursuing a series of Elgar's choral works for some time, of which
this welcome revival was the most recent.
Ironically, one of the shadows lurking in the background is the decidedly
un-British example of Wagnerian music drama. A couple of weeks ago the BBC
performances of The Kingdom reminded us how close Elgar came to Parsifal
when he composed scenes like the breaking of bread. In Caractacus it is the
trappings of the drama that are Wagnerian: the sacred oak tree, the Druid
maiden who foretells the future, the heroes in battle.
The music itself admits less of an influence. Even though his mature work
was all still to come at this point, there is no mistaking Elgar's hand in
the music that describes the peace of the Malvern Hills or the sun rising
over the forests below. In a few passages he even leaps ahead to those
sinking, melancholy harmonies that were to characterise his most personal
statements, notably in Caractacus's Lament after his defeat.
The soloist in that inspired portion of the score was David Wilson-Johnson,
a lively interpreter, although his voice loses power at the top just when it
is needed. Judith Howarth dealt confidently with Eigen's music, but Arthur
Davies sounded unhappy as Orbin. The tenor part is improbably high in the
Siegfried mode and hits a mini-forging song within the first few minutes.
Stephen Roberts sang the Arch-Druid and Alastair Miles was a fine, firm
Emperor Claudius.
There is a far wider range of lyrical, pastoral and mystic music in
Caractacus than the common view of it would have us believe and Hickox
mostly did it justice, even if he has never mastered the art of allowing
Elgar to speak naturally. The London Symphony Chorus also put on a decent
show. Nothing could easily live up to the ending, unless it be a massed
choir of Thatchers and Tebbits in full cry.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Arts: Merce Cunningham - an Event for the feet / Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A foot is what you find at the bottom end of your leg. But a foot is also a
metrical unit, as in poetry. The connection between the two, not often
apparent, is never more vivid than in the choreography of Merce Cunningham.
Here are feet that bring the whole body into life; they rise, fall, flex,
point, tap, they brace, anchor, lead and pace.
And here are feet that, often audibly, mark out iambs, trochees, dactyls,
spondees, anapaests, amphibrachs, a changing, wide range of clear metres.
There are no feet in all dance like those of the Cunningham company. To have
them briefly back in Britain has been a privilege.
Some larger superlatives are also in order. There is no dance company today
in which style and technique are more ideally fused. No company of dancers
today is composed of more individually attractive (or attractively
individual) people. And no company today has such consistently superb
choreography. Please note the present tense here. Cunningham is 73, and it
is a fact that his dances seldom if ever look their best when he is not
around to coach them. Even if some of them survive him, it is obvious that
most of his work present future dancers with far greater problems of
interpretation than choreography by Martha Graham and George Balanchine -
little of which today is in the condition it enjoyed 10 years ago, during
their lifetimes. Dance is the art of the present tense, after all. There is
nothing in life like catching it, so to speak, hot off the press.
This return to Britain, after three years, consisted of performances in
Northampton and in London at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. Though since 1964
London has seen several seasons of Cunningham's work, these three South Bank
performances were the first it has seen of his Events. A Cunningham Event is
a one-off anthology, selected from a range of his works, and is usually
performed with music and designs that did not originally accompany that
choreography. An event changes so much during its duration - generally
around 90 minutes - that it becomes complete demonstration of the whole
Cunningham experience. Writing after the first two performances, I testify
to the rapt attention and instant acclaim that they received from audiences.
The present array of Cunningham dancers performed marvel upon marvel this
weekend. On Saturday, Robert Swinston and Patricia Lent each performed
exacting solos (originally from Signals, 1970) with phenomenal audacity and
control. Swinston, always both withdrawn and intense, tossed off unexpected
air turns, to right and left, and other jumps, swept across the stage with
fervour, and was constantly surprising. Lent, in an already amazingly secure
balance high on half-toe, arched back, and then further back, keeping her
balance, and then proceeded with inscrutable assurance to further prodigies
of equilibrium, leaning way to one side with one leg beaming high into the
air on the other. And these are not feats of 'mere' technique; they register
on us as acts of spiritual daring do.
In a duet (from Trails, 1982), Carol Teitelbaum came bounding on with
exhilarating ballon and attack. Already possessed of a breathtaking fixity
of purpose on stage, she has now begun to discover the lightness of touch
and personal authority to make her a central figure in the company. Such a
character is in perfect contrast to the calmly eccentric elegance of Helen
Barrow, the witty and luscious Larissa McGoldrick, the lyrical fervour of
Emma Diamond or the plush power of Jenifer Weaver. The company's male
dancers are maybe even more striking. This weekend, David Kulick's blithe
heroism, Alan Good's serene command and Frederic Gafner's vivid involvement
all made particularly strong impressions.
The structure of an Event varies greatly. Now you see a private game for a
small group, now a series of grand-scale duets, now an ensemble moving like
wildlife at large, now solos that roam out on to the less known perimeters
of the mind. The Cunningham experience is still difficult for some
observers. Though its basic nature has probably changed little since the
1950s and 1960s, it remains more profoundly avant garde than any
experimental work being created by new dance-makers. Still, at a mysterious
level an Event is peculiarly coherent and expressive. Cunningham's
choreography never fails to say 'What a piece of work is man'. Great
dancing, great theatre, great poetry.

FT  27 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy turnover in Steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS to reduce production by 20 per cent, together with a warning that
worse could follow, sent shares in British Steel tumbling in heavy turnover
of 23m, the second biggest of the day. The move, the latest against a bleak
background for the European industry, raised doubts over British Steel's
dividend prospects.
Mr Zafar Khan at Strauss Turnbull said that while the company had little
choice in slashing output, the move would equate to a loss of Pounds 100m.
He estimates that Steel's full-year losses will be in the region of Pounds
250m, with more to come if the company makes further production cuts in the
fourth quarter.
'This raises a question mark over the dividend. The market was looking for
around 3p, but we are now forecasting a half-penny, or perhaps even less.
There is no chance for income or capital appreciation for investors in the
short or medium term. British Steel is dead money.' The shares closed 6 1/2
off at 56p.
Lucas active
Reports that Mr Tony Edwards was quitting as group managing director of
Lucas unsettled the shares in busy trading. The boardroom ructions at the
automotive and aerospace group - the finance director resigned earlier this
year - have left analysts questioning the board's strategy and have fuelled
speculation that a predator might exploit the managerial uncertainty.
However, the shares recovered from early falls yesterday to close steady at
107p.
Mr Edwards was seen as the architect of the so-called 'Lucas Plans' to
restructure the company and his departure raised questions in the market as
to whether these plans will be pursued with the same vigour. 'Lucas is the
worst managed company in the market,' one analyst said bluntly. 'The board
is in disarray and the chances of a bid must have been increased by these
lastest developments.' Siebe, off 14 at 335p, and BTR, down 4 at 498p, were
two names touted as potential bidders.
Tarmac strong
Tarmac, the building materials/construction group, was the heaviest traded
stock in a lively building sector after the company confirmed stories in the
weekend press that it had won a series of government contracts totalling
Pounds 100m for motorway improvements.
The programme involves widening and resurfacing part of the M6 in the
north-west of England, the M25 near Heathrow airport and extending the M3 in
Hampshire.
Tarmac shares raced up to 88p early in the session, with the market
responding not only to the hints of the new government contracts but also to
the long-running but nevertheless persistent stories that a potential
predator is lurking in the wings. Minorco, the international mining and
metals group linked to Mr Harry Oppenheimer's international mining empire,
has long been viewed as a potential buyer of Tarmac.
Specialists refused to ignore the bid stories surrounding Tarmac, pointing
out that profit margins on contracts such as the motorway projects are
typically only in the region of 1 to 2 per cent. By the close Tarmac shares
had come back to close a net 4 higher at 86p. Turnover was a heavy 9.1m.
Wellcome wanted
Pharmaceutical group Wellcome attracted interest ahead of results on
Wednesday. The shares burst through the Pounds 10 barrier to record a more
than 25 per cent rise since the Pounds 2.3bn issue at 800p a share in July.
The rise in the shares has been checked recently as a result of US selling
following worries that drug prices will be held down if Bill Clinton is
elected president. However, the worries were partly eased by press comment
yesterday.
Also, securities house Hoare Govett reinforced its buy recommendation and
argued that analysts will be bound to upgrade profit estimates for the
forthcoming year as a result of the stronger dollar. More than half the
company's profits come from the US. The shares were up 26 at one stage but
suffered from some profit-taking and closed a net 18 higher at 1009p.
The recent slippage in oil prices, resulting from fears of increased
production, kept the oil sector under modest pressure. Shell was the odd man
out in the sector, the shares edging up 4 to 533p, as recent hefty selling
pressure, prompted by a County sell note, dried up. Lasmo eased 2 to 181p,
reacting to 'take profits' advice in the weekend press.
The rap on the knuckles from the accounting board failed to cause any real
damage to British Gas which held around 268 1/2 p.
HSBC was the most active of the clearing banks, with the shares shrugging
off worries about strained relations between the UK and China, and closing 5
higher at 485p after turnover of 7.2m.
TSB, the subject of considerable takeover speculation during the past couple
of weeks, eased to 142p on good turnover of 5.3m after Smith New Court
lowered its profits estimates for the bank.
Activity in insurances was at a low ebb, but broker Willis Corroon picked up
6 to 220p and life assurance group London &amp; Manchester 10 to 269p.
Glaxo bucked the market to add 6 at 784p. Mr James Culverwell at Hoare
Govett said he was drawing clients attention to the fact that 'the stock has
lagged Wellcome but, longer term, has a more exciting research and
development pipeline'.
Pharmaceuticals manufacturer Medeva moved up 5 to 198p ahead of an analysts'
trip to Liverpool today.
Tobacco to insurance conglomerate BAT Industries slipped 12 to 892p as Carr
Kitcat &amp; Aitken argued that the stock was over-priced. Carr conglomerates
analyst Mr Martin Hawkins likes the long-term prospects but feels the
dividend payment is likely to be less attractive than previously. The group
is to publish third-quarter figures on November 4.
ICI, which is to publish third-quarter figures on Thursday, performed well
despite increasingly gloomy forecasts. Japanese house Nikko likes the stock
but joint broker Hoare Govett, which shocked the market recently with sharp
profit forecast cuts believes it may have to reduce estimates further. It
also has the stock as a 'hold' which because of Hoare's brokership
relationship with the company many interpret as a tacit 'sell'
recommendation. The shares lifted 19 to 1066p.
Invesco MIM, the investment management group, was the market's heaviest
traded stock after Drayton Consolidated, the investment trust, sold its
shareholding, via a series of agency crosses executed at 77p a share. The
shares gained 8 1/2 to 77p. Turnover in Invesco totalled 49m shares.
The disposal by Storehouse of its Habitat and Richard Shops, although
expected, still managed to lift the shares as analysts expressed approval of
the higher price obtained for Habitat than had been expected. The shares
rose 3 to 164p.
A suspected bear raid on Grand Metropolitan left the shares reeling,
touching 394p, although they later recovered to 398p, a fall of 11 on the
day. Spurious stories that the drinks giant had suffered substantial losses
on foreign exchange markets were angrily denied by the company.
Redland and Marley were two of the poorest performers in building materials
after BZW, the investment bank, lowered profits expectation for both. BZW
reduced current year forecast for Redland by Pounds 6m to Pounds 192m and
next year's by Pounds 5m to Pounds 200m. For Marley, BZW moved down to
Pounds 10m for this year. The broking firm cited increasingly aggressive
pricing in the UK bricks and roof tiles businesses for the downgrades.
Redland settled 10 lower at 342p, on 2m traded, and Marley dipped 4 to 76p
with 677,000 shares changing hands. An institutional visit to Marley's
operations in Germany commences today.

FT  27 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares ease as base rate hopes cool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES FOR further reductions in domestic interest rates were put on hold in
the UK stock market yesterday, leaving shares to drift easier in sluggish
trading. A renewed fall in sterling, together with an inflation warning from
the president of the Bundesbank, provided a nervous setting for the
important economic speech to be delivered in the City of London on Thursday
by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer; the same day also
brings the parliamentary debate on the Maastricht proposals and a trading
statement from ICI, still the bellwether of the London stock market.
A weekend featured by growing political pressures on the UK Conservative
government of Mr John Major was followed by new evidence of the damage
wrought by the economic recession in the UK. British Steel disclosed that it
is cutting production by up to one fifth in the face of falling demand in UK
and export markets.
Share prices opened higher but the rise was soon reversed when it became
clear that technical pressures in the stock index sector had turned
negative. The FT-SE Index was soon 13 points off and struggling to rally.
London was keeping a wary eye on Wall Street as the US market braces itself
for the Presidential election and tensions eased a little after the Dow came
in almost unchanged in UK trading hours.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,661.6 for a net loss on the
day of 8.1 points. Dealers said that trading had been nervous, with
investors unwilling to see last week's gains extended while the corporate
reporting season remains so uncertain.
Seaq volume, slow at first, picked up a little as the December futures
contract steadied to maintain a good premium. By the end of the session,
456.3m shares had traded through the Seaq network, compared with 586.3m on
Friday. Yesterday's Seaq total was boosted by heavy turnover in a few
shares, including British Steel and also Invesco MIM, the investment
management group, where a substantial stake changed hands.
Retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.4bn on Friday, maintaining
the increased volume of genuine investment activity that has featured the UK
equity market since Britain's abrupt departure from the ERM network in
mid-September.
The market's performance was helped by firmness in the international
pharmaceutical stocks, where prospects are believed to be particularly
vulnerable to the outcome of the US presidential election and to federal
welfare policy.
ICI also provided a good lead for equities, in spite of increasing
nervousness ahead of this week's profits statement, which will be scanned
for news on the plans to split the chemical monarch into two separate
groups.
But the firmness in the US dollar did little to help the wider range of
multi-national stocks which remained uncertain as traders studied the latest
opinion poll ratings of the US presidential candidates, which indicated a
narrowing in the lead of Democratic governor Bill Clinton over President
Bush.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES dealers were surprised yesterday by a substantial deal in
Amstrad options which represented almost 10m shares. This activity ensured
healthy turnover in an otherwise quiet day, writes Peter John.
The two-for-one Amstrad deal consisted of a trader buying 3,200 June 25
calls at 5p a share and selling 6,400 June 30 calls at 2.5p. The investor
will make money if the shares are at between 25p and 35p next June and the
deal was interpreted as speculation on Mr Alan Sugar making a successful bid
at 30p a share for the outstanding share capital of the electronics group.
The other significant trade was a roll-over in Sainsbury calls from the near
month to January representing just over 3,000 lots. As a result of these two
deals, total turnover was well above break-even point at 36,865 lots.
Meanwhile, the contract on the FT-SE 100 for December delivery darted around
in early trading but settled back in the afternoon to trade within a narrow
range and close 23 down at 2,698 with only 5,306 contracts dealt.
December reached a high of 2,724 at the start of trading, forced up by
growing hopes that interest rates will be 6 per cent by the end of the year.
Then the contract fell sharply, pared by worries that in view of prevalent
political and economic uncertainties, the stock market may be over-priced.

NEGOTIATIONS between the government of the Netherlands and Deutsche
Aerospace (Dasa) of Germany are to continue today in an effort to secure a
definitive agreement on Dasa's planned acquisition of a 51 per cent stake in
Fokker, the Dutch regional aeroplane manufacturer.
Lawyers are working out the details of an informal framework agreement
reached at the weekend on the three main sticking points in the long-running
negotiations.
These are the price to be paid for the Dutch state's shares in Fokker, the
future of the 50-seater Fokker 50, and the price which Fokker will pay for
aircraft components under the mooted industrial partnership.
Dasa, a subsidiary of the Daimler-Benz group, is expected to pay about Fl 37
(Dollars 21.15) per share for the Dutch government's 10.6m shares as well as
for the 13.2m shares which Fokker will issue to its new controlling
shareholder.
Fokker's shares closed up Fl 2.40 at Fl 18.20 yesterday on expectations that
the Dasa takeover, which has proved to be highly controversial in the
Netherlands since negotiations first began in early 1992, would go ahead as
originally planned.
The Dutch company's shares have fallen sharply since the government
provisionally endorsed the takeover in July, when the shares were worth
about Fl 30.

FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: DNO moves to build Nedlloyd
stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DNO, the Oslo-based oil company controlled by Mr Torstein Hagen, the
Norwegian investor, plans to strengthen the company's borrowing capacity
with a view to increasing its 6 per cent shareholding in Nedlloyd, the
Netherlands' largest transportation group.
DNO's shares, suspended on October 5, were reinstated yesterday following a
presentation of its capitalisation plan.
The company is seeking to reduce exposure to the petroleum sector while
establishing a sound financial basis for its development as an active marine
investment company. 'This would include a somewhat greater ownership
position in Nedlloyd,' it said.
To achieve this goal, DNO said it would offer to convert bonds into shares
and would seek the authority to issue shares directed at specific investors.
The company said it had received a positive response from most of its
convertible bond shareholders, representing a total outstanding of NKr168m
(Dollars 26.95m), to convert the bonds into share capital.
Through the conversion, DNO's equity-to-debt ratio would be doubled to
slightly more than 50 per cent from 25 per cent. The group would issue 2m
shares at a nominal price of NKr20 a share directed at specific investors.
However, under Norwegian company law, DNO will first have to write down the
par value of its shares to NKr10 from NKr100. This means the company's share
capital will be written down to NKr52.50m from NKr525m.
DNO is seeking to convert all its shares into voting shares in order to
improve liquidity. The proposals will be put to shareholders at a meeting
scheduled for November 9, but this should be a formality as Mr Hagen,
through various cross-shareholding companies, represents the bulk of DNO's
shareholders.
DNO said it had held discussions with some of Nedlloyd's large shareholders
about acquiring part of their shares in exchange for DNO shares. These had
drawn a positive response, it said.

full-year result

   BERNE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS VOLKSBANK expects its 1992 results to fall below last year's level as
the result of higher provisions and write-offs, Reuter reports from Berne.
The bank said that cash-flow before tax, provisions and write-offs could be
up to 10 per cent below 1991's SFr382.9m (Dollars 312.2m). In 1991, it
reported a group net profit of SFr68.4m.
The Bank said it would change its legal status into a conventional joint
stock company from a co-operative.
The step would give the bank more possibilities of self-financing via
capital markets.
Swiss markets have speculated that Volksbank could be a merger or takeover
candidate in the light of recent poor results.
However, the company added: 'There is no plan for any participation of
another company in Volksbank.'
The change would widen the circle of investors interested in the bank.
'The co-operative stock is not an actual security and makes it more
difficult in Switzerland, and in particular abroad where our legal structure
is hardly understood, to placing our stock and raise capital,' the company
said.
The bank also plans to increase its stake in Odier Bungener Courvoisier, the
French private bank, to 51 per cent from 20 per cent.
Volksbank acquired its stake in the bank, which operates in commercial and
merchant banking and in asset management, in the spring of this year.

FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: Skandia to halve global
reinsurance operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SKANDIA, the leading Swedish insurer, yesterday announced plans to halve its
worldwide reinsurance operations.
The move comes just days after the group rejected a Dollars 500m offer for
its North American reinsurance unit, Skandia America Corp (SAC).
It means that the company's total net reinsurance premiums will fall to
SKr3.5bn (Dollars 653m) next year from SKr7bn, while its solvency margin
will rise by 15 percentage points to 84 per cent.
The group operates the world's 10th-largest reinsurance business.
The emphasis will be on reducing Skandia's exposure to non-life reinsurance
both in Europe and North America. Life reinsurance premiums are expected to
hold steady at SKr2bn a year.
In the US, Skandia America will focus primarily on casualty business, treaty
and facultative (usually single large risks).
Meanwhile, the Stockholm-based operations within Skandia International will
concentrate on life business and facultative as well as non-proportional
non-life business.
Mr Bjorn Wolrath, president and chief executive, said: 'This decision is an
important step in order to secure that Skandia International and Skandia
America stay as long-term reinsurers.'
Last week, Skandia rejected an offer worth Dollars 20 per share for SAC on
the grounds that it was too low.
This was after it had abandoned plans to sell a majority stake in the unit
via a public offering and private placement - because the price was
inadequate.
Analysts believe the group will gradually run off its entire reinsurance
portfolio and are surprised it has opted to scale back its operations rather
than go for an outright sale.
However, Mrs Maria-Louise Wenander, Skandia's chief operating officer for
reinsurance (Europe and Overseas) said: 'This is not a run-off. It is a
change of strategy designed to focus the group on more specialised areas.'
The reduction in the group's reinsurance exposure will largely be achieved
through an effort to increase prices in the impending renewals season, which
will inevitably lead some clients to defect.
ESAB, the world's leading welding equipment producer, increased profits to
SKr81m (Dollars 15.1m) in the first nine months from SKr18m a year earlier.
The group said it benefited from higher sales in Brazil and tighter cost
control for its standard welding products in Europe.
Sales edged 1 per cent higher to SKr4.84bn, although, for comparable units,
the figure dropped 7 per cent. The order book rose by 6 per cent to
SKr4.88bn.
The group expected its full-year profit to be higher than last year's SKr9m
surplus, even though it remained generally gloomy about market conditions.
'During 1992 demand for welding products has sunk in practically all markets
in Europe, including the previously strong central European market. Demand
in the US has improved only slightly compared with 1991,' the company said.

CARNAUD METALBOX, the Anglo-French packaging group, has announced a
preliminary accord to purchase Anchor Hocking Packaging of the US from
Newell Corp, the consumer hardware company, for an undisclosed price, AP-DJ
reports from Paris.
Anchor Hocking, which specialises in metal capsules for bottles, is expected
to post 1992 revenue of Dollars 160m, representing 17 per cent of the US
capsules market.
Carnaud Metalbox said the purchase, subject to approval by US authorities,
would lift the group's metal capsule turnover to FFr2bn (418.8m). The
company produces capsules at five sites in Europe, but it has not entered
the US market.
Carnaud Metalbox has an annual revenue of FFr25bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest listed company, yesterday disclosed that
nine-month net profits had been cut by half to NKr520m (Dollars 93.2m) from
NKr1.041bn last year due to weak conditions in main markets and foreign
currency losses.
Hydro said it would intensify cost-cutting measures and improve efficiency.
The group plunged into a third-quarter net loss of NKr268m from a NKr39m
profit last year, after suffering financial losses of NKr403m compared with
financial income of NKr174m last year.
Hydro's weak result was far worse than analysts' forecasts. The group's
performance was due to third-quarter losses by the agriculture division and
adverse currency swings.
In the nine-month period, group revenue fell by NKr1.153bn to NKr44.471bn
and by NKr590m to NKr13.123bn in the third quarter. Mr Egil Myklebust, Norsk
Hydro's president, blamed the result on the international recession,
difficult market conditions for fertilisers and negative effects from
European currency movements.
'The international recession seems to drag on longer than was generally
expected at the beginning of the year,' Mr Myklebust said. This has led to
low prices for light metals, petrochemical products and fertilisers. Group
nine-month operating income fell to NKr2.183bn from NKr3.002bn.
The only bright spot in the group was the oil and gas division, which saw
nine-month operating profit fall slightly by NKr12m to NKr1.965bn as revenue
rose by NKr805m to NKr9.947bn.
Production of oil and gas rose to 2.3m tonnes of oil equivalent from 1.6m
last year. Although crude oil prices were slightly higher, this was offset
by a weaker dollar. The agriculture division fell into a nine-month
operating loss of NKr123m from a NKr433m profit last year.
Hydro said agriculture suffered from weaker margins, a fall in consumption
and strong price competition. The light metals division saw nine-month
revenue slashed by NKr1.146bn to NKr11.956bn as operating profit fell to
NKr276m from NKr460m.
Aluminium and magnesium improved in spite of lower prices and Hydro said
costs had been cut.
The petrochemicals division lifted nine-month operating revenue to
NKr3.157bn from NKr3.098bn but operating profits were cut to NKr291m from
NKr377m.
Hydro said that low third-quarter prices were offset by a higher sales
volume.

<TEXT>
MAZDA Motor, the Japanese carmaker, is giving up its ambitious plan to
launch a separate sales network in the US to market luxury cars. The
decision is one of the most significant retrenchment moves by the Japanese
motor industry during the current recession.
The company is halting development of a V12 luxury saloon, planned as the
flagship of its luxury car range, and pulling out of world sports prototype
car racing for at least two years, only a year after winning the Le Mans
24-hour race in France.
Mazda said yesterday it had been forced to abandon its luxury car strategy
in the US in the face of its worsening financial performance, the strength
of the yen, and continuing weakness of the US new car market.
The group announced in August last year its long-awaited move to set up a
luxury car sales channel in the US under the Amati name, with sales due to
begin in spring 1994.
It was seeking to emulate its bigger domestic rivals - Honda, Toyota and
Nissan - which had set up separate luxury car franchises in the US by the
end of the 1980s under the respective brand names of Acura, Lexus and
Infiniti.
Mazda's retrenchment in North America follows the decision earlier this year
by Daihatsu, one of the smaller Japanese carmakers, to withdraw from the
depressed US new car market.
The moves reflect the growing financial squeeze on Japanese carmakers, which
are facing a second successive year of falling sales in their domestic
market, while demand is weakening in west Europe and sales remain depressed
in the US.
Mazda's parent company pre-tax profits in the year to March 1993 are
forecast to fall 64 per cent to about Y7bn (Dollars 58m), from Y19.7bn last
year, half its earlier estimate. This would be a decline of 86 per cent
during the past two years.
The Japanese carmaker, in which Ford holds a 24.5 per cent stake, has
revitalised its product range in the past couple of years, but in the
process its finances have become seriously overstretched and it is losing
market share in Japan.
Adding to Mazda's present difficulties is its lack of a production base in
west Europe, where it is the only leading Japanese carmaker without firm
plans for local production.

Dasa and the Dutch government had hoped to be able to sign a final agreement

companies' works councils as well as from European Community authorities in
Brussels.
The Dutch government is expected to win an undertaking from Dasa that it
would continue production of the Fokker 50 as long as commercially feasible.
But the contract is likely to fall short of a guarantee that production will
not be halted or moved abroad under any circumstances.

John Toulmin QC has been elected president of the Council of the Bars and
Law Societies of Europe (CCBE) at its autumn meeting in Lisbon. He is the
first English lawyer to hold the office and only the second from the UK. The
first was Judge David Edward, the British judge at the European Court of
Justice in Luxembourg.
Toulmin has been active in the CCBE since 1984 when he represented the
English Bar on the UK delegation. Between 1987 and 1990 he was leader of the
UK delegation and was elected CCBE vice-president last year.
He has been at the forefront of efforts by the CCBE to adopt a draft
directive on lawyers' rights of establishment within the European Community.
The directive was finally passed at the Lisbon meeting this weekend bringing
to an end 17 years of negotiation between the members of the Council. The
draft directive will now be sent to the European Commission in Brussels
which has indicated that it will view it favourably.
Toulmin, 51, was educated at Winchester and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and
called to the Bar in 1965. He is also a member of the Irish Bar and the Bar
of Northern Ireland.
He is a former chairman of the Young Barristers and member of the Bar
Council and a former governor of the Maudsley Hospital in London. He is
currently a member of the Consultative Committee to the European Court,
member of the Committee of Management of the Institute of Psychiatry and a

FT  27 OCT 92 / People: Martin Taylor to chair NatWest Life
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Martin Taylor, vice chairman of Hanson, has been appointed chairman of
NatWest Life, which will be capitalised at Pounds 150m when it begins
underwriting in 1993.
This is the most important job Taylor has taken on since becoming
vice-chairman of the Anglo/American conglomerate in 1988. While he has been
a non-executive director of NatWest for two years, the new position is
expected to take up an increasing amount of his time.
NatWest says Taylor would be steering its new joint venture company with
Clerical Medical Life Assurance Society through its formative years; he
admits the new job would be demanding. But he added: 'This is time I will
have to squeeze out of my own private time. My responsibilities at Hanson
are unchanged.'
Taylor is also a non-executive director of Vickers PLC and has been a member
of the CBI Council since 1981.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Business Law: Avoiding the arbitration trap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ARMFELT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the third-world debt crisis begins to show signs of ending, needed
capital - much of it in the form of direct foreign investment - is returning
to Asia, Latin America and Africa.
In the rush to attract foreign business, developing countries risk repeating
the errors of the past. One such error has been to underestimate the
importance of the method selected for resolving international business
disputes.
Many transnational corporations remain unwilling to make direct investments
in smaller and poorer countries if those investments would require the
company to take its disputes to the local courts. Rightly or wrongly, there
is a strongly held belief that trust in the impartiality of courts in
developing nations is too great a risk.
The parties often agree to shift disputes to a neutral forum, which
frequently means international arbitration under the auspices of private
organisations based in developed countries, such as the International
Chamber of Commerce and American Arbitration Association.
Arbitration is designed to offer a neutral, expeditious and relatively
simple method of resolving business disputes. In many domestic contexts, and
some international settings, arbitration accomplishes these goals and
provides a means of dispute resolution that is superior in important
respects to judicial processes.
From the perspective of developing nations and their companies, however, the
fairness and benefits of international arbitration are often questionable.
The principal areas in which third-world parties can be disadvantaged are
selection of arbitrators, forum, cost, and access to and supervision of
legal representatives. Lurking in the background are fundamental issues of
national and international policy, under which arbitral awards are
increasingly exempted from meaningful judicial review, even when awards
violate fundamental norms of domestic public policy.
Ordinarily both sides appoint one arbitrator and the two arbitrators, or an
arbitral institution, appoint the chairman. There is an understandable
tendency on the part of parties to appoint a national as their arbitrator.
Unfortunately for parties from the third world, unless their nominee is
someone of international stature, their interests tend to be poorly served
by a national who is unfamiliar with the workings of international
arbitration.
If their nominee is seen to lack the stature of the other members of the
panel, or seen to be partial, he will be ignored by the chairman. As a
result, ordinarily the third-world client's interests will be best served by
appointing a European.
The odds are that if the contract specifies the law of a developed country,
the chairman will be someone from that legal system or from a very similar
legal culture.
By contrast, if the contract specifies the law of the developing country, it
is unlikely that someone from that country will be selected. The result is
that the panel is likely to be dominated by persons unfamiliar with the law
of the developing country.
Unless the contract has a forum-selection clause specifying otherwise, which
is rarely the case, ICC and AAA arbitrations are conducted in developed
states, often London, Paris or Switzerland.
The choice of a developed forum has a large number of consequences, none of
them favourable to litigants from less developed countries.
Even assuming the parties have selected the substantive law of the contract,
the procedure will be determined by the arbitrators, who will routinely turn
to the law of the forum.
In the case of a lengthy arbitration, the selection of a developed forum can
impose large costs on the parties in terms of paying for the hearing room,
housing of lawyers, parties and arbitrators, over and above the already high
costs of lawyers who charge at the market rates in European capitals or the
United States.
These costs have to be paid as the matter progresses, which may put a strain
on a party that lacks easy access to large quantities of foreign exchange.
To these must be added the arbitrator's fees.
The fact that the panel will be dominated by Europeans means that the case
will have to be presented in a European fashion, by counsel experienced in
the procedures of the forum. The tribunal is likely to expect extensive
research on the law and tidy presentation of the facts.
While the developing country litigant can hire equally experienced outside
counsel, at a price, their work must still be monitored by inside lawyers
and executives who are unlikely to have the same amount of relevant
experience as their transnational counterparts.
There are no authoritative statistics on international arbitration results,
owing to the confidential nature of arbitration. Nonetheless, anecdotal
evidence indicates that international arbitrators have tended to decide in
favour of transnational corporations.
More fundamentally, international arbitration is premised on a distrust of
developing countries and their courts. It is characterised by a more
informal approach to so-called legal technicalities. As a result, even a
solid claim or defence based on a formal reading of a contract will not
necessarily prevail, introducing costly uncertainty as to the likely result.
International arbitration converts disputes with significant legal,
regulatory and policy dimensions into purely private contractual
disagreements. Courts, whose duty it is to administer justice pursuant to
law and policy, are replaced with private arbitration panels that often see
their mission as merely to settle disagreements in accordance with 'general'
legal principles and prevailing business practices that favour transnational
corporations.
This type of private justice inevitably ignores the legitimate regulatory
interests of concerned states. The confidential nature of most arbi-trations
further impedes the enforcement of regulatory protections in both developed
and developing states.
The New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign
Arbitral Awards could mitigate the potential bias inherent in international
arbitration. In particular, the convention reintroduces broader concerns of
justice by empowering local courts to deny enforcement of international
arbitral awards that are rendered contrary to 'public policy'.
Unfortunately, courts in many developed countries have employed an
exceedingly narrow reading of 'public policy' - indeed more narrow than the
interpretation of the same language in the relevant domestic context. And,
courts in developing countries, when confronted with international arbitral
awards, have often followed the lead of the developed countries by enforcing
arbitral awards.
This has deprived the public policy safeguard to the private arbitral
process of any real meaning, and threatens the legitimate regulatory
policies of both developed and developing countries. What should be a
meaningful review of arbitral awards has come to resemble a rubber stamp.
Courts charged with enforcing arbitral awards could restore the balance
between private dispute resolution and public adjudication envisaged by the
New York Convention. Meaningful review of arbitration awards by enforcing
courts would facilitate international commercial transactions and capitalise
on the advantages of arbitration while avoiding the arbitration trap.
Meanwhile, however, there has been a growing tendency in certain of the more
well-off developing countries to insist on local arbitration, with even the
express right to appeal to local courts.
This attempt to redress a real or an alleged imbalance by merely tilting the
table in one's own direction is clearly a backward step. The only real
solution to the problem will be found in the true internationalisation of
arbitration.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Ending the fragmentation
 -Charles Batchelor and Lisa Wood examine British plans to establish a
business support network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British politicians and businesses have often cast envious eyes at the way
the continental Europeans organise business support - through generously
funded chambers of commerce with which businesses are obliged to register.
Starting in April, if the plans of Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, are realised, Britain will start to put in place a business
support network which will be at least the equal of its continental
partners. It would also end the fragmentation of business support
initiatives which have confused and irritated small firms in the past.
What the department of trade and industry (DTI) proposes is a national
network of about 200 business centres which would provide a combination of
advice from experienced business counsellors and a referral service with
more specialised help if this is needed.
Lead role in establishing the new network will go to the 82 English and
Welsh Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs), but they will be expected to
call on the expertise of their local chamber of commerce, enterprise agency
and, in rural areas, business support organisations such as the Rural
Development Commission.
The centres have been provisionally labelled 'one-stop shops' but the DTI is
keen to remove the impression of a low-grade, drop-in service on every high
street. One name which has been considered for the new centres is 'Business
Point,' followed by the name of the town in which they are based. They are
more likely to be set up on business parks or in the offices of existing
business support organisations.
'We are not tinkering about at the edges,' commented one person closely
involved in the project. 'This is not a case of getting the existing
services to work better but of achieving a step-change in performance.
Business people don't have the time or the inclination to be shuffled around
at the inclination of bureaucrats. A simple sign-posting service is not on.'
The key staff in the centres will be the 'personal business advisers',
people with a background in either the commercial sector or public sector
business agencies, who will help businessmen and women diagnose their
problems. If necessary they will refer their clients to specialist
consultancy help, to business databases and to sources of public or private
funding.
The business advisers will be trained to a uniformly high standard and the
centres will be expected to obtain accreditation to the BS5750 quality
assurance standard.
The target market will be established small and medium sized businesses with
growth prospects rather than the new start-up.
The one-stop shop proposals are still under discussion in a steering group
which includes Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, and representatives
of the TECs, the chambers, local authorities and Business in the Community -
so their final form is still undecided.
But the DTI plans to publish a prospectus by the end of November and wants
bids in from the TEC-led business groups by January. Between 10 and 15 of
the new business centres are expected to be operating from April 1 and the
national network is planned to be completed within about two years.
This is an ambitious timetable. The DTI says there is a wave of enthusiasm
for the idea but implementation will affect many members of the existing
business support network.
The chambers of commerce, in particular, are giving them a somewhat nervous
welcome. 'If a small business can go along to a one stop shop for help why
should it then join a chamber?' asks Ronnie Jacobson, public affairs and
marketing manager at the London Chamber of Commerce. 'This puts us in a very
odd position of helping to put ourselves out of business. Why wasn't funding
put into the chambers to let them provide a better range of services?'
Graham Ashmore, a director of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, is
concerned that the one-stop shop programme cuts across the chambers' own
Effective Business Support programme to create a core network of 50 chambers
meeting a common quality standard.
Even the TECs, which will lead the local partnerships, have their worries.
Many have already begun working closely with their local chamber of
commerce, enterprise agency and other business organisations and they are
keen that the one-stop shop programme should be seen as emerging naturally
from these activities rather than as a revolutionary new idea imposed from
on high. Birmingham formally launched its own First Step Shop earlier this
month in an initiative involving the TEC, chamber, city council and the DTI.
'We were working on this long before the government announced its plans,'
says Christine Parker, the manager.
Not that the DTI programme is the first time that anyone has thought of
one-stop shops. The present government launched a pilot network of six
'business shops' to provide start-up advice and help with tax and social
security problems in 1989. In 1990 the Labour party outlined plans for a
'one-stop business service'.
Crucial to the success of the new venture is funding. The TECs already face
pressure on their budgets and additional demands will be made by the
one-stop shop network.
The DTI says it is unable to provide a detailed costing of the new centres,
although it estimates the start-up costs over the first two years of each of
the pilots could be Pounds 500,000, of which Pounds 300,000 might need to
come from the government.
Some of the running costs may be met by the local authorities and from EC
funds, while the centres will also charge for services where appropriate.
But it is likely that the TECs will also be expected to commit a substantial
part of their budgets to running the one-stop shops. This could be as much
as half of the TEC's Pounds 80m annual enterprise budget, according to some
estimates.
Even if this money can be prised from already stretched budgets, is there
strong demand for a new network of advice centres? The DTI view is that
small business owners are frequently too busy solving immediate problems -
particularly in the middle of a recession - to realise their own long-term
needs.
Others disagree. Some specialists believe that small businesses would rather
be relieved of the burdens placed on them by government - red tape, tax
administration - than have these forms of assistance.
Stan Mendham, chief executive of the Forum of Private Business, queries
whether small business needs what he sees as yet another level of business
support on top the existing organisations. 'When will the government learn
to use what is there?' he asks.
There is certainly a case for asking why the government should now be
seeking to create a uniform, national network of business support so soon
after abolishing another centrally organised and nationally known agency,
the Small Firms Service. This was taken over by the TECs, each of which
adopted a new label for the service and a new method of working.
The DTI acknowledges that it is being prescriptive in setting a general
framework for the new network but says that local business organisations
will determine the detail.
It believes that the new network will provide a quality of business support
equal to or better than that available from the continental chambers of
commerce - without adopting the continental model of compulsory registration
for all businesses. A network which avoided compulsion, deeply repugnant to
government and most business organisations, could create a new, much needed
British model of small business support.
