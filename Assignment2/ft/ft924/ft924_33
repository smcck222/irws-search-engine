FT  24 OCT 92 / Markets: Cut in investment trust Pep charge - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Murray Johnstone, which cut initial charges on its unit trusts Peps last
week, this week reduced charges on its investment trust Pep. The initial
charge has been reduced to Pounds 35 plus VAT, instead of 1.5 per cent plus
VAT. The annual charge is Pounds 35 plus VAT, or 1.25 per cent plus VAT,
whichever is the lower. Thornton Dresdner has launched a European Bond Fund,
which invests primarily in European government securities. The estimated
initial gross yield is 8 per cent. The initial charge is 5 per cent, though
there is a 1 per cent discount until November 30. The annual charge is 1 per
cent and the minimum initial investment is Pounds 500.

Interest rates may be falling, but the troubles of the property sector are
far from over. This week, Hammerson, one of the biggest companies in the
sector announced plans to cut the final dividend from 17p to 6.5p, although
the interim dividend is being maintained. Sidney Mason, chairman, said the
recession was 'both deeper and longer than any in living memory.'

FT  24 OCT 92 / Markets: Building societies suffer one of worst months ever
 -At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Building societies had one of their worst months ever in September. Business
was sharply down for both savings and mortgage lending activities. The
accompanying graph shows the sudden drop in mortgage lending which fell last
month to Pounds 446m, down from roughly Pounds 1.7bn in each of the previous
two months. The figure was the lowest monthly total since 1982 and was
exacerbated by the end of the stamp-duty holiday in August. There was also a
net savings outflow of Pounds 264m last month compared with an inflow of
Pounds 327m in August.
Those struggling with their mortgage payments can refer to a new book
produced by the Child Poverty Action Group, 'The Rights Guide for Home
Owners' which gives homeowners details of schemes to help those in
difficulty. The guide is available for Pounds 6.95 (incl p&amp;p) from CPAG, 4th
floor, 1-5 Bath St, London EC1V 9PY.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Markets: A Clinton chiller for the bond markets - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'PRESIDENT Clinton?' said the headline on the newsstands earlier this week.
Although the latest polls suggest the question is increasingly assuming a
rhetorical status, the thought of a fiscally-assertive Democrat in the White
House is sending chills through the US bond market, if not the rest of Wall
Street.
So heavily have Treasury investors been selling government securities lately
that, since the start of the month, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond
has risen more than 30 basis points to above 7.6 per cent, reversing a
steady, if unspectacular, seven-month decline in market interest rates.
The sell-off in bonds reflects the fears of fixed-income investors that, if
Bill Clinton is elected president, his fiscal stimulus programme could send
interest rates, and possibly inflation, sharply higher.
There is nothing surprising in this, except perhaps that the bond market has
taken so long to wake up to the likelihood that the country will have a new
president.
What is surprising, however, is the equanimity with which equity investors
have greeted the turmoil in the Treasury market.
The stock market has displayed a remarkable resilience over the past few
weeks in the face of three potentially unsettling factors: rising bond
yields (which are usually bad for stocks because higher interest rates
stifle economic activity and make bonds look more attractive); the continued
likelihood of not just a Democratic victory, but quite possibly a Democratic
landslide; and a third quarter corporate reporting season that has brought
more than its fair share of surprises, some good, but many bad.
In spite of distractions, stocks have more than held their own, and have
even posted some modest gains. The market's record, in fact, has been better
than it looks, primarily because the headline-grabbing Dow Jones industrial
average has been distorted by heavy losses in several influential stocks.
IBM, Merck, Westinghouse and United Technologies, four of the Dow's biggest
constituents, have all suffered over the past days by unexpectedly poor or
disappointing earnings. IBM's figures were particularly distressing, sending
the stock this week to its lowest level in more than a decade.
Other measures of stock price performance, meanwhile, such as the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500, the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks, and the Dow
Jones Transportation Average, have all put in a strong showing.
The transportation average, widely seen as a useful leading indicator of
economic conditions, recorded its highest close since early August on
Thursday after an impressive one-day gain, a sign to analysts that the wider
market may also be rising soon. The S&amp;P 500 has been on a roll since early
October, heading towards its year high and gaining the equivalent of about
100 points on the Dow, while the Nasdaq composite has been in equally fine
form.
There have been other, technical, signs of strength in the market. The fact
that trading volume has been unusually high - more than 200m shares have
been traded each session for the past six days - suggests that investor
interest in the market may be reviving. In recent days volume has been
especially heavy on 'upticks' (moments when stocks are rising), a
traditionally bullish sign to those hawk-like analysts who watch the ticker
every day.
The derivatives markets in Chicago also has something to say about the
outlook for equities. Stronger demand for stock-index put options than for
stock-index call options might, at first glance, seem negative for the
market. After all, anyone who buys put options is betting on share prices to
fall. But to contrary-minded investors, the level of bearishness indicated
by a high put-call ratio is a happy portent. It implies pessimism about the
market may be close to peaking, which for the brave is always a good moment
to buy stocks.
While few are suggesting that the market is poised for a major advance, if
stocks can survive what remains of the corporate earnings season, and the
final week and a half of the election campaign, relatively unscathed, then
the foundations for an upbeat ending to the year may be in place.
There is even the possibility that investors might actually celebrate a
Clinton victory after November 3. The bond market may not like his plans for
big increases in government spending and middle-class tax cuts, but to
equity investors frustrated by President Bush's willingness to do anything
positive to end the economic malaise, the thought of a substantial fiscal
boost for the economy is more than welcome.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Markets: Dividends; it's time for caution - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOOMSDAY for dividends? That is the sombre title of a new review of the
investment trust sector from County NatWest's gurus Hamish Buchan and Robin
Angus.
The premise is that the cuts in dividends which have been occurring across
the UK corporate sector have yet to be felt by investment trust
shareholders. There is a natural lag in the system, with trusts still paying
out dividends earned in 1991 and early 1992. But the corollary is that trust
dividends will really start to show the pain in 1993.
Some may be able to meet the deficit by drawing on their revenue reserves
(which is what reserves are for). But other high-yielding trusts may have
few reserves to draw on. They might therefore try to maintain dividends by
buying high-yielding securities, at the expense of capital performance.
In short, the investment trust sector cannot escape the pain being suffered
in the real economy. County points out that UK corporate dividends fell in
nominal terms in the year to August, for the first time since 1967.
Meanwhile dividend cover - the ratio of corporate earnings to dividend
payments - has slumped to well under two, below the historical average. This
implies that, even when profits recover, dividends will not grow in line.
Before this sounds too gloomy, one should emphasise County's view that
'there is no cause for undue concern about the large diversified trusts or
income trusts.' For example, Foreign &amp; Colonial, the biggest trust in the
sector, is given a 'strong' dividend paying rating by the County team.
One should also point out the problem highlighted on Page III, namely that
returns from building societies are falling. With bonus cuts in the life
industry and the unit trust also facing dividend payment problems, private
investors should not be frightened away from investment trusts altogether;
the sector might still offer better returns than the other options.
Investors have to learn that returns across the savings field are likely to
be lower for the next few years than they were in the 1980s. Single rather
than double digit returns may be the norm.
So the best strategy might be to make switches within the investment trust
field, rather than to abandon the sector altogether. Back in April, I
suggested that those who had opted for the M&amp;G Income Investment Trust Pep
in the 1991-92 tax year might consider a transfer, now that the rules have
changed to allow a full Pounds 6,000 Pep allowance to be placed in an
existing, rather than merely a new issue, trust. The argument still applies.
The M&amp;G trust stands at a 9 per cent premium to its asset value; you can buy
perfectly respectable long-standing trusts at a 10 per cent discount. A
switch might result in a temporary loss of income, but it should boost the
long term prospects for both income and capital growth. Sadly, the market
has moved against you. In April, you could have made the switch and still
have seen a profit on the 100p issue price; yesterday morning, however, the
packaged units were down to 95p.
Which trusts should you switch to? County NatWest cite a number of trusts
which rank as 'strong' dividend payers, including Electric and General,
Foreign and Colonial Smaller Companies, River &amp; Mercantile Extra Income and
Value &amp; Income. All the above stand at a discount and qualify for the full
Pounds 6,000 Pep. But a stockbroker should be able to advise you on the most
suitable trusts and the transfer costs.
Another part of the investment trust sector which came under scrutiny this
week was zero coupon preference shares. These have been popular with private
investors, because they offer the prospect of tax-free gain (for those who
do not use up their annual CGT allowance).
In a new report, Smith New Court argues that the market has failed to give
sufficient weight to portfolio yield when valuing stocks. The argument is
similar to County Nat West's. The assets of most split capital investment
trusts have to grow substantially to repay the zeros. If the trust's
portfolio consists of high-yielding assets, then such capital growth might
be impossible. So the higher the portfolio yield, the worse for the zeros.
After assessing these factors, Smith New Court cites the zeros of the
following trusts as 'very good value': Exeter Preferred, Finsbury Growth,
New Throgmorton, Sphere and TR Technology. The following zeros are ranked as
'dear': Abtrust Preferred, Contra-Cyclical, EFM Income, Exmoor Dual, Olim
Convertible and Scottish National.
Such is the complexity of these instruments that private investors with
large lump sums should take expert advice from a stockbroker before plunging
into the sector.
But the small saver who is investing Pounds 50 a month into a large general
trust via a savings scheme should not be too panicked by all these
calculations. Provided they are saving for the long term - at least five
years - the investment trust remains one of the cheapest and most attractive
vehicles in the market.

FT  24 OCT 92 / China warns of turmoil over Patten's HK plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA yesterday vowed to reverse democratic reforms proposed for Hong Kong
by its governor, Mr Chris Patten, if he introduces them without Beijing's
consent.
In an uncompromising one-hour statement which underlined the deep rift
between Britain and China, Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong
affairs, warned of confrontation and turmoil in the colony during the
transition from British to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
He cast doubt over the future of Hong Kong's HKDollars 163.5bn (Pounds 13bn)
airport project, saying China would not honour debt agreements or contracts
if Mr Patten proceeded with construction without agreement on financing. It
would deny flights originating from the airport the right to use Chinese air
space, he said.
China's hard-line response to Mr Patten's proposals, at the end of his
three-day visit to Beijing, sets the stage for a struggle for hearts and
minds in Hong Kong. The first test of local reaction to Lu's ultimatum will
come today when Mr Patten makes a statement to the colony's Legislative
Council.
Lu accused Mr Patten of violating the 1984 Anglo-Chinese Joint Declaration
on Hong Kong and of making proposals incompatible with the Basic Law, Hong
Kong's post-1997 constitution. He alleged that Britain had repudiated
agreements reached between Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, and
Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, concerning the pace of
democratisation.
Lu said Mr Hurd had written to Qian agreeing in principle that the colony's
1995 elections should be carried out according to 'arrangements' put forward
by China, including those for an election committee.
In London, the Foreign Office said messages had passed between Britain and
China in 1990 in an attempt to agree on proposals for the 1995 elections. It
had not been possible, however, to agree on all aspects of the elections.
Mr Patten's proposal - that the election committee, which under the Basic
Law will elect 10 members of the Legislative Council, should itself be
elected - thus fell outside the Basic Law and did not contravene it.
Lu said if Mr Patten went ahead with his proposals, China would disown them
in 1997 and construct an executive branch of government, a legislature and a
judiciary that conformed to its understanding of the Basic Law.
'If convergence with the Basic Law is not taken into consideration then that
will undermine (prospects for) a smooth transition. Such a position will
only lead to turmoil in Hong Kong,' Lu said.
The British government yesterday repeated its support for Mr Patten's plans,
saying it wished to maintain co-operation with Beijing.

FT  24 OCT 92 / London hospitals begin fight against closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL of London's most famous hospitals yesterday began fighting for their
own lives as the government published plans for radical changes in the
capital's healthcare.
Under the proposals, St Bartholomew's, a world-famous, 869-year-old
institution in the City, would close in an amalgamation with the Royal
London. The Middlesex would close and Guy's and St Thomas' would be
amalgamated. Charing Cross would close, although its buildings could be used
to house specialist services.
Ministers will make final decisions on the recommendations, in a report from
Sir Bernard Tomlinson, former chairman of the Northern Regional Health
Authority, in the new year.
Although publication of the report provoked angry opposition from staff at
the threatened institutions, there is widespread recognition that the number
of hospital beds in London will be reduced.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, welcomed the report's broad
conclusions that hospital services in London needed to be rationalised, with
a strengthening of family doctor and community services.
But her refusal to guarantee that any savings resulting from hospital
closures would be channelled into improving primary and community care in
London angered Labour MPs when she announced publication of the report in
the Commons.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, feared that the government would
use the report as an excuse to cut NHS spending. While accepting that the
'status quo is not an option', Mr Blunkett said inadequate health care for
the people of London could not be an option either.
He coupled demands for increased spending on primary and community care with
a pledge that Labour MPs would seek to protect jobs of health workers.
Mr Blunkett was joined by other Labour MPs in demanding that receipts from
the sale of valuable hospital sites should not be used to assist Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, in holding down public expenditure.
In the long term, it is thought that transferring services from hospitals to
the community sector would have a neutral financial effect.
But some health analysts are concerned that Sir Bernard's calculation of the
additional transitional costs involved - about Pounds 150m - is
substantially lower than other estimates.

FT  24 OCT 92 / City gains limited concessions over insider trading
legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to proceed with planned legislation on insider dealing in
spite of strong opposition in the City of London, although it announced some
concessions yesterday.
An earlier version of the draft legislation had worried bankers and brokers
who claimed it would outlaw many accepted market practices. Listed companies
feared they would find it difficult to talk to analysts or large investors
without falling foul of the new law.
The latest draft provisions, published in the Criminal Justice Bill, have
been amended to take account of some of these concerns. An exemption has
been added, for instance, for companies which secretly build up stakes in
others in preparation for a full takeover bid. Under the original draft,
this would have amounted to insider dealing.
However, the Treasury, which is responsible for the legislation, has not
changed other provisions which have aroused concern. The definition of
'insider information' in the Bill is as broadly worded as in the previous
draft. Analysts have said this would make their job almost impossible.
Officials indicated yesterday that the City was wrong to fear that this
represented an extension of the law, since all the offences covered in the
Bill are covered by the existing law.
The Treasury said it would issue guidance notes on how the new law would be
interpreted.
Although the guidance will not have the force of law, it is intended to make
City professionals feel more confident that some practices will not lead to
insider dealing prosecutions.
Yesterday's Bill drew a lukewarm initial response in the City. The London
Stock Exchange said: 'Certainly some of our concerns would appear to have
been looked at. But what they haven't done is take the opportunity to take
more a radical review.'
The Bill is also intended to make it easier to prosecute international fraud
cases in the UK and will extend the offence of laundering money from
drug-related offences to cover laundering of proceeds from any crime.
Officials said an average of 17 cases of fraud a year cannot be prosecuted
in the UK because existing law only allows a case to be tried there if the
final part of the fraud is committed in the country. The change in the law
would catch frauds similar to that alleged to have occurred at the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International.

FT  24 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Insider dealing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new Criminal Justice Bill is a wasted opportunity to clean up the UK's
muddled laws on insider dealing. Not before time, the offence is extended to
cover the gilts market. The Treasury has withdrawn some earlier proposals
that would compromise the legitimate working of the equity market. Its claim
that the new law is no different in substance from existing legislation may
mean a reprieve for those infamous but less and less liquid brokers'
lunches. Yet, apart from placing the onus firmly on the defendant to prove
there is no criminal intent, the new law offers nothing to help prosecute
genuine cases of insider dealing.
Some elements of the bill are, if anything, more confusing than before. To
accommodate Brussels, information must be 'specific or precise' to count as
inside information. This would cover dealing in gilts on the basis of inside
knowledge of a cut in interest rates. But prior knowledge of the contents of
inflation statistics or balance of payments data would not count because the
information is too general. The uncertainty is so great that lawyers must
already be totting up their fees.
In other respects, the definition of inside information is also still
worryingly broad, covering any price-sensitive information which relates to
a company. This could include knowledge of a distant competitor or supplier.
Brokers' analysts may still need to consult the promised guidance notes
before they go to lunch. One can only hope the Treasury makes a better fist
of drafting them.

FT  24 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: British Airways
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If BA can get away with it, yesterday's purchase of Dan-Air for a nominal
Pounds 1 appears to be a shrewd deal. Buying an existing business is
generally better than picking up pieces from the receiver. Preserving a few
hundred jobs in the current economic climate must be worth a few brownie
points. The combination of BA's marketing clout and a proportionately lower
Gatwick overhead - existing BA staff there are being offered inducements to
accept lower pay - means that Dan-Air's routes could be profitable as early
as next year.
The cost to BA is admittedly vague - but then the numbers being talked about
would not even purchase a jumbo jet. There will be operating losses in the
short term and perhaps Pounds 35m of restructuring costs will be charged to
shareholders' funds. What remains to be seen, given the soft second-hand
market, is whether the sale of some of Dan-Air's surplus 727s will lead to
future book losses. At least BA's balance sheet can comfortably absorb the
shock for the time being. Mr Branson's Virgin group might have been engaging
in a substantially greater risk.
There is always a chance the regulators kick up a fuss. The odds, though,
must favour BA, given the availability of Gatwick slots and a lack of any
other way to ensure even Dan-Air's partial survival. The worry for BA
shareholders is that, with the USAir deal looming too, even small deals
bring closer the day when they may be asked to subscribe to a rights issue.

FT  24 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Limited headroom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Devaluations have often been good for the UK equity market, at least in the
short run. Overseas earnings account for 50 per cent of the profits of
companies in the FT-A All-Share index, and for more than half in the case of
the FT-SE 100. But history is not the only guide. This time, corporate debt
is high and dividend cover low. Most of any earnings improvement from
devaluation may be retained to rebuild balance sheets.
That prospect makes yield valuations of the equity market unreliable.
Comparing dividend yields to inflation or gilt yields suggests that shares
are not expensive, but earnings tell a different story. The market rating is
fast approaching the heady levels last seen in early 1987. Such valuations
might be sustainable given falling inflation, but expectations in that
respect may turn out to have been too sanguine next year. If so, long gilt
yields would rise and equity ratings fall. Share prices are thus unlikely to
rise more than earnings in 1993.
In the short run, the equity market also seems over-optimistic about
economic recovery. The benefit of lower interest rates may be offset by the
government's tightening fiscal stance. And US experience suggests it may
take a long time for falling rates to have much impact. The relative
performance of different equity market sectors since devaluation is thus
harder to understand. The largest rises since Black Wednesday have come from
composite insurers, property and construction. True these sectors had been
badly hit this year. But so far, the only guaranteed beneficiaries of the
ERM debacle are the overseas earners.

FT  24 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Policy shift momentum begins to fade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEEK of high drama and big swings in sentiment in the London stock market
ended with share prices still on the upward track. However, there were
distinct signs that the implications of the big shifts in policy by the UK
Government over the past five days, plus the easing in monetary policy by
the German authorities may now be fully discounted by the equity market.
Sterling's continued strength against the D-Mark left the equity market firm
yesterday, but not before the market had taken a hard look at the recent
upsurge in share prices.
The equity market began the session on an extremely cautious note with
marketmakers, known to have been given a rough ride during the market's
recent upsurge, happy to chop their opening dealing levels as a number of
the big 'action' funds moved to lock in profits achieved over the past few
trading sessions.
Marketmakers were keen to absorb the early selling, which filled in some of
the short positions built up during the recent rise in the market. At its
worst of the day the Footsie 100 index was down over 18 points. However, the
steep early fall encouraged at least two large UK institutions to return to
the market as hefty buyers of many cyclical stocks.
The burst of institutional buying, accompanied by general buying across the
market as well as bouts of profit-taking saw the Footsie 100 advance to
2,677.0, a rise of almost 19 points, in mid-morning before it ran out of
steam.
Then, activity on both the buy and sell side dwindled and the Footsie 100
drifted into negative territory during the early afternoon before rallying
and moving ahead as the week drew to a close. At its final reading the
Footsie 100 was 11.6 higher at 2,669.7. Over the week, it has risen 105.8
points, or 4.13 per cent.
This week, which has witnessed the fifth anniversary of the 'Great Crash of
1987' has seen Mr Major's Conservative Government change course on its
wholesale pit closures and economic policy. The Prime Minister's new 'growth
and recovery programme', coincided with an easing in Germany's monetary
policy.
Turnover yesterday, despite the early burst of institutional buying,
totalled 586.3m shares, well below Thursday's 727.9m and Wednesday's 850m.
But traders have been heartened by this week's sustained increase in the
level of retail turnover. Customer business in London on Thursday was just
short of Pounds 1.3bn.
Customer, or retail, business increased this week as institutions have
responded to the Government's 'dash for growth' policy.

FT  24 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST day of an otherwise busy week in the derivatives turned out
volatile as political worries and optimism about a cut in UK base rates each
took their turn in a session where volume returned to more modest levels,
writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened at 2,681, the December contract on the FT-SE edged higher
before political worries led to a brief retreat. When talk of an interest
rates cut once again started to appear, buyers sent it upwards to reach the
day's high of 2,724 mid-morning.
Late morning profit-taking was followed by renewed demand and the firm early
performance on Wall Street helped to underpin buying in the afternoon when
December traded in a range 2,700 and 2,720. As has been the case through out
the week, the contract traded at a good premium to cash for the whole
session though dealers said arbitrage was reduced. December finished at
2,721, on turnover of 7,334.
Traded options remained dull with volume reaching only 24,902 lots. Around
10,830 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 contract, while HSBC was the
most active stock option.

FT  24 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Chinese concerns hit HSBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKING group HSBC was one of the principal casualties in the FT-SE 100
Index yesterday. Political and technical factors conspired to leave shares
in the international bank 20 lower at 480p.
The stock had spiked up sharply from just over 400p at the start of the
month as the Hong Kong stock market raced up and UK investors piled into
HSBC as a hedge against a weak pound. Yesterday, news that China was
threatening to pull out of a deal to build a new airport on the island sent
sent tremors through a number of Far Eastern stocks.
This coincided with a note from County NatWest pointing out that the Hong
Kong market had reached an all-time high and it was time to take profits in
selected stocks.
As a result, the HSBC ordinary shares opened 10 off and moved down steadily
throughout the day attracting consistent sellers and final turnover of 6.2m
shares. However, County's banking analyst Mr John Aitken said institutions
who had been up to strength in Midland were left 60 per cent underweight by
the HSBC takeover and were still trying to get up to strength. Cable &amp;
Wireless was also affected by the political worries and the shares fell 12
to 595p.
Shell down again
Integrated oil company Shell Transport was hit by a strong sell note. In a
market that seemed to lack direction Shell shares moved sharply down at the
start of trading and closed a net 6 lower at 529p with 5.9m traded.
County NatWest's oils analyst Mr Fergus Macleod, who has already issued two
bearish notes on the stock this month, published an internal note that
reflected a hardened opinion on the shares.
He said there were no immediate prospects for an upturn in the European
petrochemicals market and Shell's P/E relative to the market is at an
all-time high with the yield close to its low. He cut his 1993 profit
forecast by Pounds 230m to Pounds 2.57bn and warned of further downgradings
if the trend continues.
Interest was revived in the tour operators on two counts. First, leading
charter airline Dan Air announced a takeover and then the recent persistent
bid talk in the sector resurfaced. The takeover and restructuring of Dan Air
by British Airways takes some one million seats out of the charter market,
according to analysts. They say it boosts, among others, the integrated tour
groups Airtours and Owners Abroad, both of which maintain their own
airlines. They were also lifted by the publication of figures which showed
bookings for next year 10 per cent ahead on the same period a year ago.
Sources close to Owners yesterday denied a story that the group was
considering a management buy-out and confirmed that negotiations with German
holiday group LTU were continuing. LTU is said to be interested in a
substantial stake in Owners, Britain's second biggest tour operator.
Airtours, also a rumoured predator, is known to be monitoring the situation.
The renewed talk, together with the Dan Air and booking news, lifted
Airtours 13 to 225p. Owners was steady at 74p.
BA eased 4 to 305p. However, one analyst said the move was good for BA as it
'is not very dilutive, and it strengthens BA's position at Gatwick and its
European feeder services.'
In a strong hotel sector, Stakis was the best performer on suggestions that
it was considering the flotation of its nursing homes subsidiary. Another
version had a management buy-out as favourite. Either way, the company,
which has debts of some Pounds 180m, would hope to raise upwards of Pounds
50m. Recent institutional presentation were also said to have been well
received. The shares rose 5 1/2 to 32 1/2 p. Queens Moat gained 3 to 38p in
large turnover of 9.1m, the top traded stock of the day. Forte added 5 to
179p on raised hopes that its Gardner Merchant subsidiary may soon be sold.
Compass Group, which failed in its bid for the catering group, has renewed
its interest. The shares rose 7 to 442p.
ICI fell 20 to 1047p as nervousness grew ahead of third quarter figures next
Thursday. Hoare Govett reaffirmed a cautious stance on the stock saying the
industrial outlook continues awkward in the light of deteriorating
industrial figures and profit estimates are still on the high side.
News that the government's Health and Safety Executive is to prosecute
industrial chemicals group Allied Colloids following a fire in July at the
company's raw materials warehouse hit the shares which fell 8 to 212p.
Vodafone rose 6 to 377p, helped by an upgrade from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The
house is looking for Pounds 310m this year, up from Pounds 295m, impressed
by the response to the telecoms group's new 'Low Call' service and the
stimulus it has provided to the rest of its services.
Reuters Holdings bounced 21 to 1223p following an international conference
call on Thursday night by the chief executive. SG Warburg was encouraged by
what it saw as veiled good news and told clients to look for buying
opportunities. However, there is a definite two-way pull on the stock and
agency broker James Capel sees no reason to change its view that the stock
is overrated.
SG Warburg was positive on Carlton Communications. The shares lifted 7 to
725p.
Thames Television rose 5 to 174p on reports that Silvio Berlusconi's
Fininvest could become a leading shareholder in the company's Channel 5 bid.
A recommendation from Smith New Court to take profits in the short-term in
Tate &amp; Lyle held back the shares which retreated 11 to 357p. The broker also
moved to a buy in Unigate as a good yield stock. The shares fell back 5 to
263p. Hanson's bid document for RHM caused little stir with most brokers
still advising clients to wait for an improved offer. RHM rose 2 to 249p,
Hanson edged forward a penny to 233p.
Shares in BM Group climbed 7 to 77p, boosted by a favourable analysts visit
to the company on Thursday. A shortage of stock left Hunting 8 better at
163p. Profit-takers gained the upper hand in GKN and early gains were
surrendered to leave the shares only a penny firmer at 415p. Lucas
Industries was in demand and closed 2 up at 107p.
A profits downgrading said to have come from Kleinwort Benson knocked Ocean
Group. The shares fell 15 to 189p.
Fears over Hong Kong hurt several other stocks. These included Inchcape
which derives a substantial part of its revenue from the territory. It fell
14 to 504p, in trade of 2.1m, while shares in Trafalgar House, a member of
the consortium building a bridge that is part of the airport project, eased
a penny to 87 1/2 p, on the same worries.
Wellcome, which is to publish full-year figures on Wednesday improved 9 to
991p, following recent US profit-taking.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Coffee
price rally back in gear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COFFEE market engaged forward gear again this week after consolidating
the substantial gains achieved at the beginning of the month. At the London
Futures and Options Exchange the January robustas contract was yesterday
pushed through the psychologically important Dollars 900-a-tonne level to
close at an eight-month high of Dollars 903 a tonne, up Dollars 47 on the
week.
Prices were down in both London and New York on Monday but the following day
saw technically-inspired gains in New York's arabica market help London's
robusta contract to regain its recent six-month high of Dollars 868 a tonne
in the January position.
That milestone was quickly passed as traders enjoyed what one called 'a
total turnround in market sentiment'. That was attributed chiefly to the
smaller crop in Brazil, the biggest producer, which last week said it had
exported only 1m bags (60 kg each) in September, compared with 1.6m in
September 1991.
Resistance appeared on Thursday when the Dollars 900 was approached, but as
that level was breached yesterday a few stop-loss buying orders were
triggered and the January price moved on to Dollars 905 a tonne.
Long-liquidation pushed it below Dollars 900 again, but the buyers were not
to be out-done and soon had it back close to the highs.
The changed mood of the market was well illustrated by one dealer's comment
to the Reuter news agency yesterday. 'We could see a 2 or 3 cent setback
(equivalent to Dollars 44 to Dollars 66 a tonne),' he said, 'but it would be
good for the market; we'd get rid of some short-term longs and then we could
build again.'
This optimism has even extended to expectations of the next round of talks
on renegotiating the International Coffee Agreement, scheduled for the end
of next month.
The achievements of talks held so far have been far from impressive - the
kindest thing one New York analyst could find to say at the conclusion of
the September round was: 'At least they (producer and consumer delegates)
didn't strangle each other like they did in July'. But one London trader
suggested this week that the recent price recovery might encourage delegates
to redouble their efforts to thrash out an accord. 'They won't want to let
go the ground we have gained under such difficult circumstances,' he said.
Cocoa prices also made good ground, with London's March futures position
gaining Pounds 29 on the week to Pounds 709 a tonne. The upturn began on
Monday, helped by the pound's weakness, but the key development was a 'chart
reversal' in New York on Monday night.
Dealers noted that the advance was being held back by 'scale-up selling' but
thought the market was 'in for a good run' once that dried up. 'It looks
like the manufacturers have probably bought from the trade more (Ivory Coast
cocoa) than currently seems to be available,' one said yesterday. The Ivory
Coast is the biggest producer but has recently been holding back supplies
from the market.
The annual London Metal Exchange Week began pretty dismally with copper
dipping on Monday to a 4 1/2 -month low, zinc to an eight-month low and
aluminium to a nine-month low. Nickel, meanwhile, was uncomfortably close to
a 31-month low.
By last night's close the only LME metal showing a gain on the week was
copper - up Pounds 31.50 at Pounds 1,383 a tonne for cash - and that was
entirely due to sterling's decline against the US dollar.
The week's most substantial decline was in cash zinc, which fell by Dollars
31.50 to Dollars 1,109 a tonne as flagging sentiment was further undermined
by Chinese liquidation. Tin was another big loser, cash metal ending Dollars
77.50 down at Dollars 5,877.50 a tonne.
But perhaps the most disappointing performer was aluminium. Early in the
week news of a 600-tonne rise in average daily output between August and
September, which came as no surprise, was outweighed by bullish technical
factors. But the rise later in the week that followed an announcement by
VAW, the German metals group, that it was cutting its aluminium output by
105,000 tonnes to about 300,000 tonnes a year was quickly snuffed out by
long liquidation.
The LME announced yesterday that stocks of aluminium in its registered
warehouses had grown by another 16,375 tonnes, which underlined the need for
further substantial production cuts to bring the market back into balance,
at least in the short term.

ADVANTA Management Group has acquired 50 per cent of Berliner Kempinski, the
hotel chain, for an undisclosed sum, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.
Twenty-three per cent was acquired from Lufthansa and the rest from Rolaco
of Geneva.
Advanta also has a 20-year option to buy Lufthansa's remaining 20 per cent,
with the right to exercise the option after seven years. Rolaco has retained
10 per cent.
Earlier this month Lufthansa and Advanta confirmed that they were holding
talks on Kempinski. The move by Lufthansa to divest its Kempinski stake came
after an unsuccessful attempt to merge the hotels with Air France's Meridien
luxury chain.

FT  24 OCT 92 / International Company News: Goodyear surges to Dollars
103.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOODYEAR, the last surviving large US-owned tyre company, yesterday reported
third-quarter net profits of Dollars 103.3m, up sharply from Dollars 59.1m a
year ago.
The Akron-based company said in September it expected to achieve
third-quarter earnings per share higher than the Dollars 1.01 per share
recorded in the same period last year; the 1992 quarterly earnings per share
were Dollars 1.44.
Goodyear said its improved third-quarter results had been helped by the
introduction of new products and a strengthened distribution network.
Interest expenses were also lower, although advertising costs were higher.
Revenues in the third quarter were Dollars 3bn, in line with earlier
forecasts by the company and compared with Dollars 2.8bn a year ago.
In the first nine months of 1992 Goodyear had net profits of Dollars 279.3m,
compared with a loss of Dollars 8.5m in the same period of 1991.
Revenues for the nine months were Dollars 8.9bn, up from Dollars 8.1bn
Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, said Goodyear's replacement tyre sales remained
strong in the US, and he claimed that the company was gaining market share.
On Wall Street, Goodyear's share price improved by Dollars 1 1/8 after the
results were published, to Dollars 66 7/8 .

FT  24 OCT 92 / International Company News: Elkem shares tumble on
disappointing results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Elkem, the troubled Norwegian light metals producer, fell sharply
yesterday when the company announced a pre-tax loss before extraordinary
items of NKr367m (Dollars 59.72m) - the same as for the previous
corresponding period.
The depth of Elkem's problems were highlighted after it was disclosed that
the company has approached the industry ministry to help strengthen its
capital base. Elkem is seeking exemption from Norway's electricity tax and
new taxes on electricity production or use.
The group's equity-to-debt ratio has weakened to 20 per cent from 22 per
cent since January.
The company last month sought postponement by the government of a NKr270m
loan used to acquire a 45 per cent stake in former state-owned Norsk Jern
Holding, which controls steel production and distribution companies.
Elkem announced its nine-month figures three days earlier than originally
planned in order to stem speculation in its shares. The A shares closed
NKr5.50 down to NKr21.50 yesterday as Free shares shed NKr4 to NKr28.
Elkem blamed its troubles on a weak market but said it is taking measures to
strengthen long-term financing.
Group sales fell by NKr423m to NKr5.44bn but operating losses narrowed to
NKr20m from NKr97m.
Pre-tax losses after extraordinary items widened to NKr307m from NKr188m
last year. The company made a NKr60m profit on the sale of Elkem Eiendom, a
real estate subsidiary. In the same period last year, it returned a NKr179m
profit on the disposal of its 50 per cent stake in Alcoa Nederland Holding.

FT  24 OCT 92 / International Company News: Charges push New York Times into
the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECIAL charges related to the closing of a regional newspaper caused The
New York Times Company to suffer a Dollars 33.9m third-quarter loss,
compared with a Dollars 1.9m net profit a year ago. The loss, which
translates into a deficit of 43 cents per share, against earnings of 3 cents
a share a year ago, was struck on revenues that were 9.2 per cent improved
at Dollars 429.7m.
The third-quarter charges included a pre-tax Dollars 48m write-off from the
closing of The Gwinnett Daily News in Georgia and Dollars 3m of costs at a
new printing and distribution plant.
For the first nine months of 1992, The New York Times had a loss of Dollars
4.7m on revenues of Dollars 1.31bn, compared with a 1991 nine-month net
profit of Dollars 12.4m on revenues of Dollars 1.25bn.
The nine-month result was also affected by Dollars 20m of second-quarter
charges related to severance payments.
The newspaper division, including The Times, 31 regional papers and 50 per
cent of the International Herald Tribune, benefited from higher advertising
revenues and earned Dollars 14.6m in the third quarter before charges,
compared with Dollars 10.1m a year ago.
The magazines division made an operating profit of just below Dollars 1m,
compared with a loss of the same amount a year ago. Broadcasting and
information services achieved operating income of Dollars 3.5m in the
quarter, against Dollars 2.9m a year ago.

FT  24 OCT 92 / International Company News: Japanese brokers report
first-half losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S leading securities houses reported losses for the first half, and
Nomura Securities, the largest broker, also suffered a serious loss of face
by falling behind Daiwa Securities for the first time.
Brokers blamed their poor performance on the continuing weakness of prices
and turnover on the Tokyo stock market, as well as a fall in underwriting
fees and a halving of their financial revenue.
The earnings figures would have been worse if all brokers had written off
the losses on their securities holdings. In an attempt to encourage the
market in August, the finance ministry allowed the houses to delay the
write-off until the end of the fiscal year in March.
Nomura, Daiwa, and Nikko Securities reported small pre-tax profits, while
Daiwa reported zero after-tax profits and Nomura and Nikko had net losses.
Yamaichi Securities, the final member of the Big Four, reported a pre-tax
loss of Y19.3bn (Dollars 160m), up from a Y5.4bn loss last year, and an
after-tax loss of Y15.8bn, up from Y3.8bn.
All the brokers are forecasting improved results for the second half, but
the renewed weakness of Tokyo prices in recent weeks has prompted companies
to broaden their cost-cutting programmes, which include scaling down
international operations and closing unprofitable domestic branches.
The country's 10 second-tier brokers are under extreme pressure, with
pre-tax losses ranging from Y3.8bn at Tokyo Securities to the Y18.9bn at New
Japan Securities, which admitted that 'our revival plan was not strong
enough for us to make a profit'.
When the first half began, most brokers reckoned that the daily average
trading volume in Tokyo would be around Y350bn, but the actual figure was
Y258bn. Trading volumes have remained weak since the second half of this
month, but brokers have based their full-year forecasts on an optimistic
turnover figure of around Y350bn.
Nomura said the stock market was weighed down by the worsening domestic
economy and poor corporate earnings. The company reported a 39.6 per cent
fall in stock brokerage commissions, and a 77.4 per cent fall in the total
value of stocks underwritten by the company.
These large declines were common throughout the industry, though there was
an improvement in many brokers' bond dealings. Nomura reported a Y15.8bn
profit on its trading in bonds, while the total amount of bonds underwritten
fell 17.8 per cent on the same period last year.
At Yamaichi, which has launched the deepest restructuring of the Big Four,
the lack of enthusiasm among individual investors was seen in 28 per cent
fall in commission income on investment trusts. Ordinary Japanese investors
turned away from the market after the collapse of prices and a spate of
stock scandals last year.
Individuals have been net buyers so far this month, and the second-tier
brokers, who are more dependent on individuals as customers, will be reliant
on a continuing increase to improve their profits. But many second-tier
companies have already conceded that it will be difficult to turn a profit
this year, and New Japan forecast a pre-tax loss of Y19bn, an improvement on
last year's loss of Y44bn.

FT  24 OCT 92 / International Company News: Baltica moves to shore up
capital base ahead of expected deficit

<TEXT>
BALTICA, the Danish insurance group, is to strengthen its capital base ahead
of a loss which is expected to reach between DKr2.5bn and DKr2.8bn (Dollars
430m-Dollars 482m) this year.
That would cut shareholders' equity from DKr9.2bn at the end of 1991 to
about DKr4.5bn at the end of 1992, and the group will not pay a dividend for
1992.
The group has shored up Baltica Holdings, its parent company, by selling
32.35 per cent of its shares in Baltica Insurance to Den Danske Bank at
DKr1,512 per share, which will raise DKr2.5bn. The deal gives Baltica the
right to buy back the shares before the end of 1993.
The holding company is selling some of its shares in France's Suez, in which
Baltica has a total stake of just under 3 per cent, but this will not affect
the co-operation agreement with Suez and Victoire, the insurance group
controlled by Suez. Suez has a 23.4 per cent stake in Baltica Holding.
Baltica said it will also sell its 4.9 per cent holding in Skandia, the
Swedish insurer.
In its first-half statement in August, Baltica reported a DKr991m loss, but
said it expected a better second half. However, the group has subsequently
had to make a DKr600m write-off on a property investment in Gibraltar and
additional property write-offs of DKr200m.
It also expects a loss of DKr300m in Baltica Bank, double the earlier
forecast.
Baltica Insurance is injecting DKr500m into Baltica Bank, which received
lower credit ratings recently, and making a DKr500m deposit with the bank.
The group said that Baltica Holding expects to make a profit in 1993.
Jyske Bank reported a third-quarter loss of DKr400m, taking the operating
loss for the year so far to DKr913m. The total loss for the year is expected
to be about DKr1bn.

FT  24 OCT 92 / International Company News: Exxon and Mobil slightly ahead
in third quarter

<TEXT>
EXXON and Mobil, the two biggest US oil and natural gas groups, yesterday
reported third-quarter net profits that were only slightly improved
year-on-year.
Exxon said its third-quarter net income was Dollars 1.135bn, compared with
Dollars 1.115bn in the same period last year. That translates into earnings
per share of 90 cents, two cents higher than a year ago. Exxon added,
however, that with extraordinary items stripped out its year-to-year
improvement was 6 per cent.
Mobil reported a 13 per cent rise in third-quarter net profits, to Dollars
413m. That was Dollars 1.00 per share in the 1992 third quarter, compared to
87 cents a year ago.
However, the company said that with extraordinary items stripped out its
third-quarter 1992 net would be 11 per cent higher than last year.
Mobil also announced that from January 1 next year it would start
reorganising its European sales, marketing and administrative activities.
The reorganisation would see the full range of Mobil's business placed in
three new profit centres - refining, fuels marketing and lubricants
marketing. Revenues from these businesses in Europe last year amounted to
Dollars 14.87bn out of total worldwide revenues of Dollars 38bn.
Mobil said the European reorganisation was accounted for as part of the
Dollars 68m of restructuring charges it had written off in the third
quarter.
Some 8,000 of Mobil's 67,000 total employees are employed in these European
activities, although the group said it could not predict how many jobs might
eventually be cut as a result of the reorganisation.
Exxon said its third-quarter revenues were Dollars 30.6bn, up from Dollars
27.5bn a year ago. Third-quarter capital and exploration spending was
Dollars 2.16bn, down from Dollars 2.28bn in the same quarter last year.
For the first nine months of 1992 Exxon's net profit was Dollars 3.44bn, a
sharp drop from the Dollars 4.48bn achieved in the same period of 1991.
The company attributed the slump to unusually high refining margins in early
1991 that resulted from declining crude prices.
Revenues for the first nine months of 1992 were Dollars 86.32bn, up slightly
from Dollars 85.47bn in the same period of last year.
Mobil's net income for the first nine months of 1992 was Dollars 795m, down
from Dollars 1.52bn in the same period of 1991.
On Wall Street, Exxon's share price was unchanged at Dollars 62 while
Mobil's price was up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 63.

<TEXT>
SKANDIA, the leading Swedish insurer, is reviewing the future of its
reinsurance operations in North America, after rejecting a Dollars 500m
offer for the business from the New York-based investment group, John Head &amp;
Partners.
Mr Haakon Lindkvist, Skandia executive vice-president, said the group had
rejected the offer, worth Dollars 20 per share, because it was 'too low'.
He said the group had not received any other offers, but declined to comment
further.
Skandia has already tried to reduce its exposure to North American
reinsurance by selling a majority stake in Skandia America Corp (SAC)
through a public offering.
However, it aborted these plans earlier this month because it could not get
the price it wanted for the shares.
Since then, Mr James Dowd, SAC's chairman and chief executive, has resigned
because of differences over business strategy.
John Head said yesterday that it was still prepared to meet Skandia
executives to discuss the offer.
The US group already has other insurance operations, which are affiliates of
its Head Insurance Investors unit, and it was prepared to subscribe Dollars
60m in preferred stock had Skandia's public offering gone ahead.
Last year SAC produced an SKr59m (Dollars 10.33m) profit for Skandia on
gross premiums of SKr3.2bn.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Tensions at the top: How to relieve the rigours of rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wanted: Men (fewer women can stand the strain these days) to run countries
suffering from doldrums and deficits. Ability to withstand depression would
be useful. Applicants should be ready for a 16-hour day, punctuated by
television debates, budgetary discussions, sandwich lunches to discuss
unemployment, and banquets with other leaders in similar predicaments, when
interpretors will be available. Experience of dealing with opposition
parties and high interest rates essential. The successful candidate may not
see his family for long periods unless in the company of a) TV cameraman, b)
a policeman c) a divorce lawyer.
The pleasures of governing western industrialised countries have seldom
appeared more scant. Few presidents and prime ministers in recent weeks have
been free from the strain of economic woes or electoral misfortune. Leaders
react to the stress in different ways - and some seem to beat it much better
than others.
President Mitterrand likes to emphasise inner calm by never wearing a wrist
watch. This is a sign, some amateur psychologists argue, of a tranquil and
self-sufficient turn of mind (or simply, others say, of lack of
consideration for keeping people waiting). Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime
minister, has been up all night on several recent occasions hammering out
austerity programmes to save the krona. But since the Bildts - who live in a
small central Stockholm apartment - have a one-year old baby, he says he is
used to disturbed nights.
Mr George Bush indulges in frenzied pursuit of leisure, completing a round
of golf in less than two hours, or pursuing fish in a cigar-shaped powerboat
off the coast of Maine. He was rewarded this week by seeing the local
newspaper in the township of Kennebunkport, where he has a holiday home,
endorsing the Democrats for the first time.
Mr John Major is far from being a nervous wreck, as some UK newspapers this
week have tried to depict him. But the British prime minister - whose
predilection for junk food pre-dates his accession to the highest office -
looks thinner than when he won the general election in April. Well before
the general election, aides admitted that he found his cramped Whitehall
living quarters wearisome. After six weeks of working 18 hours a day, the
prime minister is tired and sometimes irritable. Yet those who have spoken
to him this week have been impressed above all by Mr Major's sombre
deter-mination.
One leader who, for all his travails, has not lost his appetite is Mr Helmut
Kohl. Since unification two years ago, the German chancellor has taken an
almost other-worldly approach to his country's problems, refusing to attend
to questions of detail. 'He likes to tell people: 'Get on with it,'' said
one aide yesterday. Mr Kohl can most easily relax over a bottle of wine and
a plate of Saumagen, or stuffed pig's belly - the Rhineland equivalent of
Scottish haggis. His ability to devour real haggis impressed his Scottish
hosts during a visit to Edinburgh last year.
Every year, he takes a two-week spring break at a health resort to cut his
17-stone bulk, and then rapidly puts on weight again. Mr Kohl
conscientiously declined all but a morsel of the main course during one
recent dinner. Afterwards, he wolfed down a dozen apples in 15 minutes to
still his hunger.
Mr Kohl's colleagues are driven close to distraction by his beatific
optimism. One way that Mr Kohl escapes stress is through an extraordinary
capacity to cat-nap whenever he needs it - in aircraft and cars, even in
helicopters - and then wake up, capable of instantly focussing on the next
problem. For all his unruffled appearance, Mr Kohl can show extreme
over-sensitivity. If he has taken any lessons in withstanding the rigours of
office, he seems to have absorbed them from Mr Mitterrand.
After his operation for cancer of the prostate gland last month, the French
president is approaching his 76th birthday on Monday with Sphinx-like
impassiveness.
The president likes where possible to repair to his appartment in the rue de
Bievre, near Notre Dame cathedral on the south bank of the Seine. He takes a
daily after-lunch walk in the streets around the Elysee palace and plays
golf on Mondays, often with his friend Mr Andre Rousselet, chairman of the
Canal Plus pay television station, at the prestigious Golf de Saint-Cloud,
west of Paris. The club is unable to divulge his handicap.
Visitors to an honours-giving ceremony at the Elysee on Wednesday evening
recount that the president was cheerful and alert. Without using notes, he
was able to make short but apt personal speeches to each of the recipients
of decorations.
Like Mr Mitterrand, Spanish prime minister Felipe Gonzalez - favourite
bedside reading: Don Qixote - likes to go walking to get away from it all.
He spends his summer holidays deep in the marshy wilds of the Coto Donana
national park by the southern tip of Spain or, rod in hand, on a fishing
smack in the straights of Gibraltar. He has dug a cabbage plot in the
gardens of his official residence, the Palacio de la Moncloa. Lately, Mr
Gonzalez has developed a passion for cultivating bonsais. He can sometimes
disappear at weekends to tramp the sierras of Castille in search of
incipient saplings that might be added to his mini-tree collection.
The champion in standing up to pressure is Prof Giuliano Amato, Italy's
Socialist 54-year-old prime minister, who has battled with four months of
crisis. Most evenings he returns home exhausted between 1.00 and 1.30 am and
goes almost straight to sleep before waking at around 6 am. Even with his
rational academic's mind, he admits he often wakes early 'with all the
problems crowding in on me and reaching right to the stomach'.
On the few occasions he can relax, Mr Amato likes to stay at home with his
wife, Diana, listen to Mahler records and read. He still likes to pretend he
can lead a private life. On the weekend after Italy's devaluation last
month, he gave the slip to his bodyguards and stood in line at a cinema to
see 'Americans'. For world leaders trying to escape the pains of office, the
best remedy is to try to behave like everyone else.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Letter: Pit calculations ignore damage to confidence in
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr STEFAN SZYMANSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Glyn's letter (October 20) represents the first clear statement
of the cost-benefit calculation involved in shutting down the 31 pits. He
states that the 31 mines produce annually 30m tonnes at a production cost of
Pounds 40 per tonne when the world market price is Pounds 30 per tonne.
Hence the opportunity cost of keeping the pits open is Pounds 300m per year.
Using a real interest rate of 5 per cent, this implies that the cost of
keeping the pits open is Pounds 6bn in present value terms. He then states
that the cost of closure is Pounds 1,320m in the first year and a recurrent
annual cost of Pounds 600m per year thereafter, so long as the redundant
miners remain wholly unemployed.
By this reckoning, the redundant miners could spend up to twelve full years
in unemployment and still the present value of the cost of closure would be
less than the cost of keeping them open. Only if the redundant workers
remained wholly unemployed for 13 or more years would it be cheaper to keep
the pits open.
These calculations ignore the unquantifiable damage to confidence in the
economy caused by announcing closures in the middle of a recession and
possible knock-on effects in other parts of the economy. They assume the gap
between the production cost and the market price does not change and they
also do not attempt to put a value on the personal consequences to miners
and their families of abandoning mining.
However, they do represent the basis on which any well managed business
would make the decision. This has nothing to do with the price of gas, the
government's cowardly reliance on the choices of a rigged market or bogus
appeals to a nebulous national interest.

   From RICHARD SIMMONDS MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I receive many lobbies asking me to promote the excellence of the City
of London and to help establish its position as the banking and financial
centre of the European Community.
During the past week, I sought to change into sterling BFr 50,000, through
one of Britain's high street banks. With a mid-point between buy and sell of
almost BFr 50 to the pound, this bank, of which I have been a customer for
30 years, offered me Pounds 912.17. With the same mid-point, a Belgian bank
offered me Pounds 970.0.
If this is typical of British bank practice, I need to be re-convinced
before promoting its excellence.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEVEN T SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It seems a very odd response to a problem created by lending too much,
to permit even more to be lent ('Borrowing rule change for housing market',
October 21).
It may be the expedient answer in the present situation - expedient for the
lenders, that is - but unless it is made impossible in the future for
lenders to look beyond the value of the property for repayment, the problem
will persist.
It is naive but understandable that borrowers rely for advice on those in
whose interest it is to lend the maximum. . If liability is limited to the
value of the mortgaged property, lenders will take their position more
responsibly.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Letter: Echoes of Keynes in arguments over support for
over-valued exchange rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr RICHARD COGHLAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Peter Martin ('Troubling memories of the 1930s', October 17) refers to
John Maynard Keynes' concern about the impact of external economic
conditions on the domestic economy, and provides a quote that could have
come from Norman Lamont's current issue of 'Popular Economic Dilemmas'.
Particularly apposite is the reference to external depression (read
recession) which, in this case, the Bundesbank is inflicting on Germany and
the rest of Europe. Many argue that Britain should never have broken ranks,
and should suffer the same, or worse, consequences. No matter the policy
prescriptions of the Bundesbank are inappropriate for the circumstances.
In Keynes' The General Theory, the ghosts of the past haunt the present: '.
. .the City of London gradually devised the most dangerous technique for the
maintenance of equilibrium which can possibly be imagined, namely, the
technique of bank rate coupled with a rigid parity of the foreign exchanges.
For this meant that the objective of maintaining a domestic rate of interest
consistent with full employment, was wholly ruled out. Since, in practice,
it is impossible to neglect the balance of payments, a means of controlling
it was evolved which, instead of protecting the domestic rate of interest,
sacrificed it to the operation of blind forces. Recently, practical bankers
in London have learnt much, and one can almost hope that in Great Britain
the technique of bank rate will never be used again to protect the foreign
balance in conditions in which it is likely to cause unemployment at home.'
There are good reasons to justify support for a fairly-valued, but not
over-valued, exchange rate. Transitional costs will be incurred in moving
from one level to another, but these will be less than those suffered by
trying to beat down domestic costs to compensate for lack of
competitiveness. The way to support an over-valued exchange rate is to
maintain relatively high interest rates, or manage policy so as to force
economic growth below its long-term potential. Keynes believed these costs
were unnecessary and unacceptable; he was right.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Old Lady's slip shows: The flaws in UK banking supervision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank regulation is the art of shutting stable doors after the horse has
bolted.
This aphorism was used yesterday by Sir George Blunden, the former deputy
governor of the Bank of England. What he meant was that new laws and
supervisory practices are always introduced after a banking scandal has
taken place, never in time to prevent a scandal.
Thus on Thursday the Bank of England and the Treasury announced amendments
to the 1987 Banking Act and the creation of specialist legal and
investigative units at the Bank to prevent the repetition of a fraud similar
to that uncovered at the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the
international bank which was closed in July 1991.
The likelihood of there being another BCCI-style fraud is small, however.
The breathtaking magnitude of BCCI's corruption was only possible because
the bank operated in a vast number of different countries, each of whose
regulators only had responsibility for monitoring a tiny piece in the BCCI
jigsaw.
Over the past few years, bank regulators have begun to act more in concert
in monitoring international banks - and this co-ordinated approach to
supervision has been reinforced recently by a new agreement between
regulators of the leading industrial countries who are members of the Basle
Committee on Banking Supervision.
But there is always another banking disaster waiting around the corner, one
that the regulators never dreamed could happen and therefore could take no
precautions against. Regulation only comes after unforeseen events.
The Bank of England only adopted its regulatory role after the secondary
banking crisis of 1973, when a raft of new financial institutions borrowed
from the big clearing banks and then used the funds to make property loans.
When the property market collapsed, the financial system itself was
threatened.
By 1979 the Bank had sufficient monitoring powers to ensure that banks in
general could be prevented from acquiring excessive exposures to a
particular market. But it still lacked the resources and the appropriate
legal framework to keep a close watch on individual banks.
So when Johnson Matthey Bank had to be rescued by the Bank in 1984 - after
JMB made imprudently large loans - the Bank acquired yet more powers in the
1987 Banking Act. Both the government and the Bank felt that the explicit
responsibilities of the Bank had to be codified and extended.
Sir George says, with only a hint of facetiousness, that there is an
unstoppable cycle in banking collapses and that the next calamity will
happen in 'five or six years'.
If he is right, correcting the shortcomings identified by Lord Justice
Bingham in his report will not prevent the next crisis. Sir George is one of
the few officals to emerge with any credit from the report, which details
the Bank's inept attempts to keep BCCI sound.
Lord Bingham cites two occasions - in 1987 and in 1989 - when Sir George
urged other Bank officials to force BCCI to incorporate its UK operations.
The effect would have been to give greater responsibility for monitoring
BCCI's activities to the Bank. Had Sir George's advice been followed, the
fraud at BCCI might have been detected earlier and losses eventually
suffered by thousands of depositors might have been reduced.
Unfortunately, Sir George was a lone voice in the wilderness - and anyway
cannot escape his share of the collective responsibility, having been
associated with supervision since 1974.
The Bingham report cites ineptitude and negligence by Bank officials on
widespread scale. The report says Bank officials did not understand their
powers, or their responsibilities to intervene in BCCI's affairs under the
1979 Banking Act. Their consistent response for more than a decade to the
growing complexity of BCCI's operations - and to a series of allegations
that it was involved in fraud - was to shy away from supervising it more
closely, for fear that the job was simply to big and complex.
They preferred to follow the letter, rather than the spirit, of
international agreements between bank regulators, and therefore ceded the
primary responsibility for monitoring BCCI to the Luxembourg authorities,
despite the authorities' insistence that the Bank was far better placed to
do the job properly.
The report indicates that the Bank passed the buck for taking supervisory
responsibility for BCCi whenever possible. On several occasions, allegations
of fraud were left to the police to investigate, or ignored by officials
altogether.
One of the most damaging repercussions from the report's criticisms may be
to undermine the Bank's moral authority in the City. It will be less able to
command respect after Lord Bingham's portrait of it as feeble, so any
residual hope that financial practitioners will feel responsible for
following the spirit of City of London laws and codes must be commensurately
reduced.
Sir George draws the lesson from the BCCI saga that 'regulators are good at
dealing with people wanting to be proper bankers - they are not good at
dealing with fraud'. But Lord Bingham does not recommend that the Bank's
traditional technique of supervision, which is based on trust and
willingness on the part of bankers to co-operate, should be changed
fundamentally.
This system is relatively cheap to operate and has worked well in preventing
severe financial difficulties at most banks. The more interventionist and
aggressive US model of banking supervision carried out a range of
institutions has been rejected. It requires the employment of more officials
and is thus more expensive to operate.
Though the Bank of England is unlikely to be as remiss in the future
supervision of a bank as it was in the case of BCCI, there is a hidden cost
in the UK supervisory approach, which falls on bank customers.
Periodically, the Bank's trust in bankers proves misplaced, with the result
that a bank may collapse, leading to losses for its customers of the
uninsured portion (75 per cent up to a maximum of Pounds 15,000) of their
deposits (in the US, deposit insurance in effect covers all deposits).
The justification for imposing this risk on bank customers is that they will
put pressure on banks to behave prudently, because they will only place
their funds with soundly managed banks.
However, it is impossible for customers to know for certain that a bank is
sound. Even the most ostensibly conservative of banks can run into
difficulties. Adam Bank, a small, private bank managed along prudent lines,
recently had to be rescued when all its capital was wiped out by Pounds 21m
currency losses incurred by three dealers operating outside the bank's
normal rules.
So depositors may be tempted to put all their funds with the big four
clearing banks. The repercussions of the collapse of any of them would pose
such a risk to the entire financial system that the government and the Bank
would not allow them to fail, no matter how poor the service they may offer
or their relative inefficiency compared with many smaller banks.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Letter: Myth and whimsey surrounding VAT and food
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL POYNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The debate in your pages on VAT, which prompts Mr Ben Patterson to
write to you (Letters, October 22), is in danger of perpetuating the widely
believed myth that food in Britain is zero-rated.
Although you refer, in one of the articles he mentions ('VAT headache',
October 13), to the zero-rating of 'many' rather than 'all' foods, I suspect
very few of your readers realise that in their average spend at a
superstore, having excluded all non-food purchases, they will have paid
about 6 per cent VAT. British consumers were seriously misled by the
stirring Europhobic tones of Mrs Thatcher when she said 'I shall never put
VAT on food]' They would be amazed by the reality as the table shows.
The list is endless. Perhaps the most whimsical decision relates to frozen
yoghurt: if it requires defrosting before eating it is zero-rated but if it
can be spooned when frozen it bears VAT at 17.5 per cent.
The consistency and the logic of the current system could have been devised
by Lewis Carroll. We should recognise the reality of the situation and -
like the French with their 5.5 per cent VAT on all food - apply a uniform
rate. The processes of harmonisation are not helped by our arcane habits.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Letter: Growing support for increases in aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BEN JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Just two points to add to your excellent leader stressing 'Aid Matters'
(22 October).
First, since Monday the parliamentary ground swell against cutting Britain's
overseas aid budget has grown still further; 37 Conservative MPs have now
signed the World Development Movement-sponsored letter to the chancellor
calling on him to, at least, maintain the small planned increases in aid set
out in last year's Autumn Statement.
As the government defines its 'go for growth' strategy, ministers would do
well to reflect not only on the compelling humanitarian arguments for aid,
but also the business, exports and jobs aid secures for Britain.
Second, you rightly highlight the crippling effect of the Multi- Fibre
Arrangement (MFA) on developing countries, for whom clothing and textiles
make up a quarter of all manufactured exports. Unnoticed by many, earlier
this month the Council of Ministers decided to roll over the EC's system of
MFA restrictions for yet another year, pending a General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade deal.
With now little prospect of a GATT settlement, there is no excuse for the EC
not to agree to start phasing out its discriminatory textile quotas against
the Third World.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Halifax urges intervention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALIFAX, Britain's largest building society, is calling for government
intervention in the housing market to avert the need for 'crisis measures'
next year.
The level of housing activity is 'abnormally low' and demand for houses
needs to increase for there to be a housing recovery, Halifax says. The
government, it says, should take measures to stimulate the housing sector
including:
Cutting interest rates to 6 per cent to 7 per cent.
Raising mortgage interest tax relief for first-time buyers.
Considering phasing out mortgage interest tax relief for existing homeowners
to pay for better-targeted subsidies.
Otherwise, Halifax says, the number of repossessions are likely to increase,
those with negative equity will remain in that position for several years,
and any eventual recovery will be sluggish.
In its bulletin Viewpoint, Halifax compares the housing recession that began
in 1988 with previous downturns in 1974-76 and 1979-82. It finds: Real house
prices fell in all three cycles but in the present one nominal, or cash,
prices have fallen for the first time.
Regional house price gaps widened to historically high levels in 1988
followed by a sharp narrowing of regional price differences.
The most significant difference between the present cycle and past downturns
is the drop in people's wealth, according to Halifax. It says that the fall
in nominal house prices, combined with positive interest rates and a fall in
inflation, 'forced up the real costs of borrowing for house purchases to
levels not experienced before by home buyers in the UK'.
It says past recoveries occurred because houses became more affordable as
interest rates fell and people began to expect housing price increases.

FT  24 OCT 92 / UDM challenge on pit 'mothballing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL could be forced to continue cutting coal at the 10 pits that
have been reprieved for only 90 days, according to the Union of Democratic
Mineworkers.
A further three of the 10 pits stopped cutting coal yesterday, to add to the
four that stopped a week earlier. British Coal says the final three are
likely to stop soon.
British Coal is now charged with maintaining 'the essential fabric of the
mine' in all 10 cases so that, in theory, they could all be reopened after
the 90-day review, something that neither the government nor British Coal
wants.
But the UDM has written to British Coal challenging the economics and
legality of ceasing coal production. The letter says the UDM 'cannot
understand the economic logic of sustaining most of the costs of production
but not cutting coal'. If it does not receive a satisfactory reply, the
union will apply for an injunction against British Coal ordering it to
resume coal production.
Mr Paul Todd, the UDM's solicitor, said that some mines would quickly become
unworkable and unviable after coal production ceased. 'Keeping mines on a
care-and-maintenance basis is not enough, as British Coal knows very well
because it is what they were always saying themselves in the 1984-85
strike,' he said.
Most of the 7,300 miners at the 10 pits have been sent home on full pay,
although some are working on salvage operations. If those miners are made
redundant at the end of 90 days, their redundancy pay will be based on the
their last period of full work.
Some miners at the 10 pits have given up hope of a reprieve and are applying
for voluntary redundancy, although they are being discouraged from doing so
by their unions. British Coal said that at Markham Main in the Yorkshire
area about 200 men have already applied.
Meanwhile Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, said yesterday that he would do
everything possible to secure new jobs for miners in the principality.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Lloyd's syndicate is criticised after loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POOR underwriting was to blame for insurance losses at Cuthbert Heath
syndicate 1084 in the opinion of a Lloyd's loss review report made available
to Names yesterday.
Its losses of Pounds 4.4m are small compared with those sustained by larger
syndicates such as those managed by Feltrim and Gooda Walker agencies, but
they have been a heavy burden for syndicate 1084's Names - the individuals
whose assets back underwriting at Lloyd's. Almost 200 Names who supported
the syndicate in 1988 face average losses of more than Pounds 20,000 each.
Overall, the loss was equal to 142 per cent of the syndicate's capacity, or
capital base.
The report is the fourth of a series of loss reviews prepared by Lloyd's in
the wake of the market's losses in 1988, 1989 and 1990.
The report says syndicate 1084's underwriter bought insufficient reinsurance
protection and failed to keep proper records or track his exposure to
potential losses. As a result, the syndicate was swamped by claims from the
Piper Alpha oil platform explosion in July 1988.
The use of a financial re-insurance policy bought by the syndicate at the
end of 1988 is questioned in the report. It says the policy may have worked
to the disadvantage of Names who joined the syndicate in 1989 and
afterwards.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Met commissioner named
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Paul Condon was named yesterday as the new Metropolitan Police
commissioner and pledged to 'improve the quality of life in the capital so
far as policing impacts on it'.
Now chief constable of Kent, Mr Condon will be, at 45, one of the youngest
commissioners ever when he succeeds Sir Peter Imbert in January.
He said that, in addition to improving the quality of life in London, his
other priorities would be to improve the security of people living and
working in the capital and to encourage respect for the rule of law. 'So
that means heavy emphasis on the ethical standards of policing in London.'
The post of Metropolitan commissioner has the highest profile in British
policing. Ministers will be hoping that Mr Condon will improve the national
image of a service that has been damaged by repeated scandals over
miscarriages of justice.
Mr Condon, who joined the police in 1967, was selected for accelerated
promotion three years later and attended St Peter's College, Oxford, from
1972 to 1975, gaining bachelor's and master's degrees in jurisprudence.
He served in the Metropolitan force before joining Kent as assistant chief
constable, formulating plans for policing the Channel tunnel. He went back
to the Met, returning to Kent as chief constable in 1989. He has been
credited with improving managerial efficiency in the Kent force, and showing
the emphasis on ethical standards that he plans to make a priority in
London.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, said Sir Peter had focused attention on
the need to provide a high standard of service and maintain trust between
the police and community. He believed Mr Condon would prove 'a forceful
successor to a very distinguished commissioner'.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Secret selection of judges 'is farcical'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SYSTEM of appointing judges is 'bizarre and farcical', Lord Williams QC,
chairman of the Bar, said at the Law Society's annual conference in
Birmingham.
The judiciary suffers from 'pointless secrecy - the curse of this country -
and over-defensiveness', he added.
Lord Williams explained that when barristers applied to be assistant
recorders - the first step on the road to the High Court bench - a secret
file was opened on them.
'You don't know what is in it,' he said. 'You don't know which of your dear
friends have contributed. The cruellest error may be in it. You cannot put
it right. It is carefully kept under lock and key by a graduate from the
Franz Kafka school of business management.'
Lord Williams said he had recently suggested to the Lord Chancellor that
anyone who was the subject of such a file should be allowed to ask for it to
be reviewed by the Bar chairman.
'You will be amazed to hear the answer was no,' he told the conference.
He also attacked the training of judges as 'lamentably scanty'. A High Court
judge received no training after appointment and circuit judges had a
week-long seminar once every five years. This was 'quite simply not good
enough', he said.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Labour demands 'new deal for 90s'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour party dismissed as political expediency yesterday the shift this
week in Mr John Major's economic strategy, demanding instead a detailed
national recovery programme to deliver a 'new deal for the 1990s'.
In a policy speech designed to set out a more distinctive Labour position in
the economic debate at Westminster, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor,
warned that lower interest rates alone would not bring a lasting upturn.
Mr Brown said that, without a clear strategy to strengthen manufacturing and
an employment policy designed to strengthen consumer confidence, the
government would lead Britain from a 'recession crisis into a
balance-of-payments crisis'.
Challenging Mr Major to reveal whether the government now had any policy on
the stability of the pound, Mr Brown said that, for the recovery to be
sustainable, management of the exchange rate must remain a central element
of anti-inflation policy.
He said that a national recovery programme, which could not wait until the
government made its Autumn Statement on November 12, should take as its
starting point evidence that consumer and business confidence would not
return until the fear of unemployment was reduced.
The government needed also to ensure that the recovery was balanced and
sustainable, threatening neither a sharp deterioration in the trade deficit
nor an upsurge in inflation.
Mr Brown called for immediate action by Mr Major to:
Establish an emergency employment programme to re-move fear of the dole
queue.
Reduce interest rates. Consult all sections of industry to agree an
industrial policy that would raise exports, reduce imports and build the
long-term strength of the manufacturing base.
Agree action with the building societies and local authorities to pull the
housing market out of recession.
Preserve government capital spending programmes and jointly finance, with
the private sector, large-scale infrastructure projects.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Tube drivers offered payment to accept deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON Underground has offered train drivers an extra Pounds 500 a year in
an attempt to persuade staff to accept a radical shake-up of pay and
conditions.
Both Aslef, the train drivers' union, and TSSA, the white-collar rail union,
are to ballot members on the revised package, which takes the pay of
instructor-drivers to Pounds 24,000 a year. The result is expected by
November 23, the date by which London Underground says staff must sign the
contracts.
The offer, made after four days of talks supervised by Acas, the
conciliation service, includes concessions on earnings protection and travel
allowances.
TSSA said it was extremely disappointed that London Underground had refused
to delay the November 1 date for phasing in the package, as it would be
unable to complete the ballot procedure by the end of next week.
The RMT rail union is also expected to ballot members. RMT described the
package as 'unsatisfactory and unfair'. The deal would mean 29 per cent of
the 21,000 staff suffering a reduction in wages after two years.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Taking the temperature around Barts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ST Bartholomew's Hospital, familiarly known as Barts, has been a feature of
the City of London since 1123.
If the recommendations of the Tomlinson report are followed, within a few
years it will merge with the Royal London Hospital at Whitechapel, and the
Smithfield site it has occupied for more than eight centuries will be
vacated.
St Bartholomew's shadow NHS trust (approved in principle for opting-out
pending the outcome of the Tomlinson inquiry) said yesterday the hospital
was 'a local, national and international centre of excellence', and there
was an 'overwhelming case' for its retention.
'We believe that to lose such an institution would be seriously detrimental
to the healthcare of Londoners and people who work and visit the capital
city,' hospital management said, adding that it was unable to understand the
reasoning behind the Tomlinson recommendations.
Campaigners for Barts' survival argue that, in addition to specialist care,
it provides a valuable outpatient and emergency service.
They say it serves a commuter population of more than 300,000 working within
a two-mile radius of the hospital, as well as 200,000 residents of Islington
and Hackney and 5,000 of the City of London.
Mr Charles Croot, chairman of the residents' association at the Barbican,
which houses a substantial proportion of the City's population, said he
believed there was tremendous affection for Barts at the Barbican, and
strong opposition to its closure.
'I am outraged by the mere possibility of closing down such a historic
building,' said Mr Croot. He said many people who, like himself, had been
involved in raising money for new facilities at Barts would feel their work
had been wasted.
'I really think that if the government decides to close down Barts, I am not
voting for the Conservative party again, ever,' he said.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Liaison body will pool information on frauds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the most important developments arising from the Bingham report is
the creation of a new liaison body between supervisors and other bodies
engaged in the detection of fraud.
'The Treasury regard this as one of the most important things to come out of
the Bingham inquiry and we rather share that view,' the Bank of England
said.
Before the chancellor's announcement, no formal group had existed among
regulators for the exchange of information on potential frauds, although a
number of ad hoc meetings have been held in the past to discuss specific
investigations.
The new group has a core of statutory regulators - the Bank of England, the
Securities and Investments Board and the Department of Trade and Industry.
It will also include criminal investigators and will occasionally draw in
prosecuting authorities. The Inland Revenue is excluded from the group
because of the strict confidentiality laws on tax matters.
The group's main aim is to oversee the exchange of information and to
co-ordinate action between different bodies.
One of the Bingham report's main criticisms was about the lack of
communication between organisations that allowed the fraud at BCCI to escape
detection for years.
Mr Ian Watt, the KPMG Peat Marwick partner who is to head a new special
investigations unit at the Bank of England, said he expected the group to
involve regular liaison meetings, although its exact format or name has yet
to be decided.
He said: 'One of the things the investigation unit will be wanting to do is
to create and maintain a close liaison with the other agencies that have the
task of regulating and eliminating fraud.'
The Bank of England said it would provide the secretariat for the group,
which will develop its own terms of reference and methods of operation. Mr
Watt is likely to be the group's first chairman.
Mr Watt said he also expected to be involved in improving the collation of
intelligence at the Bank. Previously the Bank has used a system called
confidential inquiries, which provides for the Bank's officers to liaise
with police, the Customs and Excise department and the Serious Fraud Office.
That system will be covered by the new unit.

FT  24 OCT 92 / N-plant reprocessing delay ordered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) has been told by the UK pollution authority not
to load uranium into its new reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria
while public consultations on its authorisation are going on.
BNFL, which plans to commission its controversial new Pounds 1.85bn Thermal
Oxide Reprocessing Plant (Thorp) next year, had asked the Pollution
Inspectorate if it could begin loading uranium on the basis of an existing
authorisation. It said that would not increase discharges, since
reprocessing is not due to start until next spring.
The inspectorate declined the request, saying it might prejudice
consultation on the new draft authorisation, which is due to start shortly.
The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate confirmed that the pollution
inspectorate had asked it not to give consent to go to the active
commissioning stage.
BNFL said yesterday that the inspectorate's position still left time for the
eight-week consultation period to be completed by the end of this year, when
BNFL hopes to begin the commissioning process.
The move was welcomed by environmentalists, but Sellafield unions launched a
campaign against what they claim is a delay that might threaten several
thousand jobs at the site.
The unions, who have the backing of local MP Mr Jack Cunningham, believe the
inspectorate has been influenced by a 'bluff' from anti-nuclear groups. 'It
appears to be all the result of the Greenpeace anti-nuclear brigade who've
been conducting a rent-a-letter campaign,' said Mr Alan Westonage, chairman
of the Sellafield shop stewards.
More than 2,000 contractors are employed on the Thorp site at present, said
Mr Westonage. 'All these jobs are at risk.' The unions also fear that if
delays drag on, permanent BNFL staff at Thorp may be affected.
Mr Cunningham, who met union leaders for talks at Sellafield yesterday, said
afterwards he was planning a campaign of action with them at Westminster and
Whitehall to put pressure on the inspectorate to start consultation on
discharge authorisation.
'I'm extremely concerned about the unexplained delay which seriously
threatens several contractors' jobs in the short term and could possibly
damage the reputation of BNFL with its customers at home and abroad,' he
said.
He added that in 1976 Thorp had been subject to a public inquiry lasting 100
days, one of the longest in Britain, which had addressed all the issues in
sufficient depth. 'There is simply no credible case for a second inquiry
into the operation of Thorp,' he said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POPULATION balance between Roman Catholics and Protestants in Northern
Ireland is far closer than popularly believed, according to census figures
published yesterday.
The general perception had been of a two-to-one split in favour of the
Protestants among the 1.5m population - but the census, taken in April 1991,
shows a difference of only 4.4 per cent.
A total of 38.4 per cent recorded themselves as Roman Catholic and 42.8 per
cent said they belonged to the Protestant church - 21.3 per cent
Presbyterian, 17.7 per cent Church of Ireland and 3.8 per cent Methodist.
Other religious groupings, including the Jewish, Chinese and Indian
communities, represent 7.8 per cent of the total population.
A further 3.8 per cent recorded themselves as having no religion and 7.3 per
cent did not respond to the voluntary question on the census form.
The findings are thought to provide the most accurate snapshot of life in
Northern Ireland for 20 years.
The 1981 census was distorted because many Roman Catholics did not fill in
forms at a time of tension during the IRA Maze prison hunger strike.
The census shows there are now more pensioners.

<TEXT>
'THE REPORT is a sham. I am still suffering, my children suffer and my
business is suffering . . . people (from the Bank of England) should have
resigned,' said BCCI depositor Mrs Anita Kapoor after publication of the
Bingham Report.
Mr Ameen Marfani of the BCCI creditors' committee was similarly enraged.
'The report proves the Bank was negligent. It has consistently misled us and
I am astonished that no one from the Bank has resigned.'
Mrs Kapoor, who runs a fashion boutique in Marble Arch, London and a
restaurant nearby, said her BCCI savings - 'clear profit of Pounds 25,000
for a rainy day' - would have helped cushion the impact of the recession. As
it is, she has had to dismiss her five staff and work as a waitress in the
evening. For the past year she has been working an 18-hour day. 'The
business is on its last legs,' she said.
Amid this rising tide of woe there is a minority that is taking its losses
in silence - the estimated 8,500 so-called BCCI 'no-correspondence' UK
account holders. These are the people who have refused to repond to the
liquidators' letters inviting them to make a claim under the various
depositor compensation schemes.
'No correspondence' acc-ounts are designed to conceal the depositor's
identity, ostensibly to evade paying domestic taxes or, in the case of those
living outside the UK, to circumvent their home country's tough foreign
exchange laws. 'Many of my clients are truly paranoid now; some have come to
England and declined to claim their money for fear of exposure,' says a
UK-based solicitor who is representing several 'no correspondence' account
holders.
Mr Zafar Chisti, ex-manager of BCCI's branch in Southall, west London,
expects the number of business casualties to rise. 'I am daily receiving
news from businesses I once dealt with which are now in trouble because of
heavy-handed treatment from the liquidators.'

FT  24 OCT 92 / Councils hope for rebate over BCCI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL authorities that lost money when BCCI collapsed still hope the
government will agree to compensate them for at least part of their loss.
Thirty councils in Britain lost a total of Pounds 83m when the Bank of
England closed BCCI in July last year. The biggest loser was Western Isles
Council, which lost Pounds 23m. The second-biggest was Bury Council, which
lost Pounds 6m.
Mr David Pine, a solicitor with Eversheds Alexander Tatham of Manchester,
which represents the councils and some public utilities affected by BCCI,
said his clients took heart from damning comments about the Bank of England
in the report about the BCCI collapse from Lord Justic Bingham. Mr Pine
said: 'We're hoping that, as in the Barlow Clowes case, the government will
recognise that there has been negligence and accept its obligation to pay
creditors.' In that case, investors received from the government 90 per cent
of the money they had lost.
He said he hoped the government would make a compensation payment to the
liquidators of BCCI in addition to any compensation received from Abu Dhabi.
Mr Rory Mair, chief executive of Ross &amp; Cromarty Council and spokesman for
all the affected councils, said the Commons Treasury committee had concluded
in its report on BCCI last December that if the Bank of England were found
to have failed to discharge its supervisory duties, the losses incurred need
not be met by local authorities or their poll tax payers.
'The Bingham report confirms that the Bank has indeed failed in its
responsibilities,' he said. However, the Treasury said yesterday that there
was no question of special government compensation.

MOST international transfers of funds between banks will now have to carry
details of who made the payment in accordance with a recommendation of Lord
Justice Bingham aimed at limiting the scope for bank fraud and money
laundering.
Swift, the Brussels-based network that handles most electronic transfers of
money between banks, has notified all banks that transfers will now have to
specify at least the account number of the party making a payment.
The reform is intended to obstruct both deliberate fraud by banks and money
laundering through a circuit of bank accounts. It should enable regulators
and auditors to trace suspicious payments back to their source.
Payments through Swift have until now had only to specify the account number
into which a payment should be made. Now, the name and address of the payer
will have to be included along with an account number where possible.
In the vast majority of cases, such details are already given to ensure a
record is kept. However, BCCI was one case in which a fraudulent bank kept
secret details of payments in order to make it more difficult to trace
frauds.
Banks customarily make such payments through correspondent banks in the
relevant country that handle such transactions on their behalf. Until now,
such banks may have been told no more about a payment than from which bank
it originated.
The Bank of England said yesterday that the Swift reform would tighten the
regulation of money transfers. It has also written to the British banks
using the Swift network, urging compliance with the new Swift requirements.
A proposal for greater details of payments was made by Price Waterhouse,
BCCI's auditors. Mr John Hitchins, banking specialist partner, said the firm
hoped the matter would be pursued by the Basle committee of bank
supervisors.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Health services in London 'face serious damage'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEALTH services and medical research in London face serious damage unless
their restructuring is properly funded, the inquiry into the capital's
healthcare warned in its report yesterday.
It is essential, the report says, that adequate transitional funding is
provided to ensure service changes take place in an orderly fashion.
'The level of such funding will to a large extent dictate the pace of
change. Change that is not managed and funded in this way is likely to be
chaotic.'
It was inevitable that reaction to Sir Bernard Tomlinson's report would
focus initially on the hospitals that it has recommended for closure.
Anti-closure campaigns by threatened institutions, such as St Bartholomew's
in the City, are under way.
Although Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, emphasised yesterday that
the report was 'advice to government, not government policy', most of the
campaigns will almost certainly fail.
The government accepts that there are too many hospital beds in central
London, and ministers are expressing determination to tackle at last
difficult decisions that have, periodically, been reviewed and shelved
throughout the century.
This means that, when the first emotion over the proposed closures dies
away, attention must turn to Sir Bernard's emphasis on the need for proper
funding to support the changes.
The campaigns to save specific hospitals might give the impression that the
Tomlinson report faces total opposition in the National Health Service. That
is not so. Organisations such as the British Medical Association and the
Royal College of Nursing agree with the Tomlinson committee's overall view
that resources must be shifted from hospitals to better family doctor and
community services.
Supporters of Sir Bernard's basic approach were disappointed that his report
did not propose more stringent arrangements for ensuring that money released
from hospital closures is actually reinvested at community level.
'We are concerned about the lack of clear recommendations on how much
government funding is needed and for how long,' said Ms Christine Hancock,
RCN general secretary.
London has more hospital beds per head of population than the rest of the
country - 3.9 per 1,000, compared with an English average of 2.5.
Many of the London beds are in relatively expensive teaching hospitals
which, since the introduction of the contract-based system of financing
healthcare last year, have lost patients and run into increasing financial
difficulties. But family doctor and community services are less well
developed than in the rest of the country.
The NHS is a substantial employer in London. It has about 73,000 staff, and
health service unions claim that up to 20,000 jobs might be threatened by
the Tomlinson proposals. There are almost twice as many consultants in the
capital as elsewhere, up to 700 of whom may lose their jobs.
Arrangements for medical education will change radically. Without waiting to
make decisions on hospital closures, the government accepted the broad
conclusion of the Tomlinson committee that most medical education should be
concentrated on four London University colleges - Imperial, University,
King's and Queen Mary and Westfield.

Research. HMSO. Pounds 6.95.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Insurers sceptical on control proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INSURANCE industry is playing down the importance of regulatory changes
proposed yesterday by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in the wake of the
Bingham report.
Mr Lamont proposed that the auditors of insurance companies and building
societies, as well as banks, should face a new statutory duty to report any
suspected fraud directly to regulators.
The change, though, is unlikely to have much practical impact. Auditors have
enjoyed the right to report any suspected fraud to the regulator, even if
that breaches client confidentiality, since implementation of the 1986
Financial Services Act.
Moreover, guidance notes for members produced by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales convert the right into a professional duty.
'Any accountant who ignored this advice would be foolhardy and would be
likely to face disciplinary proceedings,' said Mr Roger Hewel, chairman of
the institute's insurance committee.
Mr Keith Loney of the Association of British Insurers, the industry trade
association, said the proposals would be welcomed. 'We would not raise any
objections,' he said.
Mr Loney added that in the past the proposals might have been opposed. But
although insurers were still keen to protect client confidential-ity
'thinking had moved on'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO former directors of Fox Milton, a London securities dealing firm, have
been jailed for six months for cheating the Inland Revenue of Pounds
130,000, it was disclosed yesterday.
Mr Philip Raisey, who was chairman, and Mr Stephen Wright, company
secretary, sang gospel songs in their City of London dealing room while they
were carrying out the fraud, an Old Bailey jury heard.
Judge Brian Capstick said a deterrent sentence was necessary in spite of the
men's former good characters and their religious beliefs. 'This was a fraud
on the innocent taxpaying public,' he said. The two men had embarked on a
'consistent plan' to cheat the Inland Revenue.
He ordered them to pay Pounds 30,000 each towards costs of the case after
hearing that the police investigation and the three-month trial had led to
costs of Pounds 645,248.
The pair were jailed on Tuesday but a reporting ban was imposed pending a
possible appeal and further prosecution. The ban was lifted yesterday.
Mr Raisey, of Chislehurst, Kent, and Mr Wright, of Sevenoaks, Kent, were
convicted of conspiring to cheat the Queen and the public revenue.

A CONSORTIUM led by International Business Machines and including Siemens
Plessey Radar and the Logica computing services company has won a Pounds
130m contract to equip the new air traffic control centre being built at
Fareham, Hampshire, Alan Cane writes.
The Pounds 350m centre will manage traffic passing over England and Wales.
It is expected to become operational in 1996.
The contract is part of a Pounds 750m capital programme being undertaken by
the Civil Aviation Authority to improve and modernise Britain's air traffic
control system.
The IBM team, which included EDS-Scicon and Frequentis, won the contract
against a consortium led by Thomson-CSF of France.
British consortia led by GEC and Dowty Command and Control Systems were
eliminated late last year, fuelling worries over the ability of UK
electronics groups to win large systems projects.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Major spurns attack on authority by Euro-rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday foreshadowed a bitter confrontation next month with
Tory critics of the Maastricht treaty by dismissing a public challenge to
his authority from the party's Euro-sceptics.
Downing Street officials said Mr Major, who last night flew to Egypt to
attend a weekend service marking the 50th anniversary of the battle of El
Alamein, was determined to re-start the ratification process next month.
But as Labour indicated that it might join Tory critics in opposing the
early return to Westminster of the Maastricht bill, Mr Major left open the
option of a tactical retreat on the precise timetable for ratification.
The officials said the prime minister wanted to make 'progress' with the
legislation before the Edinburgh summit in December. But he accepted that
the line-by-line consideration of the legislation in its committee stage
could be broken up into several stages, perhaps spanning Christmas. That
would ensure that disgruntled Conservative MPs would not have to stay at
Westminster 'night and day' to get the legislation through.
Senior ministers privately ridiculed as 'hysteria' a call by Lord Tebbit,
the former cabinet minister, for MPs to reject ratification even if that
forced Mr Major's resignation as party leader.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, told rebel Tory MPs the
government would not jeopardise the 'national interest' over problems on its
own back benches. If Mr Major was obliged to tell other EC leaders he could
not deliver on the treaty it would mark the end of British influence in
Europe.
Interviewed in today's Daily Express, Mr Major said the Maastricht bill was
not 'an optional extra' that could be ditched. 'It is an agreement that we
have reached. Europe is vital to our domestic economic interest. It is about
our prosperity, our jobs, our future.'
After a week which has seen the government's authority further undermined by
its enforced climbdown over coal closures, cabinet ministers sought to
reassure Tory MPs that Maastricht would not deflect the government from its
determination to secure economic recovery.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said early recovery was the
'overriding objective'. He argued that the recent fall in the value of the
pound would not lead to a renewed burst of inflation, and echoed Mr Major's
clear hint earlier this week that a tight public spending round would pave
the way for a further interest rate cut.
The fresh row over Maastricht followed an 'ambush' on Thursday evening by
Euro-sceptics on the Tory backbench 1922 committee. The executive, which is
dominated by MPs on the right of the party, called for a delay in the
legislation until economic recovery was under way. But despite a public
reinforcement of that message yesterday by Sir Rhodes Boyson, a leading
member of the committee, there were signs the executive was backing away
from direct confrontation.
Mr George Robertson, Labour's Europe spokesman, sought to increase pressure
on Mr Major by suggesting Labour could join Tory rebels to delay the
ratification process until next year. But Downing Street insisted the
Maastricht 'paving' debate on November 4 would be followed later in the
month with the start of the committee stage.
Lord Tebbit said treaty opponents would not be distracted by Mr Major's
threat to resign if defeated in the Commons. 'Maastricht is more important
than any individual and, therefore, whether the prime minister would resign
or not is not material in the terms of the debate.'

FT  24 OCT 92 / BA agrees to rescue Dan-Air: Rival carriers brand deal as
uncompetitive - Up to 1,600 jobs to go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS yesterday agreed to rescue Dan-Air, the UK's oldest
independent airline, in a deal attacked as anti-competitive by rival
carriers.
BA agreed to take over Dan-Air, which was due to celebrate its 40th
anniversary next year, for a nominal Pounds 1. It will assume the troubled
airline's liabilities, which BA estimates at Pounds 35m.
The rescue will mark the biggest consolidation in the UK airline industry
since BA bought British Caledonian nearly five years ago. It will involve
the loss of up to 1,600 full-time jobs and the closure of Dan-Air's charter
operations.
The deal was described by BA and Mr David James, chairman of Dan-Air's
parent, Davies &amp; Newman Holdings, as the only alternative to receivership.
Other independent UK carriers demanded a thorough investigation by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission. They said the takeover would entrench
BA's domination of the UK market and undermine the British government's
efforts to promote a multi-airline competition policy.
Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland, described BA as 'no white
knight', saying the takeover would be 'damaging to competition and choice'.
He said he had contacted the UK and EC regulatory authorities.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive and deputy chairman, said his
airline would not complete the deal if it was forced to give up routes and
landing slots. Without rapid regulatory approval, BA said it would abandon
the deal.
Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic, said he would launch a
short-haul carrier called Virgin European Airways to compete with BA.
BA said the Dan-Air acquisition would be part of a cost-saving restructuring
of its own operations at London's Gatwick airport. A new airline will be
established under the BA livery, employing between 400 and 600 of Dan-Air's
nearly 2,000 permanent staff. These employees will be offered lower salaries
than they had at Dan-Air. Some 400 Dan-Air temporary staff are also likely
to lose their jobs.
BA's new Gatwick-based short-haul airline subsidiary will operate Dan-Air's
scheduled routes with a fleet of 12 Boeing 737s and BA's existing Gatwick
services with 10 Boeing 737s. Dan-Air will reduce its scheduled network from
28 to 12 routes and dispose of 26 of its fleet of 38 aircraft.
Dan-Air made an operating loss of Pounds 24m in the first half of 1991 and
is expected to continue losing money during the winter season. BA believes
it can turn the operation around by next year.
Davies &amp; Newman, whose shares will remain suspended, will be wound up once
the transaction is completed. Shareholders will receive nothing, but Mr
James said creditors would be fully reimbursed.
Dan-Air was a successful independent carrier until 1989 when it started
losing money. Mr James was called in two years ago to restructure the
business. He failed in spite of an emergency rights issue which raised
almost Pounds 50m last year.
His critics say his decision to expand Dan-Air's scheduled services in the
middle of the worst post-war recession in the aviation industry was doomed.
BA has been busy acquiring stakes in airlines this year including its
proposed Dollars 750m (Pounds 460m) holding in USAir and the acquisition of
large minority stakes in TAT of France and Deutsche BA in Germany.
Dan-Air's disappearance is the latest step in the shake-out of the UK
airline industry which saw the collapse last year of Air Europe.
The US Transportation Department yesterday announced that US and British
negotiators are to reconvene in Washington on Tuesday for another round of
talks on easing restrictions on air traffic between the two countries.
The talks, will focus on British Airways' offer to buy a stake in USAir, the
sixth-largest US airline.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Soaring short-term interest rate puts pressure on banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LARGE rise in the cost of borrowing short-term funds yesterday put many of
the UK's leading banks under acute financial pressure and raised questions
about the Bank of England's handling of its money market operations.
A huge shortage of cash in the money market forced interest rates on the
cost of borrowing sterling overnight up to 100 per cent. Normally,
short-dated rates hover close to the banks' base rates, currently at 8 per
cent.
Yesterday's developments came at the end of a week when the government
appeared to have abandoned its previous economic strategy in favour of a
gradual move to lower interest rates in an attempt to boost recovery.
In this atmosphere, many people in financial markets have been expecting a
further cut in interest rates virtually any day.
That made it more difficult for the Bank to alleviate the shortage yesterday
via a technical manoeuvre, because such a move might have given the
impression that the government was about to ease borrowing conditions
earlier than intended.
The rise in the overnight cost of borrowing forced banks which were short of
liquidity to pay a large premium if they tried to obtain money from other
financial institutions. 'There are people in the market making massive
losses,' said one discount house dealer yesterday.
A clearing bank dealer added that the situation in the market could get
worse next week and expressed concern that the Bank was not handling the
situation properly. 'The authorities should have offered short-dated funds
and sent out a message that no alteration in base rates was intended,' he
said.
Behind yesterday's events was the huge amount of money drained out of the UK
banking system last month when the Bank bought an estimated Pounds 15bn in
its unsuccessful effort to prop up sterling. The operation left the market
short of cash, and it may take several months to restore the balance.
The shortage has become particularly acute in recent days because clearing
banks and discount houses are reluctant to borrow money from the Bank at
current rates, believing another UK base rate cut is imminent.
Commercial bank officials said the rise in money market rates was unlikely
to trigger another rise in UK base rates. Instead, the banks will carry the
losses as long as the cost of short-term borrowing stays at current levels.

TOP European Community and US farm negotiators held a series of urgent phone
talks yesterday in an effort to avert an internationally damaging trade war.
In Brussels a statement from EC officials last night said both sides were
anxious to maintain contact 'to achieve a rapid and successful conclusion'
of trade reform talks.
The declaration came amid signs of a widening split within the EC and
mounting diplomatic pressure on France, widely blamed for blocking a farm
trade agreement this week, to drop its objections.
Mr John Major and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany yesterday launched a
four-point initiative to rescue the EC-US negotiations on farm subsidies
which broke down in Brussels on Wednesday. A crisis was triggered when EC
officials refused to agree to US demands for reform of the EC's oilseeds
subsidy regime. US farmers argue the regime has cost them Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 600m) in lost exports.
The British and German leaders agreed that the EC would have to shift its
position to ensure the continuation of the talks in the Uruguay Round of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
They agreed that:
Mr Ray MacSharry, European farm commissioner, should be told to return to
the negotiations.
The European Commission must be told that the talks cannot be allowed to
founder.
The US administration must be reminded how 'dangerous and damaging'
retaliation would be.
The need to reach a settlement should be brought home to all concerned.
Their initiative was launched as it became clear that a phone call made by
Mr MacSharry to Mr Ed Madigan, his US counterpart, late on Thursday
persuaded US leaders to refrain from immediately imposing punitive tariffs
on Dollars 1bn of EC farm exports. Within the EC, a sharp message was being
conveyed at a political level by Mr Michael Heseltine, the UK trade and
industry secretary, who said Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission, had 'conflicting loyalties' between the interests of Europe and
his home country France.
Mr Heseltine warned: 'I very much hope he will now see that the overwhelming
view of the European people is that he should act as the European that he is
and conclude a deal with the Americans.'
He noted also that President Francois Mitterrand of France had played a full
part in the EC summit in Birmingham last week which was committed to
achieving a deal.
In Brussels, Mr MacSharry has been rallying support to try to clinch a deal
on agriculture with the US, which could lead to the conclusion of the
six-year old Uruguay Round. Officials in Brussels and Washington were seeing
whether each other's 'bottom lines' could be reconciled, a senior Commission
official said.
Inside the Commission, there were increasing signs of a divide over whether
or not to settle with the US. Senior officials say there is a clear majority
in favour of the deal Mr MacSharry wants to negotiate. This would cut the
volume of EC subsidised farm exports by 24 per cent and the value by 36 per
cent.

MILLION-DOLLAR MOVIE
by Michael Powell
Heinemann, Pounds 20 601 pages
THE SECOND volume of Michael Powell's autobiography comes to us from beyond
the grave. The British film-maker died in 1990 after dictating these 600
pages, or a draft thereof, to his wife the film editor Thelma Schoonmaker.
(His eyesight had become too poor to write or type.) She then edited them
into shape, which must have been as daunting a task as her work on Raging
Bull or GoodFellas.
Yet the result is a wonder. All Powell's impishness and irony are preserved;
all his flashes of absurdist wit at the expense of Korda or Selznick; and
all his rosy-cheeked ebullience. For this was not only the gallows romantic
who made A Matter Of Life And Death, The Red Shoes and Peeping Tom, he was
also the only film-maker I ever met who tried to make everyone else go into
films. 'Why aren't you making a movie?' he would cry whenever I met him,
practically pushing a camera into my hand.
Million-Dollar Movie begins in the late 1940s, as Powell's own creative high
noon was turning to late afternoon. Yet tales of filming such accident-prone
works as The Elusive Pimpernel (famous sneezing sequence), Gone To Earth
(Jennifer Jones with Shropshire accent) and Ill Met By Moonlight are
enlivened by an awareness of the corporate madness that cinema can be as
well as by a willingness to take the can himself when he thought he was
responsible for a failure.
He was certainly responsible for one startling success: the now classic
British horror film Peeping Tom. Powell is very funny on the scandalised
press reaction at the time (1959, pre-Psycho).
The movie, he records, 'was an insult to the film business, it out-cocked
even Hitchcock, in fact it was all cock. What should be done with a film
like this? It should be flushed down the water closet, with every
responsible critic in London gleefully hanging on the chain.'
It almost was. But even then Powell preserved his bonhomie. He carried on
making films (They're A Weird Mob, Age Of Consent) or planning them (James
Mason in The Tempest). And he created this magnificent double-decker memoir,
which tells us all about cinema from the sublime to the ridiculous and back
again.

THOMAS HARDY, HIS LIFE AND FRIENDS
by F. B. Pinnion
Macmillan, Pounds 45 438 pages
THOMAS HARDY has shaped our view of England. Although he was a careful
researcher, the Wessex of his novels was always more imaginary than
historical, a fiction pieced together from memories of childhood and from
stories of the heroic pre-railway days when the people of the coast lived
under fear of a French invasion. Hardy broke for ever the townsman's idyll
of simple happy country folk enjoying uneventful stress-free lives far from
the madding crowd. Any Dorset village, with its loves, its jealousies, and
its passions of revenge, its acts of arson, its murders and its hangings,
could be a setting for tragedy as universal as ancient Thebes was for
Sophocles.
There are several biographies of Hardy, including one designed by himself as
he prepared for the immortality which he knew awaited him. FB Pinion, in
Thomas Hardy, His Life and Friends, distances himself from the extravagant
tradition. His book sticks closely to the known facts, which he sets down in
chronological order, the important and the trivial, with a minimum of
explanation or speculation. Pinnion's main interest is to relate episodes in
the novels (which he assumes the reader knows well) to real life incidents.
He has a strong sense of place and provides detailed maps of the localities
that fed the novelist's imagination.
His book is accurate and comprehensive, but the style is flat and
occasionally awkward. The few explanations that he ventures (for example
that Hardy and the first Mrs Hardy would have got on better if they had had
children) are timid, conventional, and unrelated to a considered view of
Hardy's developing character.
I particularly enjoyed the accounts of how Hardy's friends and editors tried
to purge his stories of the very qualities which give them their power and
their truth - the political correctness of the time. In one story Hardy was
persuaded to change the time of his lovers' meetings from a Sunday to a
Saturday. Leslie Stephen succeeded in removing an encounter from a
churchyard, objecting to the use of the word 'amorous.' The Spectator damned
one story for daring to suggest that 'an unmarried lady owning an estate
could have an illegitimate child.' No wonder Hardy refused a knighthood.

RED SQUARE
by Martin Cruz Smith
Harvill, Pounds 14.99 431 pages
RENKO is back, Arkady Renko, the Russian detective from Gorky Park and Polar
Star. He was in Siberia, fans will recall, after serving a spell in a
psychiatric hospital as an enemy of the state. But times have changed,
especially in Russia. Renko has been retrieved from Siberia and restored to
his old job as a special investigator. He is back in Moscow again, back in
Red Square, on the eve of last year's abortive political coup.
Not that Renko knows anything about politics, or any of that. He is far more
interested in Moscow's black market: the illicit trade in Marlboros, porn
videos, spare parts, you name it, that is conducted nightly at various
unspecified locations along the city's ring road. In particular he is
interested in finding the killer of Rudy Rosen, a market operator whose car
blew to bits one night, with Rosen still inside it.
Who murdered Rosen, and why? One of the city's Mafia gangs no doubt, but
which of the many? And how will Renko nail them, when not one of the
hundreds of witnesses to the killing ever saw a thing?
The trail begins in Moscow - a city seething with discontent, immediately
prior to the coup - and leads from there to Munich and Berlin, where Renko
is reunited with ex-girlfriend Irina, now a dissident newsreader on Radio
Liberty. He visits a German sex club en route, and witnesses the death of an
American contact, killed the same way as Rosen, before returning at length
to Mother Russia. There he catches up with his villains against a backdrop
of tanks with flowers in their barrels and Boris Yeltsin defending Moscow's
'White House' against all comers.
It's a splendid story, full of atmosphere, packed with the everyday details
of Muscovite life that are Martin Cruz Smith's trademark. The details in
fact are rather stronger than the plot as a whole, and the story has been
cheerfully padded in places to make for a bigger book. But character has
always been as important as plot to Cruz Smith, and he is in his element
describing the arcane workings of the Soviet system. He has created a
thoroughly believable detective in Renko, a character much more in the
tradition of Tolstoy's Levin or Dostoevsky's Petrovitch than, say, Holmes or
Sam Spade.

VOLTAIRE'S BASTARDS
by John Ralston Saul
Sinclair-Stevenson, Pounds 20 640 pages
WESTERN civilisation is in crisis, says John Ralston Saul, because we
believe in reason. We live in thrall to a Utopian ideal of rational society,
first mooted by Enlightenment thinkers in the 18th century; but the result,
contrary to Voltaire's hopes, has not liberated humanity but enslaved it to
a bureaucratic corporatism which stumbles, unconstrained by moral purpose,
from one disaster to another.
Saul's thesis is that Enlightenment philosophers sought to rescue people
from the arbitrariness of royal or priestly power and to replace it by the
rule by reason. But their dream collapsed because of reason's own
limitations. All that happened was an increase in influence of technical
elites. The world, in short, became the fiefdom of managers. Owners of
capital do not control capital; voters do not control politics; everything
is run by managers who alone know how to manipulate the structural
complexities of society. And the managers' goals - profits, election
victories - are not shaped by morality.
This technocratic corporatism applies as much to the recently-collapsed
Eastern bloc as it does to the West. Indeed the East-West distinction, like
that between Left and Right, is not a real distinction at all, Saul argues,
but a fiction of the managerial strategy by which the Age of Reason sustains
itself.
Simply by listing the problems of contemporary civilisation anyone can make
telling points. Saul does so eloquently enough. Politicians, he reminds us,
get away with speaking literal nonsense because what counts is the manner,
not the content, of their utterances. Governments brazenly continue despite
their failures, because the concept of responsibility no longer applies.
Television, advertising and the worship of artificial heroes like soap-opera
stars blind people to the world predicament.
These phenomena and many besides, are symptoms of deep malaise. Worse still
are such examples as the arms trade, encouraged by governments which make
pious pronouncements about peace and freedom, but which subvert both by
their participation in gun-running. And this is only part of a story in
which military establishments flourish, drunk on obsessions with management
and technology; and in which most parts of the world are perennially
engulfed in war.
Although Saul's compendium of problems contains nothing new, his restatement
of them serves to keep us alert. But he misdiagnoses the source of the
problems, and has an unfortunate propensity to overstate them: with the
result that his book quickly becomes tiresome and implausible - tiresome
because of its monotone of complaint and disparagement, and implausible
because it lays all the blame on one ill-defined abstraction, 'reason'.
At first Saul claims that reason cannot be defined, and then proceeds to
define it. Reason is, he says, an obsession with truth and falsity. It is
also an obsession with efficiency. It expresses itself in 'control of
structures' and as the technique of finding 'simple and absolute' solutions
to problems. It is essentially technocratic. Worst of all it is amoral and
blind. This is illustrated by the fact that 'the murder of six million Jews
was a perfectly rational act.' It has led to managers, corporatism, and
almost everything objectionable in recent history.
These claims are of a piece with much of Saul's discussion, which is too
often superficial and general. His chief mistake is to blame an abstraction;
his second is anyway to misunderstand its nature. Blame for the world
problems rests not with a concept but with people. Reason is merely an
instrument which, correctly employed, helps people draw inferences from
given premisses without inconsistency. Choosing sound premises is what
matters, and it is solely a human responsibility. Blaming 'reason' is as
meaningful as blaming 'memory' or 'perception'. It was the racism of Nazis,
not the logic they applied to put their hatred into effect, which caused the
Holocaust.
Can Saul mean that the use of reason is bad without qualification? I imagine
him at a word-processor, answering the telephone, taking antibiotics for his
sore throat, flipping switches to get warmth and light as cold night falls.
Are all these products of reason contemptible?
The muddle in Saul's thinking appears when we examine his alternative. Early
on he says the opponent of reason is 'reasonableness', which 'practical
humanists' like Jefferson had. This is mere word-play, if not contradiction.
But at the end of the book we get a list of virtues to put in reason's
place. They are 'spirit, appetite, faith, emotion, intuition, will,
experience'. One immediately notes that all but the last, if ungoverned by
reason, are exactly the stuff which fuels fanaticism and holy wars. Here
lies the poverty of Saul's account.
Indeed for all that Saul's book is long and amazingly eclectic, ranging from
potted histories of Renaissance art to accounts of nights spent in the
desert with guerillas (the relevance to the main theme is often opaque), it
says very little.

THE GOD-FEARER
by Dan Jacobson
Bloomsbury, Pounds 13.99 159 pages
DAN JACOBSON'S new novel appears, at first glance, to be a simple fable, set
in a re-invented European past, where the known order is reversed, and the
Christians (or 'Christers', in Jacobson's deliberate blurring of historical
nomenclature) are the minority in every middle-European village, their
customs barely known and even less understood. Kobus the Bookbinder is
nearing death and, as age fingers him (the description of the effects of age
is one of the striking felicities of this most humane of books), he is
visited by what appear to be gentle ghosts.
Two small children, appear in his house, quietly playing. Dressed in
'Christer' garb, they continue to reappear, tormenting him with their quiet,
inexorable presence, otherwise completely unthreatening. It is the
realisation of who these Kindly Ones are which leads Kobus to a complete
re-examination of his morally threadbare life and, at the end, to some
gesture towards expiation, resolution and peace.
'Unspent possibilities, lives denied, stories never told, never taken, soul
forever houseless, hopes foregone: existing only in the perpetual present of
what never was and never would be'. They are the legacy, the unborn children
or grandchildren of a Christer girl whom once, in his youth, Kobus failed to
help, as she was on trial for witchcraft.
The story of Kobus's friend Malachi, who became a religious fanatic after a
period of madness which was alleged by gossip and rumour to have been caused
by Sannie the Christer girl, is another strand in this novel which, starting
as fable, widens to become a stern moral appraisal of prejudice, weakness,
political expediency. It has particular relevance for the disintegrating
certainties of today's Europe.
What starts as a mere ghost story is transformed by Jacobson into a
multi-layered parable: the simple outline is given the weight of legend and
the breadth conferred by modern psychoanalytical knowledge. At the same
time, the reader is carried along by the power of the story-telling.
Jacobson is one writer who has always known that if you want get the message
across, you have to have a good tale to tell, and, in this novel, he has
more than one good tale: narratives which, in their simplicity, grip and
focus the attention.
By playing fast and loose with historical accuracy, Jacobson raises the
endless, essential question, 'What if it had been us and not them . . ?'
and, by raising it, calls for tolerance, understanding, courage to speak up.
There are also dream sequences which have a visionary quality of such power
that one is reminded of Bunyan. And at the core of the book is the crucial
point at which Kobus fails to give evidence to support the poor child
accused of witchcraft. He has evaded the one moment when he could have made
something of his life and he has to wait futilely until the child-Furies
catch up with him before realising it. Only then does he understand the
relief that the Kindly Ones can bring.
This novel is Jacobson at his most forthright and thought-provoking as well
as at the height of his stylistic powers.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Books: Penned by a very private poet - Anthony Curtis
discovers another side to Larkin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SELECTED LETTERS OF PHILIP LARKIN 1940-1985
edited by Anthony Thwaite
Faber &amp; Faber, Pounds 20 791 pages
WHEN CP Snow reviewed The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse on
this page in 1973, he wrote: 'In making his collection, so deliberately, so
generously, Mr Larkin has shown magnanimity and courage, two of the greatest
virtues.' These are not the virtues likely to strike anyone who read the
extracts from this new book that appeared in advance of publication.
His fellow-poets are frequently described with a scurrilous, fulminating,
table-banging, saloon-bar offensiveness that soon palls. These continual
eruptions are the kind of thing many of us indulge in from time to time in
private. They often involve crude nicknames and not very funny racist jokes
about people in our circle. For example, of a woman poet who had just been
given the Somerset Maugham award Larkin writes to a friend: 'What do you
think of  .. getting four hundred nicker to go and get stuffed in Wopland?'
Remarks of this kind are intended, surely, to be both ephemeral and strictly
private. It does seem extraordinary that, while many of the people to whom
they refer are still living, they should all have been now made public.
Numerically only about one third of the letters are of this kind. They are
the ones to the group of intimate friends whom Larkin has known since school
and undergraduate days at Oxford, with Robert Conquest joining it later.
Unlike Larkin, many of these people went on to a spell of active service in
the forces and after that to make their marks in the wider world outside of
academic life.
The hairy chest that Larkin wears so inexorably when writing to them, with
intermittently lewd references to the pornographic magazines he has been
reading, seems like a determined effort to remain on terms with them and to
preserve the rebellious camaraderie of the original undergraduate
brotherhood long after it had ceased to be a reality. He probably felt
defensive about his own war as a forces reject, having been graded C3 on
account of his stammer, an affliction that interestingly disappeared on the
death of his father. It led in 1943 to Larkin taking up the 'reserved
occupation' (for someone in that category in wartime) of librarianship, a
profession where he remained for the rest of his life. He became the
University Librarian at Hull from where the majority of the letters are
written.
Larkin was one of those old-fashioned people who are reluctant to pick up a
telephone when a letter will do just as well. In consequence the editor of
the volume, Anthony Thwaite, Larkin's executor, had an enormous haul to
choose from and he has given many examples of Larkin writing not only to his
old Oxford chums but to anyone who encroached upon his life briefly or
permanently.
There are some fascinating unmawkish letters to the women friends he made
after he left Oxford, especially to Monica Jones, a lecturer in English, to
whom Larkin wrote what are some of the the nearest items in the book to
love-letters. Their affair, like so many of Larkin's relationships, seemed
positively to thrive on distance and separation. We learn that he used to go
regularly on summer holidays with her. Letters to publishers form another
group, and letters to the people who wrote to him out of the blue - aspiring
poets and admirers - yet another.
As one ploughs through the whole - the volume is best read in small doses -
Snow's view of Larkin's salient qualities begins to appear slightly less
inappropriate to Larkin the correspondent. There is a dogged courage in his
perpetual refusal to budge - both to budge in a geographical sense away from
Hull, except for some extraordinary occasion, and his similar refusal to
budge in order to get on in the literary world, to be in the slightest bit
pushy about his work. His career grew through ever wider recognition from
critics and readers without any of those adventitious boosts from the
hype-machine that jack-up lesser talents. His eventual South Bank Show
accolade gave him a public presence that he had always affected to despise.
Several letters to his chief editor at Faber, Charles Monteith, show that
though Larkin was unconscionably slow at delivering the manuscript of a new
volume - a 10 year-gap was his usual interval between books - he could be a
tough negotiator when it came to the fine print in the contract. Larkin was
indeed his father's son - Pop Larkin was a formidable administrator, Town
Clerk of Coventry. When Philip Larkin was penning business letters in a
professional capacity on publishing or library matters he was nobody's fool.
Larkin's magnanimity is well hidden behind the wall he puts up to guard his
privacy and creativity, but some of it is certainly to be found in his
tactful, supportive handling of Barbara Pym after her novel had been turned
down by Cape, her publisher for many years. Larkin admired her novels and
had written spontaneously to tell her so. Her side of this correspondence
was given in her sister's book, A Very Private Eye. What is remarkable from
Larkin's side is the manner in which, though he is full of kind words to
alleviate her misery, he does not abate one jot the force of his penetrating
criticism of her work.
Those who see the essential Larkin in the poem 'Dockery and Son' - a
meditation by a middle-aged bachelor returning to his old Oxford college -
will be interested in Larkin's confession to Monica Jones in 1966: 'I shall
spend the rest of my life trying to get away from that poem'. This whole
volume prompts one to say that he never really succeeded; but the final
answer to that central question will have to await the appearance of Andrew
Motion's biography of Larkin. This book has set the scene for it fully,
indeed in far too great an abundance of trivial everyday utterances.

THE SERVANT
by Alistair McAlpine
Faber and Faber, Pounds 11.99, 98 pages
THE DEDICATION to this book almost says it all: 'To the most magnificent,
Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven, Prime Minister of Great Britain 1979-1990,
from one of her many servants, who believes she could have been better
served.'
Alistair (now Lord) McAlpine was treasurer of the Conservative Party from
1975-1990 and deputy chairman from 1979-83. In other words, he served Mrs
Thatcher longer and more faithfully than practically anyone else. Clearly he
wishes that she was still prime minister.
McAlpine has had a simple, if mannered idea. He thinks that Machiavelli was
not machiavellian enough. Instead of writing a book advising the Prince how
to behave, he should have concentrated on giving advice to the Prince's
servant - or possibly servants: it is not obvious how many of them there can
be at the same time.
McAlpine was the servant par excellence. Of independent means and
well-connected, he never had to worry much about his own position. But even
with assets like those, you cannot succeed by merit alone. You need a
Prince, who must be perfect, and an Idea which embodies the Prince's aims
and ambitions for the people. The Servant merely does the dirty work, much
of it behind the scenes, while trying to keep his hands reasonably clean, at
least in public.
Mrs Thatcher was the Prince. The Idea was - well, this is not exactly
explained. Presumably it was what Mrs Thatcher wanted for Britain. No
specific policies, indeed no specific persons are mentioned. The Servant is
simply a handbook of how to behave.
Some of it is mildly amusing. Certainly it is much more elegant than (say)
the memoirs of another servant, Bernard Ingham, who was Mrs Thatcher's press
secretary. Where Ingham tells you in some detail how the news was managed,
McAlpine merely observes that 'timing is crucial and must be carefully
studied . . . When something objectionable has to be done, the Servant will
want as little public reaction as possible . . . The Servant needs to choose
a day when there is plenty of other news . . . He may even find it
convenient to create other news as a diversion.'
McAlpine must be smiling at the handling by Downing Street of some current
events, for obviously servants are not what they used to be.
For the rest MaAlpine outlines a number of principles that were successfully
practised during the Thatcher era. For example, 'if you propose to destroy a
possible enemy, do so by promoting him.' Again, 'having encouraged a man to
behave like a noble, a hint to his colleagues that it would not be against
the Prince's will if he were destroyed will cause them to tear him apart.'
And, of course, the point about meetings is that 'what needs to be done must
have been dealt with before the meeting begins.' The fascination of the book
lies in the fitting the real scenes to the theoretical advice. It is a very
inside job; the Servant wore gloves throughout.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Save &amp; Prosper's bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE guaranteed equity bond may just be the marketing man's ideal investment
product for the 1990s. It is not without flaws, but it could be the only way
of persuading nervous investors to put their money into shares.
This week, Save &amp; Prosper became the latest company to launch a product into
this crowded field. Its Guaranteed Stock Market Bond offers a near-exact
matching of the FT-SE 100 Index's capital growth over five years with the
promise of your money back if the index does not rise.
Save &amp; Prosper says that 99 per cent of the original investment will
increase in line with the Footsie; and those who invest before November 27
will get a 1 per cent bonus, effectively increasing the index-matching
promise to 100 per cent.
There is a further option available, for those who fear that the market
might plunge in the period just before the bond is encashed. Every time the
market rises by 10 per cent (subject to a maximum of 50 per cent), the bond
will lock in this gain. So if the market were to rise by 35 per cent and
then fall back, the investor would have secured a 30 per cent gain. The
price for this further guarantee, however, is that only 92 per cent of the
investment is increased in line with the index.
Save &amp; Prosper has calculated that over the most recent five calendar year
periods, the bond would have beaten a building society higher rate account.
For example, over the five years to January 1 1992, Save &amp; Prosper's bond
(with the bonus) would have turned Pounds 5,000 into Pounds 7,425; the
building society would have grown the same sum into Pounds 7,285.
Although the difference is pretty marginal, Save &amp; Prosper points out that
the five year period includes the Crash and that interest rates were much
higher than they are likely to be over the next five years.
So what are the snags? For a start, you must hold your investment for five
years. If you want to withdraw your money early, the guarantee will not
apply. Your return will depend on the level of the market, minus an
unspecified administrative charge which Save &amp; Prosper will apply.
The second snag concerns higher rate taxpayers. Unlike some other guaranteed
products, returns on the bond are free of basic rate. But higher rate payers
will face a charge on their gains equivalent to the difference between basic
and top rate tax (currently 15 per cent).
If they had invested in a unit or investment trust, gains would be subject
to capital gains tax. Few people make enough gains to cross the Pounds 5,800
CGT threshold.
The third snag is that the bond pays no income. Not only that, but the
investor does not benefit from the dividend yield on shares, currently 4.7
per cent. That can make quite a difference over five years. An indexed fund,
such as Gartmore's All-Share Tracker, aims to match the index and pay an
income on top.
Logic would suggest, therefore, that if you expect the market to rise over
the next five years, a tracker fund will give a better return (especially
for higher rate payers) than the Save &amp; Prosper fund. And if you do not
expect the market to rise over five years, do not invest in an equity-based
product - go for gilts or national savings.
But logic is rarely the guiding principle in finance. Save &amp; Prosper's
research suggests that people would like to invest in equities, but are
turned off by the fear of capital loss. A product such as the guaranteed
bond helps overcome this psychological barrier, and could be a key marketing
tool for the financial services industry.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Wellcome under scrutiny - The Week
Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome, the UK pharmaceuticals group, reports its full-year results on
Wednesday. Few surprises are expected and pre-tax profits of between Pounds
500m and Pounds 505m are forecast (Pounds 402.9m last year).
Sales of Zovirax, its herpes, shingles and chicken pox treatment, should
have topped Pounds 600m for the year, putting it in the world's top ten
selling drugs for the first time.
Wellcome's margins will also be under scrutiny. The new management has
undertaken to increase margins to 30 per cent by 1996. Analysts believe they
should improve 2.4 percentage points to about 27 per cent this year.
Imperial Chemical Industries, Britain's biggest manufacturer, announces its
third quarter results on Thursday. They will be watched even more carefully
than usual because of the proposed split of the company next year into two
separate groups. Pre-tax profits are likely to be grim, at around Pounds
100m compared with Pounds 196m last year.
Most of analysts' predictions for next year are based on an upturn in the
cycle. A gloomy forecast from Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, is likely to
lead to further downgrades.
Marks and Spencer, which singlehandedly accounts for some 30 per cent of the
market capitalisation of the stores sector, is likely to make some
encouraging noises about its trading prospects when it reports its interim
results on Wednesday.
Against a background of ambivalent signals about the state of consumer
spending, M and S's views will be seen as being of critical importance in
gauging sentiment towards the sector.
Stringent cost control measures will have enabled the company to lift
pre-tax profits by as much as 16 per cent to Pounds 250m. The company's
aggressive 'Outstanding Autumn Value' advertising campaign is also likely to
add to its confident mood.
However, M and S's food business, which accounts for 40 per cent of sales,
will have continued to face severe competitive pressures.
Blenheim Group, the exhibitions manager, is expected to announce pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 34m for the year to 31 August when it announces
second interim results on Tuesday.
Analysts will be watching for signs Blenheim's recent rapid growth is
slowing, and for the trading outlook in its important French market.

Banks and building societies offered a flood of lower mortgage rates this
week, the markets having finally digested last week's base rate cut. It
followed the trickle from Abbey National and a few others last week.
None matched the Bank of England's one percentage point cut. Most lowered
rates by around 0.7 of a point.
Since Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester already had one of the lowest standard
variable rates on the market, its 0.7 point cut pushed its new rate down to
9.05 per cent, undercutting the competition.
Norwich &amp; Peterborough lowered its rate to 9.2 per cent while lenders which
cut rates to 9.25 per cent this week included National Westminster, Bradford
&amp; Bingley, Chelsea, Confederation bank, First Direct, Midland, TSB, West
Bromwich and Yorkshire building society.
Most are with immediate effect for new borrowers and from December 1 for
existing customers. Midland's rate is available from Monday for new
borrowers and TSB is applying the new rate to all borrowers from December 1.
Nationwide, Halifax, Barclays and Alliance &amp; Leicester lowered rates to 9.29
per cent immediately for new borrowers with existing customers having to
wait until December 1.
Lloyds Bank and Woolwich building society settled on a cut to 9.3 per cent,
with Lloyds new rate available on November 30 for all borrowers and
Woolwich's rate on offer immediately for new borrowers and December 1 for
existing customers. Scarborough reduced its rate to 9.35 per cent.
Most lenders are offering discounted rates to entice first-buyers. Those of
particular note include Woolwich's rate of 6.95 per cent held for one year
for new buyers on loans of over Pounds 60,000. There is no arrangement fee
but the rate is only available on pension or endowment mortgages and
buildings and contents insurance has to be taken out with the society.
Barclays is offering a one-year capped rate of 6.99 per cent for new buyers
with an arrangement fee of Pounds 250 and the obligation to take out a
full-term life policy if the mortgage is on a repayment basis.
National &amp; Provincial has a guaranteed rate until January 1 1995 of between
7.5 per cent and 7.99 per cent for new borrowers depending on the size of
the loan. The arrangement fee is Pounds 150 and buildings and contents
insurance has to be taken through N&amp;P.
New fixed rate mortgages include 7.5 per cent for two years and 7.99 per
cent for three years from Yorkshire building society, available on all types
of mortgages. Borrowers will have to pay a Pounds 175 arrangement fee and
take out the society's buildings and contents insurance. The early
redemption penalty is three months interest within the fixed rate period.
A fixed rate of 6.2 per cent on all types of mortgages of Pounds 60,000 and
over is being offered by Norwich and Peterborough but the rate is only held
until May 1 1993. There is a Pounds 95 fee and buildings insurance has to be
taken out with the society.
TSB has brought out a two-year mortgage capped at 7.5 per cent for two
years, available on endowment loans with a Pounds 250 fee and two fixed rate
mortgages - a three year rate fixed at 7.85 per cent and a five year fixed
rate of 8.25 per cent, which can be taken out on both repayment and
endowment mortgages. The fixed-rate loans carry an arrangement fee of Pounds
195.
Halifax is also offering a longer term fixed rate mortgage of 8.25 per cent
held until January 1 1997 on all types of mortgages with an arrangement fee
of Pounds 250 and early redemption penalties.
Chelsea's rate of 7.95 per cent fixed until December 31 1994 is not tied to
the sale of insurance related products and is available on all types of
mortgage. The arrangement fee is Pounds 195. The early redemption penalty is
three months interest in the period of the fixed rate; otherwise it is one
month.
Northern Rock has brought out a two-year stepped fixed rate mortgage. The
rate is pegged at 6.99 per cent until November 1 1993 and then at 7.99 per
cent until January 1 1995.
The arrangement fee is Pounds 150, buildings and contents insurance has to
be taken out with the society and there is an early redemption penalty of
three months' interest.
New capped rate mortgages are offered by TSB with a rate capped at 7.5 per
cent for two years, available on endowment loans with a Pounds 250 fee.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: 'Leeches' at the pit heads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE most of Britain regards the prospect of 30,000 redundant coal miners
as a disgrace one segment of the population scents an opportunity.
Commissioned sales agents of the life insurance and pensions industry are
besieging coal fields trying to persuade soon-to-be redundant miners of the
virtues of personal pensions, according to a miners' union.
'They heard the announcement and they thought Pandora's box had opened,'
said David Prendergast, deputy vice president of the Union of Democratic
Mineworkers. Prendergast said that at every pit named for closure, at least
one insurance sales agent had planted himself on the premises to collar
workers going in and out of the pits.
'We've had them banned from the colliery curtilage,' said Prendergast. He
described the agents as 'leeches' and said the UDM had retained a financial
adviser to urge redundant miners to remain in British Coal's pension scheme.
Ironically, British Coal's pension scheme offers benefits and
inflation-proofing above the national average. The Mineworkers Scheme offers
annual increases to deferred pensions broadly in line with the retail price
index up until retirement age and are index-linked while in payment. Also,
the scheme offers widows and dependents benefits, unlike personal pensions.
Paul Trickett, secretary to the Mineworkers Pension Scheme, said in the last
two years, 23,000 members have opted out of the scheme taking pensions
valued at Pounds 400m with them. 'We estimate that the insurance industry
has earned Pounds 20m from redundant coal miners in the past two years,' he
said.
Anxiety that members are being urged to switch out of the scheme by sales
agents in search of a commission cheque prompted the Mineworkers Scheme to
retain actuaries Mercer Fraser. Mineworkers who request a transfer out of
the scheme receive a fact sheet giving the merits of the scheme compared
with a personal pension.
John Betts of Mercer Fraser said that since September, many of those who had
planned to transfer out have changed their minds. That, however, has
irritated commissioned sales agents, some of whom have called Mercer Fraser
to complain bitterly.
'They have threatened to report us to Lautro (the insurance regulator)'
Betts said. The problem is that the sales pitch involves the display of a
personal pension's projected earnings 20 to 30 years into the future. 'We
send them a letter telling them that the high number might not be so much in
20 years time after the effects of inflation,' Betts said.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Perot outspending both rival camps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ross Perot is now spending more money on his independent campaign than
President George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton combined, writes Jurek
Martin in Washington.
The latest figures from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) show that, in
the first two weeks of October, Mr Perot paid Dollars 26m (Pounds 15.9m)
from his own pocket, against the Bush campaign's outlay of Dollars 12.3m and
the Clinton camp's Dollars 11.9m.
By law the two main party candidates, receiving about Dollars 55m each in
federal funding, may spend no more than Dollars 65.5m. According to the FEC,
Mr Bush was left with Dollars 23.5m in the bank for the final three weeks
and Mr Clinton Dollars 14.5m.
Since Mr Perot's effort is entirely self-financed he is subject to no
limits, although he must report what he spends. Almost all his outlays are
on a massive advertising campaign - Dollars 23.6m in the first two weeks of
October alone - and, if he maintains the current rate, he may exceed the
permitted ceiling for the other two. So far he has spent Dollars 48m on his
own cause.
The Perot camp finally announced yesterday their candidate would do some
'conventional' campaigning - making appearances tomorrow at rallies in
Flemington, New Jersey, and in Pittsburgh.
Concentrating solely on paid-for advertising, apart from his 'free'
participation in the presidential debates, means Mr Perot has had to answer
no questions from the media.
Both the Bush and Clinton campaigns, worried by his upward movement in the
polls, have been pressing the media to investigate Mr Perot's record, much
as they did earlier in the summer.
ABC TV reported on Thursday night that it had found no evidence to
substantiate one of Mr Perot's claims that a band of would-be assassins
hired by the North Vietnamese had once penetrated his family compound in
Dallas, only to be repelled by his guards. Otherwise he is still getting off
lightly.
Vice-President Dan Quayle insisted on TV yesterday that the race was between
Mr Bush and Mr Clinton and that Perot supporters should 'think long and hard
about whether they really want to throw their vote away'.
However, the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows the gap between Mr
Clinton and Mr Bush to be twice as big as that between Mr Bush and Mr Perot.
It gives Mr Clinton 47 per cent, Mr Bush 28 per cent and Mr Perot 19 per
cent.
In electoral college terms - where 270 votes are needed for victory - Mr
Perot is not yet a threat to carry a single state.
The latest compilation of state polls by Hotline, a political newsletter,
has Mr Clinton ahead in 39 states with 421 college votes, Mr Bush in seven
with 45, leaving five states, worth 72 votes, reckoned a tie. Only in
Alaska, Nevada and Wyoming, amounting to 10 college votes, does Mr Perot
score 20 per cent or more.
PRESIDENT George Bush declared yesterday the US could 'begin writing the
last chapter of the Vietnam war', writes Jurek Martin.
Following a White House debriefing by a US mission just returned from Hanoi,
Mr Bush said he would immediately authorise 'modest' humanitarian aid to
Vietnam, mostly for flood relief. This is in return for documentation
provided by Vietnam on the unknown fate of more than 2,200 Americans held
prisoner of war and missing in action.
Mr Bush said 'we will begin reviewing what further steps we can take with
Hanoi. We appreciate what's been done.'
Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who was a former prisoner of war
and part of the US delegation, said Vietnam was now 'desperate for economic
assistance'.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Foreigners given electoral drubbing: With the Soviet empire
out of the way, candidates are picking on other targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY tradition, the US secretary of defence is supposed to stay out of
election year politics, presumably to mind the nation's security while the
president is out winning votes at factory gates, in farmyards and,
increasingly these days, in the television studios.
Mr Dick Cheney, the Pentagon incumbent, has not broken with tradition; and
only a cynic would suggest this detached role might suit him if the
Republican ship went down as he might then stand a better chance of becoming
its captain in 1996.
He did give a speech a few weeks ago in which he lamented the fact that
foreign policy was not getting much of an airing in the campaign, but Mr
Cheney must be truly disengaged if he believes this to be so.
To most people it is obvious that now there is no Soviet empire to kick
around, the dread generic foreigner is the villain in the presidential
drama.
President George Bush set out by proclaiming himself the 'foreign policy
president,' which certainly sounded more plausible than his claims to be the
'environment president' and the 'education president'. He had won a war, two
if you count Panama, while the country was not conspicuously greener or more
learned.
But this was pretty much an open invitation for Governor Bill Clinton to
complain, as did every other Democratic primary contender, that Mr Bush
cared far more about foreigners than he did about Americans. This grew worse
after Los Angeles erupted in flames and while Mr Bush was spending his time
trying to persuade Congress to send money to Russia rather than to Watts.
When Mr James Baker was moved from the State Department to the White House,
a subtle shift was discernible. Mr Clinton now charged that Mr Bush cared
far more about his re-election than he did about foreigners, which was all
wrong as anybody could see the world was going to hell in a hand basket.
But, of course, so was America. This had earlier prompted Mr Clinton to
proclaim that foreigners, in the shape of international corporations, simply
were not paying their full tax whack. If they did - and he had a plan to
make them - all sorts of wonderful things could be done for Americans.
Mr Bush also changed his tune. The flaw in Mr Clinton, he suddenly detected,
was that he had fallen under evil foreign influences. There was his time at
that cradle of European social engineering, Oxford University, which could
hardly be seen as part of the great American tradition. After all, social
engineers were only a step away from communist engineers and everybody could
see what good they had done.
Nor was the president above hinting darkly that Mr Clinton might even have
been doing the commie bidding, by going to Moscow and by demonstrating
against the Vietnam war. Mr Clinton even wanted to do business with
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, the ultimate unacceptable foreign face,
even though, naturally, Mr Bush had his own good policy reasons for doing
precisely the same thing.
But neither of the candidates come close to Mr Ross Perot. A believer in
conspiracies and cover-ups, the independent from Texas sees a foreign hand
behind everything that is wrong with America. He packaged it all in last
Monday's televised presidential debate.
The country, he declared, was being ruined by foreign lobbyists, many of
whom were actually Americans working for the Bush and Clinton campaigns, and
Mexicans would be 'sucking' away even more American jobs courtesy of the
Nafta agreement. Indeed, in every trade pact he could think of the US
government was 'breaking our business' legs' and had been consistently
out-negotiated by the wily foreigner, who ought not to be allowed to land
his cars at America's docks if the rules were not changed.
It got worse. British Airways and KLM were conspiring to undermine that
great American birthright, its airline industry. Pretty soon there would be
no Boeing and McDonnell Douglas jets to fly around in any more, what with
the subsidised Airbus and the Japanese plotting to get into the commercial
aviation business.
And then there was President Saddam, not to mention General Manuel Noriega.
Curiously, all three also like some foreigners. Mr Bush is always talking to
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, mostly about how awful it was that
the Canadian flag was flown upside down at the baseball World Series game in
Atlanta and sometimes about how to win elections from behind. He used to
talk to British Prime Minister John Major about that, too.
He certainly thinks the Arabs and Taiwanese do not have enough weapons and
is even willing to talk to the Vietnamese, although that might be because he
is growing a little worried about China.
Mr Clinton does not seem to like the Chinese much either, but he got on
famously once with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, is surrounded by Rhodes
scholars, and has invited foreign corporations by the hundreds to set up
business in Arkansas.
Even Mr Perot thinks Germans and Japanese are pretty good at 'bidness',
although that might not be so if they paid more, as he thinks they should,
to defend themselves.
And nobody likes the Serbs.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Growth in money supply to be flat
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Japan yesterday projected flat money supply growth in coming
months, but said there would be no further reduction of the official
discount rate despite government calls for an interest rate easing.
In its quarterly economic outlook report, released yesterday, the bank said
the previous monetary easing and the government's emergency economic package
would help a gradual recovery.
Mr Kagehide Kaku, director of the central bank's research and statistics
department, denied any moves to ease monetary policy.
The 0.4 per cent drop in the September money supply figure, the first
decline on record, which was released earlier this week has increased
pressure on the Bank of Japan to cut the official discount rate.
Meanwhile, surveys by the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) have revealed that
company and consumer confidence of an economic recovery remains weak.
The Business Survey Index - a survey of 4,565 companies, weighing up those
expecting an economic upturn against companies predicting a downturn in the
October-December period - stood at a negative 33.
Corporate capital investment plans for the current year to March have fallen
by 3.2 per cent against the previous period, while the EPA's consumer
confidence index fell by 6.3 per cent in the July-September quarter.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Lebanese money-changers cash in on the 'last-hope premier'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIRUT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE appointment on Thursday night of Mr Rafik Hariri, the Lebanese-born
Saudi billionaire, as the Lebanese premier was widely celebrated in Beirut
and prompted an immediate 13 per cent rise in the value of the Lebanese
pound, to LPounds 1900 to the dollar.
So great was the optimism inspired by the appointment that banks and
money-changers closed early yesterday when they ran out of notes to trade.
Many Lebanese see Mr Hariri, a self-made banking and construction tycoon, as
the last hope for an economy plagued by 100 per cent inflation, 30 per cent
unemployment and damage from the 1975-90 civil war estimated at more than
Dollars 20bn (Pounds 12.2bn).
Mr Hariri, 48 and a Sunni Moslem, wants to replace the traditional leaders
who have dominated post-war cabinets with more qualified and dynamic
technocrats. Unlike the majority of Lebanese politicians, he played no part
in the war.
But he financed the 1989 peace conference in Taif, Saudi Arabia, which ended
the conflict.
Aides say he contributes Dollars 87m to Lebanese charities annually.
Since 1989 Mr Hariri has bankrolled the Lebanese presidency and the Council
for Development and Reconstruction (CDR). The CDR has restored basic
services to the capital and promoted a controversial Dollars 2.65bn
renovation plan for the ruins of downtown Beirut.
Mr Hariri has a personal fortune estimated at Dollars 3bn and is listed by
Forbes Magazine as one of the 100 richest men in the world. His Mediterranee
Investment Group holds 35 per cent of the new Banque Francaise de l'Orient,
formed by this week's merger of the Indosuez group, Mediterranee, Al Saudi
and Libano-Francaise banks. He has substantial real estate holdings in
France and the US.
For Lebanese locked into a rigid social hierarchy, Mr Hariri's rise from a
modest Sidon farming family to vast wealth and the country's premiership is
nothing short of astounding.
After studying business administration at Beirut's Arab University he
emigrated to Saudi Arabia in 1965 where he worked first as a mathematics
teacher, then as an accountant. In 1976 he won the favour of the Saudi royal
family by building the Taif Intercontinental Hotel in just six months, in
time for the Islamic summit.
Mr Hariri was at that time a sub-contractor for the French company OGER,
which he later purchased. He proceeded to build palaces, hospitals and
conference centres throughout Saudi Arabia and recently completed a complex
for President Hafez al-Assad of Syria.
The new premier maintains good relations with Damascus; his friendship with
Vice-President Abdul-Halim Khaddam, responsible for Syrian policy in
Lebanon, will prove useful in coming weeks as the government negotiates the
withdrawal of Syrian troops to eastern Lebanon. Both King Fahd of Saudi
Arabia and President Assad met Mr Hariri shortly before his appointment.
His association with the Saudi royal family may attract badly needed
investment from the Gulf, but it could prove a source of friction with
Iranian-backed Shia Moslem fundamentalists in Lebanon. Twelve Lebanese
fundamentalist deputies were among the few parliamentarians who opposed his
nomination.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Emperor 'deplores' war atrocities in China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EMPEROR Akihito of Japan last night said he 'deeply deplored' the suffering
caused during the Japanese army's occupation of China, but fell short of
issuing a formal apology.
At a state banquet in his honour in Beijing, however, Emperor Akihito went
further in atoning for Japan's actions than his father Hirohito - the
god-monarch who presided over Japan during the second world war and who
usually expressed his 'regret' about the past on such occasions.
'In the long history of the relationship between our two countries, there
was an unfortunate period in which my country inflicted great sufferings on
the people of China,' Emperor Akihito said. 'I deeply deplore this. When the
war came to an end the Japanese people, believing with a sense of deep
reproach that such a war should never be repeated, resolved to tread the
road of a peaceful nation.'
Although the speech may satisfy the Chinese government - which is keen to
encourage Japanese investment in China - it is moot whether it will satisfy
public opinion.
The Chinese have been schooled, as a matter of government policy, in Japan's
war atrocities in their country. As many as 10m Chinese citizens are
estimated to have been killed during the occupation, which began with the
Manchurian incident in 1931 and ended with Japan's defeat in the Pacific war
in 1945.
Museums have been erected in many parts of the country to glorify the
Communist party's resistance to the Japanese invasion and to emphasise the
brutality of its occupation.
The Chinese government had allowed some citizens to agitate against Japan in
the run-up to Emperor Akihito's visit and has permitted publication of calls
for Japan to pay Dollars 180bn (Pounds 110.4bn) in war reparations, despite
waiving the right to seek them when normalising relations 20 years ago.

talk of new political grouping

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) was stricken yesterday by a
dispute among its most powerful officials, prompting rumours within the
party that new factions and even a new party could soon be formed.
The confusion follows the choice of Mr Keizo Obuchi to lead the party's
largest faction - formerly run by the party's 'godfather', Mr Shin Kanemaru,
who resigned in disgrace last week after violating political funding laws.
Mr Kanemaru had chosen Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a former party secretary-general, as
his successor but other senior officials of the faction opposed the
appointment and selected Mr Obuchi. He took office before a consensus had
been reached, an unusual move in Japan.
Fearing that Mr Ozawa could dominate the party if he controlled that
faction, the heads of the four other factions supported Mr Obuchi, although
he does not have majority support within his own group.
These factions are not based on ideology, but on personalities. The largest
faction, the Takeshita faction, owes its name to former Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita, who was forced to resign in a separate scandal three years
ago.
The deep rifts within the Takeshita faction and among the other groups have
prompted some younger LDP members to talk of new factions and parties.
The conflict, unlikely to be settled quickly, has crippled the party's
policy-making activities, and prompted widespread criticism of the LDP's
neglect of government business.
Mr Obuchi, 55, toured the offices of the faction heads yesterday, promising
to 'heal the wounds' opened in recent days and to reform the scandal-prone
Japanese political system. Mr Ozawa's enthusiasm for deep political reforms
intimidated the party elders, who are comfortable with the more modest
ambitions of Mr Obuchi, a former chief cabinet secretary.
Meetings of senior faction officials are planned for this weekend. But it is
unlikely the disputes will be resolved, prompting some Japanese commentators
to call for the return of the disgraced Mr Kanemaru, who was capable of
keeping order within the party.
Mr Kanemaru had played an important role in mustering support for details of
the recent emergency economic package. The appointment of the politically
weak Mr Obuchi suggests the party now has no one capable of performing that
powerbroking role.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Paris defiant in eye of Gatt storm: Why the country's
farmers are holding up a deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the eye of the storm over the latest breakdown in the Gatt negotiations,
France yesterday seemed calmly defiant.
Under fire from Washington, and cross-fire from some of its EC partners, the
French government stressed its desire for an eventual Gatt accord, but not
one which 'unfairly sacrificed' the interests of its farmers to those of
their US competitors.
Both the government and the main farmers' union, FNSEA, claimed the US
interruption of talks was electoral machismo, aimed at trying to keep
President Bush in the White House.
Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, yesterday echoed the view which Mr
Roland Dumas, the foreign minister, expressed earlier this week that serious
bargaining could only resume after the November 3 presidential poll in the
US.
A senior French official said the cause of the breakdown in Brussels this
week had been oilseeds, an issue over which Germany, as the EC's largest
producer of rapeseed, had more at stake than France. 'This is not really a
question of German solidarity with France, beause the Germans have their own
problems in this sector', he said.
'We have shown that we are ready to take difficult decisions in
circumstances where an agreement is balanced', the official said in
reference to France's acquiescence in the reform of the common agricultural
policy. 'But in the case of Gatt, we are not there yet.' It seems most
unlikely the ruling socialists, far behind the main opposition parties in
the opinion polls, will want to take any more 'difficult decisions' in the
run-up to next March's elections.
It may seem odd that a socialist government should appear so beholden to the
country's farmers who generally cast their votes to the right of the
political spectrum. In one recent opinion poll, for instance, 79 per cent of
farmers said they would vote for Mr Jacques Chirac, the neo-Gaullist leader,
in a presidential race, compared to only 21 per cent for Mr Michel Rocard,
the likely socialist standard-bearer.
But French farmers' political clout is partly due to their sheer number.
There are still at least 1m working farmers - 6 per cent of the electorate -
and the 'farm vote' is swelled further by many retired farmers. According to
FNSEA, the 'monde rurale', encompassing all those in France's small villages
and towns whose livelihoods are linked to farmers' prosperity, amounts to 17
per cent of the 37m electorate.
On top of this is the political quirk that the rural (as distinct from the
urban) population remains over-represented in the indirectly-elected French
Senate, though, due to electoral boundary changes in 1986, this is no longer
so in the directly-elected National Assembly.
The ruling socialists got a nasty reminder of the power of the farm lobby in
the Maastricht referendum, in which farmers nearly tipped the balance by
voting 63 to 37 per cent against the treaty.
It is significant that the lynch-pin of President Mitterrand's new strategy
to attract middle-of-the road voters was the appointment in September of Mr
Jean-Pierre Soisson, a centrist, as his new agriculture minister. Any
serious French concessions in Gatt on agriculture would blow this strategy.
Few in France are willing to take on the farm lobby. France's big service
companies would like a rapid Gatt deal to expand financial and
telecommunications exports. But they only get a weak hearing inside the
government. Their natural channel of influence would be the minister of
industry, Mr Dominique Strass-Kahn. But he is also responsible for foreign
trade, and agricultural goods account for 16 per cent of total exports.
It is precisely because of this that France is most exercised, not to say
angry, about US demands that the EC should cut not only the money it spends
on subsidising exports, but the actual volume of these shipments by 24 per
cent over six years. The particular gripe is that the reference period
chosen by the US is 1986-88, when EC cereal exports averaged 23.3m tonnes a
year.
Since then EC cereal exports have risen, by 1991-2, to nearly 28m tonnes, of
which France accounted for 10.4m tonnes. Thus, the French complaint is the
US is asking the EC in general, and France in particular, to take a far
bigger cut than Washington pretends to realise.
MR Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director general, yesterday called for negotiators to
keep cool, reports David Dodwell.
'We have to wait a bit, let the dust settle, and remind ourselves that this
is another moment of tension, not the first one.'
He said he was considering calling the trade negotiating committee, the main
Gatt body dealing with the six-year-long Uruguay Round talks next week to
assess the situation.
'I would not like to be in the shoes of either the Community or the US
coming back to say to other contracting parties that they have failed to
settle their differences. There will be a great deal of anger, for the sake
of what is at stake.'
He believed common sense would eventually produce a breakthrough: 'I can't
imagine that the US or the EC would take the responsibility of breaking down
the round at a time when we need so much a success as a signalfor the very
sluggish world economy.'
He said the breakdown coming after hopes of a breakthrough had
over-dramatised the situation.
'The round is a multilaterial round and is being negotiated here in Geneva.
We have the institutions in place to push the negotiations forward. The EC
and the US have to come back to Geneva, and it is then that we will know
what the real situation is. In the meanwhile, we have to let the dust
settle, and them we can act on that.'

Lord Owen, the EC mediator, and Mr Cyrus Vance, for the UN, said in Geneva
that territory seized by force would not be recognised. 'We do not accept
this status quo as permanent and we intend to see that it is changed', Lord
Owen said.
Earlier, the UN human rights investigator for ex-Yugoslavia, Mr Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, said on his return from an 11-day visit to the region that the
objectives of the 'ethnic cleansing' policy in Bosnia had already been
achieved. But Lord Owen said the constitution for Bosnia-Hercegovina now
being drafted would provide for the effects of 'ethnic cleansing' to be
reversed.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
RUSSIAN government ministers and their supporters yesterday warned of an
imminent danger of 'fascism' as the battle lines were drawn ever more
sharply between the majority of parliamentary deputies and the embattled
reformers around Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president.
The army also stepped in as Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev warned
the government's opponents yesterday that the army backed Mr Yeltsin and
hinted it was ready to defend him with force.
'The army is on the side of the president, its commander-in-chief,' he said
on television. 'Some politicians, making what they think are bold
declarations towards the government and especially the legally elected
president, are unaware of the consequences, not just political, but in terms
of force, which could result from whipping up such political passions,' he
said.
Earlier Mr Pyotr Fillipov, a leading government supporter warned of a
growing danger from 'former communists who are tomorrow's fascists'.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, himself departed from his usual
restrained rhetoric when he said that 'in general, there exists a real
danger of fascism'.
The past 10 days have shaken Russia's political world out of a state of
restrained hostilities to the verge of open war. The fragile power structure
of the country is now in a ferment as the various forces battle for
supremacy round the figure of President Yeltsin.
On the government side, a group of ministers, together with Mr Yeltsin's
most senior adviser, opened the campaign by briefing foreign journalists
last Friday on the dangers of a reactionary coup.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister refined the argument to a claim that
the president himself was under direct threat.
Gen Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president and leading figure in the centrist
Civic Union coalition - a coalition which has become increasingly hostile to
the government, while still pledging allegiance to the president, democracy
and reform - called directly on Wednesday for the resignation of more than
six government ministers. On the same day, the Russian parliament rejected
Mr Yeltsin's call for a four-month postponement of the Congress of People's
deputies - the full legislature, comprising 1,045 deputies, many of them
ex-communists, who are mostly bitter opponents to the government and its
reform plans. Gen Rutskoi endorsed the parliament's action.
In the midst of this, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker,
provided some light relief when he was accused, on Wednesday, of being under
the influence of drink or drugs by Ms Bela Denisenko, the deputy minister of
health. Mr Khasbulatov had alleged his life was in danger and that he was
under constant surveillance: his medical advisor said he was suffering from
overwork, too little sleep and too much smoking, and had him hospitalised.
The incident had the political world buzzing, - but is an indication of the
feverishly antagonistic state into which politics has fallen.
These events took place against a background of steadily worsening economic
crisis. Mr Feodor Prokopov, head of the Federal Employment Service, said
this week unemployment had shot up from 200,000 to 600,000 over the past
month and would reach nearly 1m by the end of the year - this may grossly
understate the reality.
In seeking to keep at bay the spectre of unemployment, the government has
simply given up monetary discipline and has made little attempt to
restructure industry. It is in danger of getting the worst of both worlds:
it has not achieved a breakthrough in reform, but has not placated the
forces ranged against it.
Even if the president and a reform cabinet can bear this very hard pounding,
it is now clear that radical reform, as conceived by Mr Gaidar's team and
the world financial institutions, principally the IMF, is in tatters and can
hardly be revived.
Western governments, distracted as they all are by domestic pressures will,
when they again focus on Russia, be required to take account of a situation
much grimmer than it was in midsummer, when the Group of Seven met Mr
Yeltsin in Munich and pledged continuing support. The IMF-approved plan for
a rapid march to financial stability will not work: instead, aid will be
required to achieve political stability.
It may already be too late for the limited purchase foreign countries can
exert. Even moderate opinion is deeply sceptical of western intentions: the
'centre' has shifted to a toughening nationalist position.
Mr Yeltsin, like Mr Mikhail Gorbachev before him (though he hates the
parallel), is seeking to pursue reform by a mixture of stubbornness,
political skill and compromise; he has cards left to play, but they mostly
involve raising the ante to confrontation, rather than making deals which
can play one force off against the other.
Winter is coming, and it will be the hardest the Russian president has yet
had to face.

<TEXT>
THREE former senior French health officials received prison sentences
yesterday after being found guilty of allowing blood carrying the HIV virus
to be injected into 1,200 haemophiliacs in the most serious medical scandal
to hit France in recent years.
A Paris court sent Dr Michel Garretta, former head of the national blood
transfusion centre, to prison for four years for fraud and criminal
negligence and fined him FFr500,000 (Pounds 60,241), the heaviest sentence
available.
More than 250 haemophiliacs have died as a result of receiving infected
blood seven years ago from the state transfusion service, at the time a
monopoly. The trial, which opened in the summer, has been an emotionally
charged factor in the declining popularity of the ruling Socialist party.
Dr Garetta's colleague, Dr Jean-Pierre Allain, former head of transufusion
research at the centre, was given a four-year sentence with two years
suspended, on the same charges.
He said yesterday he had been made a scapegoat and would appeal. Dr Allain
was suspended yesterday from a British post as a director of the East
Anglian blood transfusion service.
The third official, Mr Jacques Roux, former public health director, received
a four-year suspended sentence for criminal negligence, while a fourth, Dr
Robert Netter, former director of the health ministry laboratory, was
acquitted of the same charge.
In addition, the court ordered Mr Garretta and Mr Allain and the national
blood transfusion foundation to pay FFr9.2m to the victims, who will also
receive compensation from the government. This will run into 'billions of
francs' Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said yesterday.
Aids sufferers' groups yesterday condemned the sentences as inadequate and
renewed calls for for the trial of the politicians responsible for health at
the time.
Members of Act Up, the leading anti-Aids action group, demonstrated outside
the court calling for a 'Nuremberg of Aids.'
However, government ministers can only be tried for crimes relating to their
jobs if impeached by parliament. The right-wing opposition tried without
success earlier this month to impeach Mr Laurent Fabius, prime minister at
the time, plus Mrs Georgina Dufoux and Mr Edmond Herve, former ministers of
social security and health.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Kohl backs tax to paycosts of unification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl has thrown his weight behind moves for a tax increase
in Germany in 1995 to help pay for the accumulated costs of unification -
but with a freeze on taxation for the next two years.
The plan, proposed in a motion to next week's annual conference of Mr Kohl's
ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU), is an attempt to reconcile the
demands from the east for an urgent injection of funds, and strenuous
resistance from the German business sector to any suggestion of an early tax
rise.
By postponing any tax rise until 1995, Mr Kohl is making further drastic
cuts in state spending in the west inevitable in the next two years.
It also means that he can keep his promise that there will be no tax
increases in the life of his current government - which runs until elections
in 1994.
At the same time, it is clear that by 1995, accumulated debts for
unification from the Treuhand privatisation agency, and the German Unity
Fund, will all fall on the central exchequer, with devastating effects for
the budget deficit.
In spite of its political attractions, the call for a 1995 tax rise was
immediately criticised by German industry. Mr Tyll Necker, the president of
the BDI, the German federation of industry, said the government was putting
the cart before the horse: the immediate requirement was for savings to be
made.
The German government yesterday announced a deal on who will pay for the
huge backlog of environmental damage caused by east German industries, thus
removing an important stumbling block to new private investment.
The agreement means that the Treuhand privatisation agency will be
responsible for 60 per cent of the cost of cleaning up the damage, and the
six federal states in the east will pay for the remainder.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Bank of Italy drops discount rate to 14%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Italy yesterday announced it was lowering the discount rate one
percentage point to 14 per cent from Monday.
This is the first signal that the Italian monetary authorities believe the
recent turbulence in the international foreign exchange markets has calmed
and that the lira has achieved a relatively stable floating rate.
The move came a day after the Italian parliament approved a special law
delegating the Amato government to carry out structural reforms in pensions,
the health service, local government and the civil service. These four areas
have been one of the main causes of the country's huge public sector
deficit, equivalent to more than 10.5 per cent of gross domestic product.
The reforms will provide one third of the savings in the 1993 budget.
A Bank of Italy statement said the drop in the discount rate was also
prompted by the calmer state of the international markets and by the
continued decline in Italian inflation. Preliminary figures for this month
suggest the annual average for inflation will be 5 per cent.
Although this continued fall has yet to reflect the effects of the lira's
devaluation and float since it left the Exchange Rate Mechanism along with
sterling on September 17, the authorities appear confident the impact can be
limited in Italy's depressed economy.
The central bank has been under pressure for several days to follow the
general easing of rates in Europe, and in the past two weeks has been
gradually lowering its short term and overnight rates. However, this time it
has been especially cautious. Officials were well aware of the experience of
August.
On August 8 the discount rate was dropped from 13.75 per cent to 13.25 per
cent in response to parliament approving the 1992 emergency budget. But by
the end of the month the Bank of Italy was forced to begin defending the
lira again, leading to the last rise on September 4. Each one percentage
point drop in interest rates is estimated to lower the cost of servicing
Italy's debt by some L15,000bn a year.
Over the past week, the lira has stabilised against the D-Mark around the
L870 to L880 level. This compares with floating rates of nearly L1,000 at
the height of market turbulence. The current parity is close to where Bank
officials believe the lira could hold. This is a 16 per cent devaluation
against the German currency.
Officials yesterday declined to specify when the lira was likely to seek
re-entry to the ERM. But Italy is expected to wait until more items in the
budget are approved and completion of negotiations for an Ecu8bn standby
facility from the EC. This means re-entry is unlikely before December.
Mr Florio Fiorini, the Geneva-based Italian financier, has been arrested by
Swiss police on charges of alleged fraud in connection with the collapse of
his stock market quoted Sasea holding company, writes Haig Simonian from
Milan.
Mr Fiorini is best known as the one-time partner of Mr Giancarlo Parretti,
the Italian businessman with whom he took over the MGM film studios in the
US. The two financiers parted company last year, and Mr Parretti has since
been involved in a legal battle with his bankers. The administrators of
Sasea have until the end of February to put forward plans to restructure the
group. In spite of numerous disposals, Sasea is still weighed down by heavy
borrowings.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday acted to dispel fears of draconian EC-wide
restrictions on data processing with the publication of drastically revised
measures to ease the cross-frontier flow of information.
Interest groups had raised vociferous objections to the commission's first
draft directive on data protection, which was published in 1990.
But the commission, which admits the first version was prepared in haste,
has now rewritten the text to meet criticism that it would have hampered the
private sector, while giving the public sector a free rein to process
personal data.
The commission argues that if national data protection laws are not
harmonised, EC countries with high levels of protection - such as Britain
and Germany - will be able to restrict data transmission to their EC
partners.
Among specific changes in the complex text is a decision to apply broadly
the same rules on personal data to public and private sector. Human rights
groups feared that under the earlier text governments would be able to do
what they wanted with personal data.
The commission has also met direct marketers' demands for an 'opt-out'
clause, which will allow them to use personal data - for example, lists of
addresses - unless data subjects have already expressed an objection.
Brussels' controversial proposals to prohibit transfers of data to countries
such as Taiwan which offer little or no protection for personal data have
also been watered down slightly.
The commission hopes the directive will be adopted by member states next
year, and it could come into force from July 1, 1994.

FT  24 OCT 92 / La dolce vita among the ruins: Even in a crisis, Christian
Tyler finds Rome is still civilised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS SAID that the barbarians were overawed when they descended on Rome for
their regular pillages. We, the latter-day Franks, Huns, Norsemen and Celts,
are not so much overawed as intimidated by the Eternal City. We come in a
spirit of pilgrimage, not pillage, crossing the Alps to be dazzled by the
light, liberated by the life and cowed by the monuments of the emperors and
popes.
Even at this time of the year when lightning flickers behind the seven hills
and the city steams in daily downpours we are to be seen swarming through
the streets. At the head of each patient flock marches a drover, an umbrella
held aloft in place of a shepherd's crook. When two flocks collide and merge
there are bleats of alarm from some of the old wethers, afraid of becoming
detached and maybe lost for ever.
Shoulder to shoulder, nose to tail, the pilgrims plod through the Vatican
galleries; they shuffle dutifully past sculptures, tapestries, busts, urns
and frescoes until, more dead than alive, they are squeezed through the last
narrow doorway into that sublime collecting ring, the Sistine Chapel.
Our puritan decency may be shocked by the pagan extravagance of Rome's
religious art. But our blood is certainly heated by the sensuality of a
Michelangelo or Bernini nude, by the sight of strong marble fingers pressing
into soft marble flesh. The sculptor Canova is said to have been so excited
by his portrait of the beautiful Pauline Borghese, Napoleon's sister, that
he would sniff her marbled armpit to make sure his statue was not alive.
We sweat, we suffer; but we have no choice. And the Romans know it. They
smile at us with pity as they charmingly disembarrass us of our money.
It is no good us saying the Italians have nothing but their past to be proud
of. Of course the economy is bankrupt, the government perilously feeble, the
politicians corrupt, the bureaucracy a joke and the country beset by
scandal. The Roman modus vivendi is enough to drive the punctual, orderly
northerner to the verge of insanity.
But secretly we are envious. How do they get away with it? In this
atmosphere of crisis - and the present crisis, you are daily assured, is the
greatest of them all - they should be going about with furrowed brows,
grasping at any straw of comfort they can glean from the news bulletins.
Instead you see everywhere the same old insouciance. A glass of dry Marsala
to wash down the stuffed quail? Why not? A drop of brandy to finish off? Of
course.
The self-confidence of the Italians is superb. One veteran observer explains
it by saying that Italy does not exhaust herself by looking for answers but
lives with her problems. It is the trick of believing that so long as the
little things of life 'vanno bene' the big issues will take care of
themselves.
Perhaps that is why Italians have always been among the keenest federalists
in Europe. If Brussels wants to take on some of our bigger burdens, then let
her do so: it cannot be worse than the government in Rome. If the foreign
banks want to do business here, let them: they can only be an improvement on
what goes on already. After all, wasn't the original treaty signed in Rome
and didn't the word subsidiarity originate in the Vatican itself?
One cannot help making the comparison with Britain, a country struggling to
remain in the first division of nations and psychologically still crippled
by the loss of empire. It is as if Britain's past were a burden to her
rather than a cause for self-confidence and pride, as if a great cultural
legacy were an excuse for obsessive nostalgia rather than a guarantee of
future enjoyment.
To live in a museum need not make you whey-faced with worry: on the
contrary, what is more comforting than to wake up each day surrounded by the
glorious remains of your past?
With their exploding debt and collapsing politics the Italians have every
reason to be afraid of finding themselves beggars on the fringe of Europe.
And maybe, this time, they will. But what matters is that they don't see it
like that. Something will turn up.
Where we northerners look for big problems and complete solutions, the
Romans are content to piece their lives together from day to day, like
mosaic. And that is why, like Goethe and Ibsen, Liszt or Mozart, we need to
climb the Alps and take a breath of air on the other side. Here in Italy,
everyone can have his shout.

Thompson-Noel meets owner Bill Gredley

TWENTY-ONE years ago I stood in the grandstand at Epsom racecourse and
watched Mill Reef, one of the century's greatest racehorses, flash to
victory in the English Derby. At the end of that season - 1971 - I and
hundreds of Mill Reef's fans flew to Paris where Paul Mellon's champion
scored his most famous victory in Longchamp's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, the
world's greatest horserace.
Mill Reef has departed. He has gone to the paddock in the sky where he
listens to celestial birdsong and watches beautiful cloudscapes compose and
recompose themselves, morning and night, above the marble-bright stable
reserved for Turf Legends.
Gone, but not forgotten, for Mill Reef's genes still whizz round racetracks
with graceful athleticism, and will do so for centuries. Seven years after
Mill Reef won at Epsom, one of his sons, Shirley Heights, also won the
English Derby. Seven years after that, one of his sons, Slip Anchor, won the
English Derby. And seven years after that, in June 1992, one of Slip
Anchor's daughters, a bay filly named User Friendly, won the English Oaks,
the distaff equivalent of the Derby, as part of her lead-up to her
second-place finish, beaten a scant neck, in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe
three weeks ago.
To breed and own a racehorse like Mill Reef or User Friendly is one of the
rarest distinctions in sport. Many have tried. They have spent colossally.
But their money has evaporated. In the history of the racehorse - also known
as the thoroughbred - untold billions' worth of time, skill and patient
endeavour has been lost down the drain, flung to the winds, in the effort to
produce champions. Explanation: no one really knows why one racehorse runs
faster than another.
To find the man who bred and owns User Friendly I drove north from London to
Newmarket, through Six Mile Bottom, right at the roundabout to the village
of Stetchworth, left into Church Lane and up to the entrance to Stetchworth
Park Stud. I stopped the car at a big white gate. It opened electronically.
In I ventured, nursing my car over the sleeping policemen that are one of
the millionaire-hallmarks of big-scale racing estates, from Newmarket to
Normandy to blue-grass Kentucky. Fountains plashed languidly. Everything
shone immaculately. Serious money.
Extremely serious money. The owner of Stetchworth Park, where User Friendly
was born, is Bill Gredley, a mild and modest Englishman, 59, whose
privately-owned Unex Group (property, oil and gas in Canada, local bus
companies, etc), has assets, he told me, of about Pounds 100m  - suitable
underpinning for a racing empire of 170-180 horses, including mares,
stallions, foals, yearlings and horses in training. Totalling 1,000 acres,
Stetchworth Park is probably the biggest non-Arab-owned racing operation in
Britain.
Recently, Bill Gredley called for a one-day boycott of racing by owners to
protest at low levels of prize money. He withdrew the call last Tuesday.
Bill Gredley started in racing in the mid-1970s when he was farming in
Hertfordshire and decided to buy a couple of mares. From there, things grew
and grew. Had his successes, especially with User Friendly, exceeded his
fondest expectations?
'With the number of horses that we're running, and with our breeding
programme, we'd be disappointed if we didn't breed a Group 1 winner (the
highest category) every year. I know it is difficult, but we've gone close
with a lot of other good horses, not just User Friendly.'
Can anyone breed champions? 'No, I don't think they can. I think you have to
have a feel for the horse. You have to have some empathy. There's a lot of
people who can do it, but they tend to follow traditional lines, whereas I
do things differently. There is a certain amount of luck in it as well.'
Was his racing self-financing, or was he constantly pouring money into it?
'No, not really. Last year our prize money earnings were about Pounds
400,000. This year, mainly with User Friendly, we've got nearly Pounds
800,000. And we sell horses at the sales. We sold one the other day for
400,000 guineas (Pounds 420,000), a full brother to User Friendly. And I
suppose if we wanted to sell User Friendly herself we would get an enormous
sum for her. We take the view that everything is for sale. We are a
business, and sensible offers are always considered.'
I asked: 'How much is she worth? Is she worth the Pounds 1.25m that I
guesstimated in the Weekend FT the other day, or more?'
Bill Gredley smiled. 'I read your piece. I think you were a bit low', he
said. 'For a start, she's now going for the Japan Cup in Tokyo on November
22, and that could be worth Pounds 750,000.' In addition, she stays in
training next year, when she could win anything up to or over Pounds 1m.
Although her owner would not say, for reasons of commercial caution, it is
clear he thinks that User Friendly is easily worth Pounds 2m-plus.
Was User Friendly well?
'Very well. In the Arc she lost 12 or 15 kilos, but put the weight straight
back on. She's a wonderful horse to train because she has a run, she has a
week's rest, then she does two or three bits of work and she's off again to
the races. The only raw exercise she's really getting is in her races.
'Next year she'll be better than ever. She has improved with every race.
She's the most remarkable filly. She's got stamina, speed, temperament and
manoeuvrability. If she had won the Arc it would have been a fairytale, but
we were happy being second.
'User Friendly has come at a good time. My wife died two months ago after a
long illness. It was a traumatic time, and in a strange way User Friendly's
success helped Sara towards the end. User Friendly helped to soften our
sorrow and keep everyone busy.'
I asked Bill Gredley what qualities he brought to the business of producing
racehorses.
'I consider myself a judge of a horse,' he said. 'I don't rely on others to
do my buying, so in that sense I am my own man. If I see a good horse, I'll
buy it, though not for a lot of money. The idea is not to spend big money. I
have a stud manager here. We talk about conformation and so on, but I sort
out the matings myself. We have a training establishment here as well as the
stud.
'Everything is cost-efficient. What we do is find out the good ones and put
them into training. The bad ones we sift out here. It's very cheap to do it
that way. That's something we started last year, and it's completely new, an
innovation. We can have up to 30 yearlings. If you find four or five out of
30 worth sending to an outside trainer, you'll be very happy.
'There is a lot of tradition in horse racing, and people think one should
carry on in the time-honoured way. But I don't subscribe to that. I have a
different approach to breeding and racing. We tilt at windmills, and have
been very successful in doing so.
'I'm not one for yachts or too much leisure. I get pleasure from seeing the
horses, working them, handling them, talking to them, understanding them.
It's something you don't just acquire overnight. I get satisfaction also
from the fact that we're reasonably successful, and like most other things
it has to pay for itself. If we were to run at a loss, like any other
business we would have to cut back. I'm not saying we run it at a great
profit, but we are certainly keeping our heads above water.'
I asked Bill Gredley if he was highly competitive, the way that many owners
are. 'I don't think so. I'm very laid back, very relaxed. I'm not someone
who must win at all costs.'
Did British racing need more prize money? 'Yes. It used to be the Sport of
Kings, and people didn't worry about cost. But things have moved on. It now
costs, I suppose, an average of Pounds 20,000 to buy a horse, and another
Pounds 18,000 a year to train and race it, which is a lot of money. I know
that you don't have to buy horses. But people do, and that is why there is a
sport. There must be more prize money.
'There are, and always will be, a small minority of owners who would race
for nothing. But the others need some hope that they're going to get
something back from their racing. If you don't give them that hope they'll
drift out and racing will go down and down. It will be counter-productive
for the government.'
Although he doesn't use the strike word, Bill Gredley called for a one-day
strike by owners for higher prize money. 'The owners ought to instruct their
trainers not to enter their horses for a particular Monday. Just once. Just
to demonstrate what would happen if the betting shops didn't have horse
racing. Horse racing is an institution, quite unique. The money racing needs
should come from the turnover tax on betting, at present 7 3/4 per cent. The
government is getting Pounds 320m in this way. If they don't keep racing
pump-primed by putting more of the betting tax back into the industry, I can
see that their take will go down to Pounds 180m.'
'But there are thousands of races,' I countered, 'and thousands of horses.
Never have I entered a betting shop or opened a newspaper and said: 'Blow me
down, there aren't many horses to bet on today'.'
Again Bill Gredley smiled. 'You might have to reconsider that next year', he
said. 'There's nobody buying horses. Trainers haven't got orders. And that
is a forewarning of what is happening.'
Will he ever breed another User Friendly? 'I'll be disappointed if I don't,'
he said. 'I consider myself a young man at this game.'

FT  24 OCT 92 / Tories who want a five-year-plan: Dominic Lawson unearths a
strange phenomenon; loyal Conservatives who oppose the free market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I THINK . . . ' said the caller to the Radio Programme Call Nick Ross,
rather optimistically.
'I think,' the voice eventually continued,' that we need a centrally planned
economy.'
'Aha]' said Ross, on the ball as ever, 'I take it you are a Labour Party
supporter'. 'Certainly not,' replied the caller, indignantly, 'I'm a
Conservative voter.'
Later in the programme, which, naturally, had chosen the pit closure
programme as its topic of the week, a fully-fledged member of the
Conservative Party called in. It was another woman who thinks. This one
thought it was a disgrace that we were importing 'cheap coal from foreign
countries like Columbia' instead of using more expensive British coal.
'But that is the way markets work' replied Ross, a paragon of patience. 'You
are in favour of free markets, aren't you?'
'Not if it means importing cheap foreign coal,' the Conservative Party
member shot back.
One begins to see in what way the Conservative Government has lost touch
with its supporters. It has failed to recognise that its own people are
socialists under the skin. And who can blame John Major or Michael Heseltine
for such a monumental miscalculation? Certainly not I, who can still see the
brown stain on the carpet where I spluttered the contents of a cup of tea
while listening to Nick Ross's interlocutors.
But, as Samuel Brittan pointed out in an outstanding article in Thursday's
Financial Times, it is not just confused Conservative countrywomen who are
suddenly seeking some sort of state-rigged plan of national salvation.
'Most dispiriting of all,' he wrote, 'judging by the FT letters column, is
the number of businessmen who expect economic leadership from Government, as
if the UK were a single concern managed by a Whitehall Gosplan. When will
they take a lesson from their Italian counterparts and look for salvation at
their own hands?'
It is particularly astonishing that the problems of the coal mining industry
should have led businessmen and Conservative MPs (frequently the same thing)
to call for a National Strategy For Energy. It is precisely such a strategy
which has got the coal industry into such a terminal mess.
The strategy was that at least 20 per cent of Britain's generating capacity
should be nuclear, never mind the price. And whereas the loss making coal
mines on Heseltine's incredible disappearing hit list are said by the
President of the Board of Trade (based on some very fishy mathematics) to be
costing Pounds 100m pounds a year, the nuclear electricity generating
industry cost Britain's taxpayers almost Pounds 1.3bn pounds last year.
Without 'A National Energy Strategy' this would never have happened, and
most likely there would have been more miners and fewer nuclear engineers in
employment.
But now industrial five year plans - what Samuel Brittan calls the 'snake
cures for depression' - are back in fashion. The Independent newspaper,
purveyor of snake oil cures to the gentry, has come up with a 'a ten point
plan for national recovery'. (Why is it always ten? Perhaps we need only
nine points. Or maybe we could do with 11.) Naturally the Independent says
that the Government must (point number two): 'push ahead with major road and
rail projects' and (point number three) 'revive the housing market'. The
costs of these measures are not specified, although it seems likely that the
Government will find it very difficult to fund through the markets even its
existing expenditure plans, involving the borrowing next year of Pounds 45bn
pounds. No, Mr Brittan is right, our businesses must look to themselves for
economic salvation and success.
Here is my three point plan. One: shopkeepers to offer better service, and
to encourage their assistants to match Continental standards of helpfulness
and interest. Two: all businesses to ensure that their company's telephones
are answered promptly and efficiently, and above all, abandon the practice
of funnelling canned music down the ears of would-be customers. Three: all
businesses to ask their customers 'is there any way in which our product or
our service could be improved' rather than wait to be told that they have
lost the contract.
I have a feeling that this strategy, if applied, could stimulate the economy
without adding to the burden of the national debt. At the very least it
should diminish the national gloom. Perhaps I should suggest it to Nick
Ross.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Arts: Age of innocence - Is the concept of childhood a
modern invention? Patricia Morision looks at the artists' approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISION
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IS THE idea of childhood in art
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
as in literature - essentially a modern invention brought about by the rise
of the bourgeois family?
It was the French historian Philipe Aries who first suggested this idea 30
years ago, in the English edition of Centuries of Childhood. His brilliant
and profoundly influential - albeit flawed - thesis sought to answer two
fundamental questions: were children treated differently in the past? Did
the concept of childhood exist in premodern Europe and if not, when did it
emerge?
Innocence and Experience at the City Art Gallery in Manchester, is a lineal
descendant of Aries's project. An exhibition of paintings of children by
British artists from 1600 to the present day, it shows the great variation
during those centuries of artists' approach to children.
At one end of the period is a portrait by an anonymous artist, dated 1611,
of a little boy dressed in petticoats and holding a teething-rattle. For all
that, with his impassive stare and stiffly formal pose, the child is every
inch the heir to the mighty Norfolk family. Contrast that with one of the
most recent works, a charcoal sketch made in 1983 by Dennis Creffield. Here
is the disturbing image of a newborn baby son, wailing and ugly except (are
we right to assume?) in the eyes of his loving father.
The hang of the exhibition is not chronological. Paul Van Somers (as the
Elizabethan artist has been identified) appears in the same section as
Creffield, and as Augustus John's portrait of his son Robin, Peter Blake's
painting of himself and his sister reading comics, and paintings by Sonia
Boyce and Eileen Cooper. In just this section, titled 'A Sense of Identity',
our attention is drawn to such concerns, whether acknowledged or not by the
artist, as racism, exile, childhood nostalgia, adolescent sexuality,
paternal tyranny and maternal fear of her son's sexuality.
All very interesting but for my taste, in the context of an exhibition, this
is all far too much. What we see in the gallery is a large group of some 60
paintings and a few sculptures. Of very mixed quality, they are in many
cases both interesting and unfamiliar. The exhibition has been mounted with
the eternally praiseworthy intention of being popular and accessible,
children being a theme to pull in the punters much as an exhibition of
horses or cats might do.
But then, because Innocence and Experience is a serious show put on by
researchers committed to art in the service of social history (Joan Crossley
created the interesting if flawed exhibition, Images of the Army a few years
ago at the Whitworth), it swerves violently towards the kind of stodgy
didacticism which surely risks putting up a barrier between the public and
the paintings.
The images are being made to work too hard to serve as documents. In a book,
it works fine (the well-produced catalogue makes a stimulating read);
whereas confronted with the actual paintings, the voice of the social
historian becomes tiresomely strident. There is too much loaded onto these
walls, all manner of social and psychological insights seething beneath the
surface to emerge as oddly random snippets of accompanying text.
Predictably, the show includes the darker side of images of children art,
namely their sexual appeal. That said, courage runs out some way short of
investigating child pornography. In the concluding section entitled 'The End
of Innocence', we are directed towards male artists' voyeuristic
representations of the adolescent girl by Gerald Brockhurst's remarkable
image of his lover Dorette. Although he called it Adolescence, he was
actually representing a woman in her twenties but the point is valid enough
if we think of Balthus.
The eternal appeal of the ephebe surfaces in a dreadful drawing, 'Love Among
the Schoolboys' (once possibly owned by Oscar Wilde) by the scandalous
Edwardian artist Simeon Solomon, and 'Berryboy' by the no less scandalous
Gilbert and George. To be sure, ever since antiquity images of young boys
have been used to convey an overt sexual message. But what extraordinary
mental gymnastics are required of the visitor to see why such images belong
in the same section as Alan Ramsay's little sketch of his dead son and
Millais's famous 'Autumn Leaves'.
In the end, this exhibition is too ambitious for its own good, too knowing.
It might have been better to stick to a chronological hang and follow
through Aries's perceptions, taking issue with the master where he needs
correction. It would have been nice to have started in the middle ages
because of the opportunity to correct Aries who, in flagrant disregard of
the evidence, stated that there were no artistic representations of children
because le sentiment de l'enfance did not exist.
Apart from that omission, there are the paintings here which could have
given the exhibition a clearer structure. Family portraits by Zoffany,
Hogarth and Joseph Wright of Derby make abundantly clear the influence of
Romantic ideas on children's dress and demeanour.
So does this exhibition support Aries's view that childhood is a modern
idea? Unfortunately it is too confused and too overstuffed. It is an
intelligent and commendable venture which needed to be physicked, given a
purge. With the courage of greater simplicity, it would have led to greater
wisdom and pleasure.
Innocence and Experience will be toured by the South Bank Centre; the
sponsor is BT. Ferens Art Gallery, Hull, November 21 - January 10 1993;
Castle Museum Nottingham, January 16 - February 28; Kelvingrove Art Gallery,
Glasgow, March 6 - April 25

FT  24 OCT 92 / Arts: Dances of death - Jackie Wullschlager surveys new
theatre in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW Paris theatre season has had an early, surprise star in Mortadela,
which suggests a slice of charcuterie but is about death, desire,
fleshiness. It is the most irresistibly sexy show in town, a home-spun
musical of one man's memories whose character and warmth not only thrill the
soul but throw into relief the refined heartlessness of Paris national
theatre. Mortadela, at La Cigale in Montmartre, and another powerful music
drama, Zarzuela, nearby at the Bouffes du Nord, suggests that the pulse of
Paris theatre is beating not in the premiere arrondissement but in the
raffish outer districts.
At La Cigale, an old cafe chantant or musical, Alfredo Arias' review of his
Argentinian youth celebrates the tango in its heyday and is a bittersweet
evocation of the women from his past. Some dance their way into his memory
by erotic display, like Cecilia Rosetto in 'Banana' who seduces astonished
men in the audience with peeled bananas plucked from her thighs or
head-dress; the male emcee responds with drag pastiche in bikini and
tropical fruit. Others move to the rhythm of sexual domination and
submission; one woman beats a rope on the floor as she dances to the pace of
a low-toned conga drum while another just out of reach writhes in coils of
fear and invitation.
Whirlwind tangos, jaunty cha-chas, offset sadder boleros and chansons while
an accordion wails notes of sorrow and displacement. Never far off is the
dance of death: trompe l'oeil exchange of a doll for acrobatic dwarf actress
Pilar Rebollar, apparently dashed to the ground in a family row; a butcher,
murdering his unfaithful wife with a meat knife, elaborates the macabre
title.
Most of Arias' numbers, as well as his performers, come from the music halls
of Buenos Aires and they sing and dance with a passion and romance of exiles
recreating a lost world: throaty, tender, lustful, desperate. The show's
life-is-a-cabaret mood is raw yet slick - in songs, satiric monologues,
legwork, the pattern of pumps and stilettos on the ground. Few musicals
exhilarate with the kitsch glitz of purple roses and torso-hugging velvet
while wearing a vulnerable heart so openly on their sleeves.
The French term for play or performance, spectacle, hints at the spirit not
only of French music hall and its Montmartre traditions but also of straight
French drama, which is far more likely to include song and dance routines
than its English or German counterparts. Caligula, which opened at the
Comedie Francaise earlier this year, is a brilliant example of dance
illuminating themes in a complex work through sensual power and provocative
display. But too often a play degenerates into a mindless spectacle of
formal kicks and tuneless squeaks, which is the catastrophe of the Comedie
Francaise's newest production, Lermontov's Bal Masque.
Like Mortadela, this is a dance of death, but the contrast could not be
greater. Lermontov's tale of revenge via Russian aristocratic traditions -
gambling, masked balls, wife-poisoning, duels (Lermontov, aged 27, was
killed in one) - is enacted by puppet figures in black and white, masked,
some encased in porcelain heads like 19th century dolls, who progress by
candlelight to their doom. Solemn music recalls a funeral march; passionless
dialogue is spat out in the kind of sharp glacial French, only heard on this
stage, which could cut crystal. Director Anatoli Vassiliev has achieved a
sculptural beauty which awes for perhaps 10 minutes; he leaves his ghostly
tableau on stage for three-and-a-half slow motion hours. There is no
interval.
Here is the Comedie Francaise at its most degenerate. For decades it has
lived on inflated reputation and mystique bolstered by the French press. The
classical virtues it cultivated have been pushed to such extremes that they
have turned decadent. Productions are lumbering, absolutely unemotional.
Actors move with an authoritarian chic which is stuffy and posey, and speak
in a cut glass monotone which renders all reactions the same. In particular
productions by Vassiliev, the Comedie Francaise's celebrated director
Antoine Vitez, and actor-director Jean-Luc Boutte, who here plays the
vengeful hero Arbenine as a deadly robot, are marked by a cold intelligence
which assures unity of tone, set, costumes but innoculates against force,
tenderness, passion. Unless original shows of the calibre of Chahine's
Caligula - disliked by critics, but playing to packed houses - continue to
join the repertory, the Comedie Francaise risks decline into self parody.
Across the river, Paris's second serious national theatre, the Theatre
L'Europe, could attract the brightest and best of European directors but has
wasted the last year in an almost exclusive 'cycle hispanique' of obscure
plays in Spanish and Catalan made intelligible to French audiences by
surtitles. Its home productions have been mixed - most successful was
Patrice Chereau doing Botho Strauss; most dismal Peter Zadek's Measure for
Measure spoken by a cast which barely seems to understand its lines. And for
all the Spanish enthusiasm, the most exciting French/Spanish work now
touring Europe is Alain Maratrat's feisty, moving spectacle Zarzuela, which
I reviewed at its Vienna premiere, and which has come to Peter Brook's
cavernous Bouffes du Nord theatre.
Highlights to come in the Autumn Arts Festival emphasise the growing
importance and daring of the suburban theatres which form a classy outer
ring round Paris, and it is here, and in venues like the unfashionable
Cigale that the future of Paris theatre looks most promising.

<TEXT>
AMONG casualties in the great shift against Victorian taste early this
century, Burne-Jones was a spectacular artistic victim. 'Love and the
Pilgrim', now in the Tate Gallery, sold for Pounds 5,775 in 1898, Pounds 210
in 1933 and was bought in at Christie's in 1942 for Pounds 21. Yet when the
English tide was already turning against him in the 1900s, Burne-Jones was
still lauded in Europe. Of the Victorian painters, he set himself most apart
from the naturalistic school, and his symbolic forms and sometimes
near-abstract motifs appealed first to French and Belgian symbolists, then
to European art nouveau designers, and later had an important effect on
Picasso and Kandinsky. His biggest literary fan was Proust, whose characters
in Jean Santeuil plastered their walls with Burne-Jones reproductions.
It is the European connection that the British Council celebrates in its
touring exhibition of the artist's drawings, the first solo Burne-Jones show
ever seen outside the UK. It opened in Nantes to coincide with a Burne-Jones
acquisition; at Charleroi, outside Brussels, it emphasised the symbolist
links with comparisons of drawings by Burne-Jones and Belgian symbolist
Fernand Khnopff; and at Nancy, art nouveau capital of France, where the show
has just arrived, it trumpets the influence on art nouveau architecture and
interior design.
Like many Victorians, Burne-Jones reacted against his times. 'Then science
became materialist, and then I painted angels,' he said. But while artists
such as Leighton escaped into paradisical fictions, Burne-Jones depicted
contemporary conflicts in symbolic language. His mythological figures are
desperate, contorted creatures; in the drawings they are running, fleeing,
cowering in terror. In an Aenead illustration, shipwrecked women, bodies,
legs, gowns, hair hurtle across each other in panic. In the Merlin studies,
the convoluted, swirling movement of robes and drapes conveys the agony of
the half-drawn bodies beneath. Repeatedly, in sketches of Dido, of Chaucer's
heroines, figures twist away, heads turn from the viewer, looking down, out
of the picture; one is blindfold.
Where there counterparts in oil remain remote, ethereal, the pencil and
chalk portraits are intimate, suggestive of personality, tenderness. In one,
Burne-Jones mistress Marie Zambaco as Chaucer's Phyllis, swerves from our
glance in a deliberately distancing pose even as her elusive melancholy
tempts us back. The head of the pilgrim in a study for 'Love and the
Pilgrim' has fleshy androgynous features, the averted eye wide open and
confused. The inner mood is hinted at; here is a human type rather than the
black-clad allegory in the painting. Khnopff, who sought to paint the
'invisible' admired above all Burne-Jones precise expression of myth and
sentiment.
The most potent drawings date from the 1870s when Burne-Jones developed the
'quattrocento' style of highly wrought, multi-toned pencil works such as the
studies for Merlin and the Mirror of Venus here. Several display his
obsession with Renaissance hairstyles, locks tensely plaited, twisted,
swathed about the head, which he copied from Leonardo and Michelangelo. (He
once took opera glasses to the Sistine Chapel, 'folded his railway rug
thickly, and lying down on his back, read the ceiling from beginning to
end.')
By the 1890s, the lines are broader, there is a new softness in the head
studies, especially those in red chalk. One of the plums at Charleroi is a
dreamy late 'Study of a Woman' from a private collection, inscribed to
Khnopff, shown alongside Khnopff's similar 'Study of a Sphinx' dedicated to
Burne-Jones.
Khnopff called himself a 'co-reveur des pre-Raphaelites anglais'. This show
casts a doubly illuminating focus on Burne-Jones. A spotlight on the
drawings, more stylised and decorative, less dynamic, than the paintings,
goes to the heart of the artist's aims and vision, giving a closer insight
into his personality. Second, seeing the drawings in a foreign context in
which they were influential, raises questions about the Victorian role in
European art history and suggests that had Burne-Jones and the
pre-Raphaelites been appreciated at home early this century, rather than
seen as an aberration of the 19th century psyche, the British might have
more easily welcomed the European modern movement.
At the Musee des Beaux-arts, Nancy, October 20 to December 21.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Arts: A 'Liar' that's lasted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BILLY LIAR opened in 1960 at the Cambridge Theatre with Albert Finney in the
lead, succeeded by Tom Courtenay. Lindsay Anderson directed. Now, a National
Theatre production is touring the UK. When it reaches London (Cottesloe
Theatre, December 15) it will be the first London revival since that
original. This sad comedy by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall has spawned a
film, musical, TV series and an American sitcom. The hero, Billy Fisher,
would now be in his 50s. Why has a tall tale about a liar lasted so long?
At Manchester's Contact Theatre, Billy Liar is part comedy and part social
history, class envy and emulation in the 1950s north. This fable of England
is set in a riot of 1950s design colour and the wasteland of 1950s
monochrome attitudes. The tone of this production, like Billy's mind, is
undecided; it looks patchy.
Billy Fisher, 18, grammar-school educated and poised between working and
middle class, is, as his fiance says 'a miserable, lying, rotten, stinking
git.' He lies to aggrandise himself, and weaves deception only to be
ensnared. He lives with rough, decent parents, and courts women en masse.
Eventually his tall stories, his pilfering from work, and his two fiances -
Barbara and Rita - catch up with him.
Billy's way out is south for London, encouraged by Liz, the one who
intuitively understands his pathology. But his failure to leave the damaging
environment is a painful moment. Opportunities are rare, and Billy has wit
enough to know a missed one.
The production serves the play well enough. The 1950s design (Bunny
Christie) is a cacophony of patterns and styles of the kind on sale in New
York's SoHo chic antiques dealers; Billy's grandmother (Elizabeth Bradley)
shows taste in addressing the furniture rather than the family. The parents
(June Watson, James Grant) keep brawling distance from Billy, conveying but
rarely feeling their limitations.
As Billy, Paul Wyett jokes too much to appear wise, and underplays the
adolescent, arrested development which makes Billy's imaginings part of
everyone's past. The 1992 version of the play would find Billy in care, or
working in Virtual Reality. The 1960 version offers the excruciating sight
of someone being untrue to himself: lilies that fester smell far worse than
weeds.
Tim Supple's direction clogs the action in the cluttered travelling set, but
draws good performances from Billy's fiances and in particular from Sally
Rogers as Liz: one actually believes in her hope and ability to save Billy
from himself.
Back in 1959, with unemployment around 2 per cent, a new M1 motorway,
hula-hoops and hovercrafts, the world had looked bright for Billy. But in
the broader picture, Billy pales alongside his real-life North American
contemporaries Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady; to read On The Road (1957) is
still to anticipate the 1990s, whereas to see Billy Liar is to look back
towards Victorian England. This comedy is a serious play about England.
Unfortunately it still feels current.

must target the right market

FOR English Estates, going into arts sponsorship a decade ago was a simple
business decision. Tony Fender, chief executive, had been impressed by the
community projects of some local managers, and saw considerable scope.
'Our creed is to develop the valuable hearts of communities by industrial
and commercial development where private developers will not venture,' said
Ron Parsons, English Estates' sponsorship manager. 'But we believe that it
isn't just by property development that you improve standards of living.
Improving quality of life is just as important.'
English Estates, based in Gateshead, in northern England, was founded in
1936 as the government's response to persistent unemployment in the north
east. Over the years it has spread its interests to the rest of the UK as
industrial changes have struck different communities.
That has also been the pattern of its full-scale arts sponsorship. It began
with support for Northern Sinfonia, the rapidly growing orchestra of the
north east, and then the Royal Shakespeare Company's Newcastle season of
five to six weeks.
Five years ago it ventured out of the region to support the South Bank
Centre's touring of the Arts Council paintings collection, 'Introducing With
Pleasure', in which a series of celebrities - from footballer Pat Nevin to
opera star Dame Janet Baker - picked their favourite pictures. The
exhibition toured to Plymouth, Leeds, Bristol, Liverpool and Manchester.
The idea was to take art into the communities where the company had capital
projects, adding an extra dimension and putting into practice the theory of
cultural regeneration. In urban areas it calls the programme 'creative
partnerships', and it has won two of the Association for Business
Sponsorship of the Arts (ABSA) awards so far.
'English Estates has forged a path for sponsors in the north east to
follow,' said Chris Pulleine of ABSA North. 'There's a strong element of the
arts in its overall programme, and they have made an enormous difference in
the region as a whole.'
It was Tony Pender who founded the Sponsors' Club in the north east, a group
of nine businesses to date which is already committed to arts sponsorship
but which also puts money into a kitty to match the funding of first-time
arts sponsors.
Outside the region, the English Estates patronage has been varied. There has
been the partnership with the Arts Council for the Young Conductors scheme,
by which talented young musicians get a year's bursary to conduct with a
leading orchestra.
In the former naval dockyard at Chatham the company has built a housing
estate. 'The local people never believed we could bring big companies there,
so we've done it for them,' said Parsons. 'We had the LSO brass ensemble in
July, and the RSC is going, too.'
The latest venture is English Classics, a Pounds 100,000 programme in which
four regional repertory theatres get to present a big production. The first
has just finished at the West Yorkshire Playhouse where J B Priestley's When
We Were Married was on for five weeks. Marlowe's Dr Faustus opens at the
Nottingham Playhouse on November 5 for three weeks, followed by Ben
Travers's Plunder at Liverpool Playhouse in February and Oscar Wilde's An
Ideal Husband at Plymouth Theatre Royal in March.
'We realised the companies were falling between two stools,' said Parsons.
'They couldn't get the kind of support that national companies could
attract, and the production costs were too great for local sponsors.'
While the arts-saturated south east has been worst hit by the recession, the
north east has so far been relatively unscathed after a bad battering eight
years ago. So while English Estates is responding to the government's
suggestion of selling some of its property portfolio to raise development
capital, it is able to maintain its sponsorship, which has risen from Pounds
100,000 five years ago to almost Pounds 250,000, a plateau for the present.
'We need to be seen as an active part of the community in the north east,
and there is a a great feeling for the artist in the region which has helped
us establish sponsorship as a normal activity,' Parsons said. 'But we also
need to do it in other parts of the UK now, and keep our profile up in
London.'

FT  24 OCT 92 / Arts: Musica, where modern music still has a pulse - Paul
Driver visits one of Europe's few thriving new music festivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL recently the European map was spattered with festivals of modern
music; now they are becoming harder to find.
London's distinguished Almeida Festival has all but disappeared, Royan and
La Rochelle have gone, Metz has shrunk to a weekend, and the Venice Biennale
is troubled. But Strasbourg's 'international festival of the musics of
today', Musica, continues to shine as an example of enlightened underwriting
and energetic open-minded programming. With a budget of more than four times
(c. Pounds 800,000) that of its nearest British equivalent, the Huddersfield
Festival, Musica can afford to run for 16 days, fill them with some 60
events, take heady risks and make bold gestures. Its money comes from
copious sponsorship and hefty local and national subsidies.
Musica was founded on a central government directive in 1983, Maurice
Fleuret, himself an ex-festival director (Lille), being the instrumental
bureaucrat. This year's festival, directed by Jean-Dominique Marco with the
assistance of Marc Dondey, was the triumphant tenth, opening with a heady
risk - a choral-orchestral concert devoted to the music of that Italian
maverick Giacinto Scelsi - and ending with what would have been the boldest
of gestures, the first French performance of Tippett's evening-long
'oratorio' The Mask of Time, had there not been a decisive problem with the
Polish choir involved. The French premiere of the same composer's third
symphony (1972) took place instead - still a pretty bold undertaking; but as
played by the Orchestre Philharmonique de la Radio Television Belge
Neerlandophone under Nicholas Cleobury, with soprano soloist Penelope
Walmsley-Clark, it proved a success.
Tippett's and other modern British music formed an important strand of this
festival (the British Council weighed in with support). I arrived at Musica
too late for the hommages to Scelsi and John Cage and for the featured music
of Xenakis, Klaus Huber and Georges Aperghis, but much of the British music
was concentrated into the final four days. One concert, given by the
Orchestre Symphonique de Mulhouse, under Luca Pfaff, afforded the interest
of hearing French performers in testing works by Tippett. His string
orchestral Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli (1963), receiving its
French premiere, found the players attentive and enthusiastic but far from
easy with its florid yet finicky idiom.
The rumbustiously colourful Songs for Dov (1970) fared much better, perhaps
because their urban discontents travel more easily than does the Fantasia's
English mysticism, but certainly because of tenor soloist Nigel Robson's
brilliant expertise.
Works in the second half by young Finnish and Swiss-born composers,
respectively Kaija Saariaho and Michael Jarrell, made curious contrast with
Tippett. Saariaho's 12-minute Verblendungen (1984) for 35 musicians and tape
was a typically refined and uningratiating texture-piece. Jarrell's
20-minute Der Schatten, das Band, das uns an die Erde bindet (1989)
impressed as a tautly managed pure drama of timbres, mostly brooding and
dark.
A decidedly ingratiating Saariaho piece, Monkey Fingers, Velvet Hand, was
one of the 16 short piano paraphrases of Beatles songs that Aki Takahashi
presented in her captivating late-night cabaret-like recital, 'Hyper
Beatles'; the others included Alvin Curran's pointillistic When I'm
Sixty-Four, Walter Zimmerman's When I'm Eighty-Four (the pianist had to
count aloud to 84 in Japanese), and Kevin Volans's snappily rhythmic
Happiness is a Warm Gun.
From a concert at FR3 Auditorium by the fine Ensemble Ars Nova under
Philippe Nahon one got some idea of contemporary French and German
composition. The work of neither Heiner Goebbels (born 1952) nor Pascal
Dusapin (born 1955) is much known in this country. The first writes in a
kind of enhanced jazz / rock idiom, with electronic sampling and
instrumental high jinks (we heard La Jalousie and Red Run). The second is
more determinedly serious, more abstract and dissonant - neo-modernist. His
new turbulent clarinet concerto, Aria, had its first French airing, with
Armand Angster a loudly plangent soloist, and the 13-piece ensemble busily
maintaining a thick tutti accompaniment regulated by timpani strokes.
At the Centre Culturel Le Maillon a matching pair of Maxwell Davies's mad
scenas was given. In the hands of director Pierre-Jean Valentin, Les
caprices de Miss Donnithorne - it was sung, or rather speech-sung, in
English (by the excellent Clara O'Brien) - became a fully-staged operatic
monodrama, set in an authentically mouldering mansion chamber, and whose
Miss Havisham-like protagonist in taffeta and smudged lipstick toys
naughtily with a cucumber and finally pours wine in a stream upon the
wedding tablecloth.
Huits Chants pour un Roi fou was allowed to remain the music-theatre piece
it is, with the instrumentalists (of L'Ensemble Fa) sitting in birdcages
(and bird-costumes) on the platform, the conductor (Dominique My) in front
of them, and baritone Richard Suart, as mad George III, cavorting around
them and realising the complex vocal part with extraordinary skill and
power. He was not, though, allowed at the climax to snatch the violinist's
instrument and snap it, as crucially required by the score. Are French
audiences squeamish about such things?

FT  24 OCT 92 / Arts: Having their cake and spending it - For London's
orchestras sponsorship is more than just the icing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a fallacy that sponsorship is the icing on an orchestra's cake.
Without it, there is no cake, as the London Philharmonic is finding.
The LPO took up its residency at the South Bank in London last month, with
its Arts Council subsidy more than doubled. 'But we would lose money on
Festival Hall concerts without sponsorship,' said John Willan, the
orchestra's managing director. 'The sums just don't stack up. It costs
Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 70,000 for a concert with top-line performers and
five rehearsals, and for a full house we can only expect as much as Pounds
30,000 from the box office.'
The orchestras, for which ten years ago sponsorship was not even icing,
merely a bon-bon, are having to spend more and more of their administrative
time wooing sponsors. Without them, they know that the standards they have
built up will collapse.
But there are risks in wooing big sponsors. 'If you have a main sponsor and
he changes his mind for one reason or another, you're suddenly left with a
huge hole that may be impossible to fill,' Willan said. 'It's far better to
have a basket of smaller ones.'
His orchestra has been lucky with loyal supporters. Pioneer, makers of hi-fi
equipment, has sponsored the LPO's Musician of the Year since 1979. The
newest sponsor is Audi, the German motor manufacturer, which provides Willan
with a Pounds 30,000 car, supports the LPO's youth orchestra and makes up
much of the concert shortfall. The sponsorship enables the orchestra to keep
seat prices in an affordable range of Pounds 4 to Pounds 28.
Other sponsors include Marks and Spencer, National Westminster Bank, GKN,
the car components and engineering group, Commodore Business Machines,
Chelsfield, the property group, and a number of individuals including the
LPO Trust's chairman, Elliott Bernerd.
Altogether Willan can count on about Pounds 900,000 from sponsors this year,
a quarter of the running costs, but the search for new ones to support the
LPO's residency and ambitions is proving unrewarding. 'We believe the cachet
of residency puts us in a good position to get sponsors, but we haven't had
much success to this point. We're working hard on the 1993-94 season.'
Elsewhere, the London Symphony Orchestra's residency at the Barbican Centre
in London is ten years old and its managing director, Clive Gillinson, has
turned the cultivation of sponsorship into a craft.
He won this year's Garrett Award from the Association for Business
Sponsorship of the Arts for his enterprising and imaginative schemes. The
award carried a cash prize for the first time: Pounds 10,000 from Reed
International to spend on the project of his choice. He spent it on a
bassoon chair for the LSO because, he said, the bassoon was the only reed
instrument in the orchestra without one.
Gillinson probably won the award for his work in finding sponsorship for the
Pacific Music Festival in Japan two years ago with Leonard Bernstein and the
LPO's principal conductor, Michael Tilson Thomas. He pulled together a
Dollars 15m (Pounds 8.7m) package, and the festival has been established as
an annual event.
But that was in the pre-recession days. 'It is very difficult to persuade
new sponsors in now,' said Gillinson, who believes the Pounds 640,000
concert sponsorship he got this year will be reduced to, at best, Pounds
600,000 next year. 'Some have had to withdraw because of the recession - ICI
is one who has been very good to us in the past, and want to come back as
soon as they are able to make that decision. But we have been lucky with our
long-term sponsors.'
Peter Stuyvesant, for example, has been with the LSO for 30 years and Shell
has just signed on for another four-year cycle of scholarships. This is a
nationwide trawl for talented young players which focuses each year on a
different area: woodwind, strings, brass and timpani/percussion.
Sponsorship for the LSO is divided into three types: concerts, touring and
education. Concert sponsorship will be down next season but touring support
will be doubled, to Pounds 700,000, thanks to patrons from abroad.
'It is interesting that the last thing sponsors want to withdraw from is
education projects, showing that sponsors' sense of community responsibility
is stronger than their enjoyment of the big occasion,' Gillinson said.
'All public subsidy now is predicated on the understanding that you are
going to raise a certain amount from sponsorship. We decided that we would
not compromise ourselves artistically in going for sponsors, and to our
delight sponsors have responded, so it turned out to be the right commercial
decision, too.'

FT  24 OCT 92 / Arts: How to get the best from your patron / Sponsorship /
Antony Thorncroft gives potential sponsors - and beneficiaries - a guide to
do's and don'ts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

ONE OF the restraints on the growth of arts sponsorship has been the mutual
suspicion between arts companies and potential sponsors.
Arts companies are worried about interference in creative programming.
Would-be sponsors feel arts organisations are unbusinesslike. Experience
suggests that sponsors have more justification for their fears than the
sponsored.
Here are some guidelines which might help create better relationships:
Ten tips for sponsors
Take advantage of government money available to encourage arts sponsorship.
There is Pounds 4m a year in the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme to
boost new sponsorships, as well as tax concessions for the arts in Gift Aid
and Give As You Earn.
Set out targets for your sponsorship. If it is to generate goodwill, fine,
but do not expect wonderful publicity. Sponsored events are ten a penny and
no longer news. If it is to create opportunities for corporate hospitality
make sure the arts organisation has adequate facilities. If it is for
marketing purposes carry out some research after the event.
Most sponsors complain of poor media acknowledgement of their commitment.
This can be improved if critics are personally alerted to sponsorship and
its importance to arts organisation. The Royal National Theatre has adopted
this approach with some success.
Ensure that your guests do not numerically overwhelm a sponsored event and
that they behave. In a famous case Ladbroke's actually attracted bad
publicity when its guests returned late and noisy after the interval at a
performance of Hamlet.
Make sure that your sponsorship actually helps an arts organisation with
real money. Too much spending can be taken up with promotion, consultants
fees, and entertainment. This looks bad. It is bad.
If you want to make a big splash as an arts sponsor the most effective way
is to launch a new tailor-made event, a major competition, perhaps, or a
regional touring programme. This can carry your name, or that of one of your
brands. Take advice from the specialist consultancies, notably Kallaway,
Crowcroft Gourley, Spero Communications, Arts &amp; Industry.
Involve your workforce. In the US one development is for companies to match
the money given by their employees to arts organisations. Make sure the arts
programme extends throughout the country and is not concentrated on, say,
London and top management. Often the best results are achieved by supporting
your local theatre, or orchestra, or gallery.
Have a structured programme. Don't fritter away a Pounds 250,000 budget on
too many small sponsorships, or devote it to one elitist event - unless you
are convinced that that is what you want. Make a fixed commitment, ideally
three years, and add on another year to enable the arts company to find a
new sponsor.
Take risks. Backing the experimental - in theatre, dance, contemporary music
and art - tends to attract a more favourable media response, and often
excites guests. It gives the impression that a company is go ahead and
adventurous. It can also be very cheap. Film and photography are two areas
currently under-exploited by sponsors.
Be enthusiastic. There is nothing worse that a sponsor going through the
motions. It probably works best when the chairman, or an important director,
supports his, or her, favourite art form. Their enthusiasm inspires the
company.
TIPS FOR THE ARTS
Target the decision-maker in a potential sponsor. Companies such as British
Telecom receive about 50 letters a week from arts groups seeking aid. For
good or ill the most effective means of securing sponsorship is through
personal contacts, getting your trustees from the Great and the Good to lean
gently on businessmen they come across at work or play.
Offer sponsors a range of commitments. They can sponsor one concert and
entertain 50 guests for Pounds 12,000, or take an international tour for
Pounds 250,000. They can sponsor a touring play in Norwich, or Taunton. Be
flexible.
One area of sponsorship which has largely withstood the recession is
corporate help for educational, youth and community projects. Theatres such
as the Tricycle Kilburn are not alone in finding this the most fruitful area
for sponsorship. Money raised here acts as a good introduction to the arts
group and releases funds for mainstream creative work.
Seek out successful companies: the privatised industries, food and drink
companies, some multinationals are doing well. Small local firms are often
intrigued at the idea and every Pounds 2,000 given by the neighbourhood
greengrocer or restaurant is virtually certain to be doubled by a BSIS grant
for a first-time sponsor.
Understand that, with the best will in the world, companies facing a dive in
profits cannot be expected to continue their sponsorship indefinitely.
Reckon a sponsorship to have a three-year duration, and plan accordingly,
but be aware that, like Shell with the LSO, the link can extend over 20
years. Work with existing sponsors to find new sponsors
Be grateful. BATS once invested around Pounds 200,000 in sponsoring an opera
and failed to receive a thank-you letter for its pains. Politeness costs
little but carries great weight with a sponsor. The biggest complaint of
sponsors is that arts organisations are lacking in basic business skills,
especially marketing skills.
Be flexible where possible. Many sponsors complain that arts organisations
want their money but give little in return. It is self-defeating to brandish
a corporate name too ostentatiously in a theatre or concert hall but with
some ingenuity the audience can be gently and amusingly made aware whose
cash is helping the event happen.
Explore corporate aid other than direct sponsorship. Under the Business in
the Arts scheme, businessmen with useful skills, like accountants, computer
specialists, and marketing personnel, are seconded by their companies to
local arts organisations on a part time basis. There are also bursaries,
sponsored by English Estates, which allow arts managers to pick up new
business skills by attending management centres.
Investigate help in kind. Companies have little spare cash at the moment but
often an excess of idle goods. Airline tickets for foreign artists, cars,
computer systems, could all help an arts organisation to prosper, with due
credit to the suppliers.
The arts should examine approaches to sponsors which make a connection seem
like a good investment rather than a case of unstructured patronage.
The Royal Academy does this by getting sponsors to guarantee its exhibitions
against loss: a few have walked away without signing a cheque.
The regional and London suburban theatres are more and more the source of
West End hits. Companies could come in as Angels on selected productions.
Sponsored recordings by orchestras could have greater potential, as could
art shows which provide the backer with at least a corporate Christmas card
and at most a commercially exploited print. Arts organisations should show
business that it can speak its language.
The arts should co-operate more in seeking sponsors rather than establish
competitive positions, which often amounts to little more than poaching each
others backers. Good links should be formed with ABSA and the Sponsorship
department in the Arts Council.
The Government should be lobbied, with the arts pointing out that
sponsorship long ago stopped being the icing on the cake but is now a basic
ingredient.
One of the great dangers today is that if the Government reduces its arts
subsidy sponsors, rather than making good any shortfall, will feel that
their commitment over recent years has been taken for granted, and cut back
their aid in proportion.
Arts organisations have accepted sponsorship with amazing alacrity. Many
theatre and museum directors spend too much time courting existing and
potential sponsors. But the collective voice of arts organisations on
sponsorship remains weak. ABSA is the spenders organisation. The recipients
should join forces to make their views better known.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Arts: The feel-good factor keeps cash flowing - Sponsorship
/ A look at how the arts are coping with recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARTS sponsorship was one of the great growth industries of the 1980s. At the
start of that decade corporate funding of the arts in the UK was estimated
at Pounds 6m. In 1991 the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts,
in the first fully researched survey of the field, came up with an
investment of Pounds 57m. Even with the recession tightening its grip, Colin
Tweedy, director general of ABSA, expects arts sponsorship this year to be
around 10 per cent higher.
But, in recent months, many arts organisations, which have come to rely on
corporate support for a vital part of their income, are finding it much more
difficult to persuade existing sponsors to increase, or extend, their
support, and to attract new backers. This is the time of year when marketing
budgets are fixed for 1993 and while there are few instances of sponsors
withdrawing from their commitments (except when, like British &amp; Commonwealth
or Olympia &amp; York, they go bust), there are even fewer examples of companies
increasing their sponsorship spend.
An odd situation has developed. While the figures seem to show that
sponsorship is still in good heart - there has been a 16 per cent increase
this year in applications for the Pounds 4m. cash in the Business
Sponsorship Incentive Scheme, the Government pump priming money designed to
stimulate new sponsorships - the development officers in arts companies are
finding it very hard to tie down sponsors for next year. They are worried
that the experience of BP may become typical.
BP was one of the biggest sponsor of the arts in the UK, with a budget last
year of Pounds 1.2m. Now , beset by financial problems, it is cutting back.
It feels that while it is sacking 10 per cent of its workforce it cannot be
seen to be helping external arts companies.
It is honouring its commitments - to the re-hangs at the Tate Gallery, to
the annual portrait award at the National Portrait Gallery, to the Cardiff
Singer of the Year competition, but when its sponsorships come to an end,
like the BP Arts Journalism Award, and the BP Speak a Poem competition, it
is not renewing, and it is taking on no new events. By next year BP's
expenditure will be Pounds 750,000 and falling.
BP belongs to that group of companies - in oil, property, the banks, and
insurance companies - who are suffering badly at the moment and who were
also traditionally keen sponsors. Fortunately there are still small and
medium sized companies experimenting with arts sponsorship for the first
time and Colin Tweedy is bold enough to predict that even in 1993
sponsorship spending will rise slightly.
It may well be a different kind of sponsorship. Traditionally the arts could
sell itself to business under one, or all, of four counts. Backing the arts
offered excellent hospitality opportunities; it was good marketing, ideal
for getting a corporate or brand image across; it displayed a sense of
responsibility to the community and the nation; and it was also a charitable
act, a good deed in a naughty world.
In the current economic climate companies are much more hard-headed. Some,
notably Digital, IBM, and Lloyds Bank, set targets and evaluate the effect
of their sponsorship money. Digital has perhaps made the greatest commitment
to sponsorship as a marketing tool, preferring it to conventional
advertising. It began in 1986 by focusing on dance. As a fairly new computer
company in the UK it highlighted 8,000 potential buyers for its systems. In
six years it has invited 6,000 of them to one of its sponsored dance
evenings where it can put down social roots, to be built on later with
business presentations. Geoff Shingles, chairman of Digital, says: 'I reckon
it has worked out at around Pounds 1,000 a contact'.
Digital has added theatre and fine art to its sponsorship portfolio and,
through its backing of tours by the European Community Youth Orchestra, has
used the arts to pioneer business links in Eastern as well as Western
Europe. It is now reviewing its links with the ECYO, in which it will have
invested Pounds 2.5m over six years. Its belief that the arts offers an
excellent marketing opportunity remains firm and it is looking for a new
international sponsorship. Digital has doubled its market share in the UK in
the last decade.
Obviously using the cultural and social cache of the arts for entertaining
business contacts is a big attraction for sponsors. Glyndebourne, and the
Royal Academy, which receive no subsidy, thrive through their success at
selling themselves to companies as desirable meeting points. Glyndebourne
has raised Pounds 30m. for its new theatre largely from business, and
although the RA is finding that sponsors are less willing to offer the full
guarantee against loss on its exhibitions which it has secured in the past,
it is slowly finding backers for its 1993 shows. Typically Republic National
Bank of New York, which is sponsoring next months Sickert exhibition at the
RA, is as much interested in its opening party as promoting a retrospective
on the Camden Town School artist.
Companies are aware of the antagonism which follows if directors are seen to
be the main beneficiaries of arts sponsorship. Entertaining at an art
exhibition, or at a concert where the staff enjoy discounts on tickets, is
still acceptable but corporate membership schemes, which accounted for
around Pounds 12m of the Pounds 57m spent on arts sponsorship last year, and
are a more obvious directors' perk, are under review. Companies are cutting
back. It can cost up to Pounds 20,000 to be a top rank Friend at the Royal
Opera House and this now seems an unjustifiable extravagance. Arts
organisations are having to fight hard to maintain their revenue from this
source. Some, like Sadler's Wells, have introduced new schemes, like the
Business Circle, which, for Pounds 1,000, enables companies to participate
in bi-monthly client hunting, business-to-business meetings in the theatre,
plus booking advantages.
Corporate hospitality will remain central to arts sponsorship. Indeed, by
adding entertainment costs on top of the direct aid to arts companies,
corporate spending on the arts could easily be expanded by another Pounds
30m a year.
This is regarded as money well spent. At the other extreme, charitable
donations to the arts, which could also boost the total bill by another
Pounds 30m, are being scaled down. Ten years ago sponsorship might well have
been included in the company's charity budget, along with health, education
and other good causes.
Until recently Marks &amp; Spencer viewed the arts this way, seeking no
promotional advantage from its aid. Now sponsorship falls more within the
orbit of marketing directors which accounts for attempts to justify its
value.
The arts has little to fear from this tougher approach. Its generally
upmarket audience has a greater appeal than sports sponsorship, which is
increasingly seen as expensive, over exploited, and indiscriminate. The arts
offers an audience of opinion formers, the rich, and, in its variety, the
young.
In spite of the recession arts sponsorship is making headway in its most
challenging area: helping to sell a brand, especially to the young. In the
past advertising agencies have been reluctant to recommend arts sponsorship
to their clients: it cuts into their commission. That is why many consumer
goods makers are low spenders on the arts. This could be changing.
Beer companies, perhaps worried about eventual restrictions on advertising,
have leaped in. Becks Bier has sponsored a succession of trendy art shows,
such as Gilbert &amp; George at the Tate; Holsten has become heavily involved
with alternative comedy; and Rolling Rock with an Arts Council tour of
contemporary music. Now Haagan-Daz, the ice cream maker, has taken the
plunge with the Edinburgh Film Festival. And that epitome of youth culture,
Doc Martens, has just announced backing for its local Midlands dance troupe.
Arts sponsorship to date has ridden the recession fairly well. Overseas
companies, using the arts to integrate with British life, have helped,
especially the Japanese; the Japan Festival raised around Pounds 12m. from
Japanese companies. Next month's Scandinavian Festival at the Barbican set
itself a sponsorship target of Pounds 250,000 and raised well over Pounds
300,000, half of it from Scandinavian companies.
There is also a raft of prosperous companies, such as the newly privatised
British Gas, British Telecom, (which with a Pounds 1.6m. budget is now the
biggest sponsor) and the power generators, which have become enthusiastic
sponsors.
Certainly most of the main arts companies are keeping their heads above
water. The English National Opera has found sponsors for all seven new
productions in its 1992-93 season - although the cash commitment tends to be
smaller than last year. The Royal National Theatre is doing fairly well in
its new policy of finding backers for new productions (Oracle has just
decided to sponsor the musical Carousel); and the RSC has got backing from
Unilever (Pounds 50,000) for its new Hamlet as well as from Royal Mail and
AT &amp; T, which should prove useful if its major supporter, Royal Insurance,
decides that its six- year, Pounds 2.1m, commitment is enough. Only Covent
Garden seems out of favour at the moment.
Obviously the climate for sponsorship is tougher, especially in the south
east. Contrastingly, the Edinburgh Festival this year increased its
sponsorship to Pounds 770,000. Most sponsorships are still entered into with
a vague feeling of doing good.
Usually one committed senior director argues the case and wins over his
colleagues. These directors are having to call on all their persuasive
powers. But, if they think realistically, companies will find that, used
cleverly, arts sponsorship can, for very little money, be a flexible and
effective way of promoting good will, a company, and its products or
services.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Fashion: Plundering the 1970s for a little flare - Light and
fluid is the style for spring, says Avril Groom, decoder of catwalk messages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THREE weeks of hype and hysteria at the international spring fashion
collections there is one worry for the consumer: coping with the 1970s
re-run. The headline-makers have been unwearable chiffon, hippy tunics and
elephantine flares.
But media reaction is as extreme as the fashion shows, and it can be hard to
pick out the message from the catwalk frippery. The message is nowhere near
as frightening as the pictures make it seem. You do not have to don hippy
beads and flared trousers, but the 1970s will be the big fashion theme next
spring. You do not have to waft around in transparent layers, but lightness
and fluidity will be the bywords.
The real master designers assimilate radical changes and render them at once
creative and comprehensible. Armani, Montana, Chanel and Lacroix have made
the change from tailoring to softness seamlessly.
The divisions which existed in the 1980s between glitzy tailoring and the
torn black layers of the avant-garde are blurred. Now everyone does long,
light layers - even Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garcons. Its whole show was in
lily-pale, 'decoloured' fabrics.
Designers are united in replacing the tyranny of the label with a new
softness and romanticism. The avant-garde view is that confident, modern
women no longer need the body armour of a tailored jacket, although the
cynical might argue that the new softness has happened because such a fait
accompli is now the only way to part women from their cash.
Choosing the 1970s as inspiration has both advantages and a flaw. The
original fashion arose out of changes in society and the 'free spirit'
mentality. In today's terms this means the freedom to go as far into this
look as suits you - it is the generally fluid impression that counts, not
how flared your loons are. The flaw is that, as fashion plunders its
increasingly recent past for inspiration, the only people who think it new
and exciting are too young to afford designer clothes. In the spirit of the
1970s, when recycling was last fashionable, the young will find it in thrift
shops.
The rest of us just need to remember the general 1970s outline. Some
original items stand the test of time. You are lucky if you have anything by
Ossie Clark or Biba in your wardrobe, luckier yet if you can still get into
it. Otherwise, look for ideas that embody the spirit while keeping it
contemporary.
Take the military jacket. Christian Lacroix knows how to make it modern,
keeping its shape crisp and confining historical references to contrasting
details and teaming it with longline stretch knits or wide trousers, in
vivid, clear colours or dazzling psychedelic prints.
So does Italian-backed, but British-trained and based, Rifat Ozbek, designer
of the year, who makes it pirate-style as part of a historical South Seas
fantasy involving ikat-printed stretch leggings or sarongs and gauzy blouses
with deep lace edgings. This was one of Milan's best-received shows and
Ozbek anticipates an increase in turnover from Pounds 7m to around Pounds
12m next year.
Karl Lagerfeld, who justifies his soubriquet of 'Kaiser' by designing three
collections a season in Paris, knows a thing or two about jackets. But at
Chloe, whose new owners Dunhill have wooed him back after ten years'
absence, he first succeeded with fragile, lace-trimmed dresses and he
returns to these in playfully hippy guise, as pastel, narrow-shouldered,
fluted tunics over long, fluted skirts or soft flares.
However, his own-label collection is mostly tailoring, pretty in an
hourglass-curvy, redingote shape over a softly bias-cut chiffon skirt or
skinny striped jersey. He saves his best for the discipline of Chanel where,
amid rumours of falling sales, he makes every new trend look wearable. The
military jacket is cropped above the waist to show off flared pants or
jeans, classic tweed jackets are trimmed with a faded, 1940s-style print and
the finale is all fresh white linen embroidered like cutwork tablecloths.
Karl's little joke is Chanel Y-fronts - labels still rule for those prepared
to pay for the privilege of that logo on their knickers.
Faded prints are everywhere, most often as flowers or soft checks on the new
dress, gently bias-cut and high-waisted or seamed under the bust. Lacroix
and Katharine Hamnett say it with flowers, Ghost layers it with floppy,
dusty-shaded ruffled tunics and John Galliano layers it wildly in chiffon
and old lace with uncommercial abandon.
Joker Jean-Paul Gaultier, who puts shirtsleeves on trousers and chest-wigs
on women, wraps the dress in lace over skinny striped jersey and uses lace
for wide-legged trouser-suits as another dimension in the transparency game.
And then there are those trousers. Flares only really convince at Claude
Montana, who widens them out gently and makes them in such fluid silky knit
they are almost liquid - perfect holiday evening pants. Montana has no truck
with hippies but explores one other rich seam of inspiration - Africa. He
tattoos tribal patterns in gold on to gentle, spice-coloured suede and
refines his favourite safari-jacket shape into simple soft curves.
The safari theme, in languid colonial guise, is followed strongly by London
designers Arabella Pollen, Ally Capellino and Jasper Conran. London also
produces the best alternative to trousers, the long, full skirt. In white
linen with Prince of Wales check jacket at Roland Klein or in broderie
anglaise with curvy denim at John Richmond it loses any nostalgia. At
Vivienne Westwood, with a curvy peplumed jacket it smacks of the elegant New
Look.
For evening it blooms into bold monochrome stripes, spots or checks and, in
Paris, into faded satin from Westwood and extraordinary confections of
metallic net from Romeo Gigli. In every case, only the simplest wisp of top
goes with it. For sophisticates, the long sarong is less ingenue, in subtle
Indian-print, sequinned chiffon from Armani, in shimmery muted devore velvet
at Conran. Both fabrics are 1970s inspired but, like all the best of
spring's designs, they whisper it rather than shout.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Skiing: The dizzy heights of fashion - Arnold Wilson dodges
the fur coats in the Dolomites' top resorts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ALMOST any other ski resort, the shops would be full of ski hats and
sweatshirts with the name of the town emblazoned on them. Nothing so vulgar
in the Italian Dolomites resort of Cortina d'Ampezzo, where you cannot buy a
hat with Cortina on it for love nor lire.
When I searched for one for my friend Nigel, so he could pretend he had been
there, I was told politely that the shops in Cortina 'simply didn't sell
that kind of thing.' The only possible place where I might find one, it was
explained, was the Co-op. But not even it had anything so naff.
In Cortina a fur coat, not a ski hat, is the correct uniform. The resort
makes Aspen, Colorado look like an amateur in the fur trade. Like a herd of
mountain cats standing on their hind quarters, the furs come jostling down
the Corso Italia, Cortina's main shopping street in waves - an endless
stream of snug, smug, cosy opulence. Even customers at the Co-op wear them.
But then this is no ordinary Co-op - how could it be in the most glittering
pedestrian precinct in the Alps? Proprietors of even the most glitzy shops
here do their window dressing and even sweep the pavements outside wearing
furs.
Another trait in common with Aspen is that a surprising number of people
come here not to ski, but to be seen. The slopes - unlike other Dolomite
resorts close by - reflect this. The town may be crawling with party-goers
by night - but where do they all go in the morning? I have rarely seen such
little queueing at such a famous resort. Those who do ski often make a late
start. Fine by me - all the more of the 140 kilometres of runs (served by 56
lifts) to enjoy.
Cortina, set in a spectacular mountain amphitheatre, is the most famous of
the Dolomites resorts and indeed its local mountains - Tofane, Cristallo,
Pompagagnon, Cinque Torri, Croda da Lago and the Tre Cime di Lavaredo - are
prime examples of dolomite: the so-called Dolomia Principales. But in skiing
terms Cortina, to the north east of the region, remains distanced from the
rest of the Dolomites resorts because it is not part of the Sella Ronda, a
circuit of spectacular scenery but bland skiing around the Sella massif.
The four-valley Sella Ronda circuit (Gardena, Fassa, Livinallongo and Badia)
can be skied fairly comfortably (depending on queues) in a day. The circuit,
which links the Sella, Pordoi, Campolongo and Gardena passes, comprises a
number of small resorts including Colfosco, Corvara, Arraba (new cable car
this year) and San Cassiano, all clustered round the huge Gruppo Sella
mountain, sometimes referred to as Europe's version of Table Mountain.
It is a remarkably scenic route with more than 27 cable cars and bubble
lifts, 50 or more chairlifts and 150 assorted drag lifts dotted around this
hugely enjoyable ski circuit.
The word Dolomites is derived from the name of a French chemist and
mineralogist called Deodat de Dolmieu who first described these mountains'
unusual and beautiful rock formation in the late 1700s.
Apart from their unusual appearance - huge, often vertical monoliths of
granite with jagged crags that punctuate the skyline, splashed red and pink
as both sun and moon vie for attention - parts of the Dolomites have a
complicated history.
Sandwiched between Austria and the vast Venetian plain, some of the mountain
areas have found themselves in both camps and reflect the two cultures.
Selva, for example (but not Cortina) has a strong traditional
Austro-Hungarian influence. This makes possible the attractive prospect (in
theory) of such healthy compromises as gluhwein parties at Italian prices -
arguably the best of both worlds.
Much of the area was Austrian until the end of World War One and is still
popular with German skiers. Most of the place names have German equivalents:
Selva, for example, is also known as Wolkenstein, and the local language is
Ladin.
The Dolomites cover a vast area, from Plan de Corones in the north to San
Martino di Castrozza in the south, and from Bolzano in the west to Cortina
in the east. Selva/Val Gardena is an early season venue for the 'Ski Sunday'
television cameras with its World Cup race from Ciampinoi down to Santa
Cristina before Christmas. The run was the location for the best World Cup
performance by a British skier in the northern hemisphere: Konrad Bartelski
was second here in 1981.
Since last winter, Selva has been upgrading its lifts: the Dantercepies
gondola has been modernised, the Fermeda chair is now a quad and a new
two-seater chairlift connects Santa Cristina with Monte Pana.
On an even grander scale, the entire Dolomiti Superski region, which covers
38 resorts, can be skied on one lift pass. The area has an extraordinary
number of lifts - 464, serving more than 1,000 kilometres of prepared
pistes. And this year the pass is even valid in the Austrian regions of of
Zell am See/Kaprun, the Gastein valley, Dachstein/Tauern, Schladming and
Dachstein-Wesrt-Krippenstein. But be warned: refunds can only be given with
a doctor's certificate, and even then only for injuries sustained while
skiing]
Factfile: Arnold Wilson's visit to the Dolomites was organised by Crystal
Holidays, The Courtyard, Arlington Road, Surbiton, Surrey KT6 6BW (Tel:
081-399-5144).
Prices for January 3 or 10 in Cortina start at Pounds 269 for bed and
breakfast. Half board at Park Victoria (four star) Pounds 439. Scheduled
flights, departing Saturdays, Heathrow-Venice. Prices at Chalet Melodie,
Selva from Pounds 289, fully catered, including afternoon tea, and wine with
dinner. Flights depart Sunday from Gatwick or Manchester to Verona. All
transfer times around 2 1/2 hours. Self-drive option will save up to Pounds
90 per person. Price of low season lift passes: Dolomiti Superski Pounds 95;
Cortina only Pounds 93; Selva only Pounds 87. Special offer: Pounds 10 off
lift pass prices in all Cortina accommodation and in Chalet Melodie only in
Selva.
On Saturday November 7, the Financial Times will publish Pink Snow: A guide
to the world's Top 100 skiing resorts, featuring Arnold Wilson's
authoritative assessments, backed by the views and comments of Financial
Times readers. This unique guide will also cover ski wear and equipment, top
chalets, a ski brochure round-up, Stuart Marshall's Fast Road to the Alps,

FT  24 OCT 92 / Skiing: Whipping up a desert storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU HAVE had enough of Tyrolean thigh-slapping and yet another fondue,
why not book a flight to Morocco? Seriously. The Moroccan High Atlas have
several metres of snow each winter - while the Alps bite their fingernails
and pray, the Moroccans are pulling out the snowplows. Even in the steaming
Marrakesh summer, Toubkal, the 4,200 metre prince of the Atlas, remains
brilliant white above the fig tree orchards.
The Atlas cry out to be skied but they do not make it easy: this is
ski-mountaineering country. You do not come to Morocco to carve easy Giant
Slalom turns on well-tended pistes; the Atlas make you earn your skiing.
To get limbered up for the great adventure there is a one chair-lift resort
at Oukaimeden, 40 km from Marrakesh. Chic Casablanca folk ski here - and
surprisingly elegantly too. French skiers have come to Morocco for years,
not for Oukaimeden, but for the virgin slopes beyond the pistes.
An alternative Haute Route has been pioneered through the High Atlas with
the help of the local Berber people, who have become used to seeing their
mules laden with skis. The mule is at the heart of Moroccan skiing, and the
fleabitten animals plod right up on to the snowfields.
'Snow is fine to look at,' says one Berber shepherd, 'but it's murder to
shovel. I can't understand why you spend all this money on skiing - is it
really that good?' The Berber has a point: your skis cost more than his
house.
Twenty kilometres south of Oukaimeden and 1,000 metres higher, the mules hit
the snowfields and the real slog begins. You have to haul yourself up the
mountain. At first it is hellish. Skins are strapped to your skis, which
give grip. Where the mountain pitches into ice walls you have to resort to
rope and crampons. You reach the ridge swearing and sweating. It is all
downhill from then on. Arabic coffee is brought out, the skins are packed
away and the Moroccan guide points down a 1,500 metre flank of virgin snow.
Life begins to look up. You take a first turn, then another. You are skiing
a fall-line nobody has skied before. Solitude and serenity hits you between
the eyes: to the west is a tapestry of green fields and beyond, floating up
in castellated amber glory, is imperial Marrakesh. To the south and east is
the Sahara, golden, never ending.
After a day's mountaineering and skiing a Moroccan mountain hut seems like
the Savoy. The guide lights a juniper log fire, a lamb casserole is wolfed
down and a Moorish blizzard whips up outside.
After five days of this cycle, morning climbs and afternoon skiing and
nights around log fires learning Arabic stories, you drop down into forests
of helm-oak where black bear and lynx live. It is world-class tree skiing.
And the best of it is that there is no rubbish strewn over the mountain, no
dictatorial ski patrols, nothing but empty beauty.
You meet up with the mules again at the head of the Ouki gorge. It is souk
day in the village of Asni. Berber children tug at your skis; their fathers
invite you to eat with them. lambs. After dinner you sleep like a baby on a
narrow pine cot.
The next day you take a Mercedes taxi back to Marrakesh. You can now play
golf on the Royal Marrakesh course without guilt, and ponder the jeweled
skiing heaven of the Atlas.
Factfile: Fly direct to Marrakesh on Royal Air Maroc, daily service (from
London, Paris, Madrid). Accommodation in Marrakesh is at the luxurious Hotel
de 1a Moumania. In the mountain villages stay with Berber families. Whilst
skiing stay in the mountain huts of the Royal Moroccan Mountaineering Club.
Cost of mule and guide for five days, about Pounds 100 a head. Further
information: Ski Club of Great Britain (tel: 071-245-1033). Royal Morocco
Tourist Office: 205 Regent Street, London, W1R 7DE (tel: 071-437-6073).

FT  24 OCT 92 / Travel: Along greenstone paths, through parakeet forests -
Angela Wigglesworth treks through the Southern Alps in New Zealand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGELA WIGGLESWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'That,' said Peter, our guide, pointing to the roof of a hut high up the
mountain ahead of us, 'is where we will have lunch.'
IT SEEMED unlikely, but Peter was confident. We had set out early one cold
summer morning to drive to the start of the 40-kilometre Routeburn Track
that crosses New Zealand's Aspiring and Fiordland national parks and was
once used by the Maori in their search for greenstone.
We were three rather inexperienced trekkers getting the taste of the
Routeburn Track in a two-day walk and returning each night to comfortable
Homestay (bed and breakfast) accommodation in Queenstown, New Zealand's most
popular holiday resort, on South Island.
The first day we planned to reach the Routeburn Falls hut at 975 metres and,
if energetic enough, continue up to the Harris Saddle, the highest point
(1,277m) on the track. Our group consisted of Ben Harris, a Rhode Island
lawyer, his wife Anne, fleet of foot and always in the lead, myself and
Peter, a knowledgeable and considerate guide who kept us going with coffee
breaks, picnic lunches and water from the mountain streams.
'Every day is a good day when it doesn't rain,' said Peter (it is a
notoriously rainy area), as we set off alongside the Routeburn Gorge, the
river foaming over the rocks, the forest green and lush with giant ferns and
thick moss on the trunks of fallen trees. We crossed rivers and streams, one
person at a time, on long, swaying wooden bridges, saw a yellow parakeet in
the trees and bush robins at our feet.
Two hours later the path became rockier and steeper, the sun hotter, but by
12.30 we had reached the Falls hut, where some walkers stay the night. It
had 30 bunks and cooking facilities. Pleased with ourselves at having got
there, we sat on the verandah, ate lunch and enjoyed the view of mountain
peaks covered in mid-summer snow.
Did we want to go on to the Harris Saddle? How could we not when we had come
so far. White edelweiss, harebells, mountain daisies and snow tussock grass
grew by the steep path, the bellbird sang its lovely song and in 90 minutes
we reached Lake Harris, glittering blue and silver in the sun. Then it was
on and up to the Harris Saddle with its fantastic views across the Hollyford
Valley.
The following day we took a jet boat up the Dart River. 'This,' said Rod,
the boat company manager, 'is the most challenging river in New Zealand.
Going up-stream, we give you the history of the area and the names of the
mountains and then tell you to put your cameras away as we come down a bit
fast (80kph) to a place that will really blow you away.'
It's not how fast the boats go, he added, as we put on gloves, hats and life
jackets; it's where they take you that makes the trip spectacular. Where
Roger, our driver took us, after a spurt of speed to make us gasp, was
aground on the dried-up river bed. 'It's good it's not the same as always,'
said a cheerful German as Roger, embarrassed at his lack of navigational
skills, had to piggy-back his six passengers on to the shingle while he got
the boat started again.
Then, in 20kms, we climbed 150m, skimming past Mt Alfred and the Routeburn
Valley into the heart of the Southern Alps. Black-backed gulls flew over the
dark trees on the mountains that rose steeply from the water's edge.
We left the boat at a rocky chasm and set off through the bush to Lake
Sylvan, which, said Peter, was an hour-and-a-half's easy stroll. It was not
my idea of an easy stroll: we clambered over fallen tree trunks and had to
watch our feet on the spongy, boggy moss. In early afternoon we reached Lake
Sylvan, shimmering in hot sun. Geese and paradise ducks were on the water,
shags on the far banks.
The walks had been organised by a small company called Outside Adventures
owned by Richard and Elaine Bryant. Richard's great-grandfather came from
Cornwall around 1862 and his family have been in the tourist business in New
Zealand ever since. They offer tailor-made guided treks or one-day walks
(one includes a return trip by helicopter) for those who do not have time to
complete any of the famous treks but want to experience part of them.
Train and bus travel in New Zealand is much under-rated by New Zealanders.
Bus drivers ('My name's John, I'm your steerologist') are jolly people who
make jokes about the places you pass, deliver newspapers and mail, and are
immensely helpful. Journeys are as sociable as you want them to be. My
fellow travellers included a Japanese dry-cleaner who planned to be a
farmer, an American couple in their late 70s who had just done the Milford
track, a probation officer from Sheffield, and Gary, a young janitor from
Louisiana.
Trains are comfortable, clean and punctual. I took a five-hour journey from
Greymouth to Christchurch on the Trans Alpine Express, which has
sheepskin-covered seats. We crossed spectacular gorges and went through 19
tunnels on the climb through the Southern Alps. Turquoise rivers ribboned
across white river beds.
The Coastal Pacific Express, with many of the amenities of the Trans Alpine,
goes up the east coast of South Island to Kaikoura, once a small fishing
village, now famous for its whale-watching trips, and on to Blenheim and
Picton for the inter-island ferry. We saw seals basking on the rocks in the
blue sea.
Further north, near Blenheim, the centre of some of New Zealand's best
vineyards, we passed the pink and blue lakes of the salt quarries and had a
Devonshire cream tea at breakfast time.
Angela Wigglesworth was a guest of the New Zealand Tourism Board (New
Zealand House, Haymarket, London SWlY 4TQ), and flew with Air New Zealand
(77 Fulham Palace Rd, London W6 8JA). For information about tailor-made
treks, contact Outside Adventures, PO Box 347, Queenstown, New Zealand, tel:

and friendly hosts.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Travel: Nuremberg, a town that hid its shadows - Nigel
Andrews searches for traces of an infamous past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LADY at the hotel desk looked blank. 'Where were the rallies held?' I
asked again, 'the Nuremberg rallies?' I felt like Basil Fawlty. I had vowed
not to mention the second world war or Hitler, but had a dreadful feeling I
was about to do so. Finally she flailed an arm crossly in an easterly
direction - with a little coaching she could play Sybil Fawlty - and said
something about a football stadium. Hopeless . . .
I had driven into Nuremberg on my way from Italy to Prague. I needed a
stop-over and the road signs had stirred in me a terrible curiosity. Out
there on the A-bahn, Wagner floated into my head - 'O Nurnberg, die alte
stadt' - and I fantasised a town full of wise old cobblers singing through
mullioned windows. Then, with a change of octave, the music of evil took
over, no less fascinating. This is the town where a madman licensed by 60m
people barked down a banner-lined avenue while the world skidded towards
Doomsday.
'Ze stadium, ja,' said Fraulein Fawlty, seeming finally to understand. 'Ze
parkplatz]' She was still waving an arm at the non-mullioned window of my
edge-of-town Novotel in a way that baffled me, so I decided to go for a walk
and let my feet lead me. I followed a busy peripheral road that curved
promisingly towards distant roofs and TV aerials. After 10 minutes I found a
parking area to the left that I could cross towards the city.
But there was something suspicious about this space. A mile long by 70 yards
wide, it was a large rectangle paved with concrete slabs, marked here and
there with formal patterns. On either side, half-eaten by time and
encroaching trees, were battered stone steps that suggested bygone spectator
stands. A few equally battered cars and vans were parked at the edges of
this giant avenue, beside which gypsies and gastarbeiter families were
cooking meals.
Further down the avenue I saw the tell-tale signs. This was the site of the
Nuremberg rallies, and after the shock of realisation I inwardly cheered the
fact that it is now given over - by accident, if not design - to an
undiscriminating inter-racial dereliction. What would that arch ethnic
cleanser think of all the non-Aryans now barbecuing their kebabs on his
sanctum sanctorum?
Walking on towards the city, you see more evidence: the absurd and hideous
Kongressbau building, a Nazi version of Rome's Colosseum (used today for
little but pop concerts); further off, the Stadion, now changed from a
meeting-place for the Hitler Youth into the HQ of Nuremberg Football Club;
to the north, the ruins of the Zeppelinfeld, a time-warped collage of
terraces and towers commemorating the glory that was Albert Speer.
The ghost of Hitler is everywhere in this bombastic shadowland. As Leni
Riefenstahl's autobiography lately showed us, the Nuremberg rallies were
Hollywood come to Bavaria. Sixty years ago she was here with her Fuhrer:
camera in hand, purring up and down the giant steel flagpole in the
hydraulic lift Speer had designed specially for her. The result,
Riefenstahl's feature-length record of the Nuremberg rallies, Triumph Of The
Will, is still the most chilling present any city ever had from a director
working hand-in-glove with a dictator.
By now the casual visitor feels he has strayed into an episode of The
Twilight Zone. How to return to reality? Crossing the Luitpoldhain, the city
park dotted with further, more neatened remains of the Reich, I passed a big
modern building with welcoming lights winking through small ground-floor
windows. Ah, probably a hotel. I peered into one window. A dozen men and
women in mediaeval dress were clinking goblets while a harpist strummed an
instrument.
Still in The Twilight Zone. But I soon discovered that this was the
Mastersingers Hall, where mediaeval gear is normal. Indeed, you would
probably be thrown out if you did not come dressed as Eva, Sachs or Walther
Von Stolzing. Not far away, if you are a stickler for the real thing, is the
gothic church of St Martha which served as the original Mastersingers Hall.
By now I had had enough through-the-looking-glass experiences and was
becoming interested in a through-the-restaurant-door experience. Nuremberg
abounds in Bavarian eateries where steamy excess is the by-phrase. Meeting
up with a German friend, I ate at a tavern where mein host piles one's plate
with enough grilled meat to sink a U-boat. Sausages, chops, liver, kidneys,
steaks, more sausages, all washed down with a large stein of cold Heineken.
Now it was mid-afternoon: time to see the Old Town. Nuremberg was badly
bombed in January 1945, so much of the 'Alte Stadt' serenaded by Hans Sachs
has been restored or re-touched. This may explain its dinky feel. Contoured
in little hills and dips with jewel-like Gothic churches nudging
half-timbered houses, and the canal giving a winsome reflection to
willow-lined mansions, it all seems too good to be true - like a theme park
sector marked 'Germanyland.'
But there are real jewels here among the mock-ups. Albrecht Durer's house,
authentic to the last exposed beam, leans invitingly at the edge of a
picturesque square, requiring you to enter and admire Albrecht's taste in
severe interior decor. His paintings are in another part of town at the
German National Museum.
The Toy Museum is a Grade 1 disorientation experience. It transports you
straight back to your childhood - or Germany's childhood - as you admire the
gizmoes, follies and knick-knacks commemorating Nuremberg's history as, a
guidebook tells me, the world capital of toy production. I especially
enjoyed the toy horse that, when wound up, plays an excerpt from Die
Meistersinger and then jumps over a large frog.
As for the churches, you must not miss the Frauenkirche and Saint Sebaldus.
The first was originally commissioned as a court chapel by Emperor Charles
IV, but was gussied up in the 16th century by the addition of a gable, an
oriel and a charming tinkling clock-mechanism. The older Saint Sebaldus
houses a priceless cornucopia of carvings, sculptures and richly-wrought
shrines.
Though I stayed at the Novotel, simply because it was there, my German
friend swears by the Zirbelstube Hotel on the Ludwig Canal: very
picturesque, he insists, with one of the best restaurants in town.
Finally, though, I have a few reservations about Nuremberg. No, it should
not be missed, and yes, it is stuffed with sightseeing gems and relics of
history. But too much of the town is sanitised in its presentation. You will
not find the real Hans Sachs here: the old cobbler has fled to comfier, more
mellifluous lands, far from the squawking Beckmessers of the tourist trade.
Perhaps worse, you will not find the real Hitler here. A town that should
exist as an Awful Warning to those who come after has largely tidied away
its Nazi past: aided by hotel-keepers who do not understand their guests and
gipsy families who scarcely know what ground they so heroically desecrate.
It is good to put evil out of our heads; but only so long as it can be
brought back whenever humanity, especially in these neo-Nazi times, needs a
sharp dose of memory therapy.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Food: Hobbling but still happy in Hong Kong's finest - Grand
Hotel / Nicholas Lander puts the Mandarin to the test and comes up smiling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOTEL INSPECTORS and travel writers are continually searching for new ways
of putting the top hotels of the world to the test. Some years ago a Sunday
paper sent reporters to London's most expensive hotels and demanded a manual
typewriter at 2am.
My way of putting the Mandarin, Hong Kong to the test was more original, if
slightly more painful. When I arrived on my first night I was having trouble
walking owing to a ripped muscle. At 8.30 am the following morning I was
lying in the doctor's office on the second floor of the hotel awaiting a
miracle cure and the end to my distress.
The rest of that day was spent in a lonely but very comfortable bedroom
looking out, when the rain allowed, at the Hong Kong Club and the hypnotic
harbour. Early evening I was ready for a gentle stroll and immediately
appreciated the Mandarin's two most coveted assets - its staff and the hotel
lobby.
First, an assistant manager then a duty manager came to ask about my health.
During the rest of my stay I was continually impressed by a level of service
that managed to be prompt and professional, polite and yet friendly. The
hotel's management structure - an Italian general manager, Chinese and
European line management, including one Norwegian and the rest predominantly
Chinese and Filipino - may be unusual but it is highly effective.
The lobby itself is not large, only 3,000 sq ft, with a raised area the same
size comprising the Clipper Lounge, but it is THE place to view le tout Hong
Kong. Conveniently located opposite the Star Ferry it is not only the
entrance to the hotel but also a thoroughfare between Connaught and Chater
Streets.
The lobby monitors those who have just come from Kowloon as they scurry to
their offices in the Central District and many more who call in for a
relaxed drink before the boat home. It is a canvas for the guests to
decorate and I sat down and stared unashamedly.
The Mandarin - built in 1963 - is ancient by Hong Kong standards and, with
only 25 floors, petite (the Crown Plaza nearby, soon to be the tallest
building in Asia, boasts 78). Viewed from an incoming Star Ferry it looks
squat, almost fat, but very secure.
These external characteristics are mirrored internally. When the Mandarin
was built land in Hong Kong was less valuable than it is today and the
internal walls, a generous 3ft thick, keep out the noise from neighbours and
plumbing. However, they also preclude drastic change. In 1963 bidets and
separate showers were unheard of and, although no five star hotel would be
without them today, this internal solidity still precludes their
introduction.
The Mandarin management seems acutely aware that its customer profile is
changing. The quintessential Mandarin guest of the 1960s and 1970s was
invariably a businessman who had time for all the hotel's services. Today's
business traveller - younger and with less time - wants shortcuts not
initially part of the hotel's makeup.
Hence the somewhat incongruous appearance among the Floris collection in the
bathroom (sadly, no nailbrush) of a packet of soap flakes and an extendable
drying line for those who cannot take advantage of one of attractions of
travelling in the Far East - the laundry service. And there is still a 24
hour room service, although there is heated discussion among the hotel
management as to whether an electric kettle and instant tea and coffee in
the rooms would not go against the Mandarin tradition.
But in Hong Kong, with an indigenous population of 5.6m and 120,000 visitors
a week, the bedrooms are only a small part of an hotel's raison d'etre.
Everyone eats out, and the hotels have not turned their back on
non-residents, as is so often the case in London, but instead have converted
their restaurants, bars and public areas into bustling meeting places.
I never saw the Mandarin's Coffee Shop quiet or the Clipper Lounge without a
small expectant queue. In its ten food and beverage outlets the hotel serves
more than 3,000 meals a day. More than 60 per cent of the hotel's 950 staff
are involved on this side of the operation and there is a tasteful attention
to detail - even mundane morning cereal becomes a delight when served with
fresh papaya. My only culinary disappointment was the hotel's Chinese
restaurant, the Man Wah, in spite of its exciting close-up views of the Bank
of China and Hongkong and Shanghai buildings.
I knew it was time to pack my bags when the Mandarin lobby began to work its
magic on me. Walking out of the hotel's Business Centre I bumped into a
friend from the North of England whom I see but once a year - at a wine
weekend in the Highlands of Scotland.
The Mandarin, 5, Connaught Road, Central, tel 522-0111, fax 810- 6190. Rooms
from HKDollars 2,000 plus sales tax and service.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Cookery: Why it's time to get back to basics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH summer time ends tonight and winter officially begins. As the days
draw in our need for comfort foods grows stronger. Now is the time to go
back to our roots and enjoy the best of British.
My first recipe comes from Arabella Boxer's Book of English Food (Hodder &amp;
Stoughton Pounds 17.99), a captivating exploration and celebration of the
flowering of English cooking in the 1920s and '30s. I rejoiced in this book
when it was published last year. Just recently it has won Boxer, most
deservedly, the Michael Smith Macallan award for fine writing about British
food.
My second recipe is taken from a book to be published in paperback next
week, Jennifer Brennan's Curries and Bugles (Penguin Pounds 12.99). An
affectionate portrait of lives and foods of the British Raj, this volume,
like Boxer's, is a well written blend of history, anecdote and recipes.
ROAST HAUNCH OF VENISON (serves 8)
While young roe deer may not actually need marinading, in this recipe the
marinade becomes part of the dish and forms the basis of the sauce.
5-6 lb haunch of roe (or fallow) deer; 6 tablespoons olive oil; about 1/4 pt
chicken stock; 1 teaspoon flour stirred into  1/4 pt soured cream.
For the marinade: 1 onion; 2 shallots; 2 garlic cloves; 1 large carrot; 1
celery stalk; 3 tablespoons olive oil; 1 bottle red wine; 3 large parsley
sprigs; 8 black peppercorns; 8 juniper berries; 2 bay leaves.
Slice the marinade vegetables and cook them in the oil for five minutes,
stirring now and then. Add the remaining marinade ingredients plus half a
tablespoon of sea salt. Simmer, covered, for 45 minutes, then cool. Pour the
(unstrained) marinade over the venison. Leave for one to two days in a cool
place, turning the meat twice a day.
When ready, drain the haunch and dry it. Discard the marinade herbs and lay
the sliced vegetables in the bottom of a roasting tin. Rub the haunch with 2
tablespoons olive oil and lay it on the vegetables.
Roast for 20 minutes at 425 F (220 C) gas mark 7. Reduce oven temperature to
350 F (180 C) gas mark 4 and roast for 20 minutes per pound in all. Once the
meat has gone into the oven, warm  1/4 pt of the strained marinade with 4
tablespoons olive oil. Once the oven heat has been reduced, start to baste
the meat with this mixture.
When the joint has finished cooking, transfer it to a serving dish, cover
loosely with foil and a thick towel and let it rest for 20 minutes before
carving.
Now make the sauce. Process the vegetables from the roasting tin (except any
that are burnt), adding the juices from the tin and some chicken stock -
enough to make about   1/2 pt. Add the smoothly amalgamated sour cream
mixture and process again. Strain and reheat, seasoning to taste and
stirring constantly. Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes then pour the sauce into a
heated jug, and serve with the venison and a puree of mixed root vegetables
and some Brussels sprouts.
BRAISED VEAL IN THE MOGUL MANNER (serves 8)
For the marinade: a boned shoulder of veal weighing about 5 lb; 6 oz plain
yoghurt; l large onion, chopped; 2 inch ginger root, chopped; 1 garlic
clove, smashed; a pinch of saffron soaked in 2 tablespoons warm milk; the
zest of half a lemon.
For the stuffing and cooking: 4 tablespoons ghee or clarified butter; 6 oz
long grain rice, washed and drained; 2 inch cinnamon stick; 4 cloves; 4
cardamom pods, crushed;  1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg; 1/2 teaspoon
ground turmeric; 8 fl oz chicken stock; 2 oz sultanas; 4 oz shelled
pistachios; 8 baby white onions;  1/4 pt double cream; the juice of half a
lemon; 2 tablespoons chopped parsley.
Lay the veal flat and cut a deep, horizontal pocket into the inside surface
of the meat. Process the yoghurt, onion, ginger and garlic until smooth. Mix
in the saffron and its liquid, the lemon zest,  1/2 teaspoon salt and  1/4
teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Turn the veal in the mixture and leave
to marinate for at least six hours or overnight.
Meanwhile, prepare the stuffing. Saute the rice in 1 tablespoon ghee until
the grains are white and opaque. Add the spices and stir for one minute. Add
the stock, sultanas and half the nuts. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes or
until all moisture is absorbed and the whole spices lie on the surface.
Discard the cinnamon and cloves.
Drain the veal, reserving the marinade, and stuff the pocket with the rice.
Lay any surplus in the middle of the piece of meat. Roll up the veal tightly
and secure with string.
Lightly brown the joint in 2 tablespoons ghee in a flameproof casserole.
Pour on the reserved marinade, cover and braise at 350 F (180 C) gas mark 4
for 2 1/2 hours, or 25-30 minutes per pound of meat.
Twenty minutes before the veal is ready, place the onions round the meat.
Cover and cook for 10 minutes. Remove the onions and keep warm. Cook the
veal for a further 10 minutes without the lid.
Lift the veal on to a serving platter and keep it hot in the switched-off
oven. Place the casserole over moderate heat and reduce the gravy until
quite thick, stirring to prevent burning. Add the cream and stir over low
heat until the sauce is the consistency of thick custard. Add the lemon
juice, season and pour the sauce over the veal.
Crush the remaining pistachios. Saute them quickly in the last tablespoon of
ghee and sprinkle them over the veal. Dip the onion tops in parsley to give
them green caps. Set them round the meat and serve.

FT  24 OCT 92 / How To Spend It: Take a cheap plunge in the art market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ART market may be in a state of disarray, galleries may be folding,
artists wondering how to pay their bills, but somehow the Contemporary Art
Society manages to inject some fun and dash into the business of investing
in a little art.
Other galleries are posher, other works of art finer but the Contemporary
Art Society in its annual collaboration with Sainsbury's brings art right
into the mainstream of ordinary life.
For a start there are the prices. They begin at Pounds 100 and the maximum
is Pounds 1,750, far lower than the prices in most of the Cork Street
galleries.
There are the works of art - everything from original paintings, to drawings
and sculptures. There is also the atmosphere - much more like a marketplace
than a hushed and pompous gallery. People come and people go; paintings go
and are replaced by others. Customers seem to come from almost every walk of
life. Some are young, some are old and what many of them have in common is
they have grown to like buying art this way and come every year.
If you have a fine and distinguished collection of ancient masters, this is
not the place for you but for those wanting to know where and how to start
buying there could hardly be a better way.
The Contemporary Art Society also runs a 'Collecting on a Budget' course for
those interested in buying the works of young, undiscovered artists. It
costs Pounds 120 for six evenings and aims to give an idea of how to buy,
what is available, to take those interested to see studios, auction houses,
print-makers and galleries.
The exhibition is at Smith's Galleries, 25 Neale St, London, WC2 from
October 27 to November 1, Tuesday to Friday, 11 am to 7 pm and on Saturday
and Sunday from 11 am to 5 pm.

FT  24 OCT 92 / How To Spend It: It'll be blue and white on the night -
Lucia van der Post treads - delicately - through the china shops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE those for whom the fad for blue and white china seems just that -
faddish, a modish sort of cult, promulgated by interior decorators who are
fond of placing elaborate pieces against strategically-chosen backgrounds. I
will nail my colours to the mast. I love it. I collect it. I could never
have enough of it.
I understand why the English went wild when they first caught sight of those
delicately hued pieces from China and Japan, how they marvelled at the
Persian mosaics and beat a steady trail to The Hague to collect Dutch Delft
ware. No wonder the Staffordshire potteries soon started to experiment with
their own versions of the ancient glazes.
Not so long ago anybody with an eye and enough energy to scour the markets
could have picked up considerable collections of blue and white for quite
affordable sums. Those days are long gone.
A single dinner plate in a good blue Minton, Spode or Worcester will not
leave much change out of Pounds 80 - which means one thinks several times
before producing it to serve the lasagne. Some companies, most notably
Spode, do produce contemporary versions of 18th century patterns, but most
lack the subtlety and depth of their 18th century counterparts.
However, three designers, each influenced by the subtle charm of traditional
blue and white and each wanting to explore the traditional glazes in their
own way, have produced new versions of age-old charmers.
The ranges are not cheap - but then they never were, the rarity and
costliness of the blue and white pigments played no small part in their
desirability in the 18th century - but all are beautiful and the sort of
china that you would want to guard carefully and hand on to your children.
William Yeoward, who already runs a painted furniture business in London's
Chelsea, has just set up a company to reproduce 18th and 19th century dinner
services and creamware with the simple old English shapes that used to be so
prevalent and are now so hard to find.
'I wanted to reintroduce all those generously sized plates and bowls, those
lovely tureens, complete with their lids, and to do for the dinner services
what Divertimenti and Tricia Guild have done for earthenware. '
Pavilion, photographed here (bottom), is the blue and white version he has
produced. Inspired by Delft ware, all the pieces are hand-painted on a pale
blue background and, if you look carefully, you will see that each piece
sports one of eight pavilion motifs.
Each piece has a cartouche of an 18th century urn at the top. There are two
sizes of serving tureen, one for soup, the other for vegetables, both with
lids. There are four different sizes of plate. It took at least two years to
get the designs right as ) old moulds had to be resurrected to get the
shapes he wanted.
For the first collection there are seven sets - some breakfast, some
dessert, and some running the gamut. In my view Pavilion is the nicest but
Housekeeper's and Creamware Service also has a gentle appealing Englishness
about it - lovely plain cream pieces with rust-coloured edges and a simple
central motif. Tureens and serving dishes are gorgeous.
Prices range from Pounds 30 for a tea plate, to Pounds 35 for other plates
while a soup tureen is Pounds 110 and a vegetable tureen Pounds 93.
The complete range of Braithwaite and Scott china is at 336 Kings Road,
London SW3.
Deborah Sears is the driving force behind Isis Ceramics which specialises
almost exclusively in blue glazes on white earthenware and now offers some
seven different patterns. Word of her work has already got out, collectors
are beginning to home in on each new piece and top stores such as Bergdorf
Goodman in New York and Takashimaya in Tokyo sell it.
Deborah's painterly background can be seen clearly in the delicacy of the
designs on the pieces photographed here. She produces pieces in the
authentic English Delftware tradition and uses only original glazes and
pigments such as cobalt and tin. All the pieces are hand-painted.
Besides the tableware there are also decorative pieces such as lamp bases
and the lidded jar and vases shown in the photograph. Besides Landscape, the
pattern pictured above, there is the enormously popular English Garden,
based on a 17th century theatrical garden, as well as tulip and animal
motifs.
Prices for the bigger pieces may seem expensive - Pounds 60 for a large
platter, Pounds 50 for a colander bowl (which, incidentally, makes a most
wonderful piece for arranging flowers as well as fruit or vegetables) - but
there are smaller things, such as the hugely popular flower bricks which
sell for about Pounds 30 each.
Readers are welcome to go to Deborah Sears' studio, an old Victorian
workshop, at The Old Toffee Factory, 120a Marlborough Road, Oxford 0X1 4 LS
(tel: 0865-722729) to see and buy the work. She is open on weekdays from 10
am to 4 pm but during December will be open on Saturdays as well. A good
range of Isis Ceramics can be seen at The General Trading Company, 144
Sloane Street, London SW1, Thomas Goode, 19 South Audley Street, London W1,
The Oxford Collection in Oxford and Flemings of Richmond.
Joanna Howells came to love ceramics in general - and blue and white in
particular - when training to be a doctor at Cambridge. She used to wander
around the Fitzwilliam museum and came upon the collection of Song
porcelain. She, too, makes all her pieces individually - each is thrown and
then hand-painted.
Her work is less delicate, more richly hued than the subtle pieces of
Deborah Sears. So far there are just a few patterns - Heavenly Bodies, which
besides its deep blues also has 18 carat gold and burnished platinum,
Hibiscus, which is more delicately hued, Seahorses and Lilly.
Prices range from about Pounds 60 for a lamp base to Pounds 49 for a
standard bowl. A spectacular 18 in bowl would be about Pounds 140. Joanna's
work is stocked by: the V &amp; A shop at The V &amp; A Museum, Brompton Road, South
Kensington, London; Preston &amp; Buller of Wimbledon, and New Moon of Hatfield,
Hertfordshire. She can also be contacted at her workshop, 2 Albion Square,
London E8 4ES. Tel: 081-341-7306.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HACKETT MAN should be in clover. As from this week he now has his own
complete gentleman's outfitters where nothing jars or is out of place.
There he can worship at the altar of tradition, Englishness, quality and all
those other values so dear to the hearts of those whose preferred style of
dress owes nothing whatever to Armani, St Laurent or anything that could
remotely be labelled fashionable.
All the time-honoured products that Hackett man depends on are gathered
together under one roof. If it were aimed at any other sort of chap one
might be be tempted to call it a men's department store but for Hackett man
a gentleman's outfitters sets the mood exactly - it is what his kind of
dressing is all about.
Its location is spot on, too, right in the heart of Sloane Ranger territory,
next door to the Sloane's favourite shop, The General Trading Company, and
around the corner from Peter Jones, epicentre of Sloane school runs.
The official opening of the flagship store (the store is already operating
but there is a big glitzy opening next Thursday) is one big step forward in
the development of the Hackett brand.
Ever since Alfred Dunhill perceived that Hackett was a brand with huge
untapped potential - rumour has it that Lord Douro, Alfred Dunhill's
chairman, is a regular Hackett dresser - and bought it in June last year,
plans have been brewing.
James Pow, the managing director recruited from Mulberry, has no qualms
about opening a flagship store in the middle of a severe recession and sees
it as the first step towards establishing a full-blown international brand.
'There is a big gap in the market between expensive Savile Row tailoring and
High Street clothes.
'London needs a simplistic authentic gentleman's outfitters, a store with
the feeling that Brooks Bros had 15 or more years ago. We want it all to be
quietly, authentically English, with no pressure to buy, you will probably
either like it all or dislike it all.
'I believe firmly that the 1980s were an over-fashioned time and that people
now want to get away from frills and hype and look for quality and value for
money.'
Those who know and love the Hackett style already will be aware that it grew
out of a love of the qualities found in the best second-hand clothing.
Ashley Lloyd-Jennings and Jeremy Hackett are two immaculately dressed chaps
who could not find modern menswear with the qualities that they admired. So
they started to manufacture menswear to traditional standards.
The style of the new Hackett shop is a natural evolution from that. A sense
of Englishness is fundamental to the store. According to James Pow, 99 per
cent of the products are British-made.
There will be a made-to-measure service in suits (which basically means
making personal adjustments to ready-made clothing) and a full bespoke
service (prices around about the Pounds 895 mark). There will be all the
usual masculine appurtances from shirts to shoes and ties. Casual moleskin
trousers sell for Pounds 55, tweed jackets, all made according to the
stringent LLoyd-Jennings/Hackett standards, for about Pounds 235.
How you regard those prices depends on where you normally shop - those who
are used to Ralph Lauren prices will be impressed, those whose usual
stamping-ground is Marks &amp; Spencer may find the prices rather a shock. But
before you judge look carefully at the quality of the fabric and the making.
New to Hackett is a collection of English-made leather goods (such as the
black crossgrain travel shaving and toothbrush case, photographed here top
right), while those who liked the old barber's shop in the Covent Garden
store will be happy to know that a barber's shop has been reinstated at the
new store.
Hackett is not - and cannot be - to everyone's taste. If Armani, Paul Smith
or Boss are more your scene you may find it a little too traditional, a
touch dapper or fogeyish. But, for every man who longs to dress in a way
that is above and beyond fashion and who just wants to put on his clothes
and then forget about them, Hackett has a lot to offer.
Hackett is at 137/138 Sloane Street, London SW1.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Motoring: Shadow over the motor show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEVER before has there been a British International Motor Show like the one
opening to the public at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham, today.
Whether there will be a similar one again may depend on how many people pass
through the turnstiles between now and Sunday 1 November.
For the first time since the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders held
a motor show in 1903, there is a sponsor from outside the motor industry and
the show is being combined with another event on the same site.
The Daily Mail has chipped in with Pounds 2m and the motor show is being
held jointly with its Midlands Autumn Ideal Home Exhibition. The same ticket
admits visitors to both shows. But never mind. The echoing halls of the NEC
contain a dazzling display of the world's latest cars, presented with style
and razzmatazz. It's all a bit like one of those grand knees-ups that used
to held by the opposing commanders on the eve of 18th and 19th century
battles.
Reality (for which read recession) is out of sight and mind for a few days,
after which the car makers must get down to the task of cutting one
anothers' throats again.
Some of the biggest exhibitors at NEC spend up to Pounds 2m each on their
stands. Privately, they admit they would love to pull out of the motor show
altogether - but only if one of their competitors did so first.
With about one-third of annual British sales now concentrated into August,
they see it as a costly irrelevance held at the wrong time of the year.
A cynical view? Of course. But one can argue that the great set-piece motor
show is rooted in an age that no longer exists. The concept dates back to a
time when there were still lots of British car makers. They used to unveil
genuinely new models in a blaze of publicity at Earls Court, where the show
was then held.
Today, the industry is more international than national. New cars, usually
spoken about freely beforehand, appear throughout the year. And at most of
the international shows - not just our own - genuinely new models are
heavily outnumbered by cars one could see and test drive at a local dealer.
Tokyo Show is an honourable exception to this rule.
Having said all that, anyone having an interest in motoring, strong legs and
a comfortable pair of shoes will enjoy a day at the Birmingham show. If the
cars should finally pall - and they do ultimately provoke a sort of visual
indigestion - there is always the Ideal Home Exhibition to look at.
My personal pick of things to see would be the cars that are new to a
British visitor. The Audi 80 estate car, front-wheel or four-wheel driven,
that goes on sale here in January is one. Take a look, too, at the Audi 100
saloon with a 2.5 litre direct-injection diesel engine and 6-speed gearbox.
It is among the most fuel-efficient cars in the world.
BMW's new 3-litre and 4-litre V8 engines power the 730i and a 740i that
fills a gap in the range between the old 735i and the V12 750i. Also on show
are a V8 engined 530 saloon and the ultimate BMW, a 5.6 litre, 380
horsepower V12 engined 850CSi which reaches Britain in the Spring.
Chrysler's ultra-rapid ruffian of a car, the 8-litre, 10-cylinder Dodge
Viper, will not be on sale at Pounds 50,000-plus until late next year. But
the Chrysler Wrangler and Cherokee Jeeps will start undercutting rival 4x4s
from January.
Seven 3-door ZX models priced from Pounds 8,500 for an 1.4i Aura to Pounds
14,500 for a very high performing 16v are on the stand of Citroen, which
took over five per cent of Britain's new car sales in August.
Daihatsu's under Pounds 12,000 Bertone-styled, BMW 1.6 litre engined
Freeclimber 4x4 is assembled in Europe and comes outside the agreement
limiting UK sales of Japanese cars to 11 per cent of total registrations.
This will make it practical for Daihatsu (UK) to import about 600 Mira
microcars next year. This tiny five-door has an 850 cc, 3-cylinder
multi-valve engine and five-speed gearbox. It will retail at around Pounds
6,000, with a three-year, unlimited mileage warranty.
Compare it with Fiat's 900 cc, 4-cylinder Cinquecento baby car, due in
Britain early next year.
Ford is showing the face-lifted Escort and Orion powered by the new 16-valve
Zeta engines. Hyundai's turbocharged Scoupe now has performance to match its
sporty looks.
Although Honda's British-made Accord is absent, the new 140 mph Prelude VTEC
coupQ is being claimed (by Honda) as Europe's safest car. Apart from ABS
brakes and electronically controlled 4-wheel steering it has driver and
passenger side airbags as standard equipment. Its 2,157 cc four-cylinder
engine produces a remarkable 185 horsepower and is said to be significantly
less thirsty than that of equally potent rivals. Mercedes, which has
announced that driver's side airbags are to be standard on all its cars, is
showing revised versions of many current models with multi-valve engines.
Mitsubishi's made-in-Australia 3-litre Sigma estate car and the restyled
Lancer liftback range are new to Britain.
One of the most important British-made cars at the NEC is the new Nissan
Micra compact hatchback, which goes on sale in the UK early in 1993. By that
time the Spanish-built, up to 8-seat Nissan Serena multi-purpose vehicle, on
show for the first time in Britain, will also be available.
Peugeot's best-selling, British-made 405 has a new interior, an
easier-to-use boot and new engines, including the 1.9-litre turbo-diesel
first seen in Citroen's ZX, to go with its class-leading ride and handling.
The Safrane, Renault's 25 replacement, will compete with cars like the Ford
Granada, Rover 800 and Vauxhall Carlton in the executive market.
Rover's MG RV8 has the looks of a 30 year-old MGB but a 3.5 litre Rover V8
engine and 5-speed gearbox give it far more performance. A curious mix in
some ways, but its low volume production will keep the name alive and
prepare the way for a really new MG.
The sleek Aero replaces the Carlsson as the muscle car of Saab's range.
Subaru's cheeky little Vivio is good news for any potential runabout buyer
living in Britain's snow belt. It has three-cylinders, instantly selectable
four-wheel drive and five doors, all for just under Pounds 7,000. motoring 6
The Carina E, due to be rolling off the line at Burnaston, Derbyshire, in a
few weeks; the latest 4.2 litre turbo-diesel Land Cruiser; and some
entertaining oddities of concept cars, including one that drives on the road
or hangs from a monorail, are on Toyota's stand.
More down to earth are Vauxhall's restyled Cavaliers, among them
turbocharged 4x4 and V6 engined variants. Vauxhall Astras will be offered
with driver's side airbags, a new automatic transmission and air
conditioning early in 1993.
This looks like a smart move.
With electronic enforcement of speed limits now a reality, cars of the
future will have to be comfortable, easy to drive and safe above all else.
The message seems to have gone home at Vauxhall.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Sport: Hard workers in an industrial game - Rugby League;
Britain and Australia meet today in the World Cup final. Kevin Brown, in
Sydney, and John Hopkins assess the two sides

HAVE ANY industries been more closely associated with one sport than cotton,
and wool and coal mining with rugby league? As Geoffrey Moorhouse noted in
At The George, his book of essays about rugby league: 'The industrial
heartland of the north of England was powered by men who worked in the
mills, foundries and pits of the region . . . in time the majority of rugby
clubs in the north drew their playing strength from . . . these places.'
There is therefore, a particular piquancy that at the moment that Britain's
rugby league team has achieved its greatest success by reaching the final of
the World Cup at Wembley this afternoon, 30 pits are being threatened with
closure and British Coal is ending its sponsorship of Great Britain's rugby
league team.
Eighty thousand spectators will be at Wembley to watch Britain play
Australia, the world champions. Great Britain have improved so much recently
that the Australian coach said the current side would beat its predecessors
of four and six years ago by 30 points. Nevertheless, the Australians are
the favourites. They have held the Ashes since 1970 and won the World Cup in
1975, 1977, 1985 and 1988.
'They are the champions. They have beaten us in the past two Test series,'
says Jonathan Devereux, the burly Widnes back who was in Great Britain's
World Cup squad. 'Their record stands for itself and in Allen Langer they
have the outstanding player. If he was in our side then we would be
favourites. He has got everything. He has speed. He can read a game very
well. He has electrifying pace over ten yards, which is what he needs to get
through a gap. He can wrestle the ball clear of his opponents in a way that
is almost uncanny for a small man. He is a good kicker and he is very
tenacious.'
If Langer, a scrum-half, is a potential match winner for Australia, then
Martin Offiah is quite capable of doing the same for Great Britain. Offiah,
whose nickname is Chariots, is the fastest man on the field so long as the
injury he appeared to be carrying last Sunday when he played in the
Lancashire Cup Final has healed. Much will depend on him as it will, too, on
Gary Schofield, Great Britain's captain, playing in the centre, and on the
35-year-old warhorse, Kevin Ward, in the front row.
If Great Britain win, and it is an even money bet that they will, then they
will have demonstrated how much they have learnt from the Australians in the
past ten years.
A decade ago British rugby league hit rock bottom. It was time for change
and officials were dispatched from Britain to sit at the feet of men who had
once been their pupils. They discovered that Australian rugby league was
applying science to the art of football, setting scientifically determined
standards for everything from diet to fitness.
Whereas in Britain many training sessions included unopposed rugby, the
Australians favoured fierce physical contact in practice. This was one
radical change. Another that the British noted was the way the Australians
work with weights to develop their upper bodies. The British, up to then,
had concentrated on building up the torso and legs.
The result was a generation of massive, fast-running men like Mal Meninga,
the Australians' captain who is 6 ft 1 in and weighs 17 st 2lbs. This
afternoon he will face Gary Schofield who is 5 ft 8 in and 12 st 7 lbs.
Schofield is wiser and heavier than he was when he met Meninga in 1984 and
was thrown around like a rag doll, but he is still giving away five inches
and 65 lbs.
The Australians did not stop there. They trained hard so that they could
play the game at a fast pace. Having done all this, they set about shoring
up their defence so that it was well-nigh unbreachable.
'They put so much pressure on you when they have not got the ball that you
start to make mistakes' says Davies, a member of Britain's 1990 Test team.
As the years went by, the Australians refined all these skills, making
themselves more formidable still. One try in the second Test against Great
Britain in 1990 bore out everything they had been trained to do. The ball
was in play for 36 seconds and there were 16 passes before the try-scorer
touched down. No other team could live with such an athletic, skilful
approach.
The advances shown by the Australian rugby league teams were soon noticed by
that country's rugby union authorities as well. That code now produces big
men of great athleticism, trained to a higher level of fitness than ever
before. When these mastodons are teamed with key individuals in the key
positions such as scrum-half, stand-off and full back, then the entire team
whirrs as smoothly as a Swiss watch. The result is that the Wallabies won
the rugby union World Cup last year and there is no sign of their dominance
being ended.
As the Australians were pushing back the frontiers of the game, so in
Britain it was being professionally administered and marketed. In the days
of Eddie Waring commentating on BBC television on a Saturday afternoon,
rugby league was, frankly, a joke.
To my eyes, used to the rhythm of rugby union, rugby league was nothing more
than a series of crash, bang, wallop attacks. Six tackles and then something
had to happen. The game seemed one-paced, physically unambitious, tactically
sterile. 'Oooooop and oooonder' and 'he's taking an early bath' were
Waring's catch phrases.
Now it has become a game of considerable pace and skill - as you should see
this afternoon. It is as different from the rugby league of 20 years ago as
colour is from black and white television and jets are from propeller-driven
aeroplanes.
'Rugby League has remained unusually true to itself' noted Moorhouse, 'an
expression of values as well as a challenge and an entertainment now
embedded deeply in the lives of generations on both sides of the world . . .
But a game can be much more complex than patterns of athletic energy on a
playing field. It can reflect and embody various habits and attitudes that
amount to nothing less than a way of life and this game does.'
Like rugby union, rugby league is a game in its prime.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Sport: Australia's shrinking violets - Rugby League; Britain
and Australia meet today in the World Cup final. Kevin Brown, in Sydney, and
John Hopkins assess the two sides

TIMID Australian sportsmen are about as common as possums in Pontypool. So
why are London and Sydney suddenly crowded with shrinking violets talking
down Australia's chances in today's Rugby League World Cup final at Wembley?
Kangaroos coach Bob Fulton set the tone before leaving for London, warning
that Australia's 2-1 victory in the Ashes series earlier this year was no
guide to form for the World Cup.
'Great Britain should be favourites. We haven't got much in our favour. If
we don't win at Wembley, our Ashes success won't mean the same. In football,
people have short memories,' Fulton moaned.
It doesn't seem to matter who you talk to. Kangaroos captain Mal Meninga and
experienced second rower Bob Lindner both warn that Australia will have
their work cut out to beat Great Britain.
Back in Australia, some of the experts are going even further. 'If I had to
put up my money I'd back the Poms,' 1988 World Cup star Wayne Pearce told
fans in Brisbane yesterday.
More is at stake than just the World Cup. Australia have towered over
international rugby league since 1970, the last time Great Britain won an
Ashes series. But they have never led the all-time league table.
This year's Ashes games left Australia and Great Britain with 52 wins each
since the first Test in 1908. A Kangaroos victory would justify Australian
claims that Sydney is now the centre of world rugby league.
So are the wily Australians serious, or are they trying to disarm the
despised Poms before sending out another team of fast-moving giants to take
the trophy back to Sydney, its home since 1975?
Fulton is clearly concerned about the long lay-off enjoyed by the players
since the end of the domestic season in September. Easy tour matches against
mediocre opposition like Sheffield, Huddersfield and Cumbria will have done
little to restore match fitness.
And taking a break does affect performance: the world club championship,
played in the Australian off-season, has never been won by an Australian
side, in spite of Australia's dominance at international level.
Secondly, Australia's pre-eminence over the last 22 years has encouraged a
focus on the domestic game, prompting many Australians to rate the local
Winfield Cup competition ahead of international games. Some commentators
fear the Kangaroos may not be hungry enough to win.
But the real cause of Australian caution is recent results, which suggest
that playing standards in other countries may be catching up, perhaps
heralding the end of Australia's long period of dominance.
The first crack in the facade appeared in 1991, when Australia unexpectedly
lost 24-8. in Melbourne in the first of a three match series against New
Zealand. More seriously, Australia were thrashed 33-10 by Great Britain in
June in the second Ashes Test, again in Melbourne.
For perhaps the first time two decades, the British made the Australians
look ordinary. Significantly, the match was played in the kind of soft
conditions the Australians are likely to face at Wembley.
Australia won the series after victories in Sydney and Brisbane, but no-one
who saw the Sydney Test will forget the electrifying sight of Martin Offiah
twice getting away on the left wing, each time denied a try by the narrowest
touch of boot on sideline.
Offiah's chances of escaping today must be improved by the absence of the
the injured Andrew Ettingshausen, the top class full back who forced him
into touch on both occasions. But as successive British tourists have
discovered, the structure of the modern game in Australia produces teams
which are very hard to beat. The Winfield Cup has expanded and strengthened
considerably since 1980, and now includes teams from Queensland, Canberra
and provincial New South Wales as well as Sydney.
The gradual enlargement of the competition has increased the pool of top
players and coaches available to the national side, and helped the game
maintain its dominance among Australia's four football codes, at least in
the core rugby league states of New South Wales and Queensland.
Ominously for British fans, the strengthening process is likely to
accelerate in the next couple of years, when the competition will be
expanded to include Auckland in New Zealand, adding all the emotions of
international football to the weekly league programme.
Like their British counterparts, Australian coaches put a lot of emphasis on
commitment, physical fitness and tough tackling. But the dry sun-baked
grounds also encourage speed and ball handling skills which are harder to
develop in the freezing dampness of English winters.
The Australians have benefitted over the last few years from the
inspirational captaincy of two outstanding players who epitomise all these
qualities: 'King' Wally Lewis from 1984 to 1990, and latterly Meninga,
Australia's most capped player and record scorer with 250 points.
Meninga's success in replacing the legendary Lewis has played a big part in
keeping Australia at the top of the rugby league tree, but it places a huge
responsibility on him in the final.
If Meninga and Allan Langer fire on the Wembley turf Australia's weasel
words over the last few days are likely to be quickly forgotten. If they do
not, all the advance excuses are unlikely to protect Fulton and his men from
a raucous reception back in Sydney.

Council for the Protection of Rural England (071-976-6433), a watchdog,
highly effective for its quiet handling of government departments.
CC - the Countryside Commission in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire
(0242-521381). Set up in 1968 to promote enjoyment of the country.
Counterparts are CCW and SNH: see under EN.
Countryside Stewardship - a CC scheme to encourage public use of seven
typical English landscapes: chalk downs; lowland heath; river valleys;
coasts; uplands; historic landscapes (a deer park was the first) and old
meadow. One year old and an unexpected 900 agreements signed. It must
protect existing field walls, hedges and trees. Grants from Pounds 20 to
Pounds 100 an acre. More for public access, or school use, or new footpaths
(10p a metre) or footpaths for the disabled (20p). A similar scheme in
Wales, Tir Cymen, began in July but is restricted at present.
EN - English Nature, based in Peterborough (0733-340345), used to be the
English division of the Nature Conservancy Council. Its counterparts are CCW
(Countryside Council for Wales) in Bangor (0248-370444) and SNH (Scottish
Natural Heritage, 031-447-4784).
ESA - Environmentally Sensitive Area. By 1993 there will be 31 ESAs, run by
MAFF: fine but fragile country from the Lake District to the Suffolk River
Valleys. Grants up to Pounds 120 an acre, with extra payments for, say,
clearing scrub on the South Downs or rebuilding dry stone walls in the
Dales. Payments, in 1991 totalling Pounds 8.2m for 3,100 schemes, are
expected to reach Pounds 45m in England in 1994/95. The EC pays about 10 per
cent of the cost.
F&amp;CGS - the Farm and Conservation Grant Scheme gives 15 to 40 per cent
grants for capital expenditure of environmental value, such as shelter
belts, field boundaries, bracken control and heather management (good for
grouse).
Farm Diversification Grant Scheme - 25 per cent capital grants for
non-agricultural work on the farm, such as a shop with car park.
FWPS - the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme, run by FC and DAFS/MAFF/WOAD to
encourage planting of broadleaved woods on productive farm land, replaced
the Farm Woodland Scheme on April 1. Planting grants up to Pounds 630 an
acre for broadleaves and Pounds 400 for conifers, with a Pounds 160 to
Pounds 240 supplement for using arable and improved grass land. Annual
payments up to Pounds 100 an acre for 15 years for 50 per cent planting of
broadleaves.
FC - Forestry Commission, based in Edinburgh (031-334-0303) and charged
since 1919 with promoting native forestry, so that we should not be
dependent on foreign wood in times of war. Though it has introduced
non-native species such as the sitka spruce that blights the Borders, it now
emphasises deciduous trees.
Hedgerow Scheme - launched in July by the DOE with CC and MAFF, with funding
of Pounds 3.5m over the next three years.
Landscape Conservation Grants - small grants from CC and CCW for small
schemes for planting trees and woods, cleaning ponds, etc.
MAFF - Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Counterparts are DAFS
(Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland) and WOAD (Welsh
Office Agriculture Department).
NSA - Nitrate Sensitive Area. Following an EC directive, a pilot MAFF scheme
to control nitrates leaching from the earth, mainly by cutting fertiliser
application. The aim is to improve drinking water. Th UK will need some
normal wet years to see if it is succeeding.
Project Grants - discretionary grants from EN and CCW for anything that
helps nature conservation. Equipment, seasonal labour and display boards may
all be covered.
SSSI - Site of Special Scientific Interest. Run by EN etc. SSSIs in England
now total 3,675, covering 6 per cent of the country's area. Most are special
habitats for the rarer plants, birds and animals; some are chosen for their
geology. Typical is a rare wild sage habitat in Oxfordshire (Pounds 59 an
acre). Locations little publicised. Linked is the pilot Wildlife Enhancement
Scheme (Pounds 20 to Pounds 30 an acre).
Set-Aside - this EC scheme reached the UK in 1988. Many farmers curse it as
it makes land idle. Up to Pounds 90 an acre for removing land from
production for five years. Related is the Countryside Premium Scheme in East
Anglia including Herts and Northants - inquire from the CC in Cambridge
(0223-354462) - with extra payments up to Pounds 80 an acre for schemes that
benefit wildlife, landscape and community use of the countryside. Higher
payments for combining Set-Aside with FWPS or WGS.
WGS - Woodland Grant Scheme, introduced in 1988 when the tax concession on
forestry were repealed, pays planting grants. The best are for small stands
(one to two acres) of broadleaves: Pounds 600 an acre. Grants may also be
available from the Rural Development Commission for refurbishing traditional
farm buldings, or English Heritage for management agreements to protect SAMs
(Scheduled Ancient Monuments), or local councils. AONBs (Areas of
Outstanding Natural Beauty) and National Parks also have schemes.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Property: Who cares for the countryside? - Gerald Cadogan
considers schemes to keep the UK a green and pleasant land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO MANY SCHEMES nowadays encourage care of the countryside that farmers and
landowners hardly know which quango or government department to deal with.
The Countryside Commission (CC) perhaps, or English Nature (EN), or the
Rural Development P Commission, or the Ministry of Agriculture (MAFF), and
their Scottish and Welsh counterparts (DAFS and WOAD)? The schemes appear
overlapping and, as with social security, those entitled to do so do not
always take up what is on offer. To help readers who have land or are about
to buy an estate, our table explains the grants.
The present intent of all schemes is two-fold. They aim to reduce production
by making farming less intensive - reversing previous policy - and to
conserve, or improve, the countryside and its wildlife.
EN's new attitude shows how times have changed. In making agreements for
Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) it now emphasises active
management. Typically, that could mean clearing scrub from a meadow rich in
rare flowers and allowing grazing only for a certain number of days a year.
On the way out is the Nature Conservancy Council's passive concentration on
stopping 'Potentially Damaging Operations' (PDOs), of which a long list
encompassed almost anything you can do on a farm.
Next summer this approach will have a major boost when the Government
submits its agri-environmental plans, in accordance with new EC agricultural
policies. They will probably incorporate many of the schemes listed here.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE) suggests adopting a
unitary and country-wide system of environmental management payments.
Farmers would be paid to manage the countryside and enhance it.
The CPRE proposes, on the production side, cutting farm support so that a
true market economy can dictate prices. What does need supporting is what we
cannot, as private citizens, buy; care of the countryside. Farmers, it
argues, should get far more public money in a balanced package to keep up
their hedges and walls, be moderate in spreading fertiliser and treat their
grassland and woodland so that species that have flourished from time
immemorial will still do so, and not perish from overgrazing or hasty
development.
Such proposals would complete the revolution in farming already under way
and could be a positive encouragement to farmers and owners to carry on
doing what they have always been best at - managing the land and employing
farmworkers. It is a far cry from the making land and labour idle policy
implicit in the Set-Aside scheme.
But it needs time and patience to convince farmers that these are wise and
profitable courses. Inducements must be attractive and paid on time (often
they have not been), and agreements tailored to the particular needs of a
piece of land, and not blanket prescriptions.
You must have the right people to spread the word, says Lindon Cornwallis,
of Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, who has an SSSI and an NSA on his farm. He
thinks senior people who know farming and conservation are needed. The Barn
Elms reservoir in west London shows how specific negotiation succeeds. Next
to Harrods furniture repository it is no longer needed. Thames Water wanted
outline planning permission for housing, but it has been an SSSI as a bird
habitat. To meet the objection, Thames Water called in a firm of
environmental consultants from Chester, R. PS Clouston (0244-313486), who in
turn consulted the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust at Slimbridge, Glos. and came
up with a scheme for a bird reserve and visitors' centre, which at the same
time allowed plenty of space for future housing.
Dr David Hockin, of Cloustons, thought that the adversarial system inherent
in planning inquiries and appeals did not automatically produce the best
results. The issues were more a matter of nitty-gritty scientific
observation and interpretation. He spoke to me from a badger sett near
Reading, where he and his team have spent nights observing badgers and their
habits. He will then suggest a plan to protect setts and identify unbadgered
land to build on.
And when estate agents advertise SSSIs on land they are selling, we know
attitudes have changed. Savills in Norwich (0603-612211) is offering the
Didlington Hall estate, which includes an SSSI of three glorious lakes dug
in the early 19th century.
Unusual swamp plants are the breeding ground for gadwall, teal, shoveler and
great crested grebe. Bewick and whooper swans winter there. The big house
was demolished in 1950. With 460 acres at a guide price of Pounds 850,000,
it is an ideal spot for the romantic, well-heeled birdwatcher to build a new
house and a state-of-the-art birdhide.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Gardening: Medal winners take trials in their stride - New
verbenas and begonias have caught Arthur Hellyer's eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG THE many new plants to be raised from seed this coming winter and
spring are two verbenas that I like very much.
Both have won gold medals in the Fleuroselect trials, which are held all
over Europe. Both have been unfailingly beautiful in the trials in which I
have seen them this past summer.
One, named Peaches and Cream, has flowers of quite large size its colour
also includes shades of apricot, salmon and yellow. Verbenas are certainly
plants that are coming back into fashion after some years of neglect and
they can be used in many ways in the garden; as carpeting plants, for
edgings, in containers of any kind - including window-boxes in which they
will fall naturally over the sides - and, as small standards or dot plants
each tied upright to a cane.
The second verbena to catch my eye this summer could scarcely be more
different. It is called Imagination and it has much smaller flowers. It is
said to be a hybrid with another species but the parentage has not been
disclosed. The colour is a really deep violet blue, just the thing to
contrast with Verbena Peaches and Cream or any of the pink or dark red
verbenas.
Nierembergia Mont Blanc is another low-growing annual that has won a
Fleuroselect gold medal and is available for the first time this winter. It
is about 8in high, has narrow leaves and smothers itself in shining, white
cup-shaped flowers rather like those of a campanula a very striking plant
because of its whiteness and the freedom with which it flowers. It is
fast-growing, almost hardy, and suitable for sowing either in a propagator
in March or directly out of doors in April where it is to flower. Its
compactness makes it an ideal edging plant.
Much looser in effect, but still a fine flowering plant, is a new variety of
oenothera speciosa called Innocence. This is a fast-growing perennial which
I first noted in the Suttons Seeds trial in Devon. Here it was about 18in
high and covered in blush pink flowers but the description of the plant is
white flushed with pink.
Although it is really a perennial that will live for years it is better to
treat it as an annual, sowing under cover in March, picking out into boxes
in April and planting in May where it is to flower. It is specially
recommended as an early flowering plant.
Suttons Seeds are offering four new F1 hybrid begonias all of which have had
their seeds coated with a special paste which converts the tiny seeds into
little pellets. It is claimed that this makes it much easier to sow and that
the seeds generally germinate more regularly. The process is known as
Superstart.
Three of the begonias treated are varieties of the small- flowered Begonia
Semperflorens. Their names are Devon Gems, a mixture of colours in both
flowers and foliage; Cocktail, also a mixture of flower colours but all with
bronze leaves, and Pin Up which has white flowers with a pink picotee edge.
The fourth is the one I like best. It is called Non-Stop Mixed and is of the
tuberous rooted type with quite large, fully double flowers in a range of
colours including shades of pink, red, yellow and orange.
Not to be confused with this pelleting of seeds, which is not new, are two
pre-sowing treatments which seem to be basically the same, although I cannot
be sure as not sufficient information has yet been issued about them.
One of them, known as Superstart, is being promoted by Suttons Seeds, the
other, called Prime-Start, belongs to Unwins Seeds. In both the seeds are
given pre-packeting treatment which brings the embryos of the seeds close to
the point of germination without actually starting them into growth. The
treatment is then halted and the seeds are hermetically packeted in the
ordinary way.
When sowing time comes the seeds can be germinated in a simple propagator
and will grow with extra speed and certainty because, in Unwins words, they
are 'bursting to grow.' Unwins is using Prime-Start for a new begonia, a
cineraria, a pansy and a verbena but I do not know the names of the
varieties.
Suttons is using Superstart for five of its popular geraniums, Floribunda F1
Sensation Mixed, F1 Breakaway Red, F1 Video Mixed, F1 Gala Mixed, which
makes a particularly compact plant and so is excellent for window boxes and
other small containers and F2 Torbay Colour Mixed obtained from an
open-pollinated F1 hybrid which is a cheaper way of producing hybrid seed
and one that in this variety has given excellent results.
Clarkias are hardy annuals which can be sown in April where they are to
flower. They are attractive plants which have never had a great deal of
publicity but I think that a newcomer, Clarkia bottiae Pink Joy, may change
that. It is an attractive plant, the flowers single and cup-shaped, white in
the centre, pink around the edges.
They are very freely produced on 20in to 30in high stems. This could be an
ideal plant for filing gaps in the borders in April or May, sown where they
are to flower.
In most of the seed trials I have seen a giant annual sunflower which is new
and more compact than any I have seen. Its name is Helianthus Music Box
Mixed. It has large flowers with the big dark centres of the familiar annual
sunflowers beloved of painters ever since Van Gogh but the stems are only
about 3ft high. The ray petals range in colour from light yellow to bronzy
red. This is a fully hardy annual which can be sown in spring where it is to
flower in summer. The one necessity is plenty of light.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Gardening: Amateur advice at the experts' expense - Robin
Lane Fox has been taking his pot plants indoors in order to outwit the wise
old owls in his garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, the owls have been hooting in my garden. By daytime, an
owl-hoot means death, death for Shakespearian heroes, deadly omens for
classical generals and something nasty for columnists who have been much too
slow to plant their tulips.
I have been checking for fire blight and have feared honey fungus: I now
know why they were hooting. They were moping for my half-hardy heliotropes
and other tender plants in pot, but I have outwitted them by taking the
plants indoors before the frosts.
This year, nobody could grudge their half-hardy plants a long warm rest.
They have flourished in pots but none have flourished more than these
scented heliotropes. Ten varieties are listed in The Plant Finder, from
Chatsworth to Lord Roberts: mine is the 11th, White Swan, a heliotrope which
has pale mauve flowers and a scent straight from warm French heaven.
Heliotrope is also known as cherry pie. Its scent combines powder and
chocolate and softens the insensitivity of bedding out in France.
If you want the real thing, you need to beg some cuttings from a named form
during the next fortnight when their owners bring them under shelter.
Varieties from a seed packet have none of the scent and delicacy of the true
old Edwardian beauties.
Like most of the best things in pots, these plants are not hardy and so you
have to follow October discipline. Last week's frost took out the weaker
members of the garden unless you had anticipated it. Perhaps you still have
fuchsias, verbenas, white penstemons or any of those trailing plants with
silver leaves: if so, put them in a frost-proof shed immediately, or else my
owls will be proved right.
If you are putting a large plant or semi-shrub to rest, cut it back quite
hard and see that it is soaked heavily in water before resting in its new
home. By cutting it hard, you encourage those first green shoots which every
economist is hoping to see nowadays.
I prefer to leave these young shoots on the plant and only take them as
cuttings in early spring: some books suggest that you should root them
immediately and leave them in the same pot until March. I find that they rot
more often than not.
Each year, gardening in pots tests the wisdom of the handbooks and throws up
new possibilities. I have learned to follow rules which were being ignored
ten years ago in dictionaries: they are still being ignored in the RHS's new
Dictionary of Gardening.
They originate from amateur gardeners who have a sharp eye for decoration
and are not merely horticulturalists. Their main rule is simple: pack in
many more plants than any expert dares to tell you in print. Begin with a
pot at least 2 ft wide and into it you can pack a dozen different varieties.
They all tangle together and defy the usual wisdom so long as they are
heavily fed and watered.
This year, the reason why the heliotropes were so good is surely that I
planted them in almost nothing but animal manure. As the season ends, I can
also endorse the use of water-retaining crystals or jelly, mixed into the
compost when you plant it.
The Swel-gel really worked and I found myself watering some very heavy
plantings only twice a week, a bearable routine.
With the last of summer out of the way, the field is then clear to break the
rules with bulbs. Once again, the books and the RHS dictionary are behind
the times: they do not tell you to plant your bulbs in layers.
To my intense surprise, this method works. It allows you to put the tulips
about nine inches deep on the bottom layer and then plant a second storey of
narcissi about three inches above them and then round off near the rooftops
with a layer of crocusses just near the surface of the soil.
Like the traffic on a main street in Naples, they somehow manage to queue
without signals and move forwards without colliding.
The crocusses flower first; the narcissi then nose their way between them
and eventually, the late-flowering tulips emerge through the jungle. In one
pot, you can enjoy three seasons: they are not cheap but they are much more
fun than an ordinary old pot full of scillas.
Once again, amateurs have discovered a trick which the experts ignored for
years. Gardening in pots brings the best out of private ingenuity; pack the
bulbs in, layer upon layer, like passengers on the London Underground. They
give you three gardens in once space: this time, it is a real hoot, yours at
the expert's expense.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Gardening: Plant of the Week - Gentiana sino-ornata
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This splendid autumn flowering gentian from China and Tibet sets a high
standard of beauty with its large, azure-blue trumpets standing up on
carpets of narrow shining green leaves. It can be grown most easily in beds
of peat that contain absolutely no lime.  It requires plenty of moisture
and, unlike most alpine plants, benefits from replanting each March or April
when it is just starting in to growth and tufts can be pulled out of the old
beds with white roots attached. These tufts should establish themselves
rapidly in moist peat in an open, sunny place. They must not be allowed to
get dry which is one reason why it is easier to grow them in a deep bed of
peat rather than in a pot.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Transfer temptations: the pros and
the cons - Planning Your Pension / Those moving jobs face a devilishly
tricky decision over their accrued benefits. Eric Short weighs the options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EACH YEAR, millions of employees in company pension schemes leave their
jobs. Many seek the services of an independent financial adviser or a life
company representative to help them decide whether to leave their accrued
benefits in the old scheme or transfer those benefits to another pension
arrangement - either to another company scheme or to a pension contract with
a life company.
But in many cases employees have not been given what is regarded as best
advice. Fimbra and Lautro, the regulatory bodies, have both issued guidance
on the subject which effectively tells intermediaries that they must make a
thorough investigation of the circumstances before advising clients. If in
doubt, they should not recommend a transfer.
The problem for employees, and for those intermediaries advising them, is
that precise comparisons between the alternatives are impossible because the
contracts are different.
The company scheme provides a pension whose value has certain guarantees and
some protection against inflation, and which does not depend on the
investment performance of the fund or annuity rates. In addition, the scheme
will offer a spouse's pension, together with other possible fringe benefits
such as paying a pension early because of ill-health.
In contrast, a personal pension or buy-out contract from a life company
operates on the money purchase principle, in that the transfer value is
invested and the accumulated value used to provide a pension through buying
an annuity. The value of the ultimate pension depends on investment
performance and annuity rates. The buy-out has some guarantees, but the
personal pension has none.
This uncertainty does not mean that the pension will be lower, as implied by
many commentators. But a personal pension or a buy-out is a lottery and like
most lotteries there are winners and losers. The task of the adviser is to
decide whether recommending a transfer will provide a winner or a loser.
So, how should you decide between a transfer into a corporate and a personal
pension scheme? A leading consulting actuary adopts the following approach.
First, the consultant sets out the benefits provided if the employee leaves
his accrued rights in the company scheme. This shows: (1) The pension
entitlement at the normal pension age of the scheme. This should show the
value at the date of leaving employment and the expected value at
retirement, assuming the present statutory increases and present company
policy are continued. (2) The cash option available at retirement. (3) The
spouse's pension paid on the death of the employee if this occurs after
retirement. (4) The spouse's pension paid if the employee dies before
reaching retirement age. (5) The pension available on early retirement. (6)
The amount of transfer value available in lieu of the deferred benefits and
the period for which this value is guaranteed.
If the arrangements are not completed by this date, the employee must obtain
a fresh transfer value calculation.
The next step should be to set out the benefits available if the transfer
value is invested in a personal pension.
A consultant can calculate the amount of the accumulated fund at the time of
retirement, using two growth rate assumptions. A life company making such
calculations for an IFA would have to use the growth rates set out by
Lautro. However, an actuary authorised by the Institute of Actuaries can use
his or her professional judgment as to the appropriate growth rate
assumptions.
The consultant then calculates the pension which the accumulated fund will
buy on several different assumptions - with and without a spouse's pension,
and with and without a 5 per cent annual increase.
He can then calculate the investment return which the life company must
achieve, after allowing for its expenses, to match the benefits provided by
the company scheme.
So which is best for the employee? This depends on a number of factors -
financial and non-financial.
Financial factors
The employee has to decide whether the recommended life company can achieve
a higher return over the time to retirement than is required to provide the
scheme benefits. An adviser can give an opinion as to whether he considers
the life company can achieve this return, using past performance as an
indication (but nothing more), but he cannot give a guarantee of a future
return - nor can the life company.
With bonus rates expected to be reduced next year, investors are getting a
foretaste of the volatility of life company investment performance.
The company scheme provides spouse's benefits which an employee has to buy
with a personal pension. As such, a personal pension is more favourable to a
single person than to a married person.
The employee should consider not only the benefits at normal retirement, but
those available on early retirement. The company may well be generous
towards early retirement and not impose the full actuarial penalty, whereas
with a personal pension the full penalty is imposed automatically.
Company pension schemes are becoming more generous in making pension
increases to offset inflation - increases that the actuary to the scheme may
not have taken fully into account in calculating the transfer value. With a
personal pension, any pension increases have to be paid for. In addition,
the company is effectively guaranteeing annuity rates, something the life
company will not do.
On the other hand, the company scheme has to achieve a similar investment
return to provide the benefits and this in turn implies that the scheme is
adequately funded. Not only is there the risk of fraud, but many schemes are
now being wound up without sufficient assets to pay all the full benefits.
The deferred pensioner is at the back of the queue if there is a shortfall.
Non-Financial factors
The employee's temperament is possibly the single most important factor.
There are several aspects to this: the employee can have a measure of
control of his pension assets in a unit-linked personal pension - he or she
can switch from, say, shares to cash if wished. In a company scheme, the
employee has little or no control in its operation. The circumstances under
which the employee left may be such that he wants nothing to do with
anything managed by his old employer.
The employee's attitude towards investment risks. If the employee is
risk-averse, or if the deferred pension represents a significant part of his
ultimate pension, he should consider the situation carefully before taking
those benefits out of the company scheme.

<TEXT>
DIRECTORS appear undecided about which way to deal, with purchases and sales
very evenly balanced. Viscount Rothermere, chairman of the Daily Mail and
General Trust, sold 10,000 of the A non-voting shares, realising a little
over Pounds 650,000 before expenses. At the same time, he sold a further
12,000 in which he did not have a better financial interest. After these
sales, Viscount Rothermere's vehicle still controls more than half the
company's shares.
The media sector features quite highly this week. Christopher Bland,
chairman of LWT Holdings, has sold 84,000 of the convertible cumulative
preference, leaving himself with 186,000 preference shares. Unlike its
London weekday rivals, LWT retained its franchise in last year's bidding
contest.
Weir Group has been one of the great success stories in the UK engineering
sector, riding out the recession in impressive style. William McLean has
sold 38,000 shares at 553p, at which level the shares have doubled since the
beginning of 1991. Relative to the market over the last 12 months, they have
outperformed by almost 30 per cent.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Savings; where to find the best
returns - Investors are faced with lower rates. Philip Coggan and
Scheherazade Daneshkhu guide you through the maze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
HOW MUCH interest are you getting on your savings? The answer could be: less
than you think.
An instant saver account from Abbey National pays just 6.15 per cent gross
(4.61 per cent net) on sums between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 9,999. If you
have more than Pounds 25,000 in Lloyds Bank's 30 day notice account, you get
just 6.2 per cent gross - 4.65 per cent net if you are a basic rate taxpayer
and 3.72 per cent net if you are a top rate payer. Those with Pounds 5,000
in Barclays Select (a 90 day account) are getting 5.6 per cent gross, a net
4.2 per cent or 3.36 per cent respectively for basic and top rate payers.
Most savings accounts normally offer a lower return than the prevailing
level of base rates. Now that base rates are 8 per cent, double digit
savings returns are hard to find. To get anything more than 8 per cent, you
will need a large sum or you will have to look in other places than the very
largest banks and building societies. And even then, you will probably have
no guarantee that the rate will stay competitive.
Those who stick with an instant access account at a big bank or building
society, may well find that their net returns are not much better than
inflation (currently 3.6 per cent).
That may not be all the bad news. There was speculation this week that base
rates may have to fall to 6 per cent, if the government is to kick start the
economy. Such a change would result in savers' incomes falling by a quarter.
So what are the best returns at the moment? Moneyfacts has provided us with
its normal weekly table of highest rates (on Page IV) but we also asked it
to tell us the returns available from banks and building societies on Pounds
10,000, Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 50,000.
Pounds 10,000
On an instant access account, Moneyfacts points to the Scarborough Building
Society (0800-590578) which is paying 9.85 per cent gross and the Bristol &amp;
West (0800-100117), which offers 9.65 per cent. These rates are better than
any notice account, where the top rate is City &amp; Metropolitan's 60 day
account (081-464-0814), paying 9.5 per cent.
Those who want a fixed rate can get 9.67 per cent gross from the Beneficial
Bank (021-633-4400), or 9.0 per cent from Portman BS (0202-292444). Both
have a one year fixed term so should not be chosen by those who might wish
to withdraw their money early.
Colin Jackson, of Baronworth Investment Services, (081-518-1218) has details
of a Tessa which will pay 9.3 per cent for those prepared to invest a lump
sum of Pounds 8,650. After five years, this sum will turn into Pounds
13,061.
Pounds 25,000
Scarborough and Bristol &amp; West also offer the best instant access rates at
this level. The former is offering 10.1 per cent gross, and the latter 9.75
per cent.
On notice accounts, Moneyfacts points to the Cheshire BS (0800-243278) which
is paying 10 per cent on its 100 day account. The Beneficial Bank again
leads the fixed rate field at this level, with a rate of 10 per cent gross.
Pounds 50,000
The best instant access returns at this level are provided by the
Scarborough (10.15 per cent gross) and by the Leeds &amp; Holbeck BS
(0532-438292), at 9.8 per cent. The 100 day account from Cheshire BS pays
10.5 per cent on Pounds 50,000, with this rate fixed until the end of the
year. Beneficial Bank also pays a 10 per cent fixed rate on Pounds 50,000
for those prepared to invest for the one year term.
What about the rule that higher reward means higher risk? It is a thin line
between shopping around for the best rate and taking an unnecessary risk
with your savings.
The Weekend FT cannot vouch for the safety of any financial institution and
any mention on these pages does not imply a recommendation. Investors can
study the accounts of the quoted institutions, but many deposit-takers are
privately-owned. And as the Bingham report showed this week, one cannot rely
on the regulatory bodies to protect the investor.
The investor's main protection is the Deposit Protection Act, which
guarantees 75 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000 sterling deposits; ie a
maximum protection of Pounds 15,000. The building society protection scheme
covers 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000, equivalent therefore to a
maximum limit of Pounds 18,000. So those who invest more than Pounds 20,000
with one institution should be aware that they are taking on a slightly
higher risk.
The good news for bank and building society depositors is that there are
other choices which provide higher, or in some cases more certain, returns.
National Savings
Although rates on National Savings products have fallen in recent months,
they still offer safety and tax efficiency. The 39th issue certificates pay
6.75 per cent tax-free if held for five years, equivalent to a 9 per cent
gross return for basic rate taxpayers and an 11.25 per cent return for top
rate payers.
Non-taxpayers will find Capital Bonds more suitable, since interest is paid
gross. The present Series F pays 9 per cent compound when held for five
years.
The First Option bond, which is aimed at basic rate taxpayers, is offering a
rate of 6.5 per cent net over one year, on a minimum of Pounds 1,000. This
compares favourably with, for example, Abbey National's instant saver
account, paying 4.35 per cent net. Those who want to put away Pounds 20,000
or more in the First Option Bond will earn a slightly higher rate of 6.8 per
cent net.
But perhaps the most attractive deal at the moment is offered by the
index-linked certificates, which pay a tax-free 4.5 per annum over the
retail price index, when held for five years.
Inflation would have to average under 2.25 per cent over the next five years
for the 39th issue to beat the rate on the index-linked certificates. And if
inflation stayed at the current level of 3.6 per cent for five years, the
return would be 8.1 per cent - the equivalent of 10.8 per cent for the basic
rate payer and 13.5 per cent for the top rate payer.
The snag is that these certificates do not pay income. It is possible to
create an income flow by cashing in certificates early, but this reduces the
return. Indeed, savers should be aware that returns on these certificates
will be meagre if cashed in within the first two years.
There is a income-producing product from National Savings, but rates are
variable. Income bonds pay a gross variable rate of 9 per cent but this will
decrease to 8 per cent gross from November 5.
Gilts
These also rank high on the safety front, since they are bonds issued by the
government. They pay a fixed rate of interest, so investors are protected
against falling rates.
Gilt yields have fallen substantially in recent weeks, but it is still
possible to lock in to rates at over 8.5 per cent. The cheapest way to buy
gilts is via the post office, although this may be slower than via a
stockbroker. Yields could fall while the deal is going through.
It is the tradeability of gilts which makes investing a tricky business.
Most gilts have a face value of 100, and you can be sure of receiving that
sum if you wait until the gilt is repaid by the government. But if you need
to sell before the repayment date, you may not get your capital back.
Indeed, the vast majority of gilts currently trade at above the face value.
For example, on Friday morning, the Treasury 13 per cent 2000 was trading at
126 5/8 . If you bought the issue at that price, you would get a gross
annual income of Pounds 10.27 for every Pounds 100 you invested. But if you
held the gilt till the year 2000, you would lose a fifth of your capital,
which reduces the redemption yield to 8.26 per cent.
Guaranteed income bonds
These are issued by insurance companies and offer a fixed rate of return,
paid after deduction of basic rate tax. An element of safety is built in by
the Policyholders Protection Act, under which 90 per cent of a
policyholder's investment is protected. However, rates are pretty low at the
moment, so a substantial sum is needed to beat base rates. Liberty Life, for
example, is offering 7.35 per cent net (the equivalent of 9.8 per cent
gross) to those who invest Pounds 50,000 for three years (more details on
Page IV).
PIBS
Permanent interest-bearing shares (PIBS) are a relatively new form of fixed
interest investment, available from building societies as a way of raising
capital after legislation was passed in June last year.
Their main advantage is the relatively high rates of fixed interest they
pay. For example, when Britannia building society launched its second
tranche of Pibs earlier this month, the shares carried a fixed coupon of 13
per cent and a yield at issue of 12.14 per cent. The yield yesterday was
11.89 per cent.
This rate is higher than for gilts - but not without reason. It reflects the
increased risk of buying shares backed by a building society rather than the
government.
There are a number of other drawbacks. The shares are undated, which means
that the building society is not under obligation to pay back the original
capital (unless it is wound up). You would therefore have to sell your
shares in order to encash them and this can only be done through a
stockbroker, who will charge commission.
The minimum denomination is usually quite high since Pibs are aimed mainly
at the institutional market. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, for example, which
launched an issue this week, had a minimum holding of Pounds 50,000.
However, the minimum holding in Britannia's issue is Pounds 1,000.
PIBS are deeply subordinated, which means that in the event of a wind-up you
would be behind depositors in the queue for compensation. And if one PIBS
issuer got into difficulty, prices might fall across the sector. They should
therefore be handled with caution.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Schools for free or fee: what's the difference?: The
FT-1,000 survey shows that the best of British state education is a match
for many private schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WHAT PRICE three A-levels? Between Pounds 70,000 and Pounds 140,000, if you
put your child through the independent system. Nothing at all in the British
state sector.
At upwards of Pounds 25,000 an A-level, a private education is the most
expensive asset many parents buy after their house. And the bill is rising
rapidly: school fee increases have shot ahead of inflation for the last
decade and they will probably continue to do so. But why pay Pounds 70,000 -
the going rate for 11 years at a mid-ranking prep and independent day school
 -if you can get it for nothing, bar your tax?
For results, parents say in chorus. Surveys shows that more than anything,
parents believe they are paying for better exam grades. Few mention for
squash courts or social cachet.
The private sector still includes the very best schools and remains an
escape route for parents unwilling or unable to move into the neighbourhood
of a good state school. Even so, The FT-1,000 survey of this summer's
A-level results, to be published as a special supplement to next Saturday's
FT, will, come as shock to many a mortgaged parent. For it shows that judged
by results, the best of state education is easily a match for much of the
independent sector.
The first complete survey of exam results from both the state and
independent sectors across England and Wales, the FT-1,000 shows, county by
county, the top state schools in strong competition with the independent
sector. That is on the basis of average A-level results, which mostly
under-represent the achievement of state schools - particularly
comprehensives with their non-selective intake. Pupil by pupil, much of the
state sector probably does as well for individual students as its
independent counterpart.
True, judged by A-level results, the leading public schools are without
doubt the Rolls Royce of the national system. Not a single state school or
college comes in our top 50 schools and colleges: the top state school - the
Judd School for Boys, Tonbridge, Kent - comes 62nd, with only three others
in the top 100.* It is hardly surprising that the leading independent
schools form about a third of each year's admissions to Oxbridge.
The top few hundred schools are not, however, the only good schools - just,
in the main, the most selective. Go further down the list, and the picture
changes. Schools ranked between 250 and 350 are still the national cream:
they gain average A-level results of around three grade Cs, and send most of
their sixth-formers on to higher education. Of that 100, 34 are state
institutions (19 grammar, 13 comprehensive and two sixth form colleges). Of
the next 100 on our list, gaining average grades of CCD, 46 are in the state
sector.
The imbalance is still marked - but less so than you might think, given that
a fifth of all sixth formers (as opposed to 7.5 per cent of the school-aged
population) is in private schools.
Yet beware of generalising from the top or from average results. Most
parents are looking for a school close to them; and as boarding becomes ever
less fashionable (boarding numbers are down 10 per cent in the last three
years alone), that is increasingly true. Even boarding schools now tell you
that for much of their clientele a '90 minute rule' applies - the maximum
driving time a parent is prepared to endure.
So for most parents, it is the county or regional market that matters.
There, no single picture emerges from the FT survey.
In two counties - Essex and Northumberland - the top performing school is in
the state sector. In many others you can pay day fees of Pounds 5,000 a year
for a school the average results of which are no better than those for
nearby state schools.
Unsurprisingly, grammar schools top the state sector: 25 out of the top 30
state schools are grammar schools, while the top two comprehensives -
Hasmonean High in London and Wolverhampton Girls High - are, respectively, a
religious foundation and a school which has opted out of local authority
control.
Take Kent. Of the county's top 20 schools, ten are in the state sector.
Kent's leading grammar schools are a match for all but three of its
independent schools. In Orpington, Tunbridge Wells, Gillingham,
Sittingbourne, Gravesend and Maidstone the best-performing schools are in
the state sector.
The picture is more dramatic still in Buckinghamshire and Lincolnshire. Six
of Buckinghamshire's grammar schools - led by Dr Challoner's, Little
Chalfont - outperformed Stowe, the prestigious public school, which charges
day fees of Pounds 8,200 a year. Lincolnshire has eight state schools in the
top half of the FT-1,000, including two comprehensives, with the independent
sector nowhere outside Stamford.
Kent, Lincolnshire and Buckinghamshire's state schools, which survived the
national mania for forcing the state system into the comprehensive mould in
the 1960s and 1970s, achieve unusually impressive results. It is no
accident, perhaps, that Bucks and Lincs have among the weakest independent
sectors in the country, since few, if any, grammar schools left the state
sector under threat of reorganisation in the 1960s and 1970s. The survey
shows that a large proportion of the highest achieving private schools are
schools which, until 20 years ago, were an integral part of the state
sector.
Significantly, many comprehensives with professional middle-class catchment
areas score almost as highly as the leading grammar schools. Oxfordshire's
top state school is Cherwell, a comprehensive serving don-infested North
Oxford; Avon's is Chew Valley, in Chew Magna, mid-way between Bath and
Bristol; Bishop Luffa in Chichester heads the list in West Sussex; and so
on. County by county, state institutions in the wealthiest areas, with
professional clienteles, gain the best results, whatever their formal
status.
Indeed, an FT survey of Bristol schools, included in next week's supplement,
surmises that the city's independent day schools may well be more socially
representative than the highest achieving state schools in the city, most of
which are in its affluent suburbs or commuter belt.
In the state sector, then, education by mortgage has to a large extent
replaced education by ability. The relationship between schools' performance
and house prices is marked. All of the ten top performing counties in our
survey have higher than average house prices.
Within cities and towns, estate agents will tell you that houses in the
catchment areas of high-performing state schools go for a premium. According
to Jason Lamb, of Douglas Maloney, an agent for the catchment area of
Cranbrook School, a state grammar in Kent: 'It is very important that houses
are in the catchment area. Frequently it is the first thing that people
mention.'
By contrast, our survey shows that the level of fees charged by independent
schools has little bearing on academic performance. Fee levels generally
have more to do with the wealth of an institution's endowment, or the
grandeur of its recent building projects, than the quality of its teaching.
Collectively, private schools in Leicestershire, Greater Manchester and
Greater London have the best A-level results in the country, yet day fees
are typically below average in all three counties. Next week's supplement
includes value-for-money tables.
Recent surveys have attempted to assess the relative 'value' schools add to
their pupils by comparing grades achieved at A-level with those achieved at
GCSE. This measure is of only limited - if any - significance, since it
ignores progress made by pupils in their first five years at a school. It
also fails to take into account a school's sixth-form admissions policy -
how many of the weaker pupils get weeded out at age 16.
Next week's FT-1,000 is the first survey to publish institutions' stay-on
rates. It reveals wide variations, even among top schools. While at St
Paul's Girls' London all fifth formers stayed on last year, 85 per cent did
so at Haberdashers' Aske's School for Girls, Elstree. Several independent
schools in the top 100 had stay-on rates of less than 60 per cent - lower
than many comprehensives with a wider academic mix. Stay-on rates are not
just a reflection of the capacity of pupils, but they make for revealing
comparisons between schools.
Last year's FT survey of the independent sector showed single-sex schools
leading the field. Next week's FT-1,000 reveals the same pattern in the
state sector. Of the top 30 state schools, 25 are single-sex - most of them
grammar schools. The survey finds some excellent co-educational schools, but
overall the results of mixed-sex schools are disappointing even among
grammar schools.
Why are single-sex schools so comparatively strong? Any explanation, however
tentative, is bound to be controversial. But in the state sector, one thing
is clear: successful single-sex schools are among those which have best
defended their character against external attempts by politicians and
bureaucrats to reform them. It is time, perhaps, that British educationists
paid more attention to the pioneering work by US scholars John Chubb and
Terry Moe** on the deleterious impact of state bureaucracy on the
achievement of schools.
There is more to schools than results. There is also more to results than
A-levels: vocational courses suit many post-16 pupils far better than a
narrow academic regime, and Further Education Colleges are pioneering new
courses alongside more traditional avenues.
Yet high-performing institutions almost invariably make exam results a
priority. Strong exam performance generally also goes with a strong
extra-curricular side and intense efforts for those at the lower ability
end.
In a recent survey to find out why parents chose it, Queen Elizabeth's
Hospital, an independent day school in Bristol, found academic results to be
by far the most important factor. Next, in order, came its small size, its
happy atmosphere, the headmaster and discipline. 'There's no point trying to
re-invent the wheel,' says Dr Richard Gliddon, its headmaster. 'Results are
the most significant aspect of achievement.'
* Precise figures are subject to slight revision for late information.

FT  24 OCT 92 / The Long View: We are not bemused
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN YOU are a bemused investor or a beleaguered prime minister it can
sometimes seem difficult to see tell the wood for the trees. It can be
worthwhile to step back from the forest for a bit of perspective; you never
know, there just might be a pattern.
Right now we are in the disturbing process of changing our view of what
represents economic and political normality. A certain level of living
standard and rate of economic growth, and a certain position in the
international pecking order, have been taken for granted in Britain and in
the west generally. But although trends may persist for 30 or 40 years there
is no law that says they will persist forever.
Consider the demoralisation of America, victorious in the Cold War but now
fearful of losing the peace and apparently about to throw out its president.
In the 1950s and 1960s great companies such as General Motors and
International Business Machines dominated the industrial world. They
controlled the technology and they set the standards. Now they may be in the
long slow process of going bust, taking with them to oblivion the secure,
high-wage jobs that fuelled American prosperity.
That degree of relative prosperity was a transient postwar phenomenon, with
Europe and Japan bombed into poverty and capital famine, and the rest of the
world well behind in the development timetable. Now, technology can be
almost instantly transferred around the globe, and cheap labour countries
are becoming powerful manufacturing centres. The rise of mainland China as a
force in international trading is a little-recognised threat, although
highlighted this year by a booming Hong Kong stock market. Millions of
industrial jobs have already been destroyed in the west, with more to come.
For a while, during the 1980s, the evil day was postponed by
live-now-pay-later debt-financed binges in countries that would tolerate
them, like Britain and the US. Japan was pushed down the same road and is
now nursing a dangerously sick banking system. Germany, which prudently
avoided the debt trap, subsided instead into Eurosclerosis, until lured into
a still more seductive unification spending spree.
Germany will pay for its excesses soon enough, along with France and the
other remaining ERM members. Britain had to be forcibly rescued by foreign
exchange speculators from the errors of its political masters. However,
Continental recession will bring Britain scant satisfaction because our
exports will be hit. Meantime, European traumas have distracted Britain's
attention from the real long-term crisis, its loss of manufacturing
competitiveness and a probable inability to sustain living standards -
already a serious problem in the US. It is not a comfortable position, when
our government only six months ago won an election on promises of recovery
and no tax increases.
Against this background, protectionism is bound to start reappearing on
political agendas. At this stage the French farmers who are insisting on
their right to decent incomes for growing unsaleable food may still seem an
anachronism but some of their manufacturing counterparts elsewhere in Europe
may soon believe they have common cause.
In the UK devaluation of the currency is part of the answer, and it may have
to go further. But devaluation only works if real incomes are cut. If this
impoverishment is resisted, all that happens is a surge in inflation.
Moreover, a massive change in the structure of the economy is required.
There must be shift of resources into net exports of manufactured goods, and
a consequential sharp squeeze on the public sector and the services side of
the private sector, where most people are employed. The danger is that these
changes will bring immense financial dislocation. Here lies another risk of
inflation, because history shows that British employees fiercely resist
nominal pay cuts, and relative shifts in income have to be lubricated by
inflation.
Some say that inflation cannot happen in an economic depression. In the
1930s, it is true, prices were falling rather than rising. But then, banks
were permitted to go bust, and the money supply fell, in the US at any rate.
Today failed banks are bailed out by the state, their debts are assumed by
the public sector and the money supply goes on rising, albeit slowly.
Meanwhile the public sector deficit will be ballooning and eventually the
government will not be able to finance its debts without monetising them.
Already we are in the process of a cut in real interest rates. For nearly
five years interest rates have been held high in Britain in an attempt to
maintain the external value of sterling and suppress domestic inflation,
matching the very high real interest rates in Germany caused by the epic
clash there between fiscal and monetary policies. Remember that the real
return on index-linked gilts touched 4 3/4 per cent just before Black
Wednesday. That real interest rate has now tumbled to under 4 per cent.
Logically the British government now has motives to push that rate much
lower, both to reduce the cost of the private sector's investment in
manufacturing capacity and to diminish the burden of servicing its own debt.
Obviously this carries the risk of stimulating inflation but the dramatic
changes in political climate in the past few weeks have shown that the
government has little real choice in what it does. It was swept aside on
Black Wednesday. It will now be tossed to and fro helplessly by developments
in industry and in the financial system.
So much for prime ministers. As for investors, I suggested at the beginning
of September that the golden age of British saving was about to end. There
was bound to be a sharp and sudden change of direction, which was finally
acknowledged by John Major on Tuesday. Already the net of tax return on a
High Street savings account is down to about 5 per cent, and only optimists
believe that will provide full protection against underlying inflation.

FT  24 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Signs of lower rates help Mexico
recover - The government's monetary easing has prompted domestic investors
to return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIEN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A month is a long time in Mexico's stock market, and since the dark days of
September almost everything seems to have fallen into place for the
country's investors. After falling some 35 per cent from June to September
28, the market's main BMV index has since recovered by 25 per cent.
The rally, stronger and longer than many had expected, has been led by
domestic rather than foreign investors, and follows a string of good
economic news.
In early October, Mr Bill Clinton offered conditional support for the North
American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta); third-quarter results appeared to be
better than expectations; and last Tuesday, the government allayed fears of
a large currency devaluation by announcing an increase in the permitted fall
of the peso against the dollar.
Putting the pieces together, investors concluded that economic growth would
soon pick up and interest rates were likely to fall. Interest rate-sensitive
stocks - such as banks, retailers, and construction companies - have led the
stock market's rally.
Shares in GF Bancomer and Banacci, Mexico's largest banks, are up 45 per
cent and 31 per cent respectively over the past month; Cemex, the leading
cement company, gained 53 per cent; and Grupo Sidek, part of which is a
tourist and development group, 33 per cent.
The anticipation of Mr Clinton's conditional support for the North American
free trade agreement sparked off the buying, as many investors reckoned that
the agreement was inevitable, and could be in place by the first half of
next year. With Nafta approved, more foreign investment is expected to flow
into Mexico, and interest rates, which have been kept at around 19 per cent
in part to maintain foreign reserves at close to Dollars 20bn, could be
lowered.
A decline in interest rates would be welcomed by Mexican companies, and
would appear justifiable from the perspective of the domestic economy.
Monthly inflation has been hovering around 0.6-0.9 per cent, indicating that
real interest rates are close to 8-10 per cent. High rates have pushed down
economic growth expectations to 2.5-3.0 per cent this year, and have
contributed to the fall in the stock market from June to September.
Tuesday's successful renegotiation of the annual wage and price accord
removed the one remaining doubt. The government backed away from its
unstated goal to fix the peso to the dollar, and instead increased the
maximum permitted devaluation of the peso from 2.3 per cent a year to 4.6
per cent a year.
The government's decision, combined with moderate wage increases announced
on the same day, 'allays fears about the over-valuation of the peso, removes
a great deal of uncertainty, reduces the chances of a major devaluation, and
sets the stage for single-digit inflation in 1993,' says Mr Scott Galle from
DA Campbell Associates, a fund manager which specialises in Latin America.
The government's reversal will make the peso more volatile, since the band
at which the currency can fluctuate against the dollar will grow from around
3 per cent to nearly 8 per cent in 12 months. Mr Jorge Mariscal, manager of
Latin American equities at Goldman Sachs, says this will discourage
short-term investment in favour of longer-term holdings - the government's
presumed goal.
On Wednesday, the first signs of lower interest rates occurred. After rising
for seven consecutive weeks, rates on 28-day government paper edged down 0.2
percentage points to 19.5 per cent: on 364-day paper they fell 0.5 to 19.10
per cent.
Equity analysts immediately started to recommend interest rate-sensitive and
export-oriented stocks in spite of their recent rises, since they would
benefit most from the easing of the exchange rate. Mr Scott Kalb, an analyst
at Smith Barney, particularly likes the bank stocks, which were hit hard in
the third quarter.
Mr Mariscal is enthusiastic about export-oriented stocks, and those
competing in the trade sector, since their margins will rise slightly as a
result of the faster rate of devaluation. Cemex is likely to benefit from
the government's announcement this week to help finance the building of
530,000 low-income homes.
But he and another analyst warn that Mexico is not yet free of troubles. The
current account deficit may have stabilised, but it is still likely to top
Dollars 20bn this year. Mexico's thirst for foreign capital is therefore
likely to continue, leaving it vulnerable to unfavourable events in the US.
While Mr Clinton supports the principle of Nafta it is still too early to
tell when a new Congress will vote on it, and whether the Mexicans can
accept his interventionist parallel accords on labour and the environment.
If his commitment to Nafta looks in doubt, and foreigners take their capital
elsewhere, the government will have to keep the brakes on the economy for
much of next year as well.

FT  24 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Bad earnings news dampens
demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stock markets struggled to hold on to recent gains yesterday following
more bad earnings reports and further declines in bond prices, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 6.76 at 3,207.64,
having spent the day hovering a few points either side of Thursday's close.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also little changed at the
end of trading, down 0.8 at 414.10, while the Amex composite slipped 0.27 to
374.24 and the Nasdaq composite firmed 0.21 to 597.33. Turnover on the NYSE
was 197m shares. Rises marginally outpaced declines by 903 to 818.
Although analysts have been impressed by the market's recent resilience in
the face of a likely Democratic victory in the presidential election,
troubling corporate news continues to act as a brake on prices.
Westinghouse, United Technologies and Caterpillar have all reported
disappointing third-quarter earnings this week. Heavy losses in these
individual stocks, which make up a large part of the Dow, have prevented it
from pulling away from the 3,200 mark, which could prove to be the middle of
a new short-term trading range for stocks. Equities were not helped by fresh
declines in bond prices, which pushed interest rates higher.
Motor stocks continued to advance with Ford rising another Dollars  5/8 to
Dollars 39 7/8 in turnover of 1.5m shares on an upgrade from broking house
Salomon Brothers, which believes that there are several positive 'industry
dynamics' which will benefit US auto manufacturers, especially Ford, in the
short-term.
General Motors, which has been in demand lately on reports that Mr Robert
Stempel, the group's chairman, will soon be ousted, firmed Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 33 1/2 in turnover of 2.5m shares. The stock was also helped by news
that its car sales rose 9.6 per cent in mid-October. Chrysler proved the
disappointment of the sector, easing Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 25 7/8 after
Prudential Securities downgraded the stock, not for fundamental reasons but
because recent buying may have pushed the share price close to its term
peak.
Philip Morris slumped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 74 1/2 in turnover of 5.5m
shares after Ms Diana Temple, a Salomon analyst, cut her recommendation on
the stock from a 'buy' to a 'hold' because of concerns about the group's
share of the US cigarette market. The stock has been sold heavily in recent
days on worries about stalling overseas demand.
Caterpillar fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 52 1/4 after several broking
houses cut their investment ratings following bad third-quarter earnings.
On the Nasdaq market, Sun Microsystems bounced back Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars
32 in turnover of 6.6m shares. The move represented a strong recovery from
late selling on Thursday, which was prompted by the release of disappointing
fiscal first-quarter earnings.
Canada
WEAKER bank stocks led Toronto lower in active dealings. The TSE-300 index
lost 12.04 points, or 0.37 per cent, to end at 3,246.73. The index was up
about 39 points, or 1.2 per cent, on the week. Volume was 30.764m shares
worth CDollars 290.6m against 34.34m shares worth CDollars 277.5m. Declining
issues led advances 261 to 247.

FT  24 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses rise on renewed
rate-cut hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRENGTH in the dollar, and a reawakening of interest rate hopes helped to
bring senior bourses back to life, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS closed the October trading account with lift-off on expectations of an
early interest rate cut, a strong bond market and a firmer dollar. The
CAC-40 index ended up 35.67 at 1,766.41, just off the day's high of
1,770.72, for a rise of 6.1 per cent on the week. Turnover of FFr3.1bn was
heavy for a Friday and reflected end-account activity.
Interest rate-sensitive stocks led the rally, with Michelin adding FFr11.60
or 6.4 per cent to FFr191.90 in heavy trading. Suez rose FFr12.30 or 5.4 per
cent to FFr239.80 and Saint-Gobain put on FFr27.90 or 5.9 per cent to
FFr494.90.
FRANKFURT, however, reflected buying from DTB futures traders as the DAX
index rose 16.71 to 1,526.82, 4.5 per cent better on the week.
Among the heavyweights which the DTB focuses upon, Allianz rose DM38 or 2
per cent to DM1,908 while Daimler put on DM15.50 or 2.8 per cent to DM561.
An analyst said that Allianz might be looking a touch oversold, while the
climb in the dollar to over DM1.53 yesterday favoured major exporters.
Among second liners, Bremer Vulkan jumped DM2.90 to DM69.40, lifted from its
1992 low by a newspaper report that the company will win an order for four
container ships to China worth DM800m.
MILAN was propelled higher in active trading amid hopes that interest rates
would be cut this weekend. The government's progress on efforts to curb the
public sector deficit also encouraged the market. Buying was predominantly
domestic, though there was a report of a large foreign buy program. The
Comit index rose 4.77 to 417.19, flat on the week, in turnover estimated at
more than L200bn after Thursday's L144.8bn.
The state-controlled financial services and real estate holding company Sifa
led the market higher, with its ordinary shares rising L100 or 7.7 per cent
to L1,395, on news that Sifa would officially merge with Finmeccanica, which
is also state-controlled.
Trading in Alcatel Cavi was suspended ahead of news that its parent Alcatel
Cable of France was offering to buy out minority shareholders. lt was
offering L3,700 per ordinary share and L2,730 per savings share. The
ordinary share last traded at L2,800.
AMSTERDAM recovered some ground towards the close on short covering and the
CBS Tendency index finished 0.2 lower at 104.3, down 1.13 per cent on the
week.
The financial sector continued to improve on hopes of lower European
interest rates with ABN Amro up 20 cents at Fl 50.10 and ING 50 cents higher
at Fl 49.90.
Fokker, besieged by rumours throughout the week, denied another which
claimed that Dasa was offering Fl 25.50 per share as part of its deal to
acquire a 51 per cent stake. The Dutch group said recently that it expected
the price to be nearer Fl 40 per share. The shares closed at a new year's
low, down Fl 1.00 at Fl 15.80.
DAF was another 70 cents lower at Fl 10.80, a loss of 18 per cent on the
week, after deferring payment of its preference dividend on Thursday.
MADRID's general index put on 1.13 to 201.18, a rise of 3.7 per cent on the
week. BBV, which reported a 20 per cent fall in third quarter earnings lost
Pta10 to Pta2,215 but the sector was generally firm with Banco Popular up
Pta60 at Pta9,680. Telefonica, in spite of recent presentations in the UK
and Madrid, fell Pta15 to Pta950, while Cubiertas showed a rise of Pta245 to
Pta3,825, up 21 per cent on the week.
BRUSSELS closed higher as a strong recovery in Petrofina offset declines
among some smaller industrial stocks. The Bel-20 Index was 11.28 higher at
1,132.96, up 3.5 per cent on the week. Petrofina closed BFr440 or 6.2 per
cent higher at BFr7,590.
STOCKHOLM ended the week 9.1 per cent higher, on lower interest rates. The
Affarsvarlden General index rose 20.9 to 721.9 as turnover jumped to SKr616m
from SKr459m.
HELSINKI extended its rally to a ninth consecutive day, the Hex index
closing 14.5, or 2.1 per cent higher at 690.3, up 11 per cent on the week
and 14.3 per cent since October 12.
Turnover was FM81.7m. A FM2.17bn trade surplus for September and lower
domestic interest rates helped push the market higher.
COPENHAGEN, conversely, had another bad day, writes Hilary Barnes, following
the announcement of a big third quarter loss by Jyske Bank and Danske Bank's
purchase of a large chunk of shares in Baltica Holding. Danske fell DKr9 to
DKr209 and Jyske by DKr36 to DKr188 as the all-share index plunged 3.09 to
254.36.

<TEXT>
TRADING activity centred on stocks related to room-temperature nuclear
fusion yesterday, while the Nikkei average rose on index-linked buying,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index closed 104.61 better at the day's high of 17,117.65, down 1.5 per
cent on the week. After moving in a narrow range in the morning session, it
fell to a low of 16,944.43 in the afternoon session on light arbitrage and
small-lot selling, before rising on a late buying initiative.
Volume was flat at 220m shares against 221m. Advances led declines by 493 to
414 with 199 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained
3.42 to 1,296.69 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index xxxx xxxx to
xxxxxxxx.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone surged Y56,000 to Y597,000 on its
announcement that it had successfully tested a new vacuum method of
room-temperature nuclear fusion. Other stocks related to this technology
also advanced, with Aisin Seiki, the most active issue of the day, rising
Y100 to Y1,160 and Denki Kogyo adding Y29 to Y866.
Bio-technology related issues gained: Shionogi, the pharmaceutical company,
rose Y44 to Y824 on its research into cures for Alzheimer's disease.
Some export-related high-technology issues were lower on the higher yen, as
the currency strengthened against the dollar. Hitachi fell Y9 to Y713 and
Toshiba lost Y11 to Y562.
Ito-Yokado, the leading supermarket chain, fell Y60 to Y3,720 on the arrest
of its officials on charges of an alleged payment of Y27m to 'sokaiya' or
racketeers to prevent them from disrupting the company's shareholders'
meeting.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 50.61 to 18,748.10 in volume of 13.2m shares.
Roundup
THERE were mixed performances among the region's markets yesterday.
HONG KONG eased ahead of the weekend but was still 4.6 per cent higher on
the week as the Hang Seng index closed 66.58 lower at 6,262.54.
Hutchison Whampoa, the most active issue, lost 20 cents to HKDollars 17.60,
while Cheung Kong fell 40 cents to HKDollars 24.00 and China Light shed 50
cents to HKDollars 36.50. Turnover was HKDollars 4.83bn after Thursday's
HKDollars 6.34bn.
SINGAPORE recorded its biggest daily gain since late August on buying of
blue chips. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 34.98 to 1,366.47, up
2.4 per cent on the week. Some analysts attributed the change in sentiment
to positive September trade figures while others reported strong buying
interest from a US pension fund.
SEOUL advanced for its sixth consecutive session as investors remained
confident of an easing in interest rates. The composite stock index was 2.37
higher at 571.34, a 10 per cent gain on the week, as turnover swelled to
Won535.5bn from Won517bn.
Samsung Electronics closed Won1,300 lower at Won31,900 on reports that the
US had imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on some semiconductors.
TAIWAN saw its lowest daily turnover since June 1989, down to TDollars 7.7bn
from Thursday's TDollars 8.6bn. The weighted index dropped 36.63 to
3,662.60, a week's fall of 1.2 per cent.
MANILA fell on late selling by foreign institutions and the composite index
shed 6.27 to 1,321.41, down 3.6 per cent on the week. Combined turnover fell
to 212m pesos from 263m pesos. Oil stocks weakened as major drilling
activities scheduled for November and January were postponed.
AUSTRALIA continued to see heavy trading in Foster's rights while ANZ gained
12 cents to ADollars 2.95 on unconfirmed rumours that another institution
might take a stake in the bank. The All Ordinaries index rose 7.4 to
1,455.5, up 2.5 per cent on the week in turnover of ADollars 224.5m.
Foster's rights put on 1 cent to 14 cents while the ordinary shares were
steady at ADollars 1.24.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Overnight at 100%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIQUIDITY shortage in the sterling money market took a turn for the
worse yesterday as the overnight rate in the interbank market rose to 100
per cent in afternoon trading, writes James Blitz.
Commercial banks were bidding painfully high levels for sterling against
base rates of 8 per cent because of the shortage of cash in the system.
There was general dismay at the situation, and some discount house dealers
were concerned that the Bank of England has proved unable to rectify the
problem by adding liquidity.
Yesterday's shortage of Pounds 1.8bn forecast by the Bank of England was the
latest in a string of liquidity problems that have dogged the sterling
market all week. They are partly the result of the tax collection season
which the UK is now in. This forces the banks to deliver more funds to the
Bank of England than they are receiving.
But the difficulties fundamentally reflect the systemic shortages which
followed the Bank of England's massive intervention on the foreign exchanges
in the wake of Black Wednesday.
Compounding the problem is the widespread feeling that another base rate cut
is imminent. Dealers do not want to offer bills to the Bank of England at
the current structure of 8 per cent base rate, because they fear that the
assets will lose value if base rates are cut.
Last Friday's base rate cut in the wake of a 26-day 'repo' reflecting the
former structure of rates has probably undermined any interest in offering
bills.
Discount house dealers said that the Bank of England did not dare to offer
liquidity through a short-dated 'repo' because this would be interpreted as
signalling another base rate cut.
One dealer wondered whether there might be policy differences between the
Treasury and the Bank of England. He could not understand why the Bank did
not offer a short-dated repo accompanied by an announcement that it
signalled no policy change.
The Bank provided late assistance of Pounds 400m yesterday, although this
still left the system short of Pounds 350m of cash. One month money closed 1
1/2 percentage points above base rate, while 3 month money firmed up to 8
per cent.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar breaks key resistance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR broke through DM1.53 against the D-Mark for the first time in two
months yesterday as dealers become increasingly convinced that there will be
another official cut in German interest rates, writes James Blitz.
All week, the market has been looking for any indication that German rates
are about to ease and that the dollar is on an upward path. Yesterday was no
exception.
The dollar rose to a high of DM1.5365 in European trading, partly
precipitated by comments from Mr Erich Fein, the Depiuty President of the
Bavarian central bank, who said that the recent rise of the D-Mark has led
to a reduction in inflationary pressures as import prices ease.
Central bank officials later denied that Mr Fein had specifically commented
on the conditions necessary for a cut in rates. But a comment from
Chancellor Helmut Kohl that tax increases would be necessary in 1995 to pay
off around DM400bn of East German debt added to speculation that the
Bundesbank will relax monetary policy as public spending is tightened.
The dollar closed in Europe at DM1.5310, up more than two pfennigs on the
day.
Many analysts believe that the dollar will soar in the aftermath of the US
election. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corporation in
London, noted that the currency had been bought by major investment
institutions yesterday, a view echoed by several other analysts.
But the currency's moves between now and the US presidential election in ten
days time are trickier to call. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at
Citibank in London, says that next week's economic indicators could
underline the sluggishness of economic growth. He believes that the figure
for third quarter GDP in the US, due out on Tuesday, may show
quarter-to-quarter growth below one per cent. He also believes that consumer
confidence figures will also disappoint investors.
The Italian lira was the other currency to dominate events yesterday. The
Bank of Italy gave several indications that it may be planning to re-enter
the European exchange rate mechanism sooner rather than later.
First, the Bank announced that it would offer repurchase tenders in foreign
currencies next week, an unusual move which underlines its belief that the
lira will not depreciate. Dealers said this was compounded by the Bank's
covert intervention in European markets yesterday, supporting the lira, for
the first time since it left the ERM. The Bank closed the day by reducing
the discount rate by 1 percentage point to 14 per cent as the lira closed at
L876.1. to the D-Mark, from a previous close of 877.6.

FT  24 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Wiltshire Brewery losses rise to Pounds
1.4m
</HEADLINE>

   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Wiltshire Brewery Company, the shares of which are suspended pending a
share subscription and placing, yesterday belatedly reported increased
losses for the 14 months to November 30 1991, writes Richard Gourlay.
Pre-tax deficit rose from Pounds 578,380 to Pounds 1.39m on sales that
doubled to Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 1.25m). The figure was after an exceptional
provision of Pounds 460,241 against its investment in County Inns.
Mr Graham Axford, chairman and a former managing director of corporate
finance at James Capel, said the group continued to suffer from its high
gearing. Net interest charge in the period doubled to Pounds 705,000 (Pounds
342,000).
Wiltshire has been in discussion with its bankers since late last year.
As a result of the placing and subscription control of Wiltshire is expected
to pass to Mr Vijay Mallya, one of India's largest distillers and brewers,
whose family controls UB Group. A prospectus is expected shortly.

FT  24 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Walker Greenbank settles Alkar dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALKER GREENBANK, the wallcoverings group, has reached an out-of-court
settlement of its claims against Arthur Young, the group's former auditors,
and Mr William Carr and his son, Alan.
The litigation arose from the group's Pounds 3.5m acquisition of Alkar, a
shop fitting company, from the Carrs in 1987.
The total value of the settlement of the group's claims for damages and
costs is worth about Pounds 4.6m, including Pounds 3.7m in cash which will
be used to strengthen the balance sheet.
Walker Greenbank had originally sought Pounds 15m in damages and interest.
In arriving at the settlement the parties recognised that the costs, length
and complexity of the litigation made a commercial solution desirable.
Since the end of July Walker Greenbank has incurred legal and professional
charges of about Pounds 500,000 Its interim results included a Pounds
484,000 extraordinary charge mainly to cover these costs.
As part of the cash element 1.16m Walker Greenbank shares, issued to the
Carrs in 1988, which had been frozen since the litigation started, were sold
raising about Pounds 660,000 which was remitted to the group, together with
frozen dividends totalling about Pounds 200,000.
In addition the Carrs are writing off Pounds 900,000 in loans made to Walker
Greenbank. The balance of the settlement will be met by Arthur Young, now
part of Ernst &amp; Young, the group's auditors at the time of the acquisition
who resigned in January 1989 after accounting irregularities and stock
problems in Alkar came to light.
Mr Charles Wightman, Walker Greenbank's chief executive, said the settlement
represented a satisfactory conclusion. He added the cash would be used to
reduce borrowings to below Pounds 2m for gearing of less than 10 per cent.
'Senior management will now be able to concentrate all their efforts on the
further successful development of our core businesses,' he added.

FT  24 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Flying into a storm of competitor protest -
The fears resulting from BA's acquisition of Dan-Air
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS yesterday sparked off a furious controversy over the future
of competition in the UK airline industry by acquiring Dan-Air, the
financially troubled Gatwick-based carrier, for a nominal Pounds 1.
Smaller UK carriers warned that the deal would severly undermine the
government's multi-airline policy, designed to promote competition in the
industry, by further strengthening BA's stranglehold of the market.
By far the most theatrical reaction came from Mr Richard Branson, the Virgin
chairman, who announced he was launching a new short-haul carrier Virgin
European Airways to compete against BA. His own rescue proposals for Dan-Air
were abandoned ten days ago.
He has already applied to the Civil Aviation Authority for licences and
slots to fly from London to Paris, Brussels and a number of other European
destinations.
But Mr Branson said the new venture could only take off 'if the government
now reviews competition amongst British airlines and slots at Heathrow and
Gatwick which are two of the world's busiest airports'.
Echoing calls from all the other UK independent carriers for a detailed
investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission of the acquisition,
Mr Branson said: 'If there is no intervention, then competition will suffer,
the consumer will suffer and we will not see a flourishing multi-airline
industry.'
The other independent carriers with scheduled services, including British
Midland and Air UK, have been especially worried by suggestions that the BA
deal has already received tacit approval from the authorities anxious to
avoid the complete collapse of another UK airline two years after the
failure of Air Europe, Dan-Air's former Gatwick competitor.
All have called for a MMC investigation and some have already written to the
Office of Fair Trading. Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland,
said he had already complained to the UK and European Commission
authorities.
'A deal like this one simply cannot be waved through,' said Mr Andrew Grey,
Air UK's managing director.
But Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive, warned yesterday that BA would
not go through with the deal if it were forced to give up routes or slots.
The deal would also be threatened if it faced long regulatory hurdles.
Both Sir Colin and Mr David James, the company doctor who has been running
Dan-Air, said the alternative to the BA acquisition would have been
bankruptcy.
BA is planning to create at Gatwick a new, low cost short haul airline,
operating 11 Dan-Air Gatwick routes using 12 Boeing 737 airliners as well as
the existing 10 BA Gatwick short-haul routes with 10 Boeing 737s. Eventually
they would all be under BA livery.
The deal will save about 400 jobs from Dan-Air's present full-time workforce
of 2,000, but on lower pay. 'That's better than no job at all', said Sir
Colin.
In its submission to the OFT, one independent UK carrier notes that the job
issue was one of the persuasive arguments in favour of the earlier merger
between BA and British Caledonian. But the carrier also argues that the
implications of the Dan-Air acquisition are greater than those of the
British Caledonian merger.
At the time of the Caledonian deal there were at least two airlines at
Gatwick, Dan-Air and Air Europe, capable of providing competition against
BA. 'Now, so far as European scheduled services are concerned, there is no
other competitive force at Gatwick nor is there a prospect that an airline
could enter the market in order to provide that force.'
BA carried 66.1 per cent of all passengers carried by UK airlines on
scheduled services in 1991. At Heathrow it holds 40 per cent of slots, while
at Gatwick it holds 15.8 per cent of slots.
Dan-Air only has a handful of slots at Heathrow, but it holds about 23 per
cent of slots at Gatwick. After the Dan-Air transaction and the
restructuring of its own short haul activities at Gatwick, BA expects to
operate about 21 per cent of slots at Gatwick. The deal will see the closure
of Dan-Air's charter operations.
But what especially worries its competitors is the fact that BA will be
taking over six important Dan-Air routes to Brussels, Paris, Nice, Rome,
Toulouse and Zurich on which Dan-Air was the sole carrier out of Gatwick. BA
already serves these routes from Heathrow and the Gatwick operations will
further reinforce BA's dominance in the market.
For the competitors, the liquidation of Dan-Air would have been preferable.
They argue that then there would have been a greater chance that other
airlines would enter the market.
But this begs the question of why no other carrier stepped in to the rescue.
Even the Labour party said yesterday the BA deal 'looks as though it is the
best of a bad set of options'.
Mr James acknowledged that the short haul business was 'a dog of a market'
and the only way it could be financed was under the umbrella of a strong
organisation. By passing his patient on to BA, the company doctor yesterday
was falling in line with the general trend of consolidation in the European
airline industry accelerated by the recession and the advent of
liberalisation.
'We did not have the pocket,' he admitted.

FT  24 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Hanson hits out at RHM demerger plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON condemned Ranks Hovis McDougall's demerger plan as 'ill-conceived'
and attacked the milling, baking and grocery company's record in the offer
document it posted to its target's shareholders yesterday.
RHM again urged its shareholders to reject the offer.
The terms, 220p in cash for the ordinary shares and par for the preference
shares, values the whole company at Pounds 790m.
In a letter to RHM shareholders Lord Hanson, chairman of the Anglo-American
conglomerate, said: 'Your board's defensive proposal to break up your
company has confirmed our view that change is required.' He continued that
'the split would create three companies of much less significance, with an
uncertain future and uncertain values.'
Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive of Hanson, said the management of the three
parts would be unchanged. 'What is going to happen to deliver value to
shareholders?' he asked.
He said the milling and baking division had failed to do anything about the
changing trends in that market. In the grocery products side it was
'difficult to see a rational approach to the management of a brand
portfolio'.
Hanson's brand management skills were displayed in its Imperial Tobacco
cigarette business and its Seven Seas vitamin subsidiary.
RHM riposted, saying: 'Hanson is well known as a purchaser of businesses at
below their true value and is trying to do the same with RHM'.
Mr Stanley Metcalfe, chairman of RHM, said: 'Hanson's document ignores the
fact that the offer price sits 27p below the current market price of 247p'.
During the day RHM shares rose 2p to 249p, and Hanson shares were 1p higher
at 233p.
Hanson's document says that RHM's earnings per share record since 1988 is
worse than other leading competitors. Its share price has underperformed the
stock market and the food manufacturing sector since the 465p offer from
Goodman Fielder Wattie was rejected in 1988.
It contrasted statements by RHM management about expansion and acquisition
plans with subsequent disposals. For example, in 1988 RHM paid Pounds 80m
for the Shredded Wheat breakfast cereal business and said it was part of a
plan to grow a strong breakfast cereal business.
Within two years RHM had sold all its breakfast cereal interests.
Hanson also said the demerger plan was complex, lengthy and uncertain while
its cash bid offered certainty.
Dalgety said yesterday that Federal Bakeries, the business it sold to RHM a
week ago for up to Pounds 28m, including debt repayment, had net assets of
Pounds 14m and made a trading profit of Pounds 2m in the year to the end of
June.
RHM now has two weeks to produce a defence document. Hanson's offer could
run until December 22, or longer if there is a rival bid, but the first
closing date has been set at November 13.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits of Yorklyde, the cloth and rug maker, improved from Pounds 1.06m to
Pounds 1.37m pre-tax for the six months ended July 31.
The 30 per cent improvement was scored on the back of a 24 per cent rise in
turnover to Pounds 7.37m, against Pounds 5.92m.
Earnings emerged at 18.8p (14.1p) and the interim dividend has been
maintained at 4p.
The directors said full time working was continuing at all group factories
and added that the withdrawal from the ERM had helped to maintain a 'healthy
level of inquiry' for the new season.

FT  24 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Receivers in at Harland Simon as talks fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARLAND Simon, the control systems company suspended on the stock exchange
since last month, has been placed in receivership by its bankers. The joint
administrative receivers are Mr Nick Lyle and Mr Roger Powdrill of Touche
Ross, writes Angus Foster.
Harland has been negotiating a restructuring and financing levels with its
bankers, mainly Barclays, since the share suspension, but the company's
proposals have been turned down.
The receivership will hit 20 jobs in the holding company with 800 jobs at
stake in the operating subsidiaries.
Harland's problems began in February when it issued a profits warning,
leading to a slump in the share price. Following the resignation of chairman
Mr Roy Ashman and a decision to sell several subsidiaries, Harland announced
pre-tax losses of Pounds 6.32m in the year to March 31.
Losses included exceptional provisions of Pounds 5.1m to cover bad debts and
loss making subsidiaries.
The shares, which traded at 585p in February, had collapsed to 20p when they
were suspended.

FT  24 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Staff stop work over appointment at MGN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STAFF AT Mirror Group Newspapers stopped work last night after the company
confirmed that Mr David Montgomery, former editor of Today, had been
appointed chief executive.
Journalists and other staff on the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and People
newspapers said they would refuse to work with Mr Montgomery - who also
edited the News of the World, another paper in the Rupert Murdoch stable.
They held a newsroom meeting and said the stoppage would continue until they
received assurances that his appointment would not take place.
Mr Montgomery was called 'a sacker and union buster' by the National Union
of Journalists' members, who fear he will end the Daily Mirror's traditional
support for the Labour party.
Mr Montgomery's appointment prompted Mr Joe Haines, the MGN non-executive
director and former political editor, to resign on Thursday night, saying
the Daily Mirror's reputation as a left-wing newspaper would be destroyed.
However, in an apparent effort to maintain the political balance in the MGN
boardroom, the company also announced yesterday that Lord Hollick, the
Labour peer who is managing director of MAI, the financial services and
media group, had been appointed a non-executive director.
Mr Montgomery, commenting on the editorial policy of the MGN titles, said:
'The board has today reconfirmed that MGN's left-of-centre editorial stance
will be maintained under the overall responsibility of the editors of the
respective newspapers. I look forward to developing MGN as a strong
independently owned company.'
MGN also said Mr John Allwood had been appointed finance director. Mr
Allwood is a chartered accountant with over 14 years experience in
newspapers, including 11 years at News International.

FT  24 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Crown Comms suspended as bank talks start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Crown Communications, owner of the LBC radio station, were
suspended at 6p yesterday after the company entered talks with its banks
about a refinancing.
The company is seeking to convert a large amount of its net borrowings of
about Pounds 15m into equity.
'We are looking at a combination of a number of things, part of which would
be debt conversion,' said Mr David Whitaker, finance director.
Crown has been in financial trouble for some time, and reported losses of
Pounds 5.58m in the six months to March 31, on top of losses of Pounds 6.79m
in the previous year.
The company has been disposing of non-core assets. LBC, which lost Pounds
300,000 in the half year, is set to at least break even this month, said Mr
Whitaker.
Share suspensions and talk of refinancings are often the last options when
banks are threatening to withdraw support. But Crown's advisers remained
optimistic.
The Radio Authority, the commercial radio watchdog, said Crown's situation
was being monitored but LBC could continue to broadcast as long as it
complied with its licence and paid its licence fee. LBC's licence is due to
expire at the end of 1994 and will be re-advertised from March next year.
Crown is also waiting to hear if a new set of proposals to sell some of its
stake in a loss-making French radio network have been approved by the French
authorities. Earlier proposals to sell some of the stake were rejected.
Crown is now seeking to reduce its effective stake from 49 per cent to 19
per cent. Mr Alain Ayache, a controversial right-of-centre magazine
publisher, is believed to be buying some of the shares.

flotation tag

   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Dorling Kindersley Holdings, the international publishing group,
were yesterday priced at 165p, giving the group a value at flotation of
Pounds 101.7m.
Strong demand for the shares has caused the proportion of the 19.15m shares
on offer, which will be firmly placed with financial institutions, to be
reduced from 75 per cent to 63.4 per cent. The remaining 36.6 per cent will
be provisionally placed, subject to clawback by financial intermediaries for
sale to private clients.
The price puts the shares on an historic multiple of 18.1 and a notional
historic gross dividend yield of 2.4 per cent. The closing date for
application forms from intermediaries is next Wednesday and dealing is
expected to begin on Friday.
The issue is being sponsored by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, with Cazenove acting
as broker. The flotation will raise Pounds 31.6m, of which Pounds 25m will
be new money for the company.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Mr Major's growing pains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'A STRATEGY for growth is what we need; a strategy for growth is what we are
going to have.' Thus did Mr John Major announce what looks like the most
significant of the many U-turns made by his government since September 16,
the day the pound and the government were found wanting.
The prime minister wants an 'early, strong but sustainable' recovery, with
particular emphasis on the 'early'. He is in exalted company. The leader of
every leading country wants the same thing and Mr George Bush seems doomed
to pay the ultimate price for his failure to achieve it. Will Mr Major be
any more successful? Unhappily for him, recovery is likely to be slow in
coming and be weak when it does.
Many have recommended an independent Bank of England as part of the solution
to the government's lack of long-term counter-inflationary credibility.
Unfortunately, Lord Justice Bingham's devastating report on the Bank of
England's supervision of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International has
taken a bit of the gilt off this gingerbread.
What are the remaining options? Many recommend still lower short-term rates
of interest. But there is more of a conflict over fiscal policy. Some
recommend further fiscal expansion, ignoring the fact that the public sector
borrowing requirement is already some 5 to 6 per cent of gross domestic
product. Others argue for fiscal consolidation. Few will be surprised to
find the Treasury in the latter camp. But the Treasury may be out of touch
with the government's policies. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, said
policy was 'to go for growth and recovery out of this recession', while Mr
Lamont denied that there is any U-turn.
Next week's Mansion House speech by the chancellor and the following week's
Autumn Statement on public spending should reveal more. They need to do so.
Sterling's exit from the ERM and the volte face over the closure of the 31
coal pits have, taken together, made the government look decidedly silly. It
must re-establish its authority once again.
Another downturn
Its own disarray is not the government's sole problem. At home, the
recession may be entering another downturn. Abroad, the economies of
continental Europe and Japan are slowing down rapidly, while the US is still
struggling to mount a real recovery. Yet the plight of the global economy
must not be exaggerated. This is not the Great Depression. The UK economy
was the only one in the group of seven leading industrial countries to
shrink over the latest 12 months, although it was joined by Germany in the
latest quarter.
It is little wonder that Mr Major's government is so unpopular. It is not
likely to become less so very soon. This week's quarterly survey from the
British Chambers of Commerce argues that the UK fell into the 'second leg'
of the recession in the third quarter, with confidence falling to levels
last seen in the winter of 1990-91. The volume of imports (excluding the
erratic items) continued to grow faster than that of exports between the
second and third quarters. Sterling's devaluation - now 11 per cent on the
nominal effective exchange rate, since Black Wednesday - will help, but its
effects will not only be long delayed, but be offset by the gathering
slow-down in continental Europe.
Rate cut
Lower interest rates should also assist the recovery, mainly because they
would help financial intermediaries and borrowers to rebuild balance sheets.
An annex to the latest World Economic Outlook from the IMF shows that the
ratio of total private non-financial sector debt to gross domestic product
in the UK more than doubled between 1980 and 1991. The task ahead is
immense.
Lower interest rates are not likely to encourage much borrowing, as both the
US and Japan have discovered. One reason is the debt mountain. Another is
the level of long-term interest rates. At around 9 per cent, these reflect
both the high real rate of interest and the persistence of inflationary
expectations. It was those expectations that encouraged the huge borrowings
of the 1980s. The self-same expectations are keeping long-term rates of
interest up during the recession. Given these worries, the stimulatory
effects of further increases in fiscal deficits are at least uncertain.
The problems are not unique to the UK, though they are particularly severe
there. What is also not unique is concern about the international economy.
Beggar-my-neighbour policies are coming back into fashion. The worst example
is not the recent changes in exchange rates, which can be justified, but
trade, where a complete collapse of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade
negotiations now seems likely.
Debt and inflationary expectations at home, deflation and protectionism
abroad all threaten Mr Major's 'early' recovery. Recovery will take time. It
will also need the preservation of a stable and open international economy.
Even if Mr Major adopts the right policies, he will remain at the mercy of
events.

FT  24 OCT 92 / A message from the markets: Yield curve and stock price
movements suggest the economy is returning to its pre-ERM pattern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial markets aren't just a collection of podgy young men in red braces
shouting down the telephone. They are also a giant, decentralised
information processing system, which reflects and amplifies events in the
real world - government decisions, technical innovations, social trends -
and enforces a ruthless sort of logical consistency between them.
So what are the markets saying now about the events of the past few weeks?
How has the information-processing mechanism reacted, now that some, at
least, of the data on which it operates have utterly changed?
One way of looking at the markets is the yield curve, which shows what
happens to interest rates as you lend money for longer and longer periods.
Intuitively, you would think that a longer-term loan would command a higher
interest rate than a short-term one. That sort of upwards-sloping yield
curve is what we've got now.
But it wasn't what we had before Britain left the ERM. Short-term rates,
which are set by the government, were very high to keep footloose funds in
sterling; long-term rates, which are set by investors, were lower - though
still high in real terms.
Now, the shape of the curve has completely changed. Short-term rates have
fallen; longer-term rates have risen slightly to reflect the higher risk of
inflation now that Britain is no longer anchored to the D-Mark. The main
chart shows the periods in the recent past when the UK had an upward-sloping
yield curve. There are two: the early 1980s, and 18 months in 1987-88.
In principle, a downward-sloping yield curve chokes off longer-term
investment (both in factories and in longer-term securities) because it
makes it more attractive to keep your money in cash in a building society
than in anything else. An upward-sloping yield curve may - if the slope is
steep enough - produce a stampede out of cash and into shares, long-term
bonds and anything else which promises a significant return.
That factor has underpinned the US stock market for most of the past year,
at levels that look pricey by historical standards. It may start to have a
similar effect in the UK, too - though Mr Sushil Wadhwani of Goldman Sachs
says that the impact of an upward-sloping yield curve is less pronounced in
Britain, because it has different investment communities.
Nonetheless, since the devaluation and the interest rate cuts, the stock
market has risen sharply, with a particularly big jump this week as it
digested John Major's commitment to growth. The analysts have a tool for
exploring what the level of share prices is saying about expectations for
growth. It is an equation which attempts to establish the way dividends on
shares relate to the interest payment the government makes on the gilt-edged
securities that make up the national debt.
Gilts pay a fixed rate of interest; equities pay dividends which are
expected to grow over time. If you divide the dividend you get on each share
by the price you have to pay to buy it, you get a figure known as the
dividend yield. Similarly, if you divide the annual interest payments on a
gilt-edged security by the current price of that security, you get the yield
on gilts.
Dividends, unlike interest on gilts, go up and down; and companies can go
bankrupt. So a rational investor, in choosing between gilts and equities
would take into account not merely the yields on the two sorts of paper, but
also how dividends would be likely to rise in future and what the risk is of
dividends shrinking or disappearing altogether.
That is spelt out in the analysts' formula: the yield on gilts is equal to
the dividend yield on equities plus the expected growth rate in those
dividends minus the risk premium required to hold equities rather than
gilts.
We know what some of those elements are immediately, just by looking at the
statistics pages of the FT. The yield on medium-term gilts is just under 9
per cent. The dividend yield on the FT-Actuaries All-Share index is just
over 4 1/2 per cent. That leaves two gaps: the expected growth rate of
dividends and the equity risk premium. The second of these is something that
analysts spend hours trying to establish, by looking back over long periods
of history. The consensus is that it varies between about 1 per cent and
about six per cent. In the short term, it goes up and down like a yo-yo,
depending on the collective mood of investors. Let's assume, though, that
it's currently close to its 3 per cent average.
Plug these numbers into our formula, and we get something like this:
9 = 4 1/2 plus the expected growth rate of dividends minus 3. That enables
us to calculate the trend growth in dividends the market is expecting: 7 1/2
per cent per year.
So what? Well, the growth in dividends is itself composed of two different
things: real growth and inflation. The existence of index-linked gilts
allows us to calculate the level of inflation the market is expecting. If
you regard the yield on index-linked gilts as the real rate of interest,
then you can subtract that from the yield on conventional gilts to get the
expected inflation rate. As the chart shows, this has picked up a bit since
devaluation, and is now just over 5 per cent.
Subtract that from the 7 1/2 per cent figure, and you get an implicit
expectation of a real growth in dividends of 2 1/2 per cent a year.
That may sound a figure of interest only to coupon-clippers, but in fact
it's the best indicator of what the market thinks about the long-term
economic outlook. Dividend growth is closely linked, over the long-term,
with the real growth of the economy.
So that's what the markets are expecting: an economy that grows at a
long-term rate of around 2 1/2 per cent, with inflation of 5 per cent a
year.
That sounds plausible enough, and reasonably familiar: it's how the UK has
looked for most of the post-war period. But looking more closely at the way
those numbers work is not quite so cosy.
Take, for example, a possible set of assumptions suggested by Mr Robin
Aspinall, of the stockbrokers Panmure Gordon. Suppose that the UK is
entering a slow-growth world, in which we cannot expect real dividend growth
to be as high as 2 1/2 per cent. In any case, British companies have been
arguably paying out too much in dividends, by historical and international
standards, and need a period of holding them down to get their balance
sheets back to normal.
And in a slow-growth world, the 5 per cent inflation expectation may also
prove too high. Suppose that demand is so depressed worldwide that even an
inflationary economy like the UK is unable to generate more than 3 per cent
inflation over the medium term.
Putting those assumptions into the equation leads you - if gilts are still
yielding 9 per cent - to a dividend yield of 7 per cent. Arithmetically,
that implies a stock market 40 per cent lower than it is today. But of
course, in that sort of environment, gilt yields would not stay at 9 per
cent; assume they drop to perhaps 7 per cent. That would give you a 5 per
cent dividend yield again, but it would make stocks much less attractive
than gilts as a place to put your money.
That's the pessimistic case. You can use the same sort of numbers to draw
much more optimistic conclusions, however. Suppose that gilt yields come
down anyway, as the markets adjust to the reduced risk of inflation, and
borrowers at the long end switch to cheaper, short-term money, reducing
demand and pushing long-term yields lower.
If gilt yields drop to, say, 8 per cent, and all the other elements in the
equation stay the same, then dividend yields will drop to 4 per cent - which
implies a 20 per cent rise in the stock market.
Much hangs on gilt yields, in other words. What will happen to them? One
influence will be the behaviour of short-term rates. The current state of
the interest-rate futures market suggests that investors are expecting
shorter-term interest rates to be around 6 1/2 per cent within three to six
months. US experience, as Mr Wadhwani says, suggests that a drop in
short-term rates eventually tugs the whole yield curve down; if that happens
here, gilt yields will eventually move down in sympathy with the short end
of the market.
On the other hand, says Mr Paul Walton of James Capel, there are two
worrying upward pressures on gilt yields. One is the government's need to
borrow; the second is the historic relationship with German bond yields. The
last time the pound was floating and there was a public-sector deficit, in
the early to mid-1980s, the spread between the two rates was close to 4
percentage points. Today, it is just over 1 percentage point, the sort of
level that prevailed when Britain was firmly locked into the ERM. If the
spread rises back towards past levels, with German bond yields unlikely to
drop below 6 per cent, then it is hard to see gilt yields falling much.
Which makes it more important that companies deliver the 2 1/2 per cent real
dividend growth implied by today's numbers. Will they be able to?
Perhaps the most striking conclusion to draw from this exercise is that the
market seems to be expecting the world to go back to the way it was before
Britain joined the ERM and Germany was reunified. That's a perfectly
plausible future, of course: it's just that it may not be the right one.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Down-to-earth Tory voices: Backbenchers in the news - 1922
Committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If an extra-terrestrial were to land on your lawn this weekend and say, as
ETs always do, 'Take me to your leader,' you would not, I am sure, make the
mistake of directing it to Number 10 Downing Street. FT readers are too
astute for that. Any one of them would point the way to Sir Marcus Fox,
chairman of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers.
This would pay off. A visitor from another world would feel instantly at
home in the '22, especially one accustomed to time-travel. Is Dame Jill
Knight of this decade? Is the bewhiskered Sir Rhodes Boyson of this century?
The committee's origins, too, are disputed. The conventional account is that
disgruntled Tory aliens met at the Carlton Club 70 years ago, to hear
Stanley Baldwin rally them in opposition to the coalition led by Lloyd
George. The latter was quickly disposed of. Another view, rehearsed in a
letter to the Daily Telegraph yesterday, is that the 111 new Tory MPs
elected in November 1922 came together in April 1923 to overcome their
handicap of parliamentary inexperience.
What is clear today is that the committee now exercises more power over the
government than the prime minister can have bargained for when he won the
election with what at the time seemed like a good working majority of 21. It
was Sir Marcus who, with a word, intimated that Mr David Mellor had to go;
Sir Marcus who, with a phrase, intimated that after Black Wednesday the
government had better pull its socks up; and Sir Marcus who pronounced
(backed up by his some of his fellow committee-members) that the original
plan to close 31 coal-mines was 'unacceptable'.
Only 11 backbenchers need to vote against a government motion to defeat it.
When the Tories are in opposition every one of their MPs belongs to the
committee. When, as is usually the case, the Tories form the administration,
the 1922 is made up of the party's backbenchers. They elect an executive of
18. In May cunning manoeuvres by the Conservative right placed many of their
own on this executive. These range from Sir George Gardiner, the veteran
Thatcherite and leader of the 92 group of right-wing MPs, and Sir Peter
Hordern, a long-standing monetarist, to the more populist Sir Rhodes and
Dame Jill. Many of the 61 first-time Tory MPs among the Conservatives are
natural Thatcherites; they regard the '22 as one weapon in their war of
attrition against ministers who, as they see it, are betraying the former
prime minister. The over-representation of the right on the executive
derives in part from its feeling of being under-represented in the cabinet.
In the current febrile atmosphere of Conservative politics this can be taken
to great lengths. Backbenchers opposed to the bill to ratify the Maastricht
treaty turned up in force at Thursday night's meeting, outnumbering
middle-of-the-roaders who rarely attend. The result was reports yesterday
suggesting that Sir Marcus and his troops wanted to postpone further
consideration of the bill. Talk of delay suggests no real wish to unseat the
party leader. Loyalty is still a powerful element in Tory thinking.
What has also changed is the way in which the 1922 executive reflects
opinion. Sir Marcus was elected in May on the platform of raising the
committee's profile and speaking out on behalf of ordinary MPs. Sir Cranley
Onslow, the chairman since 1984, found that his taciturnity and loyalty to
the leadership were not popular enough. The chairman traditionally has
direct access to both the prime minister and the chief whip, to whom he
regularly reports on the mood of the troops.
Sir Marcus's open and televisual approach has created tensions within the
executive. The arrival of sound-bite politics in the traditionally discreet
area of internal party management has not gone down well in all quarters.
Some of the 1922's more traditional members complain their chairman has
taken to leading backbench opinion instead of reflecting it. One said that
it was not necessarily only the government which got out of touch during the
long summer recess.
The average age of the executive is just over 60, higher than that of the
government. Twelve are knights, and one is a dame. None of the 18 has been
in the cabinet, though half of them have formerly been ministers, and four
have been whips. Others have worked their way up through the Byzantine
structure of parliamentary committees. Many of them have experienced life in
opposition. They recall vividly the devices to which a party with a small
majority can be driven. Sir Marcus and his two vice-chairmen have between
them 70 years in the Commons. It has been time spent chatting to colleagues
rather than sweeping into Westminster in a ministerial car.
But not even Sir Marcus is unassailable. Four years away from the next
election, the committee's ability to warn the government publicly that
policies need changing is working well enough in terms of keeping the party
together if not in contributing to Mr Major's cheerfulness. By 1996-97, it
will have to show that it knows how to be publicly loyal as well, perhaps
even to unpopular policies which are too late to alter. To fulfil that role
the junta that took power in May will have to come down to earth.

EDWARD and Laura Rapp are unusual people. Original thinkers. When they
wanted to compile a list of Britons and Americans resident in France they
bought the departement phone books and methodically scanned the columns for
Anglo- Saxon names. 'It was actually a fascinating job and you got so that
you could spot a Digby-Jones at 50 paces,' said Laura.
The Rapps needed the list to mail out promotional copies of their
English-language newspaper The Recorder. It speaks volumes for the quality
of the product that an initial mail-shot of only 1,500 names has produced
over 500 subscribers paying FFr100 a year for the monthly publication.
Most of the remaining 8,000 circulation goes out via NMPP, the Paris-based
state newspaper distribution agency. Under French law any legally registered
title has a right to distribution. Ideally the Rapps would like to point
NMPP at areas where 'Anglo' communities are densest: Provence, Normandy and
the Dordogne. However, French bureaucracy is not to be directed.
'The paperwork you get from NMPP is wild. They have an accounting system
that is just a mystery to us. You don't get data on July's circulation until
October and you can't even begin to guess at what size cheque you'll get,'
said Edward.
These are not the grumbles of tyro publishers, baffled by the newspaper
game. The Rapps - both 75 - retired to the town of Duras, 60km east of
Bordeaux three years ago. They had twice started and sold successful
small-town newspapers in their native Connecticut.
Ed and Laura are the kind of quirky, charming resourceful Americans depicted
by James Thurber. And, like Thurber himself, they know a dollar when they
see one. The Kent Good Times Dispatch started its career as a Boy Scout
paper until turned around by Ed using the lifetime's knowledge he had
acquired working for Reader's Digest selling advertising in central America.
'We sold it for a good price and signed an agreement not to compete for two
years. Neither Laura or I intended to work again but we got bored and 24
months to the day from the sale we brought out The Kent Weathervane,'
recalled Ed, as he worked on front-page layouts for the next issue of The
Recorder. The owner of the Good Times Dispatch bought the second title and
killed it off.
Boredom was the genesis of the The Recorder. The Rapps had planned to run
their large house in the sleepy town of Duras as a hotel but plans to
involve other members of the family unravelled. Hearing that the only other
English language paper in southern France was in the hands of the court,
following receivership, the Rapps put in a bid. But the bureaucracy was so
wearing they decided, with pioneer-spirit, to build their own buggy.
'We'd put together out first issue by the time the court came to a decision.
We were having fun, so we decided to keep going,' said Laura. They sit at
opposite ends of the 'newsroom' facing over the midi calm of the Place de la
Resistance in Duras.
Undoubtedly there is a market for The Recorder. The prefectures in 27 of
France's 95 departments sent the Rapps figures on the number of registered
English, Dutch and Americans. These show 29,200 British, 8,000 Dutch and
17,600 Americans in just those areas and do not include unregistered
part-time residents and and second home owners. The numbers are rising.
'It's a big population to address but it's not joined together,' said Ed.
'In Connecticut we could do our entire distribution from the back of a van
in one afternoon. Here it's rather different.
'I went into a newsagents in Perigord the other day and found our paper
stuffed up on the top shelf with the porno magazines. Another man said he
found the layout so old-fashioned that he'd assumed it was a religious
tract.'
The appearance of The Recorder owes rather more to the staid visual
traditions of the New York Times than the racy British tabloids or the
colourful French regional newspapers. However, the content is entertaining
and often stylishly written. A high proportion of correspondents are
professional journalists.
'We spend a lot of money, relatively speaking, on the editorial content but
the people that write for us are good. Paying our correspondents is one of
our big costs but we think it's essential,' said Ed as the fax machine
disgorged a commentary on Maastricht from the Brussels stringer.
'We ran a readership survey in July and we have a good fix on what people
want to read and on the demographics of our audience. People clearly like
letters and informative articles about life in France, the problems and the
pleasures. they like humour and personal experiences. Most of the audience
is over 40, half is over 60.'
Advertising is the problem. The Recorder has some, but not enough. Neither
of the Rapps speaks sufficient French to sell space in the domestic market.
They are pondering whether to acquire an agent in London, a local rep in
Bordeaux, or both.
'Of course, the recession is bound to hit new titles even worse than it
hurts established ones,' said Ed. 'Who wants to take a chance on something
they've never heard of when they're cutting budgets.'
The Rapps are cautiously looking for an investor/partner who will buy into
what the Rapps have established and contribute missing skills and - dare one
say it - energy. The Rapps admit to a loss of about FFr100,000 but point out
that few new publications go into profit in their first year.
They go multi-regional rather than simply national and to produce the paper
weekly. 'Regional editions would give the anglophones news they simply can't
get elsewhere and open up local advertising,' said Laura. 'The numbers of
people in the audience justifies both moves if we can figure out the details
of how to do it.' They're optimistic but cautious about their future. 'We're
75 and in great health but after 70 we figure you're on borrowed time,' said
Ed.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Minding Your Own Business: A mere morsel in the hands of
fate - The river which changed Alan Porter's course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALAN Porter has always believed in Fate. Over the past three years this
belief has been fully vindicated as two events outside his control - a river
which burst its bank and flooded his depot and the 1990 Food Safety Act -
transformed his business in size, style and profitability.
Porter began humbly. He studied hotel and catering management at Surrey
University but found the course too theoretical and left. A year working in
the food business with Justin de Blank in London gave him practical
experience. After that he did a variety of jobs, for a while he ran the
outside catering at Ripley Castle.
In 1972, he opened Porter's Provisions in Knaresborough with Pounds 2,000
borrowed from his father, which, in the course of the interview, he
remembered he still had not repaid. He built up a chain of five shops
including one at Farnley, which Jane Grigson, the cookery writer, once
called 'the finest food shop in England.'
Above the shop, Porter developed a wholesaling operation supplying
professional chefs. Interest in the lines Porter was importing grew rapidly
in the early 1980 and so did demand for Porter's knowledge and provisions.
But a successful primary wholesaler purchasing directly from the producer
must buy in large quantities to minimise transport charges. This means at
least one pallet from each supplier. These range from Pounds 2,000 for a
500kg pallet of top quality olive oil to Pounds 10,000 for one tonne of the
Valrhona chocolate which Porter imports for his patisserie customers and his
latest project, The Chocolate Society. Once you are buying these quantities
of perishable items you need a similarly large customer base to ensure a
rapid turnover of stock.
In 1987 Porter decided to close all five shops and to move to a large depot
in Boroughbridge. This increased his annual rent from Pounds 2,000 to Pounds
20,000. Grasping this expensive nettle forced him to learn many new skills.
For the first time he had to delegate, and to work within the discipline of
an organised structure. Turnover rose to Pounds 2.5m and the workforce grew
to 24.
Porter also had to go out and find new markets. He opened a depot in
Scotland and, after three years of negotiations, won a contract to supply to
Forte group hotels, restaurants and manufacturing outlets (including all the
own-label chocolates for the Wheeler's group) which added Pounds 1m to
turnover in its first year.
Porter says he should have abandoned the retail side even earlier. He misses
the contact with the public, but there was little room left for profit.
Dealing with the bigger buyers who understand his products and appreciate
his enthusiasm for the latest British goats' cheese makes commercial sense
and satisfies his need to supply the best.
The discipline of the market had forced Porter to cut the number of lines he
sells to 2,500. Fifty per cent of turnover is cheese. The rest falls into
five categories: oils, vinegars, olives, mustards and chocolates and he aims
to turn the stock over every two to three weeks. Porter no longer allows
himself the luxury of any oddball items and has, at the fifth attempt, given
up trying to sell pasta.
Then fate struck twice. The 1990 Food Safety Act changed Porter's plans. The
effect of the Act on perishable food wholesalers convinced Porter there
would not be a future for small, national distributors of perishable food.
He had three choices. To move out of perishable foods altogether, which is
where his expertise lay; to borrow heavily and open a system of fully
refrigerated depots around the country or to wholesale the products he
imported to others with depots. The third solution seemed the only practical
one but, as Porter realised, other wholesalers were unlikely to buy from him
as long as he continued in the wholesale business able to undercut them as
the primary importer.
This summer Porter merged his wholesaling business with that of Justin de
Blank. This will create a national wholesaling and distribution company with
a turnover of at least Pounds 3.5m and free Porter's Provisions to become
what Porter would like it to be, a primary wholesaler sniffing out the best
produce in Europe.
Porter has also learnt from a disaster in January 1991. when the River Ure
broke its banks and flooded his depot. The timing, just after a record
year's turnover, could not have been worse. The insurance policy based on
turnover and loss of profits had not been revised upwards and the insurance
company would cover only half the Pounds 150,000-worth of damage. Once the
building was repaired, overheads had to be cut and the following year's
accounts showed a much reduced gross profit but an even higher net profit. A
photo of the flooded depot outside Porter's small office serves as a
reminder that, occasionally, Fate has a sunny side.

FT  24 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Hanson/RHM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is plenty in Hanson's offer document for RHM to make the target
squirm, not least the reminder of its claim in 1988 that its past success
was also the key to the future. That the future turned out dismal is now a
matter of record. Hanson will, of course, have to increase its offer, but
probably not by much more than RHM's current price of 249p. The ease with
which it seems able to knock the company down, though, raises the question
of how much even it can make out of the deal.
The modest rise in RHM's shares since its demerger proposal hardly suggests
much hidden value. Hanson could spruce up some brands and slice extra costs
out of milling and baking. Even so, break-up profits would hardly enhance
its earnings much. The alternative, which it seems to prefer, of developing
RHM more or less as a whole will be slow to yield returns and costly in
terms of capital expenditure and brand support.
Perhaps one should take the company at its word and assume it does intend to
create a new core business in food. The RHM bid would then be an example of
the new-style Hanson at work. The hope would be that a more sober-minded
approach would boost the market rating of its shares. But a food business
would require further acquisitions. There are businesses which look cheap,
but one has to hope Hanson would distinguish between assets that are cheap
because they are undervalued and those that are simply not worth having.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROUPE GAN, the third-largest French state-owned insurer, has announced that
profits almost halved in the first six months, due to a rise in car thefts
and industrial accident claims and an increase in bad debts at CIC, its
banking unit.
GAN's net profits slid from FFr962m in the first half of 1991 to FFr487m
(Dollars 94.56m) in the same period of this year, on premium income up by
11.9 per cent to FFr21.9bn over the same period.
GAN warned that, barring an economic recovery, full-year profits would be
down sharply because of the extra claims from Hurricane Andrew and the
recent floods in southern France.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Rover returns to five-day working
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER, the UK carmaker, is returning car production to a five-day week at
its assembly plant at Longbridge, Birmingham, after two months of short-time
working.
The move is in contrast to action taken this week by Ford, the leading UK
vehicle maker, which plans to work only a 2 1/2 -day week for most of
November at its plant in Dagenham, east London.
Rover said it would resume five-day working on its Rover 200/400 assembly
line in the week beginning November 2 with output rising to 4,500 a week
from the 3,840 implemented in early September.
Rover is also resuming five-day working on its Metro and Mini assembly lines
at Longbridge, which had been cut to only three-day working in mid August.
Metro output will be raised to 1,900 a week from 1,560, while production of
the Mini will rise from 300 to 500 a week.
Alvis Industries of Coventry, best known for its armoured vehicles,
announced 230 redundancies yesterday - about 30 per cent of its workforce.
The company, which already cut 100 jobs a year ago, laid the main blame on
reduced spare parts orders from the Ministry of Defence.
The company belonged to British Leyland until it was sold to United
Scientific Holdings in 1981.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC ministers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean)
yesterday reached agreement on the main elements of a programme to turn the
six-nation regional group into a free trade area by the year 2008.
The six - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand - will implement a common effective preferential tariff (CEPT)
scheme on January 1, which will reduce over the next 15 years tariff rates
on a range of manufactured and processed agricultural products traded among
themselves.
Tariff rates on these products are to be brought down to 20 per cent by the
year 2003, and to 0-5 per cent by 2008, when the Asean free trade area
(Afta) is formally created.
Asean's senior economic officials still need to thrash out 'some minor
technicalities' prior to the Afta launch in 70 days' time.
Afta is designed to stimulate more intra-regional trade and attract foreign
investment to the area, as a way to counteract the rise of regional trading
blocs in North America and Europe.
Asean economic ministers are to meet Mr Kozo Watanabe, Japan's trade
minister, this weekend to discuss prospects for increased co-operation.

FT  24 OCT 92 / How To Spend It: Workers prepare their French revolution -
Two English designers who are moving to France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU WOULD need to be a fairly assiduous follower of fashion to be absolutely
au fait with what it is that Workers for Freedom do. Among a small, select,
and international circle, they have had a serious following ever since they
launched their first collection in 1985 and winning the British Designer of
the Year Award in 1989 did them no harm at all.
They manage to produce a collection which does the almost impossible: it has
English roots and international appeal. They manage to be English without
being either eccentric or going down the slightly updated classic route.
Many of the fabrics are hand-dyed, hand-painted or embroidered and this high
class craft element imbues each garment with a quality that seems to be what
the 90s consumer is looking for. If there is a word to describe their
clothes, it has to be romantic, and if not romantic, then whimsical.
They are most famous for their deliciously frilled or embroidered shirts and
fans like the model Catherine Bailey collect them, buying each new design as
it comes out. Frances Mossman, deputy course director in textile and fashion
at the Royal College of Art, remembers when she first discovered them and
how she bought their famous silk shirt with the embroidered roses in every
colour they did it in.
'They have that magic thing of being romantic and classic at the same time.
I keep all my Workers for Freedom clothes and when I bring them out again
find that they never look out of date.' Paul McCartney used them to design
the clothes for his world tour. Jonathan Price wears their suits when he is
collecting awards.
For fans of Workers for Freedom there is both good news and bad. The bad is
that Graham Fraser and Richard Nott, the duo behind the label, have closed
their shop in Soho ('we were offered the kind of sum for our lease that we
would have been silly to refuse') and are moving their entire operation to
France. 'We had watched other friends of ours running big ad campaigns and
film production companies by telephone and fax from their house in France
and we realised we no longer had to be in London to operate.'
They are, they swear, not giving up designing, it is more a search for a
better way of living and working, away from the city. It is also, as many
British designer have realised, about the only way of cracking the magic
Pounds 1m barrier.
'Somehow,' says Graham, 'we have many successful designers who achieve
Pounds 1m turnover a year but it is almost impossible to expand in the UK as
there is no manufacturing base for designers of our kind of size. In Japan
companies will willingly produce 60 metres of a special fabric, here nobody
is interested in anything but large runs. If we want to expand
internationally - and we do - we have to be able to farm out the
manufacturing, the distribution and the selling, which are not what we are
best at in order to be able to concentrate on what we are best at which is
the designing. It is why designers such as Rifat Ozbek, Jasper Conran,
Katharine Hamnett, John Galliano and Vivienne Westwood have had to seek
management skills and extra funds abroad.'
The winter collection is in the shops, the spring/summer group going into
the shops after Christmas will be the last collection from London. There
will be a hiccup while they miss next winter's collection and 'reassess
designer clothing, where it should be going and what it should be doing.'
The good news is that for all those who find Workers for Freedom prices
(from about Pounds 190 for a blouse to Pounds 400 for a jacket) beyond their
means they have designed a spring/summer collection for Littlewoods mail
order catalogue.
It will not be available until January, but in late December you can order a
catalogue by 'phoning 0800-616-61156. Based entirely on black and white the
most expensive garment in the collection is Pounds 49.99. There will be
handknits for Pounds 34.99.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE former chief executive of Kelt Energy, Mr Alastair Locke, has won
conclusive control of Blystad, owner of the offshore oil service company,
KCA Drilling.
The deal goes into the history books as a rare example of shareholders
agreeing to accept unquoted shares in a private company in return for
publicly-quoted paper.
Mr Locke said yesterday that his private company, Abbot Holdings, had
received acceptances from 75.23 per cent of Blystad shareholders.
The acceptance level means Mr Locke will be able to take the company private
or pass any other resolutions at an EGM.
Mr Locke already had acceptances from Blystad family directors who
controlled 65.2 per cent of the company. Passage to the critical 75 per cent
acceptance level was despite opposition from independent Blystad directors
who say the offer is inadequate.
Bank of Ireland Corporate Finance says Abbot's preference share offer values
Blystad at Pounds 7.5m, or 5.4p a share. The offer remains open but is
unconditional in all respects.

</HEADLINE>

   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in Davies &amp; Newman will get nothing from yesterday's sale of
the company's Dan-Air subsidiary to BA. Nor will they get to vote on the
deal, even though they stumped up Pounds 49.3m in a rights issue a year ago
to try to keep the group afloat.
Davies &amp; Newman secured Stock Exchange approval to avoid the need for
shareholder approval 'on the basis of time constraints and the fact that the
proposed transaction represents the sole alternative to receivership'.
Shareholders could band together to call an extraordinary general meeting.
Fund managers contacted yesterday said they had not yet decided whether to
do this.
Provided the deal goes ahead, the board of Davies &amp; Newman will propose that
the company be wound up.
Creditors will fare far better than shareholders: all will have their bills
paid. That includes Pounds 43m for trade creditors such as caterers and fuel
companies, Pounds 12m-Pounds 13m of bank loans and Pounds 17m-Pounds 18m for
loans secured on Davies &amp; Newman's assets.
As well as paying off these liabilities, British Airways will take on the
costs of rationalisation. These include redundancy payments for all but the
400-600 of Dan-Air's 1,990 permanent employees. It also employs 400
temporary staff.
BA will offer jobs at reduced salaries to the staff it keeps. It will also
pay any penalties associated with the early return of four leased British
Aerospace 146 aircraft and write-off the value of seven obsolete Boeing 727
aircraft.
'The (inefficient) 727s were the cause of very significant erosion of
margins,' said Mr David James, the company doctor in charge of Dan-Air,
yesterday. 'Their disposal is a hit on the balance sheet which Dan-Air could
not have afforded.'
BA estimates that it will have to make a provision of about Pounds 35m in
the second half of its 1992 accounts to cover the costs of the acquisition.
This figure would have been higher if the deal had been struck at almost any
other time of the year because in October airlines are flush with cash from
the busy summer season.
In return for the Pounds 35m, BA acquires 12 relatively new Boeing 737s and
the business of the largest airline operator at Gatwick airport. It will
close the charter services, switching stranded passengers to other flights.
Of Dan-Air's scheduled services to 28 destinations in western Europe only 12
will be retained by BA. Tickets will be honoured by other airlines.
BA will be able to trim costs by servicing some of the remaining aircraft
with BA engineering staff.
BA says the rump of Dan-Air will continue to lose money through the winter
season. Late next financial year the dealwill show significant benefits to
BA, said Sir Colin Marshall, its chief executive.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Former BR chairman testifies in bribes trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCALE of the alleged bribery of British Rail staff by Plasser Railway
Machinery GB, the track maintenance supplier, came as a 'considerable
surprise' to Sir Peter Parker, former BR chairman, he told the Old Bailey
yesterday.
He was giving evidence at the trial of Plasser and two of its executives -
Mr Norbert Jurasek, managing director, and Mr Michael Brooks, company
secretary - and Mr David Currie, BR's former head of civil engineering. All
deny giving or receiving bribes in the form of air tickets and hospitality.
Sir Peter said that in 1983 BR had received complaints from NEI, a
competitor of Plasser, after NEI had lost a tender bid. NEI complained that
the relationship between Plasser and some BR staff was extremely close and
possibly improper.
BR investigated the claims, but found nothing improper had taken place, he
said.
Sir Peter, chairman of BR from 1976 to 1983, agreed that corporate
hospitality - including paying for entertainment and travel - was accepted
commercial practice.
However, there was a world of difference between providing hospitality and
trying to fix a contract, he said.
BR's guidelines on accepting gifts were well known by staff, as were the
difficult and sensitive areas when gifts might be made when contracts were
being fought for.
He had never had any incident over excessive entertaining drawn to his
attention.
The trial continues.

the economic and social rot caused by 15 years of civil war, Reuter reports
from Beirut.
He was named to his first job in politics by President Elias Hrawi after
winning the backing of Syria, Saudi Arabia and most of the 128 members of
the new parliament.

AUSTRALIAN coal miners have called a 48-hour strike, the country's first
national coal stoppage for almost a decade, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney.
Miners in all but a few operations walked out yesterday over a dispute
involving changes to work practices.
This follows a tribunal's ruling that there must first be productivity gains
from flexible practices before industry-wide wage rises are granted.

Mr Freij, mayor of Bethlehem, said a PLO rule that the local PLO

<TEXT>
FOREIGN investment in Poland's motor car industry is being delayed by a lack
of agreement between Warsaw and the European Community on the distribution
of 30,000-vehicle tariff-free annual import quota worth Ecu100m into the
country.
Yesterday, Mr Louis Hughes, the head of GM Europe met with Ms Hanna
Suchocka, Poland's prime minister and confirmed his company's continuing
interest in assembling Opel Astra cars at Warsaw's FSO factory.
But GM, who agreed a letter of intent with the Poles last February, are
waiting to see what share of the quota they will get before going ahead with
the agreement.
GM also wants to ensure that car imports will continue to be regulated to
minimalise competition from other car makers.
Volkswagen who are planning to assemble delivery vans at the FSR factory
near Poznan are also waiting for the outcome of the car quota talks with the
EC.
Only Fiat have disregarded the quota issue and gone ahead with their Dollars
2bn takeover of the FSM small car factory in southern Poland.
Ideally the Poles would like to distribute the quota equally between those
companies investing in the country but this is being resisted by other car
makers in Germany and Holland who are eager to secure access on equal terms.
Imports of new and used cars into Poland fell this year with the
introduction of a 35 per cent import tariff.

NOKIA, the Finnish electronics group, is taking a further step into Japan's
multi-billion dollar cellular phone market after reaching a co-operation
agreement with Kansai Digital Phone (KDP).
Under the accord, the two companies will design a digital handheld phone for
introduction onto the Japanese market in 1994 when KDP opens a 1.5 GHz
cellular network in the Osaka, Kyoto and Kobe areas.
KDP is one of the leading players in the mobile phone sector and is expected
to capture as much as 20 per cent of the domestic market in 1995.
The agreement represents a further important breakthrough for Nokia, as
Japan, with 1.5m users, accounts for around 10 per cent of the worldwide
mobile phone market.
The group already has a collaboration accord in place with Nippon Idou
Tsushin and is one of only two foreign suppliers, alongside Motorola, to
have established a foothold in the Japanese market. The Japanese market is
expected to expand rapidly when the digital networks are introduced in late
1993 or early 1994.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Dangers of Iliescu's victory: Why ethnic divisions are
growing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Ion Iliescu secured a sizeable majority in this month's Romanian
election, but doubts remain whether he will be able to unite the country and
transform it into a modern European state.
He was re-elected with 61 per cent of the vote in the October 11presidential
run-off, more than 20 points clear of his opponent, Mr Emil Constantinescu
after his party, the Democratic National Salvation Front, (DNSF) came out
top of the parliamentary poll two weeks earlier.
But the 62-year-old former Communist received a striking vote of no
confidence from the country's 1.7m ethnic Hungarian minority. In Covasna and
Harghita, two Transylvanian countries where ethnic Hungarians form the
majority, Mr Iliescu and the DNSF received less than 15 per cent of the
vote.
Mr Iliescu and his party, won comparatively little support throughout
Transylvania, Romania's ethnically mixed western province which was part of
Hungary until 1918.
In Transylvania, an unprecedented 42 per cent of the electorate voted along
ethnic lines for either Romanian or ethnic Hungarian nationalist parties. In
particular, the polls revealed a surge in support for Romanian nationalist
parties who trebled their share of the country-wide vote to nearly 12 per
cent since February's local elections.
Romanian nationalists were boosted by the strong campaign of their
presidential candidate, Mr Gheorghe Funar, the mayor of Cluj, an elegant
Hasburg town, once capital of Hungarian-ruled Transylvania.
Even before the elections, Mr Funar who characterises Hungarians as
'barbaric, migratory people' had achieved national notoriety for his
anti-Hungarian stand. Since becoming mayor in February, Mr Funar has
attempted to ban public signs in Hungarian and to close down Hungarian
schools with little censure from central government even though ethnic
Hungarians make up a quarter of the city's population.
Ethnic Hungarians and Transylvania's gipsy and fast diminishing German
minorities say Mr Funar's behaviour shows that, despite the overthrow of the
tyrannical Ceausescu regime in 1989, they still do not have sufficient
rights.
Together with other supporters of the Democratic Convention the coalition of
reform minded opposition parties which lost out narrowly to the DNSF in the
parliamentary polls, they believe the election results will lead to
increased tension in the region, especially among ethnic minorities.
In March 1990 rioting between ethnic Romanians and ethnic Hungarians in
Tirgu Mures, a town east of Cluj, claimed three lives.
One immediate concern is that Mr Funar or other leading members of his
party, be given cabinet posts in return for their support of a DNSF-led
minority government.
But Transylvanians, most of whom voted for the DC or other parties favouring
a fast transition to a market economy, also fear a DNSF government will slow
down reform, alienate foreign investors and prolong the country's severe
recession raising fears of more ethnic violence.
Many Transylvanians with their strong European traditions, fear Mr Iliescu's
re-election will mean continued isolation from the west.
'Europe is dividing once again. Countries like Hungary have shown they can
break with the communist past. These elections mean Romania will be left
behind once more: Iliescu pushes us back towards the CIS,' one young doctor,
an ethnic Romanian, said.
Like many other young people, she believes the only solution for
Transylvania's ethnic tensions is a better dialogue with Hungary and
stronger links with the west.
As for rapprochement with Budapest which has repeatedly aired its concern
over Romania's treatment of its ethnic Hungarian minority, Mr Iliescu's
second term has not got off to a good start.
In the past few weeks Romania has blamed the virulence of the Hungarian
lobby in Washington for Congress's decision not to grant the country most
favoured nation status.
By externalising Romania's problems, Mr Iliescu and nationalist groups may
achieve popularity in a country struggling with the bitter legacy of the
Ceaucescu regime and a a severely under-performing economy.
But such statements are also likely to fuel nationalists in Hungary and
further radicalise ethnic Hungarians in Transylvania, deepening rifts within
Romanian society and destabilising a region already threatened by the
Yugoslav crisis.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A ROMANIAN prosecutor appealed yesterday for witnesses to come forward with
information on a mass grave containing scores of bodies being excavated in
woodland near Bucharest, Reuter reports from Bucharest.
'We have difficulties in our investigations. People are afraid to talk to
the prosecutor ..We are willing to receive any helpful information,' Mr
Adrian Vartires, the prosecutor of Bucharest said.
Mr Vartires was referring to a grave dating from the communist era at
Caciulati-Snagov, about 40 km north of the Romanian capital, where scores of
bodies, possibly victims of the communist secret police, have been
discovered. In the period from 1949 to 1951 some buildings in the area were
used as a base of the dreaded Securitate secret police.
Romania suffered one of eastern Europe's harshest communist dictatorships
from 1947 to December 1989 when Stalinist ruler Mr Nicolae Ceausescu was
deposed and shot in a bloody uprising.
Only Mr Ceausescu and a few cohorts were tried and sentenced for abuses. No
thorough official probe has been conducted by post-1989 governments into
communist atrocities, and many former senior communists remain in positions
of power.
Dr Viorel Panaitescu, manager of the Bucharest Forensic Institute, said a
first group of 28 skeletons which had been examined showed they were men and
women aged 13 to 65 when they died, 30 to 40 years ago, between 1950 and
1960.
This would have been during the 16-year rule of Romania's first communist
leader Mr Gheorghe Gheorghiu Dej, Ceausescu's predecessor, who used brutal
methods to crush all opposition.
All the bodies were buried only 40-50 cm below the surface with no trace of
coffin wood, cloth or clothes, and four of them showed evidence of having
been shot at very close range with a 7.63 mm calibre gun, he said.
'It is strange the skeletons are in such an advanced state of decay. The
moment you take them in your hand, they fall apart. It is possible that
after death some caustic substance was poured over the corpses,' Mr
Panaitescu said.
'The area being in a wood, it is hard to believe that wild animals did not
smell the bodies and try to dig them out,' he said.

SLOVAKIA'S plan to block and divert the Danube river into the Gabcikovo
power plant is causing strains within the joint campaign by Hungary, Poland
and the Czech and Slovak republics to join the European Community.
Although all sides are trying to play down the impact of the
Hungarian-Slovak row, Mr Gyorgy Granastzoi, Hungary's ambassador to the EC,
warned yesterday that any move to divert the Danube would be a 'violation'
of Hungary's borders.
Mr Granastzoi was speaking at a joint news conference by the three east
European countries which made public an 11-page memorandum to the EC aimed
at strengthening the integration of the former communist countries into the
Community.
The EC has described as 'catastrophic' the dispute between Slovakia and
Hungary. Tripartite talks under the auspices of the EC took place in
Brussels yesterday in an effort to defuse the row and allow technical
experts to consider the effects of the planned dam project on the
environment.
The EC has agreed to mediate on condition that the talks are technical
rather than political; and that Slovakia does not carry out any work on the
project which is irreversible.
The prime ministers of the three east European countries are due to meet Mr
John Major, UK prime minister, and Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission
president, in London next week to press their case for starting negotiations
on EC accession no later than in 1996.
So far the EC has reacted coolly because the huge economic disparities. A
full response to the joint memorandum is not expected until the EC summit in
Edinburgh in December.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Manfred Stolpe, the Social Democratic (SPD) prime minister of Brandenburg
state and east Germany's best-known politician, was strongly condemned at
the opening of hearings yesterday on his contacts with the former Stasi
security police.
Mr Rainer Eppelmann, a former east Berlin pastor and prominent
anti-communist dissident, told a parliamentary investigating committee in
Potsdam that Mr Stolpe had been 'objectively compromised' by his links with
the Stasi. 'Mr Stolpe's confidence in the Stasi was greater than in the
Church,' Mr Eppelmann charged. He called on the Brandenburg leader to
present long-awaited evidence which would exonerate him instead of acting
like an 'informer who is on the defensive'.
Mr Stolpe has admitted having contacts with the Stasi while serving as a
senior Protestant Church lay official. But he says the regular meetings with
Stasi officers were part of the Church's efforts to help east Germans
persecuted by the communist authorities.
Last week the Green party, a partner in Mr Stolpe's coalition government in
Potsdam, threatened to break up the coalition if he did not resign. However,
it then backed down.
Mr Eppelmann accused Mr Stolpe of breaking his Church vow to remain silent
and of disclosing intimate details to the Stasi about the former pastor's
private life. Mr Eppelmann, a Christian Democratic member of the German
parliament and head of the government commission on the history of East
Germany, said he had learned this on reading his own Stasi file.
Mr Stolpe will be questioned today over the circumstances in which he was
awarded East Germany's Order of Merit in 1978. Mr Klaus Rossberg, a former
Stasi officer who is also to testify today, said he personally handed Mr
Stolpe the medal in a clandestine Stasi residence.

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE former Italian prime minister, Mr Giulio Andreotti, came under fire
yesterday after a magistrate's report named Salvatore Lima, his right-hand
man in Sicily who was killed in March, as the Mafia's link to the political
establishment, Reuter reports from Rome.
The report also disclosed that Tommaso Buscetta, the Mafia's most famous
turncoat, has decided to talk to investigators about relations between
gangsters and politicians - a topic he had earlier refused to discuss on the
grounds it was too delicate. The report issued on Wednesday said the Mafia
murdered Lima, a former mayor of Palermo, because he stopped protecting
their interests after years of collusion.
Lima, 64, who had been a member of the European Parliament and the
uncontested leader of the Sicilian wing of the Christian Democrats loyal to
Mr Andreotti, was shot dead in his car less than a month before last April's
national elections. Mr Andreotti, who served in all post-war Italian
governments until last April, continued to defend Lima in radio and
newspaper interviews after the report was issued. 'I never found one element
to judge him (as a Mafioso) . . . but I know how much he helped us in the
fight against the Mafia in these past years,' Mr Andreotti told Italian
radio.
But Mr Andreotti came under sharp fire in the media and from some
politicians for defending Lima for years when many suspected him of Mafia
collusion. The newspaper La Repubblica ran a front-page cartoon showing Mr
Andreotti removing his face to reveal an alligator with a head shaped like
Sicily. Mr Antonino Caponnetto, the retired magistrate who founded Palermo's
anti-Mafia investigation unit in the early 1980s, criticised Mr Andreotti
for continuing to defend Lima 'in tones which seemed like a prelude to a
beatification'. 'Everybody knew except Giulio,' L'Indipendente said in an
editorial which called Lima 'the Mafia's travelling salesman'.
Mr Leoluca Orlando, a former mayor of Palermo and head of the maverick
anti-Mafia party La Rete (The Network), criticised the Christian Democrats
for sending Lima to the European parliament.
Palermo magistrates have issued 24 arrest warrants for Mafia members
suspected of ordering and carrying out Lima's killing. At least five have
been arrested.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY Euro-sceptics last night delivered a strong warning to Mr John Major
that his determination to restart the Maastricht ratification process
threatens a renewed outbreak of civil war on the Conservative back benches.
The warning came as Labour suggested that it might decide to maximise the
prime minister's difficulties by opposing the return of the legislation
before the Edinburgh EC summit in December. One member of the opposition
front-bench team suggested that the party might join with the bill's Tory
opponents to defer ratification.
As the government announced that the Commons will hold a one-day debate on
November 4 to pave the way for the return of the Maastricht bill, the
Euro-sceptics won loud support for their demands to delay the treaty at a
crowded meeting of the backbench 1922 committee.
MPs at the meeting said some supporters of the treaty also expressed doubts
about how sensible it was to press ahead with the detailed committee stage
of the bill later next months after the latest convulsions among the
government's supporters.
Members of the 1922 executive also voiced fears that the renewed debate over
Europe would break the fragile unity in the party which Mr Major managed to
restore this week with the retreat over pit closures.
Several pro-European Tories argued that Mr Major was right to get out of the
way quickly what promises to be a gruelling three or four-week Commons war
of attrition.
Earlier this week Mr Major told colleagues that he was ready to make
Maastricht an issue of confidence in his own leadership.

<TEXT>
MIRROR GROUP Newspapers is poised to announce that Mr David Montgomery,
former editor of Today newspaper, has been appointed chief executive in a
board reorganisation.
The decision, which is expected to receive formal board approval this
morning, prompted the resignation of Mr Joe Haines, an MGN non-executive
director and the Daily Mirror's former political editor. Mr Haines last
night described Mr Montgomery as 'a rightwinger who once campaigned for the
Mirror to be boycotted throughout Ireland because of the Mirror's policy
favouring a united Ireland'.
After failing to disguise their initial shock at the appointment, senior
Labour officials said they remained confident that the Mirror's traditional
support for the party would be unchanged.
The board changes, which include the appointment of a finance director and
several non-executive directors next week, had the backing of MGN's bankers
and Arthur Andersen, administrators of the collapsed private Maxwell
companies which own a majority of MGN shares. The shares, suspended on the
disappearance of Robert Maxwell, were re-listed in July this year.
Mr Montgomery will replace Mr Vic Horwood, who is expected to remain within
the group as chief executive of the Scottish Daily Record.
Mr Bernard Tominey, commercial director, has left.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Hospital closures proposal today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLOSURE of several famous London hospitals and rationalisation of many
others will be proposed in a report published by the government today.
A version of the report leaked last night by London Health Emergency, a
pressure group, identifies St Bartholomew's - London's oldest teaching
hospital, in the heart of the Square Mile - as the most famous casualty.
Other hospitals on the closure list, according to the leaked document, are
Charing Cross, Queen Charlotte's, the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear
and the Hospital for Tropical Diseases.
Two other famous teaching hospitals - Guy's and St Thomas' - would be
rationalised on a single site.
The contents of the document leaked by London Health Emergency are
consistent with the expected recommendations of Sir Bernard Tomlinson,
former chairman of the Northern regional health authority, who has conducted
a year-long government-commissioned study of London's hospital provision.
Health service union leaders reacted angrily last night to the likelihood of
the report recommending widespread closures. They estimate that up to 20,000
jobs might be at risk from the proposals.
Mr Hector MacKenzie, general secretary of Cohse, said that the Tomlinson
proposals threatened to do for the health service in London 'what the
government has tried to do for the mining industry'.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said Labour 'totally' rejected
the Tomlinson proposal to 'subject London's health care to the chaos of
market forces.'
He promised to resist 'any hospital closures' which were not proceeded by
the development of alternative facilities.
According to London Health Emergency, other recommendations will include
reducing the Middlesex and University College teaching hospitals to a
smaller unit on the UCH site, and scaling-down St Mary's teaching hospital,
Paddington.
The government will make final decisions in the new year following
consultation.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Arts: Which Witch - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here it is - the musical from Hell. Which Witch has been sent as a
punishment on all those who scoffed too harshly on poor feeble little
Bernadette two years ago. Bernadette, a martyr to muddle-headedness, at
least meant well; it was merely Dr Jekyll. But Which Witch, brash and
cynical, is Mr Hyde. Although replete with witches' sabbath, exorcism,
inquisition, torture scene and burning at the stake, it manages to be
excruciatingly dull.
The composers, the Norwegian Ingrid Bjornov and Benedicte Adrian, are the
chief perpetrators. They met in a sandbox at the age of two (no comment),
and have been hard at work on Which Witch since 1986. Albums have already
been released, concert performances have been given, and hype is busy.
In addition, Bjornov also conducts the music from the pit, and Adrian
performs the leading role.
But the music for Which Witch is not only bland, it is also ludicrously
inconsistent. It has a pop-baroque overture, a funky-rock executioner's
song, numerous operatic trimmings and pretensions (even a coloratura mad
scene), and whole fallow acres of sub-tuneful declamation that tread the
murky borderline between Les Mis. and Lloyd Webber. It even has, to
accompany a Renaissance wedding dance, a tango accompanied by rock drumming.
Which Witch fails even to tell its narrative well. Maria Vittoria,
fosterdaughter to a noble Roman house in the era of Farneses and Gonzagas,
is in love with Daniel, a priest, and her love does not fail even when she
is rejected by her adoptive family or when, after eloping with Daniel and
then losing him again to God, she is arraigned as a witch. But It is unclear
whether the big witches' scene that closes the first half is real or dreamt.
The overall pace is far too slow, the very ending much too sudden.
The words are by Kit Hesketh-Harvey (no Widow in attendance here). The line
in his programme bio which reminds us that he studied with Sondheim should
be suppressed: what did he learn? These lyrics are sheer doggerel,
alternating between cheap comedy (two girls we never see again chant
'Chastity's extremely dull, God, I want to be a bride') and plodding
exposition. Here's a typical couplet: 'We can-not af-ford to wait,' 'I'll
find you at the ci-ty gate.' And the music weights every syllable like a
tombstone.
As Maria Vittoria, Adrian looks pretty but sings - painfully flat - in the
worst kind of undernourished squeezed tones. Graham Bickley, as Daniel, has
a better voice, but not enough power. As his scheming sister, Vivien Parry
demonstrates severe problems with moving in and out of her chest register.
There are moments when you can giggle at Which Witch, but not many. It is a
just a very dreary melodrama.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Fraud to be handled by special unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England yesterday announced a reform of the way in which it
supervises banks. The reform is intended to strengthen its response to fraud
and malpractice and ensure that it uses the full range of its legal powers.
It will remove primary responsibility for the investigation of fraud from
the Bank's banking supervision division. Instead, malpractice inquiries will
be handled by a new special investigations unit.
Under the reform, backed by Lord Justice Bingham, the heads of the
investigations unit and a new legal unit will have direct access to the
Bank's governor and deputy governor. They will attend meetings of the Bank's
board of banking supervision, its supervision oversight body.
The investigations unit will be headed by Mr Ian Watt, a partner of KPMG
Peat Marwick, the accountants. Mr Peter Peddie, formerly a partner in
Freshfields, the solicitors, will head the legal unit.
Both men will rank as advisers to the governor, with seniority equivalent to
the Bank's four executive directors. They will work with Mr Brian Quinn,
executive director for banking supervision, and Mr Tony Coleby, executive
director for wholesale market supervision.
Staff in the supervision department will be required to pass on any
suspicions of fraud to the investigations unit, which will then handle any
inquiry.
The reform moves the Bank's approach to supervision closer to US regulators,
which use a corps of professional examiners to supervise banks. The unit may
employ a set of accountants and inspectors specialising in fraud.
Although Mr Watt and Mr Quinn will work together in monitoring fraud
investigations, the reform narrows the primary responsibility of the banking
supervision department to supervisory issues, and standard forms of
supervision.
The reform is in response to two criticisms in the Bingham report: that the
Bank failed to react quickly and aggressively enough to fraud at BCCI, and
that it underestimated its legal powers to deal with the bank.
Lord Bingham said the Bank's traditional techniques of supervision based on
trust, frankness and a willingness to co-operate worked well in most cases,
but 'a quite different approach' was needed in cases when trust was lacking.
The Bank has accepted that it will have to alter its approach to supervision
so that in cases where it loses trust in the managers of supervised banks or
suspects fraud, it will 'change gear' to more aggressive supervision.
The investigations unit is likely to employ some inspectors with outside
experience. It will deal with cases referred from both the banking and
wholesale markets supervision divisions.
The legal unit will take responsibility for legal advice on supervisory
issues from the Bank's solicitors. It will try to ensure that the Bank
exploits all legal routes to detect and combat fraud and malpractice.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Business sees UK economy slide into second dip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH business suffered a 'deeply disturbing' slide into a second leg of
recession last month and no quick turnround is likely, British Chambers of
Commerce said yesterday.
Presenting a grim survey of more than 8,200 companies employing 1.3m people,
Mr Christopher Stewart Smith, the organisation's president, said business
confidence was 'seriously undermined' and all UK regions were suffering
either a slowdown or decline in output.
All the main economic indicators - sales and orders, employment, investment
and confidence - fell back sharply in the third quarter, reversing a steady
improvement in the UK economy over the previous 12 months.
Mr Stewart Smith warned that the outlook for employment was particularly
grim. Fewer than one in five companies was operating at full capacity last
month and a big majority of large manufacturing and service companies
planned to shed labour in the current quarter.
Underlining the gloomy outlook, Ford said yesterday it would extend
short-time working at Dagenham, its biggest British factory, by switching to
a 2 1/2 day week for most of November because of continued weak vehicle
sales.
Mr Stewart Smith said: 'Overall, we have seen a worsening of the external
economic environment with depressed home and export markets, interest and
exchange rate shocks, as well as economic and political instability. These
are not the conditions for recovery.'
He called on the government to restore business confidence through
infrastructure investment, deregulation and export promotion. But he warned
against a 'dash for growth'.
Stimulating consumer demand in the short term should not be the first
priority, he said. Further cuts in interest rates from the current 8 per
cent level were not necessary and could have a the short term should not be
the first priority, he said. Further cuts in interest rates were not
necessary and could have a counter-productive effect on the value of
sterling, pushing up import prices.
The government should focus on stimulating exports and business confidence,
he said.
Britain recorded its third successive visible trade deficit of more than
Pounds 1bn last month.
The deficit narrowed slightly compared with August but the Central
Statistical Office gave a warning that the impact of higher import prices
following sterling's devaluation had yet to be felt fully. Even so, import
prices rose by almost 1 per cent, the sharpest monthly increase for two
years.
A 2 per cent drop in the value of exports last month was outstripped by a
2.7 per cent fall in imports which left the visible trade deficit at Pounds
1.06bn compared with Pounds 1.15bn in August. The Treasury blamed the drop
in exports on sluggish world economic conditions.
The visible trade deficit grew to Pounds 3.34bn in the third quarter from
Pounds 3.19bn in the second. The current account deficit, which reflects
trade in services and certain transfer payments as well as trade in goods,
increased to Pounds 3.04bn from Pounds 2.85bn.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Trade war with EC nears as US threatens Dollars 1bn
sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOP US officials met at the White House last night to consider imposing
penal tariffs on Dollars 1bn (Pounds 625m) of European Community food
exports annually following the breakdown on Wednesday of talks in Brussels
aimed at settling a two-year farm trade dispute.
A decision to impose sanctions could trigger a tit-for-tat trade subsidy war
between the US and the EC. It could also jeopardise six years of
multilateral negotiations under the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade aimed at liberalising world trade.
A senior US administration official said the meeting, chaired by President
George Bush, was considering retaliation in the oilseeds dispute. 'There is
a feeling that we have been stymied,' the official said.
Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, said in Brussels last night
that the result of the Washington meeting would determine the fate of the
Gatt round. 'This has to be wrapped up within hours,' he said.
He was due to speak to Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, before the
meeting, in the hope of relaunching efforts to secure a deal and staving off
the US retaliation package.
Mr MacSharry said the EC would 'have no alternative but to
counter-retaliate' if Washington introduced its punitive tariffs. 'The trade
war will be on,' he added. 'It's easy to start one, but it will be very
difficult to stop it. I don't want one. Nobody should want one.
Co-operation, consultation and negotiation is what we should be doing.' He
said he and his colleagues were waiting for the US to resume the
negotiations.
According to senior European Commission officials, Mr MacSharry intended to
clarify with Mr Madigan what is the EC's 'bottom line'.
News that the talks had broken down on Wednesday night between Mr Joe
O'Mara, a senior US farm trade negotiator, and Mr Guy Legras, his EC
counterpart, drew conflicting responses from EC capitals and Washington.
Even as Mr O'Mara was flying back to Washington, having walked out of talks
in which the US claims the EC backtracked on issues thought to have been
settled just a week ago, EC officials contradicted reports that negotiations
had broken down.
Leaders in other capitals were less sanguine. 'In view of the very
substantial progress achieved in recent days, the German government would
consider it irresponsible if the negotiations broke down,' said Mr Jurgen
Mollemann, Germany's economics minister. 'We expect the EC Commission to do
everything to achieve a result in the negotiations.' Mr Mollemann said a
failure of the talks would be economically dangerous.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, rejected a French assertion that
a conclusion to talks on Gatt might now be several months away whatever the
result of next month's US presidential election.
Responding to comments by Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, Mr
Major said: 'I could not disagree more strongly with that view.'

FT  23 OCT 92 / Bank censured over BCCI: Bingham report criticises
supervision of corrupt banking group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England's supervision of Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, the corrupt banking group, was censured yesterday in a report
commissioned jointly by the Bank and the government.
The report, by Lord Justice Bingham, said the Bank failed to take
appropriate action after receiving a series of warnings over many years that
fraud was taking place at BCCI. It was also critical of Price Waterhouse,
BCCI's auditor, for failing to brief the Bank fully about the extent of the
fraud it had uncovered at BCCI in early 1991.
BCCI was closed down in July 1991 after the Bank received a report from
Price Waterhouse, listing frauds carried out by the bank involving many
billions of pounds.
Abu Dhabi, the Gulf state which had a majority shareholding in BCCI, also
came under attack for failing to pass on to Price Waterhouse and the Bank of
England information it received in the spring of 1990 on the scale of the
BCCI fraud.
Further criticisms were that the Bank misunderstood its legal responsibility
to monitor BCCI's activities closely from as early as 1979 and that
subsequently it missed a series of valuable opportunities to take greater
responsibility for supervising BCCI's operations.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said yesterday the Bank 'was slow to
impose on BCCI an appropriate supervisory regime and . . . that the Bank
continued for too long to rely on the Luxembourg authorities to play the
leading (regulatory) role'.
He proposed, however, only modest reforms of the UK banking supervisory
system, which Lord Bingham concludes has generally worked well in preventing
fraud and financial difficulties at other banks.
The Bank is creating a special investigations unit to pursue any indications
of fraud or malpractice at banks. Separately, a legal unit is being
established to advise the Bank on its responsibilities and rights under the
Banking Act, after a series of misjudgments in the Bank's relationship with
BCCI.
In addition, the UK Banking Act, which gives the Bank its supervisory
powers, is being amended to give the Bank an explicit power to close down
the UK operations of any international bank if it feels the overseas
operations of that bank are not being supervised properly.
A separate amendment will introduce a duty on any bank's auditors to pass
information on suspected fraud at that bank to the Bank of England. A
similar duty will be given to auditors of building societies and insurance
companies to report suspected fraud to their regulators.
The Bank and the Treasury do not believe Bank officials should resign in the
wake of the report. 'The Bank made mistakes over so many years, it hardly
seems fair to blame officials currently at the bank rather than those who
have now retired,' said one government official.
In the House of Commons, the Bingham report provoked fresh calls from Labour
MPs for Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton to resign as governor of the Bank of
England and for additional government help for BCCI victims.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said ministers - including Mr John Major
who was chancellor before becoming prime minister - should accept
responsibility. The Treasury 'knew full well that there was a problem', he
claimed.
But Mr Lamont said Mr Brown's attack was 'absolutely disgraceful' and cited
Lord Bingham's conclusion that, 'the conduct of Treasury officials and
ministers is not in my view open to criticism in any respect'. Later he said
he had 'every confidence' in the Bank governor.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton said he was conscious of the acute distress the fraud
caused innocent depositors but its scale was unique and was concealed from
auditors for many years.
But several Conservatives, including Mr John Watts, chairman of the Commons'
Treasury select committee, signalled anxiety that proposals for tightening
supervision should be carried through speedily. The committee has called Mr
Leigh-Pemberton to give evidence next month.
Rejecting calls for extra compensation to BCCI depositors in the UK, Mr
Lamont said the existing depositor protection scheme had already paid out
Pounds 50m to about 9,000 people and the total could reach Pounds 85m. Under
the deposit protection scheme, depositors in a failed bank receive 75 per
cent of their deposits up to a maximum payment of Pounds 15,000. Attempts
would be made to speed up payments to depositors under the protection
scheme.
The Bingham report's criticism of Abu Dhabi stems from an incident in the
spring of 1990, when Abu Dhabi's royal family was told by Mr Swaleh Naqvi,
then BCCI's chief executive, that he had conspired in the misappropriation
of Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.34bn) of the royal family's funds from a BCCI
offshoot.
Price Waterhouse and the Bank did not learn of this misuse of the royal
family's money for nine months. Lord Bingham says: 'There was no reason for
not passing on the effect' of what Mr Naqvi had admitted.
Price Waterhouse was said to have missed opportunities in early 1990 to give
the Bank of England a detailed picture of the BCCI fraud. Lord Bingham said
this was regrettable.
His strongest criticism was reserved for the Bank of England. He said it
should have investigated two separate allegations of wrongdoing at BCCI in
early 1988 and was negligent in not investigating separate allegations made
in November 1988.
The Bank was also wrong not to get more involved in attempts to rescue BCCI
from collapse in 1990, he said. It was wrong in early 1991 to focus on the
financial implications of reports it was receiving from Price Waterhouse
rather than the implication that there was serious fraud at BCCI.
Not only did Bank officials fail to understand the implications of what they
were told by Price Waterhouse in 1991, they were wrong in not communicating
all they knew to the Bank's governor and board of banking supervision, which
reviews the work of the supervisory department.

FT  23 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Fisons up on broker sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHARMACEUTICALS group Fisons bucked the dreary performance in the sector as
one of the stock's principal bears changed tack. The shares jumped to 238p
at one stage and closed 9 higher at 224p on heavy turnover of 6.9m.
The stock received a boost at first as a result of heavy buying in the
traded options market. Then, investment bank BZW, which has fought shy of
Fisons for around five years, came out with a more positive story after a
meeting with chief executive Mr Cedric Scroggs. BZW said that it had not
officially changed forecasts or recommendations but had been discussing a
'qualitative story' with clients. Others in the market said Mr Scroggs had
been enthusiastic about the potential for two products still awaiting US
approval and had persuaded BZW to increase its profit forecast from the
current Pounds 140m. It is also expected that the house will upgrade its
present 'hold' recommendation.
Recs retreat
The regional electricity companies (Recs) retreated in busy trading as one
broker cut its dividend growth forecast and others hinted they may follow.
Shares in Southern, the only Rec in the FTSE 100, fell 15 to 376p on heavy
turnover of 2.7m. Kleinwort Benson said that lower inflation meant that the
Recs' level of dividend increase could not be sustained and that this year's
13 per cent forecast rise was likely to be only 10 per cent.
However, other electricity stock watchers added that political
considerations would also overhang the rate of dividend increase, with the
Recs being put under pressure to rein in the rise until the controversy over
pit closures blows over. Ms Rachel Lucas at County NatWest said: 'While the
political climate will make the Recs careful at the November interims, I
think the full-year dividend rate of increase will show no decline.'
There was also additional pressure on the Recs yesterday as some in the
market considered them overvalued, with a switch into the water stocks being
recommended. Eastern fell 14 to 366p, London 18 to 393p, Midlands 20 to 403p
and Yorkshire 20 to 433p.
Royals speculation
Troubled Royal Insurance was the focus of strong speculation early
yesterday. Turnover expanded as a takeover rumours swept the market and one
broker prepared a buy recommendation. The shares jumped 12 and the
possibility of a bid was enough to drive the shares higher, leaving a number
of traders short of stock across the board.
Once its effect had been felt, the rumour, which featured German insurer
Allianz, died away. However, some analysts also argued that mortgage
indemnity problems, which affect Royal particularly badly, were likely to
lessen as a result of much lower base rates.
Then Credit Lyonnais Laing put out a hefty buy note, arguing that despite
the very real problems of mortgage indemnity the shares were undervalued.
Royal shares closed a net 7 higher at 216p with 8.5m traded, the heaviest
turnover since the group passed its final dividend in February.
High street drugs group Boots tumbled after one leading house recommended
profit-taking amid a general sentiment in the market that the stock had
overrun. The shares closed 14 adrift at 479p in heavy turnover of 2.7m.
County NatWest believes that recent optimism surrounding the group may have
been overdone. It cites falling drug margins and dull high street sales in
Boots' competitors as evidence to impinge on what it expects to be otherwise
'excellent interim results next month'.
Exploration and production group Lasmo saw heavy turnover in the underlying
shares and traded options as one analyst pointed to a 'lemming-like rush for
stock'. Investors were worried about being caught out by the
currency-related rise in E&amp;P stocks but preferred Lasmo to Enterprise
because of the overhang of stock created by the latter's recent US share
issue. Lasmo gained 3 to 191p, making a gain of 26 this week, on turnover of
6.9m shares. Enterprise lifted 7 to 439p.
Turnover in Lucas Industries jumped to 14m after Hoare Govett was said to
have placed around 1 per cent of the company's shares.
In a mid-morning deal, the stockbroker was thought to have bought a block of
7m at 104p, and quickly passed it on at 105p, though the original seller
remained unknown. The shares closed a penny lower at 105p, having touched
110 earlier in the session.
The automotive and aerospace components group remains the subject of bid
speculation with international conglomerate BTR put forward as a potential
predator.
There was another day's hectic activity in the building and property sectors
as institutions continued to shop around in the hope of climbing aboard for
the long-awaited recovery. However, analysts continued to caution against
any sustained rise on the back of this week's government pronouncements. The
building materials sector was enlivened with talk of a bid for Blue Circle,
the shares jumping 7 to 153p in good turnover of 4.7m. Dealers said that
packaging group Carnaud Metalbox, off 5 at 2045p, was the rumoured predator.
Among housebuilders, second-liners were in demand. Berkeley Group rose 11 to
240p, Bryant 6 to 90p and Laing 12 to 190p. Costain Group was steady at 25p
with 16m traded, the highest of the day.
Property group Land Securities ran into a bout of selling, the shares
slipping 11 to 421p. Analysts said Wednesday's rise had been overdone and
worries over the group's dividend returned. Instead investors turned their
attention to MEPC, up 15 to 323p and again to the second-line stocks.
Bank stocks were very firm in active trading as most houses reassessed their
value. Lloyds, the quality play, lifted 10 to 434p and troubled Barclays
also lifted 10 to 334p with 15m traded. Abbey National, the most highly
geared to an upturn in the housing market, lifted 5 to 331p with 11m shares
traded.
The principal pharmaceutical stocks were weak as US interest died away and a
few stories provided an excuse to sell. Some analysts talked of a US press
article which pointed out the disparity between drug prices in the US and
Canada; there is a feeling that if Mr Bill Clinton is elected president he
will clamp down on US pharmaceutical prices. There was also reasonable
selling of Glaxo American Depositary Receipts in the UK. This was followed
by reports of a negative press story on Glaxo's asthma product Serevent.
Glaxo fell 19 to 776p.
A maintained dividend by Albert Fisher sent the shares forward in early
trading. But a cautious meeting with analysts pulled the shares back and
they closed 1 1/2 off at 40 1/2 p. Turnover was a very heavy 12.5m.
Profit-taking advice from Hoare Govett and Panmure Gordon was said to have
held Unilever back, the shares dropping 17 to 1077p.
Shares in international conglomerate BTR fell 7 to 497p early in the day
after broker County NatWest advised a switch out of the stock and into
Hanson. In a note set to land on investors' desks today, County said: 'For
many years Hanson and BTR were given similar multiples. However, Hanson now
trades at a substantial discount to BTR. We belive that the differential
between the two is no longer justified.'
The strong market trend later helped BTR recover some of the lost ground and
it closed a penny easier at 503p on trade of 5.5m shares, while Hanson
gained 2 to 232p, with some 8.6m shares dealt by the close.
The market was cheered by GKN's north American expansion plans and the
shares jumped 18 to 414p.
Chemicals group BOC fell 10 to 730p as Hoare Govett moved from a buy to a
hold.

FT  23 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Institutions switch into second
liners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
LONDON'S equity market staged another strong upward push on the back of the
government's new 'growth and recovery' policy, but was showing distinct
signs of running out of steam towards the close of trading.
Nevertheless, the Footsie still managed to post a 12.4-point rise to
2,658.1, a gain of 99.1, or almost 4 per cent, over the past five trading
sessions, amid hopes of more interest rate cuts in the near future.
The session began on a cautious note with a gloomy review of the UK economy
during the third quarter from the British Chambers of Commerce, which
confirmed recent official statistics detailing the deepening economic
recession.
But the opening trend which showed the Footsie 100 down almost three points
within minutes of the market opening was quickly reversed when the Footsie
future attracted a flurry of exceptional buying interest and moved to a near
50-point premium over the cash market.
Demand for leading shares, partly triggered by stock index arbitraging and a
big short position in the market, reached a peak around midday when the
Footsie was up over 36 points. Enthusiasm was not disturbed by the September
trade figures, which disclosed a current account deficit of Pounds 963m,
against a general consensus forecast of Pounds 1.15bn.
Markets were additionally underpinned by the solid performance of sterling
against the dollar and the D-Mark, after the government gained a comfortable
victory in the Commons on the debate over the mining industry.
The afternoon session in the stock market, however, saw the emergence of
intermittent bouts of profit-taking, prompted by a rather ragged early
performance on Wall Street, and a downturn in the Footsie future premium
over cash which came off to around 31 at the close.
Dealers said there was a significant shift in the pattern of buying interest
in the equity market yesterday. Having bought the leading stocks
aggressively this week, the big institutions switched their attention to the
second-line stocks.
This suggestion was vindicated by official turnover figures which showed
Footsie volume of 314.9m shares and non-Footsie volume of 412.9m shares. And
further proof of the move into the second-line stocks came from the
performance of the Footsie Mid 250 index which easily outperformed the
Footsie 100 in jumping 30.4 to 2,494.6. The all-encompassing Footsie 350
rose 7.9 to 1,278.7.
Overall turnover in the market totalled 727.9m shares, a figure expected to
see customer, or retail business continue above the Pounds 1bn mark. The
value of Wednesday's retail business surged to over Pounds 1.5bn, continuing
the upturn in activity that followed the recent cut in UK interest rates and
the Government's 'dash for growth' policy shift.
There was heartening news for the market's smaller companies as Smith New
Court said it would start marketmaking in a further 44 smaller company
stocks this morning. The stocks would otherwise have been relegated to the
Stock Exchange Bulletin Board, after being dropped by other marketmakers.

<TEXT>
THE STRENGTH of sterling gave an initial boost to stock index futures,
sending the contract sharply forward before a strong bout of profit-taking
caused a retreat, writes Joel Kibazo.
Demand for the December contract on the FTSE, which began trading at 2,691,
was seen early in the session sending it gently forward. But continued hopes
of a cut in UK base rates, the recovery of sterling and a general lack of
sellers led to a squeeze mid-morning when the contract powered ahead
reaching the day's high of 2,729 just before lunch.
In the afternoon, an initial bout of profit-taking gathered pace after the
early lacklustre performance on Wall Street and December hit the day's low
point of 2,634 half an hour before the official close.
December finished at 2,690, down 6 on Wednesday's close and around 7 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 23. Turnover was a
more modest 8,154 contracts. A premium of between 15 and 30 was seen
throughout the session.
Volume in traded options was once again healthy, reaching 37,059 contracts.
A total of 13,850 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option, though a mere 416
lots were traded in the Euro FT-SE option.
In stock options, Lasmo was the day's best performer, recording a total of
1,889 trades with the February 260 calls the busiest series.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Bingham Report - Investigation into the BCCI scandal: How
the years of fraud unfolded
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
1972: Agha Hasan Abedi founds Bank of Credit and Commerce International to
realise his dream of creating a world-class bank serving Third World
interests. BCCI, registered in Luxembourg, begins with capital of Dollars
2.5m supplied by Bank of America and Arab stockholders, including Sheikh
Zayed of Abu Dhabi. Customers include Gulf Shipping Lines run by Gokal
family.
1973: BCCI opens branches in four Gulf states and in mainly Asian-immigrant
areas of UK.
1974: Further branches open in London, focusing on rich Arab clientele.
1975: Registered in Cayman Islands.
1976: BCCI moves central offices to London. Branches in UK rise to double
figures, with plans for further expansion announced. But early signs of
trouble: New York regulators turn down BCCI's attempt to buy Chelsea
National Bank because of its uncertain status. Bank of America internal
memo expresses concern over
general lack of control of BCCI's activities.
1977: Abedi touts BCCI as world's fastest-growing bank. Total assets have
grown to Dollars 2.2bn, and branches number 146 in 32 countries - including
45 in the UK. Abedi persists with plans to expand in the US, and enlists
help of Bert Lance, Jimmy Carter's former budget director.
1978: Bank of America becomes uneasy about BCCI's loan portfolio and decides
to wind down its involvement. BCCI embarks on plan to buy US banks by
stealth and acquires shares in Washington-based Financial General Bancshares
(FGB). Clark Clifford, former US defence secretary, becomes BCCI US adviser.
Gulf Shipping accounts in difficulty.
1979: Ernst &amp; Young expresses concern about BCCI using two auditors (the
other being Price Waterhouse).
1980: BCCI opens in Panama. Gulf Shipping accounts now so badly in default
that BCCI starts plundering other accounts to conceal losses. BCCI's
nominees finally acquire control of FGB after long battle.
1981: Manuel Noriega opens an account with the bank.
1982: Abu Nidal terrorist organisation begins to channel funds through BCCI.
Bank of England official Brian Gent says the Bank is the logical supervisor
of BCCI.
1983: Ricardo Bilonick of Medelln drugs cartel opens account with BCCI.
1984: Swaleh Naqvi, Abedi's deputy, visits Latin America and identifies it
as market for growth.
1985: Luxembourg bank supervisor tries unsuccessfully to get Bank of England
to assume full responsibility for BCCI. Bank of England receives anonymous
letter detailing fraud at BCCI. BCCI's treasury department loses huge sum of
money in irregular transactions and plunders other accounts to cover up.
BCCI buys a bank in Colombia to tap Latin American market.
1986: Abedi takes Dollars 150m out of the staff fund to plug hole in balance
sheet. Treasury moved to Abu Dhabi.
1987: Bank supervisors from eight countries form a college to oversee BCCI.
US Senate subcommittee led by Senator Kerry investigates BCCI's connections
with Noriega. Price Waterhouse appointed as single auditor.
1988: Eleven BCCI employees charged with money laundering. BCCI helps
Noriega spirit his money out of the US. Abedi has heart attack and heart
transplant. Naqvi takes over management. Bank of England receives two
indications, one from City of London Fraud Squad and the other from a Middle
East accountant, of fraud
at BCCI, but follows up neither of
them.
1989: Price Waterhouse begins to uncover loan problems, including large
loans to the US nominees and other insiders. Naqvi says they will be dealt
with, but no action is taken, and he becomes evasive. Noriega toppled by US
invasion. BCCI agrees to forfeit Dollars 15.3m after being found guilty of
money laundering.
1990:
Spring: Price Waterhouse uncovers 'false or deceitful' transactions. Loan
problems worsening rapidly. Naqvi goes on desperate mission to Abu Dhabi to
obtain financial help. Admits there have been heavy losses. Regulators
approve a Dollars 1bn bail-out by Abu Dhabi to save BCCI from what they
consider to be the graver threat of collapse. Price Waterhouse signs off
1989 accounts with footnote about the bail-out.
May: Control of BCCI moves to Abu Dhabi. BCCI restructured, hundreds of
employees laid off and dozens of branches closed. Abu Dhabi starts its own
investigation into BCCI.
October: Naqvi and Abedi resign. Price Waterhouse finds evidence that Abu
Dhabi representatives have been authorising more dubious loans. Need for
further Dollars 1.5bn bail-out apparent.
November: Florida court sentences BCCI employees to between seven and 12
years in jail for money laundering. Price Waterhouse uncovers Naqvi's
private files detailing much of the fraud.
December: Investigations turn up Dollars 600m of unrecorded deposits.
1991:
January: Bank of England, told of latest findings, is reluctant to call a
formal investigation for fear of jeopardising new Abu Dhabi bail-out plan.
In US, banking and prosecution authorities prepare to take action.
March: Bank of England orders report from Price Waterhouse under Section 41
of the Banking Act, but continues to press Abu Dhabi to complete rescue
plan.
June: Price Waterhouse delivers Section 41 report detailing 'probably one of
the most complex deceptions in banking history'. Top Bank of England
officials 'devastated'. Regulators decide to shut BCCI.
July 5: Shutdown of BCCI worldwide.
July 19: UK government announces inquiry into BCCI affair.
July 29: US grand jury indictment alleging worldwide scheme to defraud
spanning 20 years. Charges levelled against Abedi, Naqvi, and five corporate
entities within BCCI group.
September 5: US grand jury indicts six BCCI officials, on charges of
laundering drug money. Syed Ali Akbar, former head of BCCI's treasury
department, arrested in France.

secretly taking over a California bank and fraudulent dealings in the shares
of a Florida-based bank.
December: BCCI liquidators in US agree to plead guilty on BCCI's behalf to
fraud, racketeering, and money laundering. Dollars 550m of BCCI's US assets
are forfeited as part of settlement.

March 12: Touche Ross issues writ claiming damages against Price Waterhouse
and Ernst &amp; Young.
June 12: UK High Court sanctions Dollars 1.7bn compensation settlement for
creditors negotiated with Abu Dhabi.

alleging 'sophisticated and corrupt criminal enterprise' that bribed and
cheated its way across the world to gain power and money.
October 1: Four-year US Senate sub-committee investigation into BCCI by
Senator Kerry concludes by accusing Bank of England of 'wholly inadequate'
regulation of BCCI.
October 22: Bingham Report says Bank of England 'not up to the task' of
supervising BCCI.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Bingham Report - Investigation into the BCCI scandal: BCCI
problems not spotted early enough . . . . officials in the dark as debacle
developed - Bingham warns against the case being viewed in isolation,
pointing out the large workload of supervisors trying to halt the frauds.
Richard Waters studies the main points of the report

<TEXT>
'THE history of BCCI's supervision by all the UK authorities is a long
story, extending over 19 years. It is also a complex story, involving a
number of different authorities and parties in the UK and abroad. And it is
a very dense story, because the supervisory attention paid to BCCI over the
years was very great. It is not a story which readily lends itself to simple
and categorical judgments.'
Lord Justice Bingham's introduction to his own report into the BCCI collapse
may warn against jumping to simple conclusions, but the overall conclusions
seem clear: the Bank of England failed to take serious note of the BCCI
problem early enough, and senior officials were often kept in the dark on
the debacle that was developing.
The report also warns against viewing the BCCI case in isolation. 'The
supervisory problems which BCCI presented were tackled by busy men and
women, often over- stretched and with other problems competing for their
attention. Reading the story of BCCI alone may give a misleading impression
that these events occurred in isolation. Of course they did not: they were
to the supervisors part of an often very considerable workload . . . The
systematic frauds now thought to have been practised in BCCI were on a scale
which had never been known before.'
1972-79
There was little reason to resist BCCI's arrival in London in 1972.
'Abedi himself appeared to be an experienced and successful banker . . . It
would not have been consistent with the City's role as a dynamic financial
centre to have resisted entry by this apparently promising newcomer.' The
backing of Bank of America, which owned 25 per cent of the new bank, was
also seen as a strong comfort. However, constant - though unsubstantiated -
rumours about the bank's probity and its unusual structure led in time to a
proposal to incorporate the bank in the UK. It was only then - in 1978 -
that the Bank discovered the worrying news that Bank of America was planning
to pull out of BCCI. 'It revealed its intention, over a period, to withdraw
from BCCI,' says the report. 'The reasons it gave were commercial, and it
was at pains to disavow concern about BCCI's business as a cause. But the
loss of this prestigious backer significantly undermined the Bank's
confidence in BCCI, and Abedi's failure to reveal this important development
. . . confirmed the Bank in its suspicion that he was a man whose frankness
could not be relied on.'
Under the 1979 Banking Act, the Bank was faced for the first time with the
need to licence BCCI in the UK. It was aware of several adverse factors.
'The ownership of the group was not clear. The largest bloc of shares was
owned by a Cayman company, ICIC Overseas, owned by another Cayman company,
ICIC Holdings. But despite considerable probing by the Bank, satisfactory
details of the ownership of ICIC Holdings were never forthcoming. It was
suspected that BCCI was financing the purchase of a considerable tranche of
its own shares.'
Other factors included:
'The general balance of market opinion, at home and abroad, was adverse,
ranging from wariness of the unknown through unease to outright (but
unsubstantiated) hostility.'
'The group was dominated by and excessively dependent upon the personality
and skills of a single man, Abedi. He could not be trusted to disclose
unwelcome news to the Bank or any other supervisor.'
'The group's operations were characterised by ostentatious expenditure and
lavish entertainment.'
A further consideration, says Bingham, was whether the bank should have been
regarded as having its main centre of activities in the UK - a question the
Bank never addressed. 'In my view the evidence is clear that London was by
1979-80, if not much earlier, the effective head office of . . . the group.'
The Bank did not face these questions, and therefore did not consider it
necessary to consider granting the bank a licence. That, says the report,
could have been a crucial moment in the bank's history. 'Refusal of a
licence would, in all probability, have caused loss to depositors and other
creditors and exposed the Bank to accusations of racial prejudice,
xenophobia and so on. In the real world such considerations are bound to
intrude. But in the real world the choice did not lie simply between the
grant and refusal of a licence.
'Had Abedi been denied the use of a banking name, as he should have been, it
would have been a bitter blow and would have been a strong additional
inducement to do all in his power to meet the Bank's supervisory
requirements with a view to obtaining recognition, if not at once, at least
in the foreseeable future.'
1980-88
By 1982, Mr Brian Gent, a deputy head of banking supervision, had come to
the conclusion that the only way to supervise BCCI properly would be to
force it to incorporate in the UK and regulate the whole group from there.
'The thrust of his argument was that no supervisory authority other than the
Bank could reasonably be expected to take on the supervision of BCCI and
that the Bank should do so, rather than let a large international group
continue in business on a largely unsupervised basis.'
However, by the time this plan had been developed and put to BCCI in 1984,
it was quickly squashed. 'Abedi, usually compliant (at least overtly) and
ingratiating, was on this occasion truculent and angry. The Bank's
initiative, under consideration for nearly two years, thus fell at the first
fence.
'It is true that there were no grounds for fearing imminent catastrophe.
There were, indeed, no substantiated grounds for immediate apprehension. But
it was appreciated that no one had a clear overall view of the group's
operations. There was concern about what might be happening out of sight. If
a sail has to be changed, it is better to change it before, not after, a
storm has blown up. It is unfortunate that this promising initiative was so
quickly snuffed out.' The Bank's failure to take a stronger line with Mr
Abedi prompts some concern. 'Given the potential importance of the end in
view, I find it surprising that no effort was made to bring the Bank's
traditional authority to bear on Abedi to seek to secure his compliance. . .
. But as matters appeared at the time, the Bank was, I think, rather easily
deterred.'
By 1985, however, the Bank no longer favoured the idea of supervising the
whole of BCCI. 'I find it harder to understand why consolidated supervision
by the Bank, endorsed at the highest levels of the Bank not so long before,
was now so firmly rejected. The answer is perhaps to be found in Johnson
Matthey Bankers. In the aftermath of that episode substantial additional
demands were made on the Bank's supervisory resources and the Bank may well
have been wary of undertaking new and risky assignments which, if the worst
happened, would expose it to renewed criticism.'
Concerns were quick to resurface. Late in 1985, Price Waterhouse was brought
in to investigate large losses in BCCI's treasury division. It identified
losses of Dollars 285m.
The UK authorities' reaction: encourage BCCI to move its treasury operations
to the Gulf region. 'The central treasury losses also caused the Bank to
back away from the scheme for local incorporation. That was an
understandable decision, but I think a questionable one. It was
understandable because the central treasury losses episode underlined the
difficulty of supervising BCCI and reinforced the Bank's distrust of the
management's willingness to disclose bad news. It was questionable, because
supervision is not a reward for good behaviour but a safeguard against bad,
and this episode should have strengthened the Bank's existing view that
closer and better supervision was called for.'
Shifting problems overseas was not 'an adequate supervisory response', says
Lord Justice Bingham. 'The place for a refractory pupil is in the front row,
not in a dark corner at the back. The central treasury's recent history did
not suggest that supervision was unnecessary.'
In the following year, Luxembourg made a direct appeal to Mr Leigh-Pemberton
for the Bank to take over worldwide supervision of BCCI. He declined. 'The
clear balance of opinion in the Bank, particularly among the most senior
supervisors, was strongly against the Bank undertaking this responsibility.
The view was put that it was Luxembourg's problem and Luxembourg had to
solve it. That was only partly true. Certainly Luxembourg had a problem,
because (BCCI) was registered and licensed there . . . But it was also the
Bank's problem because BCCI's effective base (apart from the central
treasury) was in the UK, it was widely perceived as a British bank and UK
depositors stood to lose much more than those of Luxembourg if things went
wrong.'
The Bank's reservations about taking on the job were understandable, though.
'Had the Bank accepted the burden of supervising the worldwide operations of
a BCCI incorporated and based in the UK, its task would indeed have been
formidable. The group traded in over 70 countries, in many of which
supervision was weak or non-existent. In the absence of trust, a more
intrusive style of supervision than the Bank ordinarily practised would have
been needed. The cost would have been great. The demands on trained
super-visory personnel would have been very difficult to meet. But this was
by far the most hopeful solution, possibly the only hopeful solution.'
By 1987, another idea was proposed by the Luxembourg authorities: a network
of locally incorporated subsidiaries around the world. Mr Rodney Galpin,
then in charge of banking supervision, resisted this idea, concerned that
'supervision of a UK subsidiary was likely to lead the Bank into the role of
lead supervisor which it sought to avoid.' Also: 'The Bank doubted whether
it could be satisfied (as required before an institution could be authorised
under the 1987 Act) that it would be run prudently and with integrity,
although the Bank could continue to rely on (the Luxemburg regulators')
assurances in respect of SA. He offered the Bank's co-operation by
intensifying its supervision of UK branches of SA, sharing information and
discussing changes in the central role of London in the group.'
This response, says the report, was inadquate. 'Even allowing for the fact
that Jaans (the head of banking superivsion in Luxembourg) and Galpin were
engaged, however politely, in a negotiation, I find Galpin's reply
disappointing. There is no doubt of the Bank's intense desire at this time
to avoid being drawn into a leading supervisory role. But that risk very
largely arose because of the leading position occupied by the UK in the
group, however unwelcome that position might be (and was). The commercial
realities would not be changed by pretending they did not exist.'
Eventually, banking regulators agreed to set up a 'college' arrangement in
which they would co-operate to oversee BCCI. 'The college was seen by the
supervisors and PW (Price Waterhouse) as an advance on the clearly
unsatisfactory supervisory regime then in force,' says Bingham. 'But it was
a second-best solution. No one thought it likely to be as effective as a
single, efficient consolidated supervisor, and the establishment of the
college did not of itself do anything to tackle the root of the problem,
which lay in the structure of the group.'
By 1988, accusations of fraud were becoming stronger: the City of London
Fraud Squad was investigating an aspect of the bank, and diplomatic sources
passed on concern reported by a chartered accountant working in the Gulf.
Although both were 'serious and specific,' there was no follow-up.
'In view of the critical opinions widely held about BCCI and the
considerable detail which the police supplied, I find it hard to understand
the Bank's apparent lack of interest in establishing the truth. In the
second case, the incident occurred outside the UK and had nothing to do with
the UK branches of . . . the group. But it appeared to have a direct bearing
on the ownership of the group and the integrity of its management. It may be
that the Bank discounted the reliability of this report because of other
suggestions it contained. If so, I think, its source justified more serious
treatment, and it is indisputable that follow-up was possible. In this
instance also I find it hard to understand how any supervisory official
could think it right to leave such allegations unexplored.'
Abedi
'On 9 February 1988, while in Pakistan, Abedi had a heart attack. Two weeks
later he suffered a second, more serious attack. A heart specialist flew out
to examine him and diagnosed serious damage. Shortly afterwards he was flown
to the UK and a heart transplant operation was performed at Harefield
Hospital on 9 March 1988. After a long stay in hospital he was followed up
as an out-patient until December 1990. 'With the consent of Mrs Abedi the
inquiry obtained a report from Abedi's UK surgeons. This disclosed severe
neurological damage sustained before the operation. Although this report was
based on an examination about a year earlier, the surgeons did not expect
major improvement and their report is consistent with accounts given by
those who have seen him recently.'
Lord Justice Bingham's views on the founder and guiding light of BCCI cast
him in a more generous light than some other commentators have, principally
for his ambition of opening a bank to benefit the developing world. 'There
was nobility in this ideal which, by his ambition, energy and flair, he did
much to realise. The vices which brought BCCI down should not obscure the
virtues which it showed in some places and which, perhaps, inspired its
creation.'
'While my impressions of Abedi are inevitably second-hand, I have had the
opportunity of speaking to many who knew him well and had dealings with him.
He remains something of an enigma,' says Bingham. 'His hold over the staff,
particularly the Pakistani staff, of BCCI was almost mesmeric, and he very
favourably impressed a number of seasoned politicians. But there were others
who recoiled. His oft-expounded and much-publicised semi-mystical
philosophy, seen by many in BCCI as an inspiration, was viewed by others as
tedious rubbish. While preaching the need for humility, he was thought by
some who knew him well to be a man of overweening arrogance and considerable
personal vanity. He combined his advocacy of the poor and oppressed with a
personal life of flamboyant opulence and a driving ambition for power. If he
is to be given credit for his ideals, he is to be debited with an inordinate
endowment of low cunning, manifested in many ways and not least in his
assiduous cultivation of those who by virtue of their wealth or position
could be used to his advantage.'
The conviction of BCCI employees on money-laundering charges in the US in
the late 1980s brought some of the deepest soul-searching among regulators,
with the Bank of England for a while imposing a daily reporting requirement
on BCCI to detect any run on the bank. Bingham himself concludes, though,
that there is no evidence that senior executives were involved in the crime.
'It has never (to my know-
. . . officials in the dark as debacle developedledge) been suggested that
the directors or controllers of SA were party to the money-laundering
conspiracy. Nor is there evidence known to me that senior managers were
implicated. Those indicted were not managers of SA within the statutory
definition, as the Bank rightly held.
'But the Schedule (to the Banking Act) makes clear that fitness and
properness involves not only probity but also competence, soundness of
judgment and diligence. Elsewhere, the requirement of prudence is stated in
general terms. There were, as it seems to me, questions to be asked about
the judgment and competence of the board and management when BCCI bought its
minority interest in BCC Colombia in 1983 and its majority interest in 1985.
'The likelihood of involvement in handling the proceeds of drug-trafficking
could scarcely have eluded a competent and diligent banker contemplating
such an investment, particularly if he had branches in Panama and agencies
in Florida. While it is true that money-laundering became an increasingly
high-profile subject throughout the 1980s, it was not an activity in which a
banker of probity would knowingly have engaged in 1983.
'Whether BCCI failed to recognise the risk, or recognised and discounted it,
or recognised and accepted it, or recognised and took what were thought to
be adequate precautions, I do not know. This inquiry was never made. I think
it was a pertinent inquiry, to which a rigorous supervisor would have wished
to know the answer.'
1989
By the end of the 1980s, BCCI's structure had once again returned to the top
of the supervisors' agenda and was the subject of discussion between Lord
Callaghan, the former Labour prime minister, and the governor of the Bank of
England. 'Partly at least as a result of approaches made to the Bank by Lord
Callaghan a little earlier, fresh thought was given to structural and
supervisory questions,' says the report.
'When Abedi was unable, through illness, to continue running the group, he
shared his thoughts with Lord Callaghan, who also on occasion acted as an
unofficial adviser to the group. Lord Callaghan came to feel that the group
had somewhat lost its direction in the absence of Abedi's leadership and
that its best future lay . . . in relocation of the group in the UK, subject
to the supervision of the Bank. A meeting was arranged with the governor on
May 25 1989 at which Lord Callaghan advanced this proposal.' Once again,
however, due in part to a lack of agreement among bank executives over the
best way to proceed, nothing was done.
Meanwhile, events were moving swiftly towards the final closure of the
group. Price Waterhouse, which had become sole group auditors of the bank,
were approached by an employee of the bank who claimed evidence of fraud.
The man, not named in the Bingham report, seems to have precipitated the
events that led to the closure.
'The informant was a senior officer of BCCI outside the UK with access to
good information. To protect his personal safety his identity must be
withheld, although it has been made known in strict confidence to the
inquiry. He began to give information to a PW partner ('P') in October 1989.
'The informant was not easy to assess. He tended to speak in riddles, to
make suggestions about areas to be investigated, to drop hints. P followed
up the leads and hints he was given. Some led, or appeared to lead, nowhere.
But over a period P increasingly came to regard the informant as
fundamentally honest and accurate.
'P's partners, who did not enjoy P's direct relationship with the informant,
were more sceptical, and took longer to be convinced of the informant's
reliability and good faith. There was accordingly a period during which,
within PW, there was some doubt about the reliability of the informant's
often rather enigmatic communications.'
By February 1990, Price Waterhouse felt able to go to the Bank to discuss
its growing fears. 'In communicating with the Bank in this way, (Tim) Hoult
and (Christopher) Cowan felt they were taking an exceptional step. They went
to the Bank and entered separately to avoid any risk of being seen by any
representative of BCCI.
'They agreed with Barnes, who was alone, that because of the extreme secrecy
of the meeting no note should be taken. It was a short meeting and
recollections of it differ. I am, however, sure that Hoult communicated PW's
doubts about the probity of BCCI, giving some of their grounds . . . Barnes
asked whether they considered (Swaleh) Naqvi (BCCI's chief executive) to be
fundamentally honest.
'Hoult said that Cowan had very serious doubts about Naqvi's honesty but he
himself was as yet unconvinced of his dishonesty. Barnes' recollection, that
PW came to tell him that the audit was not proceeding too smoothly and that
they were having difficulty getting the information they needed from Naqvi,
is in my view mistaken, although he thinks that if the informant had been
mentioned he would have remembered it.
'I find it surprising that this meeting made so little impression on
Barnes,' Bingham concludes. 'After years of criticism, and after Tampa (the
money-laundering convictions), here was a suggestion of dishonesty from an
unimpeachable source pointing at the chief executive of the group. Barnes'
impassivity on receiving this message seems to me to show a rooted
unwillingness to believe ill of BCCI.'
A second meeting with Barnes was arranged for March 2. And although Barnes
reported five days later to the Bank's board of banking supervision, 'he
gave the board no hint of PW's communication. He judged it inappropriate to
tell the board of what were no more than suspicions. While respecting his
motives, I consider this a misjudgment. This was, after all, PW's second
visit, and no one but he knew of the first.
'Even unsubstantiated suspicions from such a source are of significance. One
of the results was that the Board of Banking Supervision, and the governors,
were not at this point alerted to serious doubts about the integrity of the
chief executive of the group.'
In April 1990, PW produced its most damaging report on the group so far,
prompting another visit by Hoult and Cowan to the Bank 'to deliver a copy'.
However, what followed was a catalogue of bad communication: 'Barnes
declined to receive a copy because of the Bank's delicate position vis-a-vis
the (Luxembourg regulators). So Hoult went through the salient points in the
report.
'It is, I think, clear from the only note of the meeting (which was made by
Miss Jones and which, though not comprehensive, was substantially accurate)
that Hoult concentrated on the immediate financial crisis and the need for
very substantial shareholder support.
'But it seems he made no express reference to fraud or malpractice of any
kind, and he went into little detail save, to some extent, of the Gokal
loans. It is surprising, and unfortunate, that the Bank's attention was not
expressly drawn to the fitness and properness implications of the report.'
Nevertheless, the PW report was more widely circulated in the Bank later in
the month. PW 'accordingly assumed that the inferences to be drawn from the
report, as they thought clearly, would be drawn by the Bank. This was not
what happened.
'Although Beverly read the report and found it a 'shock' and a 'devastating
report to read', it is questionable whether he drew from it any inference of
deception or malpractice. Barnes, if he read the report at the time at all,
read it briskly and understood it to concentrate on the financial problem
outlined by PW on April 18 1990.
'Quinn saw the report at the time and appreciated it disclosed a serious
financial crisis, but may not have read the whole of the text very carefully
and the report raised no real doubt in his mind about the integrity of Naqvi
and Abedi.'
PW's report failed to ring alarm bells at all levels of the Bank. 'In April
1990 (and for a number of months afterwards) the governors, the Board of
Banking Supervision, Quinn and Barnes were unaware of the serious doubt
thrown by PW on the integrity of the bank's most senior management.'
As BCCI's problems became more serious, it was forced to rely more heavily
on the Gulf state whose interests had become its major shareholder: Abu
Dhabi. The result was that Abu Dhabi came to learn of problems at BCCI
before the Bank or PW, says Bingham.
'When, in the spring of 1990, it was plain that BCCI faced financial
disaster, Naqvi appealed to the Abu Dhabi shareholders to rescue the group.
He admitted to them that the group had made large losses. An attempt to
staunch these losses by Central Treasury dealing had, he said, led to even
greater losses.
'To try and prop up the bank he and Abedi had misappropriated funds
amounting to Dollars 2.2 billion from the (Abu Dhabi) Ruling Family's
portfolio which they managed. It seems clear that this misappropriation was
admitted by Naqvi, and understood by the Abu Dhabi shareholders, to have
been dishonest. But Naqvi pleaded that BCCI was basically a sound and
profitable enterprise and begged the Abu Dhabi shareholders to support it.'
Bingham warns that his report has been produced without substantial input
from Abu Dhabi. Naqvi 'is under restraint in Abu Dhabi', while 'Mazrui's own
understanding is not easy to assess.' But he adds: 'The Abu Dhabi
authorities are not, however, untutored innocents in the world of
international finance, and I cannot think they were as greatly deceived as
they suggest.
'Unhappily, the Abu Dhabi shareholders did not at the same time communicate
to either the supervisors or the auditors even the outline of what Naqvi had
revealed to them. It was to be nine months before the misuse of the Ruling
Family's portfolio became known to PW and the Bank.
'I have to regard this as a serious and potentially influential omission,
even if the Abu Dhabi shareholders' understanding was as they say. They
point out (quite correctly) that Naqvi's estimates were unverified and
unsubstantiated, and suggest that they viewed them with some scepticism. I
find this unconvincing.'
The final year of BCCI's existence could have been cut short had Abu Dhabi
acted differently: 'Had the full facts known to them been communicated to PW
and the supervisors in April 1990, it seems likely either that all concerned
would have embarked on a group restructuring programme with a much fuller
investigation and understanding of the malpractice which had existed in the
past and of the level of support required, or that the bank would have been
closed or would have collapsed there and then.'
The blame was not all on Abu Dhabi's side: banking regulators themselves
failed to encourage better communication. 'It is . . . unfortunate in
retrospect that the supervisors did not, at this critical juncture in BCCI's
affairs, seize the opportunity to establish direct personal contact with the
top levels of the Abu Dhabi government: had senior representatives of the
Bank and the IML succeeded in discussing the existing situation and the
future at this stage, all involved might have had a clearer understanding of
the others' position over the months ahead and it is to be hoped that more
detail of Naqvi's revelations would have emerged.'
Communication was not helped by the Bank's traditional ways of going about
its business. For 'presentational' reasons, the banking supervisors did not
want to travel to Abu Dhabi in the summer of 1990. 'I think this was
unfortunate. City tradition is that the world attends upon the Bank. This
is, no doubt, a beneficial tradition. But the Bank was dealing with a proud
and independent government not reared in this tradition and in the throes of
a serious local crisis. There was an urgent need, in the interests of UK and
other depositors, to impress on the government the finality of the IML
ultimatum and the necessity to find a solution.'
Meanwhile, more evidence revealed to PW by senior BCCI employees showed that
the size of the hole in the bank was even bigger than they had feared. 'PW
were shocked to learn of these new facts, because of the figures involved,
because Iqbal had apparently not been free to make the revelations before
and because of the deception apparently involved.
'PW once more feared for the survival of the bank and thought it necessary
to see the majority shareholders again urgently. So Hoult and Cowan returned
to Abu Dhabi on 29 September 1990. They told the Bank they were going, but
not of the reason for the visit beyond referring to financial problems:
asked for a ball-park figure, they thought that the shortfall on certain
assets might be Dollars 1.5bn, which would be needed in the form of new
capital, the take-out of certain loans by the shareholders, provisions and
guarantees.'
Again, the Bank was not told of fears about deception at the bank. A lack of
communication meant that 'both PW and the Bank were restricted in their
understanding of the situation . . . The majority shareholders had not told
PW or the Bank of Naqvi's revelations, even as to the misuse of the Ruling
Family's portfolio. PW for their part had not told the Bank of . . . remarks
about manipulation of Gokal accounts, the ownership of First American by
BCCI nominees and the failure of BCCI to make a profit . . . Nor had they
mentioned Iqbal's remarks on 26 September and the fact that he had not
apparently been free to make these revelations before.'
October 1990
In October, PW produced its latest in a series of damning reports on the
bank, leading eventually to Naqvi's departure. Yet even this failed to
produce a strong reaction from the Bank of England.
'Bartlett, who read the report, was understandably struck by the serious
financial situation it disclosed. He did not at the time read the reference
to collusion with major customers to misstate or disguise the underlying
purpose of significant transactions as 'a very strong suggestion of
dishonesty', although with the benefit of hindsight he now does.
'This report was not widely circulated within the Bank. Neither Barnes nor
Quinn saw it until after the closure of the bank in July 1991.'
The Bank of England was concerned mainly about the financial predicament of
the bank. The implications about the behaviour of senior executives did not
appear uppermost in its mind. Bingham says: 'I find it hard to understand
why the fitness and properness aspects of this report made so little impact
on the minds of those who did read it in the Bank. For any bank to be
accused of colluding with customers to misstate or disguise the underlying
purpose of significant transactions should be a very serious thing to a
supervisor responsible for monitoring compliance with the statutory
criteria.
'In failing to appreciate and react to the implications of this report the
Bank was in my view at fault. But it was not solely at fault. The report did
not convey, in a blunt and unmistakable way, the full extent of PW's
concerns following their conversations with Habroush and Iqbal. Nor had the
majority shareholders revealed the full effect of Naqvi's revelations in
April.'
By early in 1991, the picture developing before the auditors was beginning
to look even worse. Naqvi revealed for the first time the existence of
substantial fictitious loans.
'PW were conscious that Naqvi's revelations had not been verified by
detailed investigation and they were sceptical of his assumption of sole
responsibility. But they could see no reason why he should make damaging
admissions which were untrue and much of what he said corroborated what
Iqbal had said earlier.
'They were inclined to regard Naqvi's disclosures as, in all probability, a
fairly comprehensive account of the fraud practised in the bank. They did
not report this conversation to the Bank . . . Again, I find this puzzling
and think the omission was very unfortunate.'
In April, PW conveyed more of their concerns to the Bank. Yet the reaction
was inadequate, says Bingham: 'Although . . . Bartlett was much concerned at
the size of the financial support which this conversation showed to be
necessary, the reported theft of very large sums by Abedi and Naqvi from the
Ruling Family of Abu Dhabi caused remarkably little stir in the Bank.
'Barnes, to whom the note of this meeting was copied, did not attach great
importance to this aspect of it because it related to past events and former
management who, however disgracefully they had behaved, had no place in the
future plans of the group. It was a matter between the shareholders and the
former management.
'Quinn confirmed that no thought was given to revocation at this time . . .
It was doubtless for reasons of this kind that no indication of this sizable
theft was made to the Board of Banking Supervision and the governors until
after the closure of the bank. I consider this reaction strange.'
Even as late as April, less than three months before the closure, the Bank
was not particularly worried about BCCI's future, believing as it did that
Abu Dhabi support assured the bank's future.
Bingham says: 'It is not easy in retrospect to understand how the Bank and
PW could in early April 1991 have been other than pessimistic about the
future. The (Luxembourg regulators') deadline had three months to run. The
financial package had not been finally signed, so the group was still
technically insolvent. The accounts, already overdue, would be still further
delayed and would show huge losses. The final outcome of the various
investigations in progress was not known but must on past experience have
appeared likely (particularly to PW) to produce disturbing revelations. The
prospect of hostile proceedings and adverse publicity in the US had not
receded. Even the basic decisions on the future structure of the group had
not been taken, and there was no realistic possibility that a detailed
structural plan, approved by the shareholders and the relevant supervisors,
would be available by the end of June. The directors and managers of the new
banks (wherever they might be) had not for the most part been appointed.
'I find it surprising that there was not a sense of impending crisis, and
that the Bank did not judge this (latest) college meeting . . . to merit the
personal attendance of one of its most senior supervisors. But it must be
very doubtful whether anything the Bank could reasonably have done at this
stage would have averted the ultimate collapse of the group.'
The Bank, meanwhile continued to look for an Abu Dhabi bail-out of BCCI.
'There is room for very real doubt whether, in view of what it had learned
(and should have understood) about the business of BCCI, particularly over
the preceding 18 months, the Bank was well-advised to give even provisional
blessing to these restructuring plans until the past had been
comprehensively explored or a clear understanding for the future reached
with the majority shareholders.'
The Bank's lack of preparation for the impending crisis is shown by the fact
that its head of supervision was actually on holiday at the time BCCI was
finally closed.
'Reading the Bank's contemporaneous records, I discern no sense of impending
crisis. Had any crisis been expected, it would hardly have been thought
satisfactory for Barnes, as Head of the Banking Supervision Division, to go
on holiday on 21 June without plans for his return or consultation in case
of emergency. (As it was, and although he left a telephone number, the Bank
did not communicate with him during what turned out to be the crucial
fortnight which culminated in the closure of the bank. The first he knew of
the closure was when he returned from holiday on 6 July 1991 and read of it
in the newspaper.)
@Whsh . . . the overdue 1990 accounts unapproved, the shareholders' support
unconfirmed, their global restructuring plans incomplete and the continuing
threat of damaging US revelations, it is hard in retrospect to understand
why the course ahead did not appear more hazardous.'
It was against this background of apparent complacency at the Bank that, in
July, PW delivered its bombshell: a final, damning report, which the Bank of
England had itself commissioned three months before.
Its effect on the regulators was immediate. 'Bartlett was clearly somewhat
shaken by the report, both by its strong language and because it went
further than earlier reports. Cowan thought there was not very much new in
it, and suggested that its impact was the result of including all the
various threads in one place . . .
'Quinn read the draft section 41 report overnight on Wednesday 26 June. He
found it devastating. His mind was in no way prepared for it. Had he been
fully alive to the story as, in a piecemeal way, it had unfolded to the Bank
. . . he would still have been much struck by the comprehensive and
cumulative effect of the draft report, but its contents could scarcely have
come as quite such a complete surprise.'
Within days, BCCI had been closed - at least one action which draws applause
from Bingham: 'Given the decision to close BCCI without advance notice to
the majority shareholders or management, the closure itself was well-planned
and very skilfully executed.'
The decision to close BCCI - something which has itself drawn widespread
criticism - is also supported by Bingham. 'There was no course open to the
Bank which offered a quick and complete solution to all outstanding problems
without loss, or the risk of loss.
'All the courses open were to a greater or lesser extent unattractive as
liable to cause loss. But the Bank had a statutory duty to protect the
interests of UK depositors. Its judgment that those interests were best
served, as matters stood, by closure was strongly supported by the Board of
Banking Supervision.
'And while a judgment based on that ground alone might be open to criticism
(the Banking Act 1987 apart) as unacceptably chauvinistic, it was a judgment
which commanded very wide assent among other supervisory authorities. It
cannot be plausibly argued, in my opinion, that the course which the Bank
took was not an appropriate one, even though it was not the only possible
course . . .
'That, however, leaves unanswered an important question, whether PW's draft
section 41 report should have come to the Bank as the devastating surprise
it did. In my opinion it certainly should not.
'It would not have done so if the Bank had been more alert in receiving and
understanding the messages it was given, if those messages (received and
understood) had been more consistently brought to the attention of the most
senior echelons in the Bank and the Board of Banking Supervision and if the
Bank had more actively pursued the leads it was given.'
The Bank's decision to close BCCI without first talking to Abu Dhabi also
receives support from Bingham. Abu Dhabi 'felt deeply wounded that such
action should have been taken in this way by a country with which Abu Dhabi
has, over many years, enjoyed close ties of trust and friendship. I am not
at all surprised by these reactions, fired as they were by an unjustified
but potent suspicion that the Bank was guilty of duplicity, and they must be
a matter for deep regret. But I do not think the Bank's decision to give no
effective advance notice to the majority shareholders can be criticised as
wrong.'
Bingham's conclusion: 'This history was, in its later stages, a tragedy of
errors, misunderstandings and failures of communication . . .
'Public attention has naturally focused most closely on the last 15 months
of BCCI's active existence, which was indeed a period of crucial
significance. But the problems which then came to light, in large measure
through the work of PW and the investigating team, had their roots deep in
the past. Prime responsibility of course rests with those who devised,
directed and implemented the frauds which were practised. Whether the frauds
could and should have been discovered by the auditors earlier is an issue I
have not been asked to investigate.'
At the end, the Bank of England remains central, says Bingham. 'The Bank did
not pursue the truth about BCCI with the rigour which BCCI's market
reputation justified. In the later stages the Bank came to rely to an
excessive extent, in my opinion, on the auditors: under the British system
of supervision the auditors have a crucial role to play but the duty to
supervise is placed on the Bank and it is a duty which cannot be delegated.
It is the Bank, not the auditor, which is the supervisor. In these respects
the Bank's supervisory approach to BCCI was in my opinion deficient. How
different the course of events would have been had these deficiencies not
existed, one can only speculate.'

FT  23 OCT 92 / Arts: Making it better - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the loveliest theatres in London, the Criterion in Piccadilly Circus,
has re-opened after a four year pause for refurbishment. It looks
resplendent from inside and out. It has come back with a transfer from the
Hampstead Theatre, Making It Better by James Saunders whose Next Time I'll
Sing to You and A Scent of Flowers made him seem a promising playwright in
the early 1960s.
It is not that Saunders has gone backwards, merely that he has failed to
develop. Here we are with a rather slight, well enough written play that is
not going to offend anyone; nor excite them either. For the culturally
aware, there are two references to Graham Greene within the first few
minutes. There are also the comforting background and voices of the BBC
World Service.
Jane Asher playing Diana Harrington must be one of the few actresses who can
claim to sleep with the entire cast. Not that she is a nymphomaniac; there
are only three, apart from herself. In order of appearance they go as
follows: her husband, who has decided to 'come out' and therefore leaves
her; an old Czech, who has defected in the pregnant year of 1968 and whom
she picks up in a pub; and a young Czech who has first been the male lover
of her husband.
On stage it all looks quite innocent. The setting is London, the time 1989 -
the year of the real Prague spring. (Saunders has previously worked on
Redevelopment, one of the plays by the Czech President, Vaclav Havel). There
is still a little spying going on, but not nearly enough to make a plot.
The Czech connection is simply that both Diana and her husband have
previously worked for the BBC in Prague. Now they are back in Bush House,
the headquarters of the BBC's overseas broadcasting, where it seems that
Czechs are two a penny.
Here there are a few jokes. One had forgotten what asinine programmes the
World Service puts out between news bulletins: snatches of Buddy Holly and
helpful documentaries on the spread of science and technology.
'Well, of course,' says the announcer, 'the history of telecommunications is
still developing. Next Wednesday we shall be talking to the man who tried to
put a telephone in every village in India.' Possibly this is Saunders being
satirical; it struck me as the funniest line in the play.
Making It Better is not a bad piece, just a bit slow. Ms Asher is a very
professional actress who would be better still if she had sharper lines.
Larry Lamb as her sometimes husband looks exactly like the sort of man you
would expect to meet in the World Service of the BBC.
David de Keyser and Rufus Sewell play the old and young Czechs respectively.
The director is Michael Rudman. The best news remains that the Criterion is
back on the map.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Arts: Lorenz and Most deliver the unexpected - Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Misled about the starting-time of his recital, I missed Siegfried Lorenz's
opening Schubert Lieder on Wednesday. That was a great pity, as his Hugo
Wolf and his Schumann soon demonstrated - and a pair of Schubert encores
finally confirmed. This was his London recital debut, which is quite
inexplicable: there have been admiring reports of his singing for at least
15 years; has Somebody here has been asleep.
On the platform, this baritone does not cut a romantic figure. He has the
charisma of an assistant bank manager who is going out of his way to be
friendly; or in narrative, comic or ironic songs, of a jolly uncle eager to
act everything out for the children. But he delivers his songs like a
self-effacing master - almost a pedagogical model, but escaping that chilly
stamp by virtue of a warmly appealing, human timbre.
In fact the Lorenz voice is capable of great imaginative variety; but it
took a special effort to notice it, so discreetly was all that art put to
the service of the texts and the music. The nearest comparison is with the
tenor Peter Schreier, a regular Lorenz partner: searching attention to the
lyrics, marvellously communicative, unforced diction, an iron determination
to winkle out everything in the music that serves the sense - but never to
fake up something more. In a programme of first-water songs like these
(Morike Lieder by Wolf, Schumann's op. 24 Liederkreis after Heine), anything
more would be superfluous.
There was no illusion of inspired spontaneity, but none of his songs
required that extra spice. Not, at least, from the singer; but Wolf's
'Storchenbotschaft', a delectable cartoon of a shepherd receiving the glad
news from a pair of storks that his girlfriend has given birth -
unfortunately, however, to twins - deserved a far more fluent, exuberant
waltz-postlude than Iain Burnside gave it.
Burnside is the Artistic Director of this South Bank song-series, and an
accompanist of great but uneven promise. This was one of his uneven
evenings. He could be soberly rapt in Wolf's great insomnia-to-benediction
'In der Fruhe', and he dealt astutely with the piano-parts of the most
familiar songs. Elsewhere he seemed to be feeling his way still. In
Schumann's visionary epilogues he was always prickly and self-conscious. For
Lorenz's deceptively 'natural', direct manner, he was not a natural partner.
In the Festival Hall, Franz Welser-Most conducted an ingenious programme
with the London Philharmonic on Tuesday. Each half offered a big work by a
composer in his young maturity (Brahms and Bartok), preceded respectively by
an earlier novice piece for only strings (Rossini at 12) and another for
winds alone (Richard Strauss at 17).
The LPO strings found a proper Rossinian verve for his C major 'String
Sonata'. Though the transcription from the original four-player score never
sounds convincingly orchestral, the individual string-sections made a good,
muscular fist of their 'solo' flights. Strauss's op. 7 Serenade - for 13
players, like Mozart's divine B-flat Serenade - was gracious and subtly
shaded, but any temptation to rollick was firmly repressed: not much hint of
the later, unbuttoned Strauss got through. I had always thought that the
appeal of this Serenade lay in just that.
The D minor Piano Concerto of Brahms found Radu Lupu plainly off-form.
Welser-Most led off in fine, stormy style. The piano's late entry, with that
worried tune in restless sixths, may be a nervy new voice, or a secretive
contrast - but Ludu made it nothing in particular. Though this work ought to
be ideal Lupu territory, he was strangely backward about fixing any
consistent character in it. Some transitions were roughly assertive where a
natural reading would seem to ask for tapering-down, and others vice versa.
Bartok's Miraculous Mandarin was performed complete, with the eerie choral
voices (the LPO's Choir) toward the end. Obviously well-prepared and
brightly coloured, it sounded more like a straight ballet-score - an
uncommonly violent one, of course - than a baleful symphonic vision, as in
the famous Boulez reading. For the subcutaneous 'seduction' scenes, the solo
clarinet was less than sexy. As a whole, nevertheless, Mandarin made a
high-profile impression where the Brahms had seemed fitful and bitty:
exactly what one had not expected.

Roy Strong has skirted perilously closely around the trapdoor reserved for
TV show-offs in the first two of his Royal Gardens series (8.30 BBC2) but
has not yet tumbled in. His accounts of Hampton Court and Kew have had as
much to do with entertainment and history as with horticulture. Today he
turns to the gardens created or remodelled by George IV: Brighton Pavilion,
Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle.
As that finishes, assuming you can tear yourself away from the repeat of
Blackadder Goes Forth (a considerable assumption) you can watch the first in
a new Channel 4 series, Spirit Of Trees (9.00), which, it seems, is about
precisely what it says. Episode 1 also goes to Windsor ..
Today's Crime Story (9.00 ITV) is about a nasty and yet undeniably
fascinating case involving newspaper proprietors' families. Criminals
intending to kidnap Rupert Murdoch's wife snatched the wrong woman. Her body
has never been found.
The most fascinating aspect of Between The Lines is not the investigation of
police corruption but the frantic sex life of the chief character, Tony
Clark (9.30 BBC1).

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the Chestertonian grounds that a thing worth doing is worth doing badly,
the first-ever Scottish Opera production of Giulio Cesare in Egitto can be
welcomed. There are no other grounds for doing so. Handel, a theatre
composer of supreme genius whose greatest works now enrich the basic
repertory of all serious opera houses, is here taken back to the caveman age
of the 20th-century Handel revival - the age when those operas were deemed
to need 'help' of some form or other.
In this Julius Caesar the score is cut (bad enough) and its three-act
structure broken into two long, misshapen acts (worse), in patches re-scored
and re-ordered (worse still), and (worst of all) conducted with an ignorance
of the basic niceties of 18th-century style that must make even the most
tolerant Handelian weep with rage and despair. The staging is mounted in
comic-strip style, with an utter lack of wit in the early scenes and lack of
emotional depth in the later, but absolutely no lack of late-20th-century
opera-production cliches (stepped stage, poster-bright costume colours,
evening dress, bra and petticoat, shoe and glove fetishism, cartoon
front-cloths, and so on).
I cannot actually prove that it all adds up to the single worst Handel opera
production ever given by a leading British company, but after sitting
through Wednesday's opening night at the Glasgow Theatre Royal I am strongly
moved to insist that it must be. It is the dead mass of boredom to which the
opera is unvaryingly reduced - all three hours and 20 minutes of it (much of
it taken up with silent pauses for face-pulling or prancing about) - that
one minds so furiously. When silliness of staging (hopelessly old-fashioned
for all its modish gestures) meets invertebracy in the musical direction, a
lethal operatic brew is cooked up.
Julius Caesar characters delivered in the language of Viz or John Glashan
cartoons are bad enough; Julius Caesar arias rendered lifeless by a
conductor's rhythmic drag and plod, with occasional further slowings-down in
mid-course, provide the coup de grace. This horror is the work of the German
producer Willy Decker (from Cologne), the Glasgow designer John Macfarlane,
and the Swiss conductor Samuel Bachli, and is a co-production with the
theatres of Ludwigshafen and Montpellier. For its taste-level, approach to
the late-20th-century re-imagining of Handelian opera seria dramaturgy, and
above all level of musical command, the adjective provincial might have been
coined.
No good points? Well, the voice parts are all given at correct pitch
(countertenors sing Caesar, Ptolemy and Nirenus, and a female mezzo Sextus).
The cast is potentially a fine one, which makes the musical and dramatic
waste of it that much harder to bear: Michael Chance in the title role
(lacking the big virtuoso guns for the florid music but innately musical,
eloquent and supple in phrasing), Joan Rodgers as Cleopatra (her exquisite
timbre clouded by production idiocies and tempo misjudgments), Anne Mason
(Cornelia), Eirian James (firm-toned as Sextus), Christopher Robson (prone
to self-caricature as Ptolemy), Gidon Saks (Achillas) and Timothy Wilson
(Nirenus). Brian Trowell's graceful English translation is welcome.
In sum, however, this is an achievement to place beside Covent Garden's
recent Huguenots and Scottish Opera's own 1985 Weber Oberon: all three
instances of works requiring some form of 'period' sympathy in the mounting,
and productions of the most shamingly unsympathetic and inartistic kind.
In repertory at Theatre Royal, Glasgow, until October 29, then on tour in
Aberdeen, Newcastle and Edinburgh

FT  23 OCT 92 / Arts: Get to know the Genoese - Susan Moore visits Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If only someone had had the nerve to call this show 'The Genius of Genoa'.
Unsurprisingly, Art in the Republic of Genoa 1528-1815 is failing to pull
crowds into Frankfurt's Schirn Kunsthalle. No doubt few passers-by would be
able to even name a Genoese artist, and the rest remain uninspired by the
dreary title to find out who - or how wonderful - the republic's artists
might be. What treats the incurious are missing.
It is, however, an uneven show. At first glance, its exhibits are not unlike
those of an Italian provincial museum, incongruously transposed into the
inhospitable modernist space of the Schirn. There are the requisite unframed
pictures in less than perfect condition, plus a melange of furniture,
sculpture, silver, ceramics and textiles. On the other hand, most civic
museums do not boast a wall of Genoese-period Van Dycks.
In Van Dyck, the immensely wealthy and ostentatious ruling families of Genoa
 -bankers to the world - found their perfect recording angel. These are
sumptuous but sombre portraits, each nuance of gossamer lace, silk and
velvet rendered with consummate skill. The young gentlewoman known as the
Marchese Balbi is decked out entirely in black - but blacks encrusted with
gold, trimmed with threads of silver. But this is far more than a statement
of rank. Van Dyck cannot but warm to this dark, flashing-eyed beauty.
Looking at her we realise how unalluring by comparison he found his puddingy
English female sitters.
Another other full-length, a penetrating study of an aged and wordly Genoese
senator, makes for a striking contrast to the informality of the portrait of
his two friends from Antwerp - the painters, engravers and dealers Lucas and
Cornelis de Wael with whom Van Dyck lodged during his stay in Genoa during
the 1620s. Cornelis sits with one arm casually draped over the back of the
chair, the black sleeve of the other highlighting the delicious cut white
silk of his brother's doublet. Sadly we are unable to compare the pupil with
his master: there is not one of the great Genoese portraits that Rubens had
painted some 20 years before.
Rubens was to exert a profound influence on Genoese art, not least on the
Capuchin friar turned painter Bernardo Strozzi. Strozzi is a painter's
painter who wields a generously loaded brush with brio; nowhere is the
vitality of surface more evident than in the 'Allegory of the Arts' on loan
from the Hermitage, and a vast 'Rape of Europa' from Poznan. Strozzi works
from a black ground and drags layer upon layer of rich tints across the
canvas to lend an earthy substance to his figures. Ideal Flemish
voluptuousness melds with the North Italian realist tradition.
Here, too, is a marvellous lute player, a dark, swagger portrait of an
unknown man, plus the only known Strozzi bozetto - or oil sketch - for a
silver basin, illustrating various episodes from the life of Antony and
Cleopatra. Displayed beside it is the basin which ultimately derives from
Strozzi's sketch.
Genoa's other great home-grown, 17th century talent is Giovanni Benedetto
Castiglione, best remembered as the inventor of the monotype and the
perpetrator of virtuoso drawings made with the point of the brush and oil
paint on paper. In one of the most complex Baroque compositions on show,
Samson is attempting the destruction of the temple of the Philistines; to
escape the tumbling masonry, a young boy in the foreground, boldly
foreshortened, almost dives head-first out of the picture.
In the art of painting, the Baroque period is indisputably Genoa's finest
hour. Alongside the more or less familiar tours-de-force of acknowledged
masters, we also find a wealth of major minor masterpieces, such as Giovanni
Maria Bottalla's 'Deucalion and Pyrrha' brought from Rio de Janiero and an
effectingly tender account of Tobias taking leave of his blind father by
Bartolomeo Guidobono. It is tempting to say that an exhibition focussing on
the Baroque, like that staged in Genoa earlier this year, would have been
more rewarding. In an attempt to be encyclopaedic, this show has spread
itself too thin.
The exhibition continues until November 8.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Arts: 'Carmen' smoulders on - Opera in Birmingham and
Glasgow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bloodthirsty spectacle of high drama and passion has arrived in
Birmingham. No - not the one in which twelve men in grey suits stab each
other in the back for the sake of a concept that none can define. That was
last week.
This is the arena production of Bizet's Carmen, involving a huge company of
performers (500 singers and dancers and ten horses, according to the press
hand-out), which was first seen in London at Earl's Court in 1989. In
Birmingham it is being played in the National Indoor Arena, where it opened
on Wednesday after a postponement of a couple of days in order to allow the
previous occupants, the world's media who had been attending the summit, to
move out.
At best, it is still a spectacular show. Without turning Carmen into an
all-singing, all-dancing musical blockbuster, the production brings off some
splendid coups de theatre. Escamillo arrives with a torch-lit procession of
admirers. Gypsies descend from the roof on rope ladders. The parade of
toreadors, arriving on horseback to the acclaim of the multitude, was just
the grand and exciting climax it ought to be, but never usually is.
In its original staging all these ideas were said to add up to a production
that was well integrated and scorchingly alive. But in that case some of the
burning Spanish midday heat has gone out of it. This revival in Birmingham
needs a lot of tightening-up if the drama is to generate momentum. Scenes
with the principals need to suggest early enough the passion smouldering
below the surface.
It was not until the final confrontation - a splendid scene with Don Jose
stalking Carmen around the deserted bull-ring - that Wilhelmenia Fernandez
and Jacques Trussel really set sparks off each other. As a soprano Carmen,
Fernandez was attractive and sensual but lacking the darker side, the
fatalism, the rawness of emotion; Trussel's singing sounded stretched.
Cynthia Haymon was a lovely Micaela and Gregory Yurisich a proud, confident
Escamillo. Prospective visitors should note that the casts are variously
interchangeable.
Amplification of the voices was excellent; the ensemble, though, seemed
perilous. From my seat no less than 12 television sets were in view relaying
the conductor's beat to the stage, but even that was not sufficient to keep
singers and orchestra together across such a vast space - a pity, as Jacques
Delacote was giving a real performance in the pit, enlivened with subtleties
and insights in every corner.
Nevertheless, like each of the arena opera productions seen so far, this one
is a creditably serious attempt to present opera truthfully to the masses.
The local audience would seem to have taken to the idea, as thousands
flocked to the first night, leaving few empty seats. No doubt the people of
Birpmingham are delighted that the city is now playing host to a show in
which more than a government's reputation gets murdered at the end.
Performances continue until October 27 (021-200 2222 and 021-633 3333)

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (9): London's
anaesthetic wears off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS only in the final weeks of the third quarter that the UK stock market
managed to edge ahead and join the handful of world equity markets that were
able to report capital gains, in local currency terms, over the three-month
period.
July and August were extremely disappointing months for the UK market, as it
struggled against an economic recession that was proving more enduring than
expected, as well as the growing storm in the sterling foreign exchange
markets.
Recovery came in the third week of September, when sterling's exit from the
exchange rate mechanism (ERM) - temporary, according to Mr John Major, the
prime minister - sent UK shares strongly higher.
The London stock market, brushing aside the prime minister's views for the
time being, interpreted the escape from ERM discipline as a signal that
domestic interest rates could now be cut. The FT All-Share Index jumped by
4.4 per cent on the day following the news, and, sure enough, base rates
were cut by one point within the week.
This concentration of activity into the final three weeks of the quarter can
distort the picture of what was happening in the previous two months. UK
government bonds and cash both outperformed equities over the quarter.
By the end of September, there were significant recoveries in some equity
sectors which had been looking distinctly unhappy only a few weeks earlier.
Banks and insurance stocks, for example, rallied quickly as interest-rate
optimism boosted the standing of their corporate customers, and thus
improved the chances that these customers might pay back some of their loans
and overdrafts - and perhaps even avoid going bankrupt and taking their
lenders and mortgage indemnifiers with them.
But most of the sectors which outperformed were favoured for defensive
qualities, in a market running for cover for much of the time: health and
household; utilities, including telephone and electricity stocks; and a
handful of large index stocks, including Hanson Group and General Electric.
Also performing strongly was Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, a
welcome newcomer to London following its acquisition of Midland Bank, one of
the market's chief problem stocks at the time.
It is not hard to see what the market was afraid of. Pressures within the
ERM network presented themselves early. The stock market focused on the
progress of the French government's campaign to secure a Yes vote in the
Maastricht referendum. At the begining of August, Mr Major was already
stressing his government's commitment to a strong pound, while calls for a
realignment of the ERM currencies were heard from the boardrooms of several
leading UK companies.
Meanwhile, the prolongation of the domestic recession hurt the corporate
sector badly. British Petroleum halved its quarterly dividend, and British
Aerospace shocked the market with a severe drop in profits. Stockbrokers
downgraded profit forecasts yet again; at the end of September, forecasts
for ICI's profits were cut by about one fifth, without provoking indignation
in the boardroom.
Britain's hasty exit from the ERM saved the UK equity market from a dismal
quarterly performance. Unfortunately, the anaesthetic seemed to be wearing
off by the end of September. The City of London had realised that further
cuts in base rates would be difficult to achieve if sterling continued to
plunge now that it was outside the ERM.
Although City analysts remain mildly positive for the final quarter of the
year, predicting a year-end Footsie level in the 2,575-2,625 range, few
expect an easy ride through a trading quarter which opened with the stock
market suffering its biggest one-day fall since the October crash of 1987.
Many fund managers will be tempted to keep the money in cash, a policy which
proved correct in the third quarter.

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (8): Shares are
buffeted by the hurricane - These are highly nervous times, with uncertain
currency markets, and not the moment for investment heroics. Stay in, or
very close to, cash and the wholesale money markets
</HEADLINE>

SEPTEMBER WAS the roller-coaster month of the third quarter.
Thin trading volumes in most equity markets, over the July-August holiday
weeks, had left bourses bumping along at or near their bottom levels -
though Tokyo did manage a 6 per cent rise in one day in August, on the
unveiling of the Japanese government's stimulatory package.
Then, in September, the Bundesbank shaved fractions off two key German
interest rates, and virtually every European equity market took off. It
didn't last.
Tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) had already been
apparent on foreign exchange markets early in August, and they came more
sharply into focus immediately ahead of the French vote on the Maastricht
treaty.
The currency hurricane started in the days before the French vote, hitting
first the Italian lira and then the Spanish peseta. The big assault caught
sterling and the British apparently by surprise (despite the writing on the
wall), and the pound quit the ERM, thus jettisoning the sheet-anchor of
economic policy.
The equity markets reacted perversely, at least initially. The currency
turbulence saw shares fall sharply in Italy and Spain, and rise steeply in
the UK on the immediate analysis that Britain was now free to pursue
economic policies to tackle its deep recession and away from the currency
constraints of the ERM (see below).
It took only a couple of days for more rational minds to focus on the
negative factors, including the risk of higher UK inflation and continuing
poor corporate results and dividend payouts.
But at least the pound's devaluation came to the immediate rescue of
sterling portfolio managers. Their total return over the third investment
quarter, measured by the FT Actuaries World Index, showed a relatively
healthy 9 per cent; for dollar investors, the outcome was a meagre 2.1 per
cent. Currency considerations were well and truly back into the
international equity investment environment. They will persist in the final
quarter of 1992, while the tensions within the ERM may very well bring a
fundamental shift in investor strategy, certainly for European funds.
The economic and monetary convergence foreshadowed in the ERM had persuaded
many fund managers to take a fresh look at bonds, at the expense of their
equity holdings, encouraged by the so-called debt convergence theory.
Asset-allocation committees ended the third quarter in semi-permanent
session, though the dismal performance of most equity markets in the first
few days of October did not provide them with much guidance.
Hard-pressed sterling investors in Japan did have something to justify a
half-cheer during the July-September period. The Japanese market produced a
return of more than 20 per cent, after the two miserable previous quarters;
and the Nikkei index on September 30 was up a fifth on its six-year low, hit
on August 18 this year. (Relief for portfolio managers, who increased their
exposure to Japan around the start of the year remains limited, however,
because that market is still more than a quarter down since the start of
1992).
Other highlights of the quarter? Not too many, in fact. Switzerland
performed well, yielding a total return to sterling investors of some 18 per
cent, and 11 per cent for dollar holders. Belgium, too, had a good quarter
for British investors, but dollar holders on Wall St had a return of just
over 3 per cent.
I am afraid that this column's advice for the final quarter is no different
from that proffered for the last two: stay in, or very close to, cash and
the wholesale money markets. These are highly nervous times, with uncertain
currency markets and no time for investment heroics.
One marginally encouraging note for some will come at the end of the year,
when the results of the 1987 stock market crash drop out of long-term
performance statistics, allowing fund managers to skew their promotional
shots. These will not tell you that cash was generally king over the whole
period; but can they conceal the fact that London, on October 5, had its
largest fall since the Black Monday shakeout five years ago?

forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CATERPILLAR, the US heavy equipment manufacturer, unveiled a profit of
Dollars 23m, or 23 cents per share, in the third quarter, reversing a
Dollars 37m, or 37 cents loss in the same quarter a year ago.
The results were stronger than Wall Street analysts had expected.
Sales for the quarter were Dollars 2.68bn, up 14 per cent.
Despite the third-quarter gain, Caterpillar reported a loss for the first
nine months, of Dollars 163m, or Dollars 1.60, compared with a loss of
Dollars 86m, or 85 cents.
Sales within the US rose 13 per cent in the quarter, to Dollars 1.18bn. The
sales gains stemmed primarily from shipments deferred from earlier in the
year when operations were hit by a strike.
Revenues from financial subsidiaries also rose as portfolio assets expanded.
The company's sales outside the US were Dollars 1.41bn, up 14 per cent from
the third quarter last year. Foreign sales amounted to 55 per cent of
Caterpillar's overall sales.
Caterpillar said it expected domestic and overseas demand for construction
machinery to be weaker in 1992 than in 1991 due to a globally weak economy
and forecast that its fourth-quarter results would be 'marginally
profitable'.

FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: Extraordinary items push ITT
down 36% in period
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITT, the US conglomerate, yesterday unveiled a 36.5 per cent drop in
third-quarter net income, reflecting a balance sheet cluttered with
extraordinary items.
The figures included an after-tax gain of Dollars 622m, or Dollars 4.71 a
share from the sale of ITT's 30 per cent stake in Alcatel, the French
telecommunications company. This was largely offset by charges of Dollars
582m, or Dollars 4.41, to cover losses at its Hartford insurance unit.
Catastrophe losses from hurricanes Andrew and Iniki reduced earnings by a
further Dollars 95m, or 72 cents.
Including these items, ITT recorded net income of Dollars 113m, or 60 cents,
compared with Dollars 178m, or Dollars 1.30, a year earlier. Sales were
Dollars 5.5bn against Dollars 4.9bn.
ITT had warned investors about its extraordinary items in the quarter and
had announced its catastrophe losses from the hurricanes. Shares in ITT
eased only Dollars  1/8 to close at Dollars 65 1/4 yesterday in light
trading.
Operating income improved at five of ITT's nine leading businesses. Earnings
from ITT's automotive business rose to Dollars 26m from Dollars 14m. Its
forest products services business saw operating income grow to Dollars 35m
from Dollars 22m. ITT Sheraton hotels had earnings of Dollars 13m, against
Dollars 4m. Earnings from ITT's finance arm grew to Dollars 51m from Dollars
23m while company's communications and information services saw income
advance to Dollars 53m from Dollars 43m.
ITT said it was adding Dollars 680m in capital to its insurance business to
strengthen its surplus position.

<TEXT>
INGERSOLL-RAND, the US industrial and construction equipment manufacturer,
reported third-quarter earnings up from Dollars 34.7m, or 33 cents a share,
to Dollars 35.9m, or 35 cents. The per-share figures reflect a two-for-one
stock split in June.
Operating profits, excluding a Dollars 10m charge for the restructuring of
the company's recession-hit aerospace bearings business, slipped by Dollars
5.2m to Dollars 57.5m. Sales rose from Dollars 866m to Dollars 904m.
Net earnings for the first nine months were Dollars 100.8m, or 97 cents a
share, up from Dollars 95.9m, or 92 cents, on marginally higher sales of
Dollars 2.69bn.
Operating profits in the company's standard machinery segment fell slightly
in the third quarter because of the unstable European economy and resulting
price pressure.
Engineered equipment profits also fell, while the bearings, locks and tools
segment lifted profits, before the restructuring charge.
Mr Theodore Black, chairman and chief executive, said incoming orders for
the third quarter were Dollars 891m, up 8 per cent from the 1991
third-quarter total of Dollars 829m.

TENNECO, the US conglomerate undergoing a major restructuring, yesterday
announced third-quarter net income of Dollars 46m, compared with severe
losses a year ago, but warned of continuing losses at its JI Case
agricultural equipment subsidiary.
The profits, equal to earnings per share of 28 cents, compare with losses of
Dollars 693m, or Dollars 5.69, last year when Tenneco took Dollars 427m of
after-tax restructuring charges. Revenues were up at Dollars 3.2bn.
JI Case, suffering from depressed US demand for agricultural and
construction equipment, reported a third-quarter operating loss of Dollars
68m, against a loss of Dollars 169m before restructuring charges last time.
The company said Case would cut production by an additional 4 per cent,
bringing its annual production cut to 24 per cent. The result would be
losses at the subsidiary for the fourth quarter and the full year.
Of Tenneco's other businesses, packaging posted profits of Dollars 49m, up
from Dollars 23m; chemicals group Albright &amp; Wilson reported Dollars 15m of
operating income, against a loss of Dollars 1m; gas pipelines made Dollars
58m, up from Dollars 17m; automotive parts made Dollars 60m, against Dollars
49m; and shipbuilding made Dollars 68m, up from Dollars 61m.

NORANDA Forest, Canada's biggest pulp and paper group, reduced losses
sharply in the third quarter, despite low prices for most products except
building materials.
It cut net losses to CDollars 17m (USDollars 13.7), or 16 cents a share,
from CDollars 51m, or 48 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose 10 per
cent to CDollars 1.12bn.
Operating profit before interest and depreciation was CDollars 33m, a
turnround from losses of CDollars 61m.
Nine-month losses were reduced to CDollars 62m, or 55 cents a share, from
CDollars 131m, or CDollars 1.34 a share. Donohue, another leading Canadian
pulp and paper group also reduced losses in the third quarter. Shipments
rose significantly and, though newsprint and market pulp prices remained
low, timber products were strong. Third-quarter net losses came to CDollars
5.8m against CDollars 14.4m.

OLYMPIA &amp; York has cancelled a key meeting with lenders to discuss a new
debt-restructuring plan, amid signs that negotiations between the ailing
real estate developer and its creditors will soon come to a head.
Despite calling off the meeting which was due to take place in Toronto
yesterday afternoon, O&amp;Y still insists that it will meet the October 27
deadline for filing its latest restructuring proposals.
O&amp;Y took the initiative in setting up the meeting, but a representative for
one group of project lenders said they were told that the company was not
yet ready to provide a preview of the plan, which covers more than half its
CDollars 13.5bn (USDollars 10.9bn) debt.
Negotiations with several of the 27 creditor groups came to a halt over the
past 3 to 4 weeks, but are expected to resume in earnest once O&amp;Y unveils
its revised proposals.
The initial plan, presented in August, would have required most project
lenders to accept a blend of extended maturities on their loans, and
tax-exempt 'distress' preferred shares. Other secured and unsecured
creditors would be offered an immediate equity stake of up to 49 per cent in
the parent company, Olympia &amp; York Developments, plus convertible bonds.
Under an Ontario court order, O&amp;Y must take a vote on any revised plan
between November 20 and 30. The court protection granted last May expires on
December 30.
Several creditor groups are laying the groundwork to seize rental income
from O&amp;Y buildings or the buildings themselves if negotiations founder over
the next month.
Prudential Insurance, which holds a USDollars 155m mortgage on a 45-storey
building in central Toronto, has asked a US court to reverse last May's
order granting various of O&amp;Y's Canadian subsidiaries protection under
Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code, as well as under the Canadian
Companies Creditors Arrangements Act.
A Prudential spokesman said the insurance group is concerned about the
'inconsistency, delay and confusion' which could result from courts in two
countries having jurisdiction over O&amp;Y.
He said that if O&amp;Y's restructuring plan turns out to be unacceptable, 'we'd
rather have the building now than later'.

CANADIAN Pacific Forest Products suffered a loss of CDollars 57.9m
(USDollars 47.76m), or CDollars 1.10 a share, in the third quarter, despite
improvements in some markets.
This compares with a loss of CDollars 55.2m, or CDollars 1.26, a year
earlier.
Sales fell to CDollars 466m, against CDollars 507m, mainly because of asset
disposals.
The nine-month loss was CDollars 188.5m, or CDollars 3.69 a share, against a
deficit of CDollars 165.5m, or CDollars 3.76 a share, on sales of CDollars
1.36bn, against CDollars 1.5bn.

SEARS, Roebuck, the US retail and insurance group, yesterday reported its
first quarterly loss in its 106-year history.
Claims related to Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki battered its Allstate unit and
charges related to settlement of a lawsuit dented income in its huge
Merchandising Group.
A previously-reported after-tax charge of Dollars 1.2bn at Allstate
contributed to a loss of Dollars 833.7m, or Dollars 2.25 per common share
for Sears in the third quarter. That compares with a 1991 third-quarter gain
of Dollars 229.2m or 67 cents.
Allstate suffered a third-quarter loss of Dollars 840.2m, compared with
earnings of Dollars 158.2m last year, after taking the charge to cover
hurricane-related claims. Allstate's revenues rose slightly, to Dollars
4.07bn, compared with Dollars 4.96bn last time.
The group's results included a Dollars 20.5m third-quarter write-off of
Sears' investment in Phar-Mor, a discount drug store in bankruptcy
reorganisation.
For the first nine months, Sears suffered a consolidated net loss of Dollars
166.1m, or 51 cents, compared with net income of Dollars 765.8m, or Dollars
2.23, last time.
Sales in the third quarter were Dollars 14.49bn, up 1.3 per cent from
Dollars 14.3bn last year.
The Merchandising Group, the retailing heart of the company, reported a
third-quarter loss of Dollars 36.4m, compared with income of Dollars 54.4m
last year. It lost about Dollars 80m in revenues and took a Dollars 27m
after-tax charge after settling a case involving customer overcharges at
Sears' car service stores. Its sales edged up to Dollars 7.71bn from Dollars
7.66bn in 1991.
The Dean Witter Financial Services Group income rose 24.1 per cent in the
quarter, to Dollars 114.3m, up from Dollars 92.1m in 1991. Sales were
Dollars 1.3bn, from Dollars 1.25bn last year.
Sear's Coldwell Banker real estate group had third-quarter income of Dollars
20.2m, up from Dollars 5.5m last time. Sears said the gain primarily
reflected the timing of property sales at Homart Development. Coldwell
Banker sales were up 1.8 per cent to Dollars 455.8m, from 447.9m.

AT&amp;T, the US telecom-munications giant, yesterday reported a 16.1 per cent
rise in third-quarter operational income, despite the weakness of the US
economy, helped by solid results from long-distance telecommunications and
financial services.
The company reported record quarterly net income of Dollars 963m, or 72
cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 1.79bn, or Dollars 1.40 a
share, in the same period of last year when it took Dollars 4.2bn of
charges. Excluding special charges, operational income totalled Dollars
829m. Revenues were Dollars 16.18bn, up from Dollars 15.63bn.
The results were broadly in line with expectations. Wall Street's mean
estimate of earnings per share, as tracked by the IBES information service,
was 73 cents.
The company said that NCR, the computer company AT&amp;T acquired last year and
merged with its own computer operations, had operating income of Dollars
49m. It said the figures were not comparable to the subsidiary's pre-merger
financial results.
'NCR continues to report strong orders in the US, but orders outside the US
weakened as a result of the computer industry's slump worldwide,' it added.
AT&amp;T's telecommunications services revenues grew Dollars 315m, or 3.2 per
cent, from Dollars 9.8bn to Dollars 10.2bn, as long-distance calling volumes
rose about 6 per cent.
The company's credit card unit reported its first profitable quarter since
it was launched two years ago and helped produce a 35 per cent increase in
financial services revenues, up from Dollars 358m to Dollars 485m.
Sales of products and systems saw a 1.7 per cent rise in revenues, to
Dollars 3.87bn from Dollars 3.81bn, led by higher sales of micro-electronic
components and business phone systems.
For the nine months net income was Dollars 2.81bn, or Dollars 2.11 a share,
on revenues of Dollars 47.4bn, compared with a loss of Dollars 113m, or 9
cents, after charges last year on revenues of Dollars 46.63bn.

Operating revenue was essentially unchanged at Dollars 2.21bn, while
operating income advanced 9 per cent to Dollars 262m.
The company attributed the improvement to operating efficiencies and
reductions in the long-term cost base of its transportation units.
Operating income at CSX's rail business rose 14 per cent to Dollars 182m.

THE depressed state of the US chemicals industry was reflected in the
third-quarter results of Dow Chemical and Monsanto.
Both companies said the problems of operating in a sluggish US economy were
compounded by the economic weakness in Europe.
The industry's continuing woes were underscored by Mr Enrique Falla, Dow's
executive vice-president, who said: 'The combination of a sluggish recovery
in the US economy, a severe slowdown in Europe and weak industry fundamen
tals globally have denied us the pricing flexibility to restore profit
margins in basic chemi cals and plastics.'
Dow Chemical, the second biggest US chemicals company, suffered a 35 per
cent drop in net income in spite of a 6 per cent rise in sales.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 145m, or 53 cents a share, on sales
of Dollars 4.75bn, against earnings of Dollars 223m, or 82 cents, on sales
of Dollars 4.5bn last year.
Operating income rose 9 per cent to Dollars 446m in the quarter, but net
income was hurt by increased financial expenses and a higher tax rate.
Similarly Monsanto, the Missouri-based chemicals com pany, saw third-quarter
net income drop in spite of higher sales. Net income tumbled 53.4 per cent
to Dollars 62m, or 51 cents a share, from Dollars 116m, or 91 cents, last
year, while sales grew 3 per cent to Dollars 1.88bn from Dollars 1.82bn.
The company said the beneficial impact of a weak US dollar was not
sufficient to counter effects of lower selling prices and weak European
operations.
Its revenue figures do not include Fischer Controls, which was divested in
October and is now accounted for in discontinued operations.
Operating income from the chemicals business fell to Dollars 43m from
Dollars 77m, although sales rose to Dollars 923m from Dollars 895m.
The Searle phar maceuticals business had operating income of Dollars 39m,
against Dollars 38m on sales which rose to Dollars 405m from Dollars 362m.
Income from the NutraSweet artificial sweetener business fell to Dollars 21m
from Dollars 44m.
Union Carbide, another big US chemicals group, posted third-quarter net
income from continuing operations of Dollars 23m, or 17 cents, against a
loss of Dollars 112m, or 88 cents a year ago. Last year's results included
special charges of Dollars 114m.
Sales rose 4 per cent to Dollars 1.24bn from Dollars 1.19bn.
Mr Robert Kennedy, Union Carbide's chairman, said excess glycol capacity in
the US and the far east was the biggest problem this year.

DENMARK'S minority government was faced with a fait accompli yesterday when
three opposition parties, with a majority in parliament, agreed on terms
which the country should seek from its EC partners regarding the Maastricht
treaty. Danes rejected the treaty in a June referendum.
Mr Poul Schluter, prime minister, last night welcomed the proposals - agreed
by the centrist Radical Liberals, Social Democrats and the left-wing,
anti-Maastricht Socialist People's Party - said he hoped it would pave the
way for a negotiating position backed by all parliamentary parties. Mr Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen, foreign minister, said a 'national compromise' should be
possible to achieve.
If special arrangements are agreed with the rest of the EC, the Danes will
submit the Maastricht treaty to a second referendum next year.
The proposals follow closely the terms outlined in a resolution by the
Social Democratic party congress in September. Denmark must be allowed to
stand aside from a common European defence, and from the introduction of a
common currency and the third stage of economic and monetary union.
It wants to continue to participate in the exchange rate mechanism, but must
maintain national control over economic and monetary policy. It also wants
to avoid any obligation to co-operate on immigration and internal security
on a supra-national basis.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE slowdown in the west German economy, combined with soaring costs for the
east, means new budget savings of at least DM10bn (Pounds 4bn) must be made
next year, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, warned yesterday.
After talks with leaders of the country's industrial organisations, he said
they all believed that west German growth had to be revived in order to
maintain the flow of state aid and investment to the east.
The slowdown was likely to mean a shortfall in budget revenues of
DM5bn-DM7bn, he said. At the same time, new spending needs identified in the
east, including the servicing of DM50bn in housing debts and extending
investment subsidies to industry, would push the deficit into 'billions in
double figures'.
The government is adamant that there can be no tax increase for 1993 (on top
of a 1 point rise in VAT, already approved), and has also rejected calls for
a levy or compulsory loan from the better-paid. Any extra spending in the
east must be financed from savings in the west.
Mr Mollemann said his talks with industry were aimed at complementing
negotiations for a 'solidarity pact' between industry, unions, central
government and the 16 federal states, to finance recovery in the east.
In a report to the cabinet on Wednesday, Mr Mollemann estimated growth in
the east German economy this year at between 2 and 5 per cent, compared with
original government forecasts of 10 per cent or more. He put west German
growth at 1.5-2 per cent.
He called for further radical savings measures from public spending, without
specifying where the cuts would fall.
One proposal before the government, to increase investment subsidies for
small and medium-size businesses in the east from 8 to 25 per cent, would
cost far too much, the industry lobbyists warned.
Mr Hans Peter Stihl, of the German chambers of trade and industry, said that
investment promotion had to be differentiated between regions and economic
sectors.
One proposal is to end subsidies for investments in the relatively
flourishing retail trade and services sectors, and concentrate simply on
reviving east German manufacturing industry.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Amato wins approval for crucial reforms: Boost for effort to
curb public sector deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Amato government's efforts to curb Italy's huge public sector deficit
received an important boost yesterday when parliament approved a law
endorsing a fundamental restructuring of pensions, the health service, local
government and the civil service.
Inefficiencies and waste in these four areas have been a principal factor in
fuelling the public sector deficit, equivalent to over 10.5 per cent of GDP
and nearly triple the EC average. The reforms are expected to generate a
third of the extra L93,000bn (Pounds 42bn) needed in the 1993 budget, with a
cumulative effect thereafter.
The breakthrough in parliament was accompanied by welcome external support
for the government's reform policies from the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development in Paris. The OECD took the unusual step of
releasing six weeks in advance parts of its annual report on Italy at the
government's request.
The report concludes that 'the stakes for Italy (in resolving its fiscal
crisis) are currently higher that at any period since the second world war'.
Mr Philippe Huet, chairman of the OECD committee, said the report warned
Italians they had 'no alternative, whatever government is in power in Rome',
but to follow Mr Amato's policies. It predicted 1 per cent growth next year.
Against the background of this parliamentary vote and with the lira holding
reasonably steady around 880 to the D-Mark, senior government officials were
predicting a lowering of the discount rate from 15 per cent.
The reforms have been rushed through parliament under special procedures,
having been first proposed in July. Deputies have approved the broad
outlines; the executive now has 90 days to fill in the details.
On pensions, the government was obliged to resort to a vote of confidence to
speed the measure through. It is taking similar action, probably in both
houses, to win approval for the rest of the 1993 measures, hoping in this
way that L66,000bn of extra revenue and spending cuts will be approved
within the next three weeks.
The structural reforms will shake-up the post-war welfare state and put
local and public administration on to a more managerial and accountable
basis. Pensions will now be brought into line with the EC norm, gradually
raising the retirement age for men from 60 to 65 and from 55 to 60 (with
incentives to remain until 65) for women. Privileged public sector pensions,
available for women after 15 years service and men after 20, will be
gradually realigned with the 36 years in the private sector.
The health service is going to be removed from political control, and the
640 local health units halved and placed under professional management. The
reform of local/regional administration envisages an end to Rome's tight
centralised control of funding. In future they will be able to raise a
significant array of extra taxes.
As for the 3.2m public employees, recruitment will be more selective, and
there will be greater job flexibility and performance monitoring.
The OECD report says: 'Reaching the (Maastricht) fiscal target implies
cutting the public sector deficit by nearly 2 per cent of GDP a year from
1993 onwards. . . . Maintained over four years, an adjustment of this size,
in face of a widening gap between real interest rates and economic growth,
would represent a major achievement, nearly unparallelled in OECD
countries.'

FT  23 OCT 92 / Independent body to examine electricity plant closures plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSOR Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, is to
step up his investigations into two developments which have been widely
blamed for the threat of pit closures.
He announced yesterday he would appoint an independent assessor to examine
recent decisions by National Power and PowerGen, the two large electricity
generators in England and Wales, to shut several coal-fired power stations.
Prof Littlechild, director-general of electricity supply, will also bring
forward his own review of the way electricity distribution companies buy
their power supplies. The growing practice among distributors of building
their own gas-fired power stations has triggered suggestions of 'sweetheart'
deals which may be squeezing coal out.
Prof Littlechild promised to report publicly on both issues by December,
meaning that his findings can be fed into the full review of energy policy
which has been promised by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, in January.
The two big generators announced on September 30 that they were closing 12
power stations. Although these represented less than 5 per cent of
generating capacity in England and Wales, most of them were coal-burning.
Under new licence conditions, Prof Littlechild has the power to investigate
plant closures to ensure that they will not drive up electricity prices. If
he thinks they will, he can recommend an inquiry by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
Prof Littlechild was reviewing power purchasing practices to ensure that
they were economic before the coal crisis. He said last week he would
accelerate the review because of concern about the gas deals, but
yesterday's announcement was the first indication that he would try to fit
in with Mr Heseltine's timetable.
If the gas deals turn out to be uneconomic, the regulator can penalise the
companies by disallowing their costs, but he cannot force them to stop using
gas.
As an independent regulator, the director-general of electricity supply can
only be asked by Mr Heseltine to carry out certain tasks. But Prof
Littlechild said last night: 'This was a decision I made myself. I think it
is important to have an impartial and objective review.
'The most useful contribution I can make is to ensure that the electricity
industry is operating efficiently.'
PowerGen said the review was 'not unexpected. We fully understand the
pressures currently facing Prof Littlechild'.
Dr Bob Hawley, chief executive of Nuclear Electric, the state-owned nuclear
utility, yesterday denied suggestions that nuclear power stations should be
closed to make way for coal. He said this would be a 'quick fix' that would
overlook the long-term benefits of nuclear power.
Nuclear stations could generate electricity at a competitive price and
without emitting gases into the air, he said. Although Nuclear Electric
would receive Pounds 1.2bn in subsidy this year, it aimed to be profitable
by 1995.

FT  23 OCT 92 / PepsiCo to help sell Ukrainian ships in Dollars 1bn deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEPSICO is to help to sell up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) worth of
Ukrainian-built ships on international markets. The deal is expected to lead
to rapid expansion of the US company's soft drink and fast-food restaurant
operations in the former Soviet republic.
The eight-year agreement is one of the biggest western business ventures
involving the former Soviet Union and the largest for the export of
manufactured products yet concluded with Ukraine.
PepsiCo expects to invest almost Dollars 150m to treble its soft drinks
production in the Ukraine, currently about 60m litres a year, and to open as
many as 100 Pizza Hut restaurants there. The first restaurant will open next
year.
The company plans to increase its franchised bottling plants in Ukraine from
seven to 12 in the next two years and will set up local distribution, sales
and marketing networks.
PepsiCo would not disclose its initial investment in the project but said
its planned expansion in Ukraine would be financed out of hard currency
proceeds from ship exports. The Ukrainian treasury will share in profits
from the exports.
A joint venture, Ukrainian Development Corporation, has been formed to
market internationally all the commercial vessels built by the Zaliv
shipyard at Kerch, on the Black Sea. Zaliv aims to double its production
capacity to four merchant ships annually by the year 2000.
The vessels will be sold or leased by Fram Shipping, a privately owned
Bermuda company which is a partner in the joint venture, along with PepsiCo,
Zaliv and Ukrpivo, the Ukrainian state beverage organisation.
Three vessels are already under construction, the first of which will be
completed next spring. The joint venture is committed to taking delivery of
the shipyard's output for the next eight years.
PepsiCo said it was confident Fram could sell or lease all the vessels,
noting that the shipping company had found international customers for
Ukrainian-made ships worth Dollars 300m in the past two years.
The joint venture will take part in the modernisation of the Zaliv shipyard
and will assist in converting some of it to new manufacturing ventures,
including planned production of prefabricated Pizza Hut units.
Ships are one of the few products which Ukraine can hope to sell
internationally. The republic contains many of the former Soviet Union's
shipyards, and most of the capacity is still dedicated to military vessels.

FT  23 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Bank supervision
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England will have less excuse for dithering in the event of
another BCCI now that it is to acquire the power to deny licences to banks
whose structure is unduly complex or secret. Even without that power it
could have acted sooner, as is manifestly clear from yesterday's Bingham
report. Had it done so, depositors might have suffered smaller losses, but
it would be wrong to suppose that the outcry would have been any less
shrill.
The danger - amid all the undoubtedly justified recrimination - is that the
public will conclude that perfect supervision can create a world where bank
deposits are always free of risk. A deposit market which differentiates risk
through pricing is a useful discipline on bank managements to whom the funds
are entrusted. It only works, though, if depositors heed the message in the
price, especially large ones like local authorities.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
French companies so far have been more predatory than their neighbours when
it comes to preparing for the single market. But the Napoleonic ambitions of
Credit Lyonnais are something special. Germany has been the big hole in the
French bank's expanding European network, which is why it comes as little
surprise to learn that negotiations are in hand to purchase a controlling
stake in BfG.
The whole saga is delightfully continental. The so far unconsummated deal
would appear to have been fixed earlier in the year as a condition of French
insurer AGF's successful campaign to consolidate its grip on Aachener und
Munchener Beteiligung. AMB has a 50 per cent stake in BfG. Everyone is
allowed to emerge with credit - not least AMB which should exit cleanly if
not profitably from a costly diversification. There is even the familiar
prospect of minority shareholders getting a raw deal if AGF seeks to turn
influence into control by acquiring Fondiaria's allegedly loose stake in
AMB.
Credit Lyonnais' move will presumably reinforce fears that the French bank
is overstretching itself. But the insurance implications are perhaps more
intriguing. For the moment AGF's German strategy seems to be more successful
than that of its domestic rival UAP, which has not yet managed to wrest
control of Colonia from Groupe Victoire. But the reality remains that two of
Germany's top three insurers are effectively in French hands. It is easy to
carp that the problems of unification may prolong the underwriting downturn
in Germany until 1994 at least. But in Paris they might well retort that the
race has been won before the official starting gun for a barrier-free Europe
has even been fired.

FT  23 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Albert Fisher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In retrospect, it is easy to see how the Albert Fisher magic worked. A
company with a plausible line about European food integration and economies
of scale issues highly priced paper to buy lowly rated fruit trading
businesses. It also takes the precaution of deferring part of the purchase
price through earn-out contracts. The result is electrifying earnings growth
until the deferred cash payments come home to roost. And sadly, the business
does not yield the growth or synergies required to feed investors' heady
expectations. Hence the company's sliding rating relative to the market over
the past five years.
Now the bubble has well and truly burst, the company will have a hard task
generating the organic growth to replace acquisitions. The new chairman, Mr
Stephen Walls, promises to tidy up and look for ways to increase value for
shareholders. Even if he were to juggle assets with other food companies,
the reconstituted sum seems unlikely to be worth more than the current
parts. And it is difficult to place a high valuation on what looks more and
more like a commodity trading company. Earthquakes, riots and hurricanes cut
US profits last year, while near-perfect growing conditions elsewhere
slashed European earnings.
Besides, the company's trading problems do not begin and end with freak
conditions in 1992. Over-competition in fresh produce, partly caused by
renewed South African exports, will keep downward pressure on world fruit
prices. Meanwhile the last drop of net cash will drain out of the business
this year on capital expenditure and earn-out payments. The worst may be
over, but shareholders have little to look forward to.

<TEXT>
Trade policy developments rarely have much immediate impact on financial
markets. Their long-run implications for economic growth are considerable,
however, which is why the setback in the Uruguay Round is such dismal news.
The Dollars 100bn annual boost to world trade arising from a successful
round would, after all, constitute a 3 per cent increase: a welcome antidote
to economic slowdown. Doubtless the insults will flow freely if the
breakdown turns out to be irreparable. The US is far from blameless. But the
European Community's determination to toe the French line has been still
more destructive, even when viewed from the narrow perspective of its own
economic interests.
While the US is at least set to enjoy the benefits of the North American
free trade area and fast growth in the Pacific rim, the EC is struggling to
cope with Maastricht uncertainty, and the economic ravages of tight German
money. The combination of a stronger dollar and possible US economic
recovery after next month's election has created export opportunities which
might offset some of the domestic worry. The US takes some 17 per cent of EC
exports to third countries, still a considerable share even though it has
fallen from 21 per cent five years ago. But chances of export-led recovery
in Europe would be jeopardised if the Uruguay Round collapsed.
Indeed, there is every chance that the US will turn up the heat in the
transatlantic oilseeds dispute by imposing trade sanctions. Washington's hit
list is heavily slewed towards products from Ireland, the home of the EC's
farm commissioner, and France, which it views as the main culprit. Insofar
as this involves wine and spirits, though, the penalty would partly be paid
elsewhere, for example by Guinness through its LVMH connection and
Allied-Lyons which controls Courvoisier.

Outsider on the inside - John Gapper and Bethan Hutton profile a
hard-fighting bank regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BRIAN QUINN, executive director for banking supervision at the Bank of
England, is accustomed to struggle. But his brush with Bank of Credit and
Commerce International has propelled him into the hardest fight of his
career.
Mr Quinn took the decision to shut down BCCI, and it was he who chose not to
do so earlier. Were it not for his conviction that he acted correctly, he
would probably have resigned yesterday. Though he remains in place, the
investigations unit announced yesterday removes primary responsibility for
the investigation of fraud from his department.
Silver-haired Mr Quinn, the son of a Glasgow shipyard worker, has none of
the arrogance that might be expected from one in his position: his manner is
friendly and affable. Yet visitors to his office are struck by his alert,
slightly tense air as he pores over papers or discusses a bank.
Bankers speak with one voice about Mr Quinn. All of them smile first, with
affection and amusement. 'Tough,' says one; 'A real Glasgow street fighter,'
says another. Doubts emerge only after a discreet pause. 'Does he have quite
the stature?' one finally asks.
If stature means the assumption of natural privilege from an early age, the
answer is no. Mr Quinn penetrated the inner circle of the English
establishment from outside. He managed it because of two character traits.
One is a combination of meritocratic qualities: intelligence, hard work,
clarity and energy.
'He is very, very cautious,' says Mr Rattan Bhatia, a friend from the
International Monetary Fund. 'Cautious and far-sighted. Where you and I look
at four sides of a problem, he finds a fifth one.'
The second facet is a strong sense of probity. Mr Quinn is a practising
Roman Catholic, though he has questioned aspects of church doctrine. He has
the Catholic's faith that wrong-doing should be punished and virtue rewarded
 -and that both will happen.
It is this combination that has led Mr Quinn to remain in his job. Friends
attest that since the BCCI scandal broke and he could speak about it, he has
never wavered from believing that his actions were right.
Mr Quinn moved on from his Scots working-class roots when he took a degree
in economics at Glasgow University, then a masters degree at Manchester and
finally a doctorate at Cornell University. He moved to the International
Monetary Fund's Africa department as an economist in 1964, and with his
teacher wife Mary spent two years on secondment in Sierra Leone. They
returned to London in 1970, when he joined the Bank's economic division.
After a seamless rise through the Bank, he became the head of banking
supervision in 1982. It was a rough time to start. Just as he was starting
to settle down, the Johnson Matthey Bankers storm broke.
Mr Quinn survived the subsequent outcry, and moved in 1988 to his current
role. The job is a curious mixture of elevated intellectual analysis and
hard-nosed practicality. His responsibilities include everything from
planning the future framework of international supervision to tackling
senior managers of domestic banks about ill-advised policy.
The pity of BCCI for Mr Quinn is that he finally collided with a bank that
proved too tough and deceitful for him to fight.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Bingham Report - Investigation into the BCCI scandal:
Accountants back extra legal duties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANCY bodies in the UK last night supported the recommendation by Lord
Justice Bingham that auditors should have a legal duty to report to the Bank
of England in certain circumstances outlined in the 1987 Banking Act.
The Bingham conclusions on auditors were greeted with little surprise by the
accountancy firms, which had been widely expecting the move. The accountancy
bodies said they would expect to be consulted before the duty to report
became law.
In a joint statement they said: 'The particular circumstances when a legal
duty is to be imposed will need to be considered with great care to ensure
the obligation is effective, without either encouraging over-reporting by
accountants or auditors or imposing a needless formality into the
preparation of the reports, which may cause delay in their issue to the Bank
of England.'
Mr Robert Charlesworth, secretary of the Auditing Practices Board, the
standard setting body for auditors in the UK, said: 'If the auditor's
position in law is to be changed from a right to a duty then I think there
will be a need for some considerable care given to deciding in what
circumstances the law requires him to make such reports.'
Mr John Tattersall, a partner at Coopers and Lybrand, said he believed the
legal duty 'might well clarify the statutory duty' of auditors.
In the body of Lord Bingham's report he focused on the Bank's relationship
with Price Waterhouse, BCCI auditors. His report said the Bank came to rely
too heavily on the auditors.
The report picked out three prime areas of criticism referring to Price
Waterhouse. All covered failure to communicate crucial information which
might have heightened concerns at earlier dates.
After the auditors discovered substantial unrecorded deposits and other
irregularities at BCCI in December 1990 and the following January, Lord
Bingham concluded that it was 'unfortunate that the opportunity was not
taken to put the Bank as fully in the picture as the known and suspected
facts then permitted'.
The report also highlighted an interview conducted by two PW partners with
Mr Swaleh Naqvi, former chief executive of BCCI, on January 19 1991 which
Lord Bingham said were regarded by the auditors as 'a fairly comprehensive
account of fraud at the Bank'. The conversation was not reported to the
Bank. 'Again I find this puzzling and think the omission was very
unfortunate,' said Lord Bingham.
At a later date, the auditors failed to pass on further accounts of frauds
and malpractices to the Bank of England.
Lord Bingham said there had been no conscious decision by PW to withhold the
information, much of which had already been passed to the Bank. Nonetheless,
he said, 'probably the last opportunity for a clear and comprehensive
understanding to be reached by the bank with the majority shareholders on
the future of the bank' was lost.
The section 41 report would not have come as the 'devastating surprise' as
it did, said Lord Bingham, had Price Waterhouse more plainly and
comprehensively brought elements of fraud to the attention of the Bank.
The report cleared Price Waterhouse of much of the criticism by the Abu
Dhabi majority shareholders surrounding the role of the auditors in the
Section 41 report.
Last night Price Waterhouse welcomed the report and singled out Lord
Bingham's remark that 'the problems came to light in large measure through
the work of PW and the investigating team'.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Bingham Report - Investigation into the BCCI scandal: End to
regulation by a nod and a wink - John Gapper finds that the Bank of
England's lot as policeman of the banking system is not a happy one
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS IT steadied itself this summer for the publication of the Bingham report,
the Bank of England offered an elegant defence of its chequered history of
bank supervision. Mr Eddie George, the deputy governor, made a speech in
which he praised the 'very profound truth' of the observation in the Pirates
of Penzance that 'a policeman's lot is not a happy one'.
When regulatory duty is to be done, the Bank has certainly had a miserable
time over the past 20 years. Starting with the secondary banking crisis of
the 1970s, and continuing through episodes such as the rescue of Johnson
Matthey Bankers in 1984, it has suffered a series of embarrassments in its
efforts to maintain a well-ordered banking system.
The BCCI debacle yesterday provoked the most stinging criticism of its
supervision since the JMB rescue, when Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the
governor, was heavily criticised in parliament. Lord Justice Bingham's
report depicts the Bank as a cautious and bureaucratic regulator lacking the
vision and decisiveness to move briskly against BCCI.
The publication of the report comes at a sensitive time. Although BCCI was
in many respects a unique mishap, supervisors are faced by many other
challenges. The weaknesses of large banks exposed to bad loans in a
recession mean that the Bank holds the reins in one of the most awkward
periods for bank supervision in two decades.
Perhaps inevitably, there is little consensus within the banking industry on
the appropriate balance between regulation and laissez-faire.
Some bankers grumble that politicians are in danger of providing excessive
protection to consumers by over-protective regulation. If consumers come to
believe that a bank can never fail they will not discriminate between good
banks and bad banks when choosing where to place funds.
However, other bankers say the supervisors are occasionally too complacent
and that their institutions could benefit if their business decisions were
challenged more rigorously by the Bank.
The part of the Bank surrounded by this controversy barely existed before
1974. There were 13 officials in the discount office, which supervised
discount houses (the intermediaries between the Bank and the money markets).
They largely operated by 'gossip' with bankers. Although lighter supervision
could hardly be imagined, this worked well enough. The insularity of the
financial system made regulation a simple matter.
The first changes were forced by a liquidity crisis among the unregulated
secondary banks in 1973, which compelled the Bank to organise a Pounds 1.2bn
'lifeboat' with clearers. The crisis showed the importance of financial
institutions that could not be controlled as easily as the first tier of
banks.
Five significant aspects of the Bank's supervisory style were formed in the
mid 1970s:
Its primary aim was to establish confidence in the banking system. Banks
accepted regulation in the early 1970s 'because we convinced them it would
be good for them,' says one official.
It opted to rely on banks' accounts rather than carrying out its own audits.
This is now defended by Bank officials as a matter of principle, but it
started for mundane reasons. It had too little time to train inspectors in
the rush to start regulation, and it feared competent ones would be
recruited by the banks they inspected.
It took the view that there were two sorts of banks: solid ones that did not
need much supervision; and less trustworthy ones that had to be watched
carefully. The 1979 Banking Act enshrined this by allowing the Bank to grant
two forms of licence: a full banking licence and a limited 'deposit taker'
licence.
It was forced to accept the unwelcome notion that it might be wrong. In
spite of pressure from Bank officials to be allowed to remain the sole
arbiters of good banking practice, the 1979 act set up an appeal mechanism.
The Bank has not been defeated on appeal since, but it remains wary about
risking such a blow to its authority.
It started to set formal requirements for banks' exposure to risk. The Bank
established a minimum capital adequacy ratio of 8 per cent. Those it felt
unhappy about could be asked to ensure that capital comprised 15 per cent of
assets, which are principally loans.
From these foundations, the supervision department has grown to the point
where it employs 190 officials. As markets have been deregulated, political
and consumer pressures have grown.
This growth in staff has been accompanied by a rise in formal regulatory
requirements. The drafting of the 1979 act was largely in the hands of the
Bank, and it preserved much of its preferred freedom of manoeuvre behind the
scenes. But the JMB rescue brought fierce criticism of the Bank, and a
stiffening of its duties.
JMB was a supposedly competent fully licensed bank, yet it lent 115 per cent
of its capital to two borrowers. It evaded the net of regulation by making
late and inaccurate returns to Bank supervisors. The Bank was forced to take
it over, and went on to make a tactical error by transferring Pounds 100m of
capital to JMB without telling the government.
The ensuing 1987 act also changed some founding principles of regulation. It
ended the divide between first-tier and second-tier banks, and put the focus
of regulation on protecting depositors. A consequence was that BCCI was
upgraded to full banking status automatically.
Since then the Bank has settled into an uneasy compromise between
comfortable tradition and the new formality. It has resigned itself to
regulating according to the book, while trying to preserve some of its old
freedom of manoeuvre. This compromise means the banking establishment and
the Bank's critics tend to draw contrasting morals from BCCI.
Many of the critics blame the Bank's fondness for 'working with the grain of
the market' for upsets such as BCCI. They say the delay in shutting BCCI, in
spite of intimations of trouble as far back as the 1970s, is symptomatic of
a cautious establishment culture.
Ms Shelagh Heffernan, a senior lecturer in international finance at City
University Business School, says the Bank should exploit the element of
surprise. 'If British banks conduct their own branch audits without warning,
why does the Bank let them know when it is coming?' she says. Yesterday's
announcement of a new investigations unit may go some way to satisfy such
criticism.
Another policy cited as a symptom of attachment to the past is the Bank's
reluctance to act until it is utterly sure something is wrong. It values its
air of infallibility too highly to risk it on appeal. According to a senior
banker: 'There is still a large element of nods and winks in the system, and
the Bank would not want to lose that.'
The result in the BCCI case was that a bank many people had suspected since
was founded was only closed 20 years on. Even within the Bank there is a
recognition that the BCCI affair will have to lead to a greater willingness
to risk its rulings being overturned on appeal.
Even some bank chairmen have recently said in private that they would
support a move towards more adversarial supervision. They say that it could
be a useful discipline. Some say they might have lent less to the property
sector in the 1980s - now the cause of big losses - if supervisors had
challenged their lending policies more forcefully.
Yet others in the banking establishment tend to view BCCI as holding the
opposite lesson. Clearing banks were not happy at first about being
regulated at all, and some bankers have become more uneasy as supervision
has become more onerous. Some bankers chafe at inquiries from, as one puts
it, 'really quite junior Bank people who seem to get intoxicated with their
power, and constantly try to second-guess you'.
Such griping does not unduly dismay the Bank. Officials are happy to have
some evidence of tension between banks and the Bank as they are often
accused of having too cosy a relationship.
Yet the Bank feels sympathy with the idea that regulation has become too
inflexible. It would like back the freedom to act informally against problem
banks without having to stick to rigid rules.
There is also a fear in banking circles that the Bank is slowly being pushed
into removing all the risk from making deposits at banks. 'The essence of
good regulation is that when there is a choice between protecting the
integrity of the system and protecting every single depositor, the system
should come first,' says a bank official.
Such an argument does not impress many politicians or depositors. Most
observers agree that BCCI is likely to shift regulation further towards
formality and aggression. 'The Bank will inevitably have to become more
sceptical, and less chummy,' says Mr Richard Dale, professor of banking at
Southampton University.
Thus the BCCI scandal is likely to mark a further step away from nods and
winks, and towards rules and regulations. The question for the Bank is
whether it can finally shed nostalgia for the past. The banks' policeman has
not yet finished agonising.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Bingham Report - Investigation into the BCCI scandal:
Monitors move to plug international loopholes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE international system of bank regulation failed to put an effective brake
on the fraudulent behaviour of BCCI.
Thus one of the Bank of England recommendations for reform following Lord
Bingham's report is that the UK Banking Act should be amended to prevent an
international bank from exploiting loopholes in the international regulatory
system.
The Banking Act will be reformed so that a bank will not be able to operate
in the UK if the Bank is concerned that it cannot obtain sufficient
information on the institution's overseas operations.
One of BCCI's consummate skills was in playing regulators in one country off
against those in another. These regulators are already taking steps to try
to prevent any other bank from using BCCI's devices to avoid proper
scrutiny.
BCCI's success in eluding effective supervision stemmed from a separation
between its domicile and the location of the bulk of its operations.
Its overall holding company was incorporated in Luxembourg, as was one of
its subsidiaries. Prime responsibility for ensuring BCCI was sound and
properly managed therefore rested with the Institut Monetaire
Luxembourgeois.
In theory, this meant that the IML was responsible for monitoring all BCCI's
international operations on a consolidated - or unified - basis.
However, the bulk of BCCI's activities - 98 per cent of them, according to
the IML - took place outside Luxembourg. As a result the IML, with its
limited resources, found the task of overseeing all these international
operations 'rather beyond them', according to the Bank.
To the IML's credit, in 1985 it notified BCCI's other regulators that it was
uncomfortable with the task of supervising this corporate octopus. A college
of regulators was established in 1987, on the IML's initiative, so that
regulators from eight countries would jointly take responsibility for BCCI.
This college proved to be incapable of monitoring BCCI closely enough. It
was not until 1990, when the Bank began belatedly to take a close interest
in BCCI's activities, that regulators began to learn of the fraud at the
bank. Not until early last year did the scale of the fraud become apparent.
Regulators now agree that it would have been sensible for the Bank to have
taken a closer interest much earlier. More of BCCI's business was in the UK
than anywhere else. Only in a technical sense was it domiciled outside the
UK.
Over the past year, regulators have been trying to devise a way of closing
the loophole that prevented BCCI from being properly supervised. The forum
for debate has been the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, which
comprises the supervisory authorities of the Group of 10 leading industrial
countries and is chaired by Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York.
In July the Corrigan committee issued new minimum standards which its
members agreed to apply in the supervision of international banks.
The committee made an unambiguous commitment that international banks would
be policed rigorously on a worldwide basis by a single regulator. A bank not
supervised in this way would be barred from the territories of signatories
to the agreement.
The minimum standards had four main features:
Any international banking group should be supervised on a 'consolidated
basis', taking account of its operations anywhere in the world, by a single
home country authority.
To set up branches in a jurisdiction outside its home country, a bank would
need regulators' consent in both home and 'host' countries.
A home-country supervisor should have the right to receive information on
the international operations of banks under its supervision.
If a country was unhappy about the international supervision of a bank whose
domicile was elsewhere, it could impose 'restrictive measures' on branches
of that bank on its territory. These could extend to closing down the bank.
These standards will not be easy to implement. Legal impediments, for
example, prevent supervisors in some jurisdictions - even in the US - from
passing information on banks to supervisors elsewhere.
Some regulators are concerned that the reforms do not go quite far enough.
There is, for example, no formal mechanism for ensuring that signatories to
the standards implement them.
Meanwhile, the reforms of the Banking Act proposed yesterday by the Bank and
the government will give the Bank greater powers than those necessitated by
its participation in the Corrigan committee agreement.
The Bank will be able to refuse authorisation to a bank if it sets up
branches in countries lacking an effective supervisor, irrespective of the
quality of the supervision in the bank's home country.
To prevent a repetition of BCCI, trust and co-operation between regulators
is essential. But equally important is the need for individual regulators to
make their own judgments about the fitness of a bank - and not pass the buck
to other regulators.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Bingham Report - Investigation into the BCCI scandal: Abu
Dhabi remains bitter over closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABU DHABI, the majority shareholder in BCCI, said last night it agreed with
Lord Justice Bingham that the Bank of England's supervisory role had been
deficient, but defended itself from criticism of its role in the BCCI
debacle.
In a carefully worded statement, Abu Dhabi said: 'The majority shareholders
are surprised that, as the principal driving force behind efforts to uncover
the fraud in BCCI and then to restructure the bank so that it could operate
on a sound and proper legal basis, they have been the subject of criticism .
. . particularly in the light of their reliance on the regulation of the
bank by the Bank of England, and on the audit reports issued by Price
Waterhouse.'
Privately, Abu Dhabi officials were making it clear that they remain bitter
about the way BCCI was closed by the Bank after restructuring negotiations
had reached an advanced stage.
They admit that Abu Dhabi had been told in April 1990 by Mr Swaleh Naqvi,
former chief executive of BCCI, that deposits belonging to Sheikh Zayed al
Nayan, ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates, had
been misappropriated, but say that this did not constitute a reliable
statement.
They argue that Mr Naqvi, currently detained in Abu Dhabi along with 17
other former BCCI executives, had previously shown himself to be an
unreliable witness, and that his information had been provided verbally and
not written.
In their evidence to the Bingham inquiry, Abu Dhabi and its solicitors,
Simmons &amp; Simmons, have argued that there is no evidence that the Bank would
have behaved differently if it had received details of the Naqvi interview.
They also cited the pressure the Emirate faced during the Gulf war as a
reason for the alleged lack of communication with the regulatory
authorities.
In recent weeks British Foreign Office officials have been working behind
the scenes to offset any potential diplomatic fall-out from the Bingham
report.
But the strength of criticism contained in the report could have a negative
impact on crucial defence contracts that the UK is hoping to sign with Abu
Dhabi.
UK government officials also hold private fears that a diplomatic row could
erupt as a result of the report.
Some Abu Dhabi officials claim their reputation has been impugned by its
contents.

FT  23 OCT 92 / View from down under: Rising backbench influence and policy
retreats hold out little prospect of firm government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We now know the government's strategy. It is stark, and simple. It can be
summed up in one word: survival. Mr John Major and his colleagues will do
whatever is necessary to restore their authority, taking each day as it
comes, defining the medium term as the week after next and the long term as
Christmas. The illusions of grandeur, the aspirations to making Britain the
best in Europe at this or that, are in mothballs. We are in the hands of a
prime minister who, as the little boy would feel obliged to point out, is
adorned by fewer clothes than Madonna.
Nothing is settled. The excitements of the past week have got us precisely
nowhere. Ten days ago there was a policy for the coal mines, and a strategy
of sorts for energy. Today neither exists, and no one can say what will come
in their stead. Forty days ago there was an economic strategy - to bear down
on inflation by staying within the exchange rate mechanism. Today there is
confusion: the announcements made so far constitute not so much a U-turn as
going round in circles. There is still a European strategy - to ratify the
Maastricht treaty. It is Mr Major's last wisp of apparel. It is not at all
certain that it will be in place for much longer.
The plan to close 31 coal mines was first threatened, then derailed, by a
parliamentary coalition between the Labour party, the Liberal Democrats, and
a Churchill-led faction of the Conservative party. The government's retreat
has subsequently been played out before our eyes. Last Friday evening there
was talk of buying off the rebellion with a compensatory fund for retraining
redundant miners. Nothing so cheap was on offer. On Monday the president of
the Board of Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine, bid higher. There would, he said,
be a moratorium on the closure of 21 of the threatened pits, pending
investigations by his department. It looked as though the closure policy was
not being withdrawn - it was merely to be phased in. That was a precipitous
climb-down, but nevertheless insufficient.
On Tuesday the government upped the ante: the 10 pits apparently doomed by
Monday's statement would be kept in order during the 90-day statutory review
period, in case any could be reprieved. As to the other 21 pits, and energy
policy in general, there would be two full reviews, one by the president
himself and one by a parliamentary select committee. Under pressure, Mr
Humbletine piled on hostages to the government's fortune. The economics of
imported coal, and gas-fired generation, would be re-examined; in the end
even nuclear policy was put up for review. If the government is true to this
week's promises it might even re-examine the electricity privatisation which
produced the commanding duopoly that is so patently able to dominate the
market. Theoretically, that too could now be changed.
In consequence, taxpayers could find themselves maintaining, by subsidy, a
larger coal industry than is justified by market demand. To save the
parliamentary day, Mr Heseltease goaded the Labour opposition into behaving
like a gang of drunken schoolboys. That united the Tories. Humbled Mr
Heseltine may have been, but in the practice of pure politics he is still
one of the few outstanding professionals in the administration.
The retreat from the counter-inflation strategy has been even more dramatic.
Only a fortnight ago the prime minister spoke in Brighton as if the pursuit
of low inflation was still the overriding objective. That lasted about a
week. Under heavy political fire, interest rates fell by a full point last
Friday. This Tuesday Mr Major, taking the concept of 'open government' more
seriously than previously thought possible, started to make economic policy
pronouncements on television. He stressed growth on one news bulletin and
forgot to mention inflation on another. Treasury officials must have found
it relaxing to hear the prime minister's rapidly changing aspirations
explained to them as they sat in the comfort of their own homes, watching
the flickering screen.
I do not wish to be unfair. The economic question of the moment is whether
we are on the brink of a global depression. No British government acting
alone can do much about that. Mr Major is painfully aware of this. I am
certain that what he wants is sustained non-inflationary growth, as he
intimated in answers to parliamentary questions yesterday. Contrary to the
mutterings in public bars and around City luncheon tables, he is not
foolish. He is a politician of greater personal resilience than is generally
acknowledged. His problem is that he is running out of political capital. He
can no longer feel certain, as he did until September 16, that with a full
term in office ahead of him he could afford to play a long game, battering
inflation down towards 2 per cent or less, in the know-ledge that the
recovery would come in time for the next election.
Worse, he has now lost both the affection of much of the electorate and his
authority over much of his party. In such circumstances the prime minister's
only political option is to speak stirringly of growth. 'It is our intention
to pursue a strategy that will bring recovery, with it growth, with it jobs
and with it prosperity,' he said in the house yesterday. 'It is essential
that that moves right to the centre of thinking in each and every aspect of
Government policy . . .' As to inflation, he is merely keeping his fingers
crossed.
What will happen next will be dictated by events. Take, for example, public
spending cuts, which conventional wisdom says are needed to offset the
inflationary effect of reductions in interest rates. If the cuts are
serious, public sector pay increases must be held to 2 per cent or less. The
Royal College of Nursing is at least as adept at playing on public sympathy
as the National Union of Mineworkers. If the government caves in to the NUM,
why not the nurses? If the nurses, why not disgruntled householders saddled
with the new council tax? We are back to the old days, when proponents of
every vested interest have good reason to try their luck.
This prognostication of continuing political impotence can be taken too far.
Anti-Maastricht plotters are forgetting that the Labour party underpinned
the government's defeat on the coal closure plan. Labour is more likely to
abstain than to vote against a Maastricht ratification bill. It will
nevertheless be a close-run thing, with the prize going to the side with the
greatest parliamentary stamina.
The opposition is not about to help the government by voting to close off
filibusters by Tory Europhobes who seek to talk the bill to death, or
postpone its reintroduction. Yet if the bill is defeated, Mr Major's hold on
office will become extremely tenuous. Within the Conservative party, a vote
for Maastricht is becoming a vote for Mr Major, and vice-versa. Heads will
be counted at a debate due on November 4, the Tory backbenchers' 1922
committee permitting.
The most likely outcome is still a victory for the bill, and for Mr Major.
On that assumption, we can take it that the prime minister will survive,
battered but still in office, for long enough to be floated back to safety
by an economic upturn - one day. That is the good news. The other half is
that, politics being what it is, by-elections are likely to wear down the
Conservatives' majority of 21. As his term lengthens, Mr Major will become
more, not less, in thrall to the whims of his back-benchers. If firm
government is what you are after, it is not a comforting prospect.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid all the fuss over the relationship between BBC chairman Marmaduke
Hussey and Sir Michael Checkland, the BBC director general, it is worth
recalling the advice of a former BBC chairman, the late Lord Swann.
Lord Swann, who died a couple of years ago, said that the director general
should drive while the chairman be left to read the map. Many feel that the
problem with Hussey is not his age but the fact that he has been doing too
much driving and not enough map-reading.
One of the side-effects is that not enough thought has gone into making the
key appointments to the corporation at a particularly sensitive time in its
affairs. Pamela Taylor, the new director of corporate affairs, is an able
recruit, but John Tusa steps down as managing director of the World Service
at the end of the year and there is still no word yet on his replacement.
The powers that be at the BBC are thought to be keen to see a woman in the
World Service job - which helps explain why the names of Jenny Abramsky,
editor of BBC radio's news and current affairs, and Patricia Hodgson, head
of the planning and policy unit, are frequently mentioned. However, one
other name being canvassed is that of Cheung Man-Yee, director of programmes
at Radio and TV Hong Kong. She also happens to be chairing a Commonwealth
Broadcasting Association conference in Botswana at the moment.
Perhaps Sir Michael Checkland has gone to check her out?

'Don't ask me where I'll find the time', says David James, one of Britain's
best-known company doctors, who now wants to add membership of the governing
council of Lloyd's of London to his heavy caseload.
James already works 80 hours a week in his role as chairman of Lep Group,
Eagle Trust and Davies &amp; Newman. He has been a Name at the insurance market
for 10 years and currently trades Pounds 850,000 on the market.
He says that he 'cottoned on' to the problems of the spiral reinsurance
syndicates - which account for half of Lloyd's last reported loss of Pounds
2.06bn, and believes that many of the Names facing heavy losses were
'totally ignorant of what they were getting into'.
Tate and Lyle boss Neil Shaw, who is also chairman of the Association of
Lloyd's members, says that he is impressed by James and his 'no-nonsense
grasp' of the issues now facing the insurance market. Hence the ALM is
taking the unusual step of backing James for the one vacancy for an external
member in this year's elections.
However, James already has more than enough to worry about without trying to
advise Lloyd's on its problems. If British Airways does come to the rescue
of Dan-Air, perhaps he may have more time available. But it won't have done
his reputation much good.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Letter: Prosperity must be earned, and interest rates used

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr S CARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In an otherwise commendable editorial 'A New policy framework' (October
22) there is evidence of a continuing reluctance to view the efficacy of
interest rate changes with consistency or realism.
What the experience of the period from late-1988 to mid-1990 illustrated
clearly was that interest rate changes have a very slow impact upon
inflation. Yet you speak of raising interest rates should wage inflation
cease its decline.
Again, it is stated that rate increases could be needed within the new
strategy should sterling collapse. But would not an absence of credibility,
initially at least, in the new strategy neutralise the effectiveness of such
manoeuvres?
I do not believe in any case that under the general strategy as espoused the
problem would necessarily be one of need to raise interest rates. Rather
that the resultant improvement in the British economy would lead to a strong
appreciation of sterling against the currencies of the (declining) European
countries by 1993, bringing with it the conflict of whether to use base
rates to control domestic inflationary pressures, or to prevent any further
increase in the exchange rate, the former requiring (arguably) higher
interest rates, the latter rate reductions.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your various correspondents who have put forward proposals for reform
of the UK economy have, with respect, missed the fundamental point: economic
conditions are by and large the result of individual decisions not
government decisions. National prosperity is simply the sum of the
prosperity of that nation's citizens.
Our earning ability, as an individual, is determined by our skill,
knowledge, and motivation. If most of us, as individuals, can honestly say
that we are as productive, pound for pound or dollar for dollar, as our
opposite number in France, Germany, Japan, Taiwan or the US, or wherever,
then our long-term prosperity as a person or as a nation is assured.
The fundamental, long-term problem with the UK economy is that, taken as a
whole, our aspirations as consumers outstrip our earning capacity as
producers when compared with the citizens of many other leading economies.
Government may temporarily change the relative costs of home-produced and
foreign goods, or the benefits of borrowing rather than lending, but no
short-term measure will transform us into a nation of highly-skilled,
highly-motivated, high-earning (and I do mean earning) people. Similarly,
trade unions or industry pressure-groups may all too easily be tempted to
try to stem the tide of change rather than accept and plan for a different
and more difficult future.
However, the nature of the problem and the time-scale for recovery demand
far greater levels of maturity and honesty than are usually credited by the
electorate to politicians or politicians to the electorate. Gaze firmly
fixed on the next election (or party conference) the politician pretends to
have all the answers, thus conveniently relieving the rest of us of
responsibility for the inevitable failure of palliatives.
The truth is that if we (yes, all of us) do not have the commitment and the
strategy to improve our economic capacity relative to that of our trading
partners, our decline will continue inexorably, the associated pain
alleviated only briefly by those periodic bouts of inflationary euphoria to
which we, in all probability, are yet again condemned.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Letter: Amortising goodwill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL BIRKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Profesor Arnold's excellent article on accounting for goodwill ('A new
approach to valuation of the intangible', October 15) will, I believe, be
broadly welcomed by industry, except in one regard - the requirements that
'any goodwill capitalised should be amortised against profit over its useful
economic life'.
In fact, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales report
provides, I believe, for the value of certain assets such as brands to be
reviewed periodically and does not require amortisation if it can be shown
that there has been no decline in value. Conversely, if the economic life of
the asset is indeterminate and there is no identifiable decline in value,
the amortisation period can be infinite.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Letter: House prices still too high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JONATHAN LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While I agree with Barry Riley (The Long View, October 17) that 'house
prices are not low,' Mr Riley does not go far enough. In 1979, before Lady
Thatcher's first general election victory, a typical mortgage of under
Pounds 20,000 was well within the Pounds 25,000 ceiling for mortgage
interest tax relief. With higher basic rates of income tax in those far-off
days, the interest on a typical mortgage received a 33 per cent tax subsidy.
In 1992, only 60 per cent of a typical Pounds 50,000 mortgage is eligible
for tax relief at a rate of 25 per cent.
Mortgage interest nowadays, therefore, typically receives a tax subsidy of
around 15 per cent. I contend that the changed tax regime means that the
house price:earnings ratio needs to fall to somewhere in the range 2.5-3.0
to be comparable to the historic average of 3.0-3.5.
House prices are still too high, by a factor of about 20 per cent.

<TEXT>
Sir, We employ more than 1,500 people in the electronics industry in the
Rhondda and Aberdare valleys of south Wales and, to say the least, things
are difficult. Fortunately, 30 per cent of our product is exported directly
to EC countries and without that we would have been in more than extreme
difficulties.
We, along with most industrialists in the UK small and large, are under more
pressure then ever before. I wish to suggest a simple remedy that would
start the economy back on the road to recovery and create world-wide
confidence.
The quickest way to create jobs and confidence is to get the house building
sector moving again;
Mortgage interest relief should be increased from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds
75,000 for a period of three to five years, subject to regular review; at
the same time, mortgage tax relief should be increased from 25 per cent to
50 per cent;
Building houses is the quickest way of creating male jobs in all sectors of
the community - and no one can deny that there is an urgent need for more
houses. This scheme should really be self-financing because the cost of tax
relief to first time buyers will be more than offset by the reduction in the
benefits currently being paid to unemployed construction workers.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Letter: The broader arguments against means testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms FRAN BENNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Willman ('Means to a public spending end', October 19) concludes
that 'with pressure on public expenditure now growing, criticism of
universal benefits is likely to become increasingly difficult to resist,'
and cites in particular child benefit and retirement pensions as candidates
for the means test.
In the course of his article, however, he puts several cogent arguments
against further means-testing - including its manifest failure to deliver
benefits to all who need them and its negative impact on incentives to work
and to save. But this does not exhaust the debate, of course.
Right-wingers, for example, have become increasingly concerned about the
growing intrusion of the state into people's private lives which the spread
of means-testing has already brought about. Means-testing child benefit
and/or pensions would hit precisely those households on modest means whom
Labour was concerned about when putting forward its own pre-election tax
proposals. And means-tested benefits, in the context of a society which puts
such a premium on individual economic success, are too often seen as a badge
of failure, both by their recipients and by those who fund them.
If resources are tight, there are many forms of public spending - or
foregone tax revenue - which would repay close examination before we get to
'universal' benefits.
A society which used its social security system merely to relieve poverty
once it had struck would have a distressingly narrow view of 'welfare'.

FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: Valmet trims deficit to FM213m
as margins improve

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VALMET, the Finnish state-owned paper machinery and engineering group, has
cut losses after financial items to FM213m (Dollars 44.60m) in the first
eight months from FM529m in the same period last year.
Sales grew by 22.3 per cent to FM5.03bn, reflecting the group's acquisition
of the remaining 50 per cent of Saab-Valmet in March and the purchase of 91
per cent of Tampella Papertech in May.
Valmet noted that its operating margin was FM357m, compared with a negative
FM187m a year ago, and cash-flow had also turned positive.
However, financial expenses rose sharply to FM226m from FM56m, due to the
group's expansion and high interest rates.
The group expects to remain in the red for the full year, but the loss
should be less than last year's FM616m deficit.
Full-year sales are estimated at slightly more than FM9bn.
Nobel Industries, the Swedish industrial group, made a profit (after
financial items) of SKr248m (Dollars 43.57m) in the first eight months of
the year, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm.
This was an improvement on the SKr193m profit made for the same period of
1991, although invoiced sales fell by 14 per cent to SKr14.03bn from
SKr16.2bn.
The company said that the international recession would have a negative
influence on its activities but in spite of this it believed profits (after
financial items) for 1992 would be better than the SKr460m it achieved last
year.
Nobel improved profits in the first eight months in its pulp and paper
chemicals division (up from SKr56m to SKr73m), paints and adhesives (up from
SKr118m to SKr144m) surface chemistry (up from SKr31m to SKr95m) and defence
electronics (up from SKr34m to SKr45m).

FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: Paradoxical profit promised by
US disasters - Nikki Tait examines how insurers could reap gold from the
whirlwind
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE television pictures were horrific. Flattened trailer homes stretched as
far the camera could see; sweating, distraught individuals fought over ice
trucks and food supplies; children played amid rubble and overturned
vehicles.
But, if Hurricane Andrew left a trail of human devastation across southern
Florida in late-August, did it at least do US property-casualty insurers a
good turn?
The industry could use some help. It has been stuck in a 'downswing' of the
insurance cycle for five years, an uncomfortably extended stretch.
Under conventional insurance theory, this is the period when pricing is
'soft', and insurers cannot push through meaningful premium increases. As a
result, they make a loss on their underwriting activities, although they may
still be profitable overall thanks to income on their investment holdings.
For much of the Sixties and Seventies, these 'downswings' lasted for about
three or four years. The cycle would then 'turn', as underwriting capacity -
for a variety of reasons - withdrew from the marketplace. Remaining insurers
duly increased their rates; their underwriting losses dwindled; and
eventually they made money on insurance activ-ities.
In more recent years, however, the industry has found the downswings
becoming more pronounced, and the upswings less so. The last cycle, for
example, began with a downswing in 1977, which lasted for seven years.
It 'turned' in 1984, and insurers did enjoy three years of improving
conditions. But, before the industry overall could move to an underwriting
profit, the cycle turned down again in 1987. The current downswing has
continued ever since.
The question, then, is whether Hurricane Andrew is the catalyst which will
push capacity out of the market, allow remaining insurers to raise rates,
and move property-casualty (P-C) insurers in the direction of an
underwriting profit.
Some Wall Street analysts certainly think so, and Wednesday's revised
estimate of the hurricane losses - up from Dollars 7.8bn to a staggering
Dollars 10.7bn - adds weight to their case.
'Disastrous damage inflicted by Hurricane Andrew should be large enough to
cause a turn in the P-C pricing cycle,' suggest analysts at Kidder, Peabody,
for example. 'The improvement in pricing should start to be evident with
January 1993 renewals.'
Such thoughts have prompted a rally in the shares of P-C insurers - with the
result that the Dow Jones index for the P-C insurance industry group has
advanced by almost 10 per cent since late-August, compared with a slightly
weaker equity market overall. A similar trend has been evident recently in
the reinsurance sector.
Proponents of this bullish scenario have a handful of arguments to bolster
their case. First, they point out that Hurricane Andrew came after a series
of costly disasters earlier in the year.
These included the Los Angeles riots and some less-publicised but extremely
violent storms which hit the grain belt. Ahead of Hurricane Andrew,
therefore, 1992's insured losses from US catastrophes totalled almost
Dollars 4bn - only slightly below the Dollars 4.2bn cost of Hurricane Hugo,
previously the most expensive insured disaster.
Secondly, US P-C insurers are generally thought to hold less catastrophe
reinsurance that they did a few years ago, and hence will have to bear a
larger part of the losses themselves.
In the past, reinsurers - often non-US organisations, like Lloyds of London
 -have picked up 30 to 40 per cent of a catastrophe's losses. Today, most
analysts put the figure at nearer 20-30 per cent - a reduction which, in
turn, reflects increased caution on the part of the hard-hit reinsurance
industry.
Finally, there is the sheer size of the Hurricane Andrew insurance bill. In
early-September, the property claims division for the American Insurance
Services Group, an industry trade organisation, estimated the insured losses
to be around Dollars 7.3bn in Florida and perhaps another Dollars 500m in
Louisiana, the second state affected by the storm.
This week, it raised the figure for the two states to Dollars 10.7bn. It
blamed this 37 per cent increase, at least in part, on jacked-up
construction costs in Florida, and heavy rain which followed the hurricane
and prevented some immediate repair work, compounding the long-term damage.
Even so, a few industry executives and analysts, who have seen hopes of a
turn in the cycle dashed before, still urge caution. For a start, the
property-casualty industry is thought to be well capitalised at present  - a
sharp contrast to the life sector, where more substantial exposure to
property-related investments is taking its toll.
P-C insurers generally have very low exposures to property-related holdings
and high-yield bonds - the types of investment which have caused problems
for life companies.
On the plus side, this should allow the industry to absorb the losses
without too much anguish. Moody's, the large Wall Street rating agency,
notes that the sector's aggregate capital at end-1991 was Dollars 158bn, or
'plenty to cover this year's storm costs'. But, conversely, the pressure to
push up rates may be mitigated.
Secondly, there are some concerns that political considerations will weigh
in. Much play has already been made of an internal memo from Mr Maurice
Greenberg, head of the large American Insurance Group (AIG), to executives
on August 24. Mr Greenberg, writing just after the hurricane struck,
suggested that the storm presented an opportunity to 'get prices increases
now'.
That, in turn, prompted the state insurance commissioners in Florida and
Louisiana to freeze AIG's rates for 60 days while they examined the
company's practices.
To date, there have been no indications that repercussions from the leaked
memo will more widespread.
Nevertheless, consumer groups have leapt on the bandwagon, with the result
that rate increases - always a touchy subject - have become
doubly-sensitive.
Finally, it is worth remembering that the impact of the hurricane has not
been spread evenly - either between individual insurance companies, or
between the various elements within the P-C market.
How the storm will affect different insurance lines is still a hotly-debated
subject.
Some pundits believe the economic structure of Florida's Dade County - a
large number of poor and probably under-insured residential properties but
some big retail malls which were effectively flattened - means that pricing
in the difficult commercial multi-peril market stands a good chance of
firming.
Others claim that other external factors will keep commercial lines 'soft',
and the impact will be confined to personal lines.
Still, the proof of the pudding in the eating - and some signs of discomfort
are already becoming evident in individual situations. Only this week
American Reliance Group, a New Jersey-based property-casualty insurer, said
it had reached the limits of its catastrophe reinsurance coverage, and
needed to raise capital in the wake of rising losses from the hurricane.
The fourth-quarter dividend was axed, and management did not rule out a sale
of the company. And American Reliance, one suspects, may not be alone in its
misery.

FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: Anglo American lifts quarterly
gold earnings by 10.3%

ANGLO American, the world's largest gold producer, lifted attributable
profits at its gold operations by 10.3 per cent to R152.8m (Dollars 52.5m)
in the September quarter, from R138.5m in the three months to June.
Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of the gold and uranium division, attributed the
improved performance to 'good production results and some savvy hedging'.
Gold production at the five mines in the group rose to 65,105kg from
63,590kg, and the average revenue per kg of gold during the quarter was 0.7
per cent higher at R33,031 per kg compared with R32,786 per kg - well above
the spot price for bullion, which was closer to R30,000 per kg.
Commenting on the performance of Freegold, Mr Lionel Hewitt, managing
director of the division, said that, although gold produced rose slightly to
28,257kg from 28,059kg, the mine remained marginal: a 1 per cent increase in
revenues and a 3 per cent increase in costs produced a 9 per cent fall in
working profit.
Attributable profit fell slightly to R60m from R61.8m. He stressed, though,
that the mine was in much better shape than 18 months ago, when more than 50
per cent of its 24 shafts were not covering costs.
Vaal Reefs had a steady quarter, with production constant at 18,870kg.
Attributable profits rose to R53.5m from R48.6m. Mr Hewitt said the mine was
well placed to increase future production capacity. Earlier in the week,
shaft sinking started at the new R1.7bn Moab project, an extension to the
Vaal Reefs lease area.
Western Deep Levels recovered partially from its recent difficulties to push
production up by 10 per cent to 9,985kg from 9,096kg, but Anglo said the
mine had further to go before it regained the 1991 annualised production
level of 41 tonnes. Attributable profits rose to R18.6m from R10.9m.
Elandsrand benefited from improved grades to produce a record 4,832kg
against 4,582kg and attributable profits rose to R15.7m from R12.1m.

DYNO INDUSTRIER, the Norwegian chemicals group, suffered a decline in

The group also announced the transfer of Scandinavian dynamite production to
Norway, which means it will cut 100 jobs from Nitro Nobel 650-strong Swedish
workforce. Dyno said local dynamite sales had fallen sharply in the past
five years.
Nine-month sales fell by NKr259m to NKr5.57bn as operating profit slipped to
NKr315m from NKr320m.

FT  23 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Conflicting influences put
Dow on see-saw

Wall Street
US SHARE prices ended mixed yesterday after fluctuating amid the conflicting
influences of weaker bond prices, some unexpectedly good jobs news and a
mixed batch of corporate earnings reports, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 13.78 at 3,200.88,
having spent the day see-sawing within 20 points either side of Wednesday's
close. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished down 0.77 at
414.90, while the Amex composite closed 1.09 lower at 374.51 and the Nasdaq
down 0.03 at 597.12.
Turnover on the NYSE was again heavy, at 216m shares, and declines outpaced
rises by 961 to 787. The market opened in a positive mood, buoyed up by the
news that weekly state unemployment insurance claims fell by 15,000 in the
week ended October 10. Analysts had been expecting a rise in claims. But the
early gains did not last and shares lost ground by mid-morning in the wake
of further declines in bond prices.
Although the weakness in bonds was primarily due to some unusual trades on
the Chicago futures market the move in the market was enough to unsettle
equities, which moved into negative territory just before midday. After an
uneventful afternoon, blue-chip prices picked up ground on some late buying.
Earnings reports continued to pour in from some of the biggest companies.
AT&amp;T firmed Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 41 7/8 after the telecommunications
giant announced third quarter net income of 72 cents a share, a substantial
improvement on the Dollars 1.40 loss incurred at the same stage a year ago.
BankAmerica, however, failed to impress, the stock dropping Dollars 2 3/8 to
Dollars 41 5/8 in turnover of 3.5m shares after the west coast banking group
reported a modest improvement in net income to Dollars 1.22 a share, but
also announced a Dollars 600m rise in problem assets.
Salomon was another big loser, dropping Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 33 1/2 in
turnover of 1.9m shares after the group announced a 95 per cent decline in
third quarter profits to just Dollars 6m in the wake of a sharp drop in
trading profits at its securities subsidiary.
Sears Roebuck fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 41 5/8 after the company unveiled
a Dollars 2.25 a share loss for the third quarter following big charges
against earnings to cover write-offs and losses at its insurance unit caused
by Hurricane Andrew.
Canada
TORONTO gains in the mining sector were offset by a decline in gold shares,
leaving the overall market little changed. The TSE 300 composite index added
6.14 points, or 0.19 per cent, to 3,258.77, with advances over declines 273
to 257.
Volume climbed to 34.3m shares worth CDollars 277.5m against the previous
25.7m worth CDollars 252.1m.

<TEXT>
INVESTORS remained on the sidelines on uncertainties over a factional row
within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and a possible discount rate cut,
and the Nikkei average finally closed lower after moving within a narrow
range, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei ended 128.48 lower at the day's low of 17,013.04 after share
prices lost ground on late futures-related arbitrage selling. Earlier, the
day had been punctuated by falls on profit-taking, an afternoon recovery on
foreign interest, and index-linked buying by investment trusts which pushed
the index up to the day's high of 17,178.54.
Volume rose to 210m shares from 168m. Losers outnumbered gainers by 488 to
380, with 218 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks shed
5.06 to 1,293.27 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.91 to
1042.36.
Traders said that some investors would remain inactive until the US
presidential elections in November were over. 'The possible Clinton victory
has not been discounted into share prices,' said Mr Ross Purdie at SG
Warburg. He added that the currency market would be most affected, and that
Japanese investors had not hedged their positions to gain from the outcome.
Expectations of lower interest rates buoyed interest rate-sensitive,
large-capital issues. Nippon Steel rose Y3 to Y295 and Sumitomo Metal
Industries added Y1 to Y271.
Dealers again focused on Interferon-related stocks. Inabata gained by its
daily limit of Y200 to Y1,370, while Daiichi Pharma-ceutical gained Y60 to
Y1,680.
Financial issues were weaker on profit taking. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank fell Y30
to Y1,470 and Mitsubishi Bank lost Y30 to Y2,090.
Uni Charm, the diaper maker, surged Y130 to Y1,610. The company projects a
37 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits for the year to March next year.
Nikkiso also gained Y71 to Y620 on a firm earnings forecast.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 71.75 to 18,798.71 in volume of 11.4m shares.
Pharmaceutical and machinery shares rose on small-lot buying. Ono
Pharmaceutical rose Y100 to Y5,610.
Roundup
HIGHS in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand enlivened the region yesterday.
HONG KONG saw a torrent of institutional demand which took turnover up from
HKDollars 4.19bn to HKDollars 6.34bn, just below the record HKDollars 6.42bn
set on May 25. The Hang Seng index ended 128.27 or 2.1 per cent higher at
6,329.12.
Hutchison Whampoa featured after a report, denied by the company, that it
may close down or sell the overseas investments of its telecommunications
arm. Hutchison topped the most active list, gaining HKDollars 1.90 to
HKDollars 17.80.
BANGKOK broke above the 900 mark on the SET index which closed 18.83 or 2.1
per cent higher at a new 18-month high of 902.76 in turnover of Bt15.52bn.
The top five active stocks were all banks, and the banking group accounted
for 46 per cent of total market turnover led by Krung Thai Bank, which rose
Bt10 to Bt238, and Bangkok Bank, up Bt7 to Bt93.
KUALA LUMPUR closed at its high for the year on strong buying by both
domestic and foreign institutional investors, particularly from Singapore
and Hong Kong. The composite index advanced 8.02 to 623.87 as volume rose to
173m shares after Tuesday's 112m.
SEOUL closed firmer in active trading as strong buying outweighed surges of
profit-taking. The composite index ended 9.26 higher at 568.97 in turnover
of Won517.1bn after Won431.9bn. MANILA slid after Philippine Long Distance
Telephone fell back in the US. The composite index lost 26.47 to 1,327.68 in
combined turnover of some 263m pesos. PLDT fell 25 pesos to 920.
AUSTRALIA saw heavy turnover in Foster's rights as the All Ordinaries index
rose 4.3 to 1,448.2. Some 100m Foster's rights changed hands at between 14
and 16 cents each and the brewer's shares closed 5 cents higher at ADollars
1.24 in volume of 5.8m shares.
Stocks with exposure to Papua New Guinea were calmer: they were affected
recently after the government there said it might re-negotiate mining
contracts. Placer Pacific and Highlands Gold each rose 1 cent to ADollars
1.75 and 85 cents respectively.
NEW ZEALAND, pleased with the successful listing of Natural Gas, a division
of Fletcher Challenge, saw the NZSE-40 index gain 7.89 to 1,381.21 in
turnover of some NZDollars 26m.
Natural Gas, which had an issue price of 90 cents, closed the day at 98
cents, while Fletcher Challenge closed down 4 cents at NZDollars 1.76.
BOMBAY recovered on the last day of trading in the Hindu year, the BSE Index
peaking at 3,002.16 before 52.63 higher at 2,987.29 after Wednesday's fall
of 116.24.

FT  23 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Beregovoy remarks tease Paris
bourse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES shed more of their enthusiasm, contemplating a sharp deterioration
in economic expectations and the limited consolation of interest rate
prospects, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS rose on remarks by the prime minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, that he
hoped he would be able to cut French interest rates quite soon, but fell
back when the central bank failed to deliver. After a high of 1,750.42 the
CAC-40 index ended 8.50 higher at 1,730.74 in turnover of FFr2.6bn.
The biggest moves came in Matra and Hachette, as Wednesday's merger terms
appeared to favour Matra shareholders. Trading in both shares resumed
yesterday and Matra rose FFr20.10 or 11.2 per cent to FFr198.90 while
Hachette dropped FFr24.40 or 18.9 per cent to FFr104.60.
Oil shares held on to their gains with Elf adding FFr3.80 to FFr349 and
Total rising FFr4.80 to FFr235.80. Lafarge gained another FFr6.40 to
FFr302.40 while Eurotunnel fell FFr1 or 3.2 per cent to FFr30.10.
FRANKFURT saw the day's biggest price changes coming in second-line stocks.
The DAX index rose 7.21 to 1,510.11 as turnover fell from DM6.3bn to
DM5.7bn.
Among senior blue chips, there was no consistency of performance. Lower down
the order, KHD and Continental responded to job cutbacks, the engineer
falling DM2.90 to DM87 and the tyremaker by DM7 to DM194.
Retailers were mostly lower but Kaufhof put on another DM9 to DM439.
Lufthansa rose DM6 to DM102.50. Mr Alex Magona of MAP Securities said that
its recently announced cut of 400 pilots' jobs, from a total of 3,200, were
probably keeping recovery prospects in mind after a more than halved share
price at one point this year.
AMSTERDAM saw another bad day for DAF and Philips, which led the CBS
Tendency index 0.8 lower to 104.5.
The truck maker announced it would defer paying a dividend this year on its
convertible cumulative preference shares and they slipped to close Fl 1.80
lower at Fl 12.00 while the ordinaries lost Fl 2.00 or 14 per cent to Fl
11.50.
Reports in the local press that Philips might seek wage cuts left the shares
down Fl 1.00 at Fl 19.80. Earnings downgrades upset DSM and Akzo which fell
Fl 1.50 and Fl 2.40 respectively to FL 87.00 and Fl 128.90 while rumours
that Fokker was facing cash flow problems weakened the shares by 50 cents to
FL 16.80.
MILAN firmed further but trading was uneventful. The Comit index rose 3.74
to 412.42 in turnover estimated at around Wednesday's L155.9bn.
Credito Italiano steadied after Wednesday's heavy fall, closing L10 higher
at L2,035. Fiat, which announced production and jobs cutbacks, rose L43 to
L4,293.
MADRID's general index rose 1.38 to 200.05 as financials and utilities
registered good gains. A fall in bond yields in the last few days also
supported equities.
STOCKHOLM registered its third consecutive gain, as lower interest rates
continued to support the market. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 8.8 to
701.0 in turnover of SKr459m after SKr466m.
B shares in SCA rose SKr2 to SKr73 in spite of a 96 per cent plunge in
eight-month pre-tax profit. A forecast of break-even for the full year
encouraged the market, which had been fearing a loss.
COPENHAGEN put banks under pressure following reports of big losses at two
regionals, Varde and Sydjyske, writes Hilary Barnes. Danske Bank fell DKr7
to DKr214 and Unidanmark by DKr2 to DKr102. The all-share index fell by 0.43
to 257.44.
BRUSSELS closed firmer, but steel stocks fell on dividend cut fears, with
Arbed losing BFr65 to BFr2,225. Glaverbel fell BFr250 to BFr3,490 on a
report, denied by the company, that it would make a capital increase by
year-end. The Bel-20 index inched 3.51 higher to 1,121.68.
HELSINKI saw a 9.8 per cent rise in bank shares on the fall in domestic
interest rates. The Hex index rose 14.1, or 2.1 per cent to 675.9.

FT  23 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Euroinsurers suddenly come to life -
But, there are serious doubts about their sustaining this recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European insurance sector is suddenly showing signs of life after a year
in which it has seriously underperformed the markets as a whole.
The shares of the French companies Axa, Assurances Generales de France (AGF)
and Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) rose by around 10 per cent in the
first half of the week, for example, while UK companies Royal and Sun
Alliance and Sweden's Skandia were also up sharply.
Analysts have put forward the possibility of shifts in German economic
policy and lower interest rates to explain the shift in sentiment. However,
the scope for recovery appears to be limited. In the longer term, fears
about asset deflation, increased competition and higher claims are likely to
undermine investor confidence.
'There is growing unease about the trend towards an asset deflationary
environment,' says Mr Angus Runciman, an analyst with BNP Securities, whose
insurance index shows that insurance shares, until just over a week ago, had
underperformed the broader European markets by 27 per cent since August
1991. 'We doubt that the sector is on course to repeat the very strong
performance of the mid-1980s.'
The severity of the insurance sector's underperformance has been heavily
influenced by events in Scandinavia where the failure of ambitious takeover
plans has led to turmoil on the markets.
But German, Spanish, Italian and French insurance shares have also been hit,
falling by between 15 and 20 per cent in the third quarter alone.
A fall in asset prices is one of the main reasons. Over the past few years a
number of major European companies have spent heavily on overseas
acquisitions, dissipating a hitherto unused pool of investment assets.
French companies, in particular, have been hit by a fall in property prices.
Their investments in property account for about 75 per cent of shareholders'
funds, according to Mr Bob Yates, an analyst with Fox Pitt Kelton.
Falls in property values of up to 30 per cent have reduced the scope for
realised capital gains, which have traditionally bolstered bottom-line
profitability, and left insurance companies' banking subsidiaries with
losses on property-related loans.
Many continental European companies account for their assets at historic
rather than market cost, limiting the real damage to balance sheets from the
fall in asset values.
Even so investors' perceptions have been adversely affected. 'Events in
Scandinavia have prompted people to ask whether the assets are really there.
Markets are beginning to realise how quickly assets can be eroded,' says Mr
Runciman.
Mr Yates agrees: 'It's psychological. People are aware that assets are
falling and they lose interest in insurers. There is a 'feel bad' factor at
work.'
Whereas in the bull markets of the 1980s investors were attracted by the
rapidly rising asset values of insurers, in the 1990s they are looking
increasingly at earnings.
Yet this is at a time when profitability is being squeezed. While falling
interest rates have depressed investment income, rising claims and
continuing competition are hitting underwriting results.
Insurers have been taken by surprise by the increase in claims frequencies
this year, says Mr Tim Dawson, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, citing the
sharp increase in car thefts in France, Italy, Germany and the UK.
'The earnings quality of German and French companies has been seriously
eroded because of the rise in non-life claims,' he adds.
At the same time, overcapacity and the continuing threat of rate competition
is undermining the scope for rate increases.
This is particularly the case in markets like Germany and the Italy, where
rates for personal lines insurance have been maintained at artificially high
levels.
Although the new European framework for cross-border trading has only just
been agreed, many companies are only beginning to adapt their strategies,
and capital is still trapped inside national boundaries.
However, the supply of capital into the industry could be increased by the
entry of banks into insurance, especially in the home, motor and life
insurance markets. 'I'm not sure that rate increases are sustainable,' says
Mr Runciman. 'New capital will come in as soon as there is any upturn,
blunting recovery.'

FT  23 OCT 92 / The Property Market: Leipzig starts to rebuild itself - The
east German city faces daunting tasks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The confused and neglected state of the property market in the former East
Germany is just one of the reasons why the wheels of economic reform are
grinding slowly in that country. But some progress is evident in Leipzig,
the east's second largest city, where the authorities are pressing ahead
with modernising the property stock.
The smoke-belching chimneys that dominate the Leipzig skyline have now been
joined by cranes; the crumbling and blackened remains of baroque buildings
have been shrouded with scaffolding; and the arcades and passages in the
city centre are stacked with west German consumer goods.
Change is in the air. This feeling is reflected in a survey by Jones Lang
Wootton (JLW), the chartered surveyors, of 100 property companies,
financiers and consultants. The respondents said Leipzig has more potential
for property investors than any other east German city; while half the
respondents said they planned projects in Berlin, 60 per cent said they
intended to work in Leipzig.
It is the considerable lack of office space in Leipzig that is attracting
office developers. Leipzig's office stock currently totals between 1m sq ft
and 1.3m sq ft, virtually all of which is obsolete by western standards. An
additional 2m sq ft (2.6m sq m) of office space will be needed if Leipzig is
to attain the same proportion of office stock to population as west German
cities.
For developers, there are numerous incentives, including grants, favourable
tax treatment, European Community regional grants and subsidised lending
rates.
The shortage of space has driven rents up to unsustainable levels. Today
rents are as high as DM60 a month, and some investment deals have been
sealed on yields less than 2 per cent.
But for all the apparent opportunities, Leipzig faces some daunting
obstacles if it is to fulfil its ambitions. These include:
Pollution. Before 1989, the region had the highest density of harmful
emissions in the German Democratic Republic. The city's reliance on lignite
is evident in the open cast mines that scar the countryside surrounding
Leipzig and the layers of grime on the buildings.
But emissions have halved with the closure of factories, briquette plants,
and heating stations. Today, city residents say they can see the sky clearly
for the first time in many years.
The inadequacy of Leipzig's building stock, the result of heavy bombing
during the second world war and four decades of communist neglect. Under the
former communist regime, historical buildings were neglected and eventually
demolished to make way for grey Stalinist-type buildings.
Leipzig's lack of good housing is a forceful brake on development since it
prevents the city from attracting skilled workers. The authorities hope
that, over time, the barrack-like prefabricated blocks of flats littered
around the city, will be demolished.
The shortage of hotel rooms is another headache. The city has only 3,370
hotel beds, making it difficult to reserve a room at busy times, such as
Leipzig's famous spring and autumn trade fairs which each attract up to
100,000 visitors. The city's planning office has received more than 100
enquiries about hotel projects.
Poor transport infrastructure. Although Leipzig has good motorway
connections by east German standards, the road system is poor compared with
west Germany.
Declining population. Leipzig's population has shrunk from 713,000 before
1939 to 511,000 today, due to a lack of jobs, decay, shortage of housing,
poor recreation facilities and pollution. Since German reunification in
1990, more than 30,000 people - mainly young and relatively well-educated -
have migrated from the city.
Land ownership disputes. This is the city's biggest single problem. The
government's decision to give anyone whose property was expropriated the
right to reclaim their property has resulted in claims for 95 per cent of
the city centre. 'The most important job of every developer in Leipzig is to
get the ownership situation cleared,' says Mr Albrecht Wrede, lawyer for
Erste Munchen-Leipziger Investitionsgesellschaft, a developer planning one
of Leipzig's largest schemes.
The poor state of the city's land registers has given the authorities an
apparently insurmountable problem. It has just a few dozen staff to deal
with 23,000 applications for property restitution, each of which can take 28
days to process. Last year, Leipzig settled just 130 land disputes; this was
more than half the total land dispute settlements reached in all of eastern
Germany last year.
For developers, the result is mounting frustration. 'It is not that the
staff at the city authority are not willing to work, they are not
qualified,' says Mr Douglas Holoch, who heads JLW's Leipzig office.
'They (the city authorities) can work effectively on questions of property,'
says Mr Michael Schimansky, head of the office for commercial development at
Leipzig city council. The council copes with its own lack of cash by
co-operating with developers. For example, developers are being asked to
finance masterplans, build infrastructure and make land available at a low
price for industrial uses.
The city is anxious to attract industry, since the engineering, machine
tools and light industrial sectors that have been the mainstay of its
economy face rationalisation. Mr Schimansky underlines the city's hunger for
investment. 'Leipzig is one of the new sites in western Europe where the
population accepts chemical plants,' he says.
Despite Leipzig's desire for rapid industrial growth, it is the trade and
service sectors which are initially likely to see the greatest volume of
activity. 'The service industries will experience over-proportional growth,'
says a report by Zadelhoff Deutschland, a property adviser, and Arthur
Andersen, a management consultancy. 'It is generally expected that Leipzig
will become a centre for trade and banking,' says the report.
Leipzig has drawn on its past in targeting the areas where it hopes to
expand. The city's historical importance is based on its trade fair. The
exhibition grounds are being moved to Mockau in the north of the city, part
of ambitious plans to give Leipzig the most modern exhibition facilities in
Europe.
The city was also the centre of the book and publishing trade in the former
communist state. The town planners have created a 'Media city Leipzig'
project, which will cover a large part of eastern Leipzig. The project is
being carried out by an association of public and private interests, which
intends to build publishing houses, media centres and office buildings at a
cost of between DM2,000m and DM3,000m.
But change will be more apparent on the outskirts of the city, rather than
the centre. Since the farmland surrounding the centre is not encumbered by
disputes over land ownership, the area has been the target of much
speculation.
A total of 143 industrial areas and business parks, covering 10m sq m have
been planned. However, in the view of JLW, only 10 per cent of these will be
built. 'It will be necessary to make immense investments in the
infrastructure for this purpose and this could be the death knell for some
projects,' JLW says.
Leipzig's reconstruction is being financed by institutional and private
funds from western Germany. The transformation of the city testifies to the
strength of Germany's commitment to its development.

FT  23 OCT 92 / International Bonds: CS Holding gives new lease of life to
convertibles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE convertible bond market sprang to life yesterday, when CS Holding, the
Swiss holding company which owns Credit Suisse and partly owns CS First
Boston and Electrowat, launched a rare offering of bonds convertible into
bearer shares. The Dollars 500m issue of 10-year non-callable convertible
bonds, increased from Dollars 400m, was arranged by Credit Suisse First
Boston.
The convertible bond market has been starved this year, creating a surplus
of demand, particularly from specialist convertible bond funds. The CS
Holding deal provided investors with the sort of high-quality name they were
looking for.
Dealers said the issue, which closed at its par issue price, was meeting
particularly strong demand among Swiss investors, who welcomed the chance of
a dollar play on a Swiss equity investment.
The size of the issue will also help boost declining liquidity in the
sector. As well as suffering from a slump in new issues volume this year,
the secondary market has suffered from a spate of buy-backs and early
redemptions.
In addition, many convertible bonds are no longer traded as such, since
their equity component has lost its value due to declining stock market
prices.
Consequently, many older issuers are now traded purely as fixed-income
instruments.
Dealers said the coupon on the CS Holding deal had been squeezed slightly,
but a lower indicated premium of 10 to 12 per cent provided adequate
compensation. The bonds pay a coupon of 4 7/8 per cent, about a point more
that the dividend yield of 3.8 per cent. The deal will be priced over
today's closing price on the Zurich Stock Exchange. The structure of the
deal is unusual in that the issuer cannot redeem the bonds early, which adds
extra value for investors.
In the dollar sector, General Electric Capital Corporation took advantage of
attractive swap arbitrage at the short end of the market to launch a Dollars
200m three-year issue, despite volatile conditions in the US Treasury
market. The triple-A rated bonds will be priced today at a spread of 45
basis points over the comparable US Treasury note yield.
In the French bond market, Banque Nationale de Paris launched a FFr1.5bn
five-year deal which was considered attractively priced at a spread of 49
basis points over the comparable yield on French government paper. The deal,
arranged by BNP Capital Markets, met strong demand from investors, due to
the current rally in the short end of the market. Many investors believe
that rates are set to fall soon, and that the yield curve will become
steeply positive.
In the floating-rate note market, the World Bank launched a 'collared'
floater, paying a minimum coupon of 5 per cent and a maximum of 8 1/4 per
cent. Initial interest is set at 25 basis points below the six-month Libor.
The deal was arranged by Kidder Peabody.

FT  23 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Bank of America says problem
assets now total Dollars 5bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BANK OF America, the leading bank in the western US, yesterday disclosed an
increased level of problem assets as it released its first fully integrated
quarterly results since its takeover of the loss-making Security Pacific was
completed last year.
The San Francisco-based bank said the total problem assets pending sale
totalled Dollars 5bn, up from a previous estimate of Dollars 4.4bn. Bank of
America's share price closed down Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 41 5/8 .
Net profits for the third quarter were Dollars 476m, or Dollars 1.22 per
share. But Bank of America said the result was not comparable with its
third-quarter 1991 net profits of Dollars 285m, or Dollars 1.20 per share.
The net effect of non-recurring items, including merger-related
restructuring expenses and a gain on the sale of a payroll processing
business, was a Dollars 175m charge in the first nine months of 1992.
For those nine months, the bank's net income was Dollars 1.02bn, which is
not comparable with the Dollars 839m earned in the same period last year.
Mr Dick Rosenberg, chairman, said the earnings were 'solid' and that the
integration of Security Pacific's operations was proceeding on schedule.
Net loan losses during the quarter were Dollars 371m, consisting Dollars
460m of write-offs and Dollars 89m of recoveries. Most write-offs were in
the consumer, construction and property sectors.
The return on assets for the nine-month period was 0.85 per cent, while
return on equity was 12.39 per cent.
Bankers Trust, the New York bank, achieved Dollars 211m of net profits in
the third quarter, a 14 per cent rise year-on-year. Earnings per share were
Dollars 2.45, up 13 per cent.
First Interstate Bancorp, the 11th largest US bank holding company, staged a
sharp third-quarter recovery, turning in profits of Dollars 75.1m, compared
with a loss of Dollars 207.5m a year earlier. For the first nine months, net
profit totalled Dollars 200.2m, compared with a loss of Dollars 220.2m for
the 1991 period.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Italy rallies on hopes of cut in budget
deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON and PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN markets were generally firm yesterday, with a strong rally in Italy
following a parliamentary vote in favour of the government's
deficit-reducing budget proposals.
The upper house of the Italian parliament approved a package of budget
measures covering health and pensions reform by an overwhelming majority.
Analysts said the vote was a positive sign that the government of Mr Giulio
Amato will be able to reduce the budget deficit next year.
On Liffe, the 10-year BTP bond contract closed at 91.25, from an opening
level of 90.15. Sentiment was also buoyed by an easing of money market
interest rates, increasing speculation that the authorities will soon cut
the discount rate. Call money rates fell from 14.23 per cent to 13.97 per
cent following Bank of Italy repurchase operations.
GERMAN government bonds opened higher following Wednesday's easing of money
market interest rates, but the positive mood was not sustained. On Liffe,
the 10-year bund future closed at 91.35, below the day's opening level of
91.45.
The Bundesbank switched to variable rate repurchase operations this week -
rather than supplying liquidity at a fixed rate - allowing money rates to
drift lower. Yesterday, call money was mostly traded at 8.75 to 8.85 per
cent. However, analysts dismissed hopes of an immediate cut in the discount
or Lombard rates.
Ecu bonds held on to gains made earlier this week, encouraged by government
measures to improve market liquidity. The French treasury announced plans to
establish a Ecu700m stock lending fund for Ecu bond marketmakers. Bond
prices were little changed yesterday. However, 10-year bond yields have
fallen by 40 basis points over the last week.
UK government bonds moved higher, encouraged by a narrowing of the trade
deficit during September. The best gains were at around the 10-year
maturity, although short-dated stocks closed about  1/8 of a point up on the
day.
The UK's visible trade deficit narrowed from Pounds 1.15bn during August to
Pounds 1.06bn last month. The value of both imports and exports fell.
Analysts said the figures underlined that there was little hope of an
export-led recovery prior to sterling's effective devaluation. The
devaluation should boost the competitive position of UK exporters, although
the value of imports will also rise.
The 9 3/4 per cent gilt maturing 2002 closed at 109 9/32 , up  1/4 of a
point from the opening, for a yield of 9.03 per cent. On Liffe, the December
bond future fell back from an opening level of 99.19 to 99.12 by the close.
Volume was subdued at 30,000 contracts.
JAPANESE government bonds closed higher yesterday, following a
better-than-expected auction of 10-year bonds and continued anticipation of
lower interest rates.
The benchmark government bond No 145 closed on a yield of 4.77 per cent,
from an opening level of 4.845 per cent. The Bank of Japan's regular monthly
auction stock saw Y80bn 5 per cent bonds sold at an average bid price of
100.24.
The good response to the auction drove prices higher in the secondary
market. Hopes of an interest cut were fuelled by a speech by Mr Yasushi
Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, who said any economic recovery in Japan would
be slow.
US Treasury prices were weaker yesterday but above their early morning lows,
when an unexpected decline in jobless claims and heavy selling on the
Chicago futures and options market had sent bonds tumbling.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/16 at 95,
yielding 7.611 per cent.
The two-year note was also lower, down  1/16 at 99 9/16 , to yield 4.219 per
cent.
Prices were little changed at the start, but fell on news of a 15,000 fall
in weekly jobless claims. The market then dropped sharply following a big
sale of December bond futures in Chicago.
The sell order, which was accompanied by a order to buy December bond puts,
sparked further declines in the cash markets and attracted a lot of
attention.
There were reports that the trades may have violated the rules of the
Chicago Board of Trade, but some sources later indicated that the trades had
been due to a mistake. Once the futures market had settled, prices in New
York recovered.

FT  23 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Bell Resources dispute raises
fears over puts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DISPUTE between Australian Consolidated Investments (ACIL), the Australian
investment company which owns the former Bell Resources, and holders of Bell
Resources convertible bonds could have serious implications for other
holders of bonds with put options.
ACIL faces repayments of ADollars 19.2m (USDollars 13.8m) to investors
following a decision in the UK Court of Appeal two months ago in favour of
investors' right to put, but plans to take the case to the House of Lords.
The original dispute arose when bondholders tried to exercise a put option
providing for early repayment of principal at 117.7 per cent of par value on
November 13 1991. Instead, bonds were redeemed at 103 per cent of their par
value, when the company exercised its call option. However, it gave receipts
to bondholders when the call was exercised.
Ahead of the Lords' appeal, the company has caused further controversy by
printing a notice in the Financial Times, offering to buy back the receipts
at 10 cents per dollar. If the Court of Appeal's decision is upheld,
investors stand to gain 14.7 cents a dollar.
However, brokers and potential investors complain they are unable to buy
receipts, because they are not regarded as tradeable securities, even though
they are offering a higher price than ACIL. One broker said he was willing
to pay 11 cents in the dollar, but had no way of making that offer directly
to receipt-holders.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Ford to cut car output further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD is to extend short-time working at its car assembly plant in Dagenham,
east London, to the end of November in a further move to cut production in
the face of weakening sales in the UK and continental European markets.
The short-time working at Ford will affect about 5,000 employees in the
Dagenham car assembly plant, which produces the Fiesta car and which exports
around half of its output.
For four weeks from next Monday, the plant will in effect work only the
first 2 1/2 days of each week, with production halting after the Wednesday
day shift. In the final week of November, the plant will work a three-day
week with two shifts a day from Monday to Wednesday.
The output of about 11,400 Fiestas will be cut during the next five weeks.
That follows earlier cuts during September and October.
Both Ford's car plants, at Dagenham and at Halewood, Merseyside, have in
effect been working only a three-day week this month, and output has also
been cut sharply at Ford's Transit van plant in Southampton.
Ford has been forced to cut production at most of its assembly plants in
continental Europe.
The company said yesterday that it was still reviewing production plans for
its Halewood plant during November.
In a similar move, Leyland DAF, the UK subsidiary of Dutch commercial
vehicle maker DAF, is stopping production at its van plant in Birmingham and
on its light truck assembly line in Leyland, Lancashire, for two weeks in
November.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Cost of prescribed drug ingredients rises 22%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COST of the ingredients in prescribed drugs in England during June was
22.4 per cent higher than a year earlier, leading to fears that the UK's
drugs budget may be out of control.
The Department of Health estimates that the total cost of prescription
medicines has increased 25 per cent over the past two years. During the
first six months of 1992, the increase in the cost of drug ingredients was
15.2 per cent compared with the first half of last year. Inflation in the UK
is running at 3.6 per cent.
Although the July figures were lower at only 11 per cent, emergency meetings
have been called within the Health Department to deal with rising cost of
the drug bill, according to Scrip, the independent industry newsletter. The
department denies that, although regular meetings have continued, it says.
Although the drugs bill represents a relatively small proportion of NHS
expenditure, which is dominated by staff costs, it is an area of spending
that the government has been concentrating on trying to control in recent
years. Substantial rises in drug costs would present difficulties for health
authorities in a year when they are expecting little comfort from the autumn
spending round.
The most recent figures will be an embarrassment for the Health Department,
which is struggling with the Treasury to justify its spending in the present
expenditure round.
The statistics suggest that government efforts to control demand for
medicines have not been sufficient to keep down the drug bill. Last year,
the government introduced budgets for general practitioners, which, if
exceeded, had to be justified by the doctors. A scheme to show doctors how
much they spent compared with their peers was also introduced.
The National Health Service spent Pounds 3.138bn last year on drugs,
equivalent to 9.7 per cent of its total budget. The increase in the NHS drug
bill was about 10 per cent, according to Scrip.
The National Audit Office is investigating the pharmaceutical price
regulation scheme used to set the UK's drugs prices. The scheme is due to be
renegotiated shortly.
Other measures that could be considered by the Department of Health,
according to Scrip, include:
Generic substitution, which involves the pharmacist substituting a chemical
equivalent and possibly cheaper medicine.
An across-the-board price reduction and freeze.
The newsletter suggests that the reduction could be 1.5 per cent, although
it suggests that the move is unlikely. An extension of limited lists,
removing certain items from the reimbursement list, forcing the patient to
pay the drug's full price.
The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry is running an
advertising campaign emphasising the importance of the UK's drugs industry
and arguing that drugs are good value for money.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major defends shift on economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR justified the shift in emphasis in economic policy yesterday
by warning that worsening conditions in Europe and beyond meant ministers
had to put growth and job creation at the top of their policy agendas.
In his first remarks to the Commons after the new stress on growth was
announced on Tuesday, the prime minister said it was 'essential' those goals
moved 'to the centre of thinking in each and every aspect of government
policy'.
'It is our intention to pursue a strategy that will bring recovery, with it
growth, with it jobs and with it prosperity,' he told MPs at question time.
Mr Major also made clear that further cuts in interest rates would be
pursued in conjunction with continued vigilance over inflation.
'When it is safe to make further reductions without imperilling our
inflationary objectives, that certainly would be the Government's intention
to do so,' he said.
Mocked by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, for being driven by events
beyond his control into daily 'U-turns' in order to mollify his
backbenchers, the prime minister insisted that economic conditions had
'darkened and become more difficult' across Europe.
He stressed that the public-expenditure round was forcing the government to
take tough decisions, but confirmed that the new emphasis for spending will
be on job creation and capital projects.
While public expenditure would be contained wherever possible, the prime
minister said that 'particular care' would be given to schemes that had
positive implicationsfor employment and growth.
'We shall certainly look more carefully at ensuring that we seek to get the
private sector working more effectively to assist in capital projects.'
Downing Street confirmed that the emphasis on a growth-led economic strategy
had been discussed by the prime minister and the chancellor with Cabinet
colleagues yesterday.
More details would be disclosed at Mr Norman Lamont's Mansion House speech
next week before a comprehensive policy framework is announced in the Autumn
Statement on November 12.
With the public-expenditure committee meeting on an almost daily basis, the
final shape of next year's spending plans will probably go to Cabinet the
week after next.
Officials insist that the worsening international economic outlook would not
allow any upward revision of the Pounds 244.5bn ceiling on spending, which
remains sacrosanct.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Regulation of offshore oil fields is eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TIM EGGAR, energy minister, yesterday gave a boost to the North Sea oil
industry by reducing regulation in order to speed up development of new
fields.
Mr Eggar, speaking at a conference in Aberdeen, said changes in procedure
would streamline the system for approving field developments.
He said: 'I am confident the changes will produce very real benefits for
field operators and their partners, not only in terms of cost savings, but
also in greater flexibility to meet their commercial objectives.'
North Sea operators have been pressing for lighter regulation to enable them
to develop more cheaply the smaller and less economic fields which now
characterise the area.
Mr Eggar's most important proposals were for officials from the Department
of Trade and Industry to work within company project teams during
consideration of some new developments, and for the DTI to make greater use
of data and materials available within companies when assessing proposals.
He also suggested that the DTI would concentrate its resources on the
largest developments, while smaller ones would be subject to less rigorous
assessment.
Other proposals were:
DTI officials would have greater authority to agree technical proposals
during the evaluation of 'Annexe B' proposals (development proposals), to
give an earlier indication of the department's position.
Less information would be required by the DTI at all stages.
Development consents would be tailored more closely to circumstances of the
field concerned.
The DTI would give more of the responsibility for monitoring operations to
field operators, while itself taking a more selective role.
Mr Harold Hughes, director-general of the UK Offshore Operators Association,
said he welcomed any move that would lessen the manpower, expense and time
involved in meeting DTI require-ments.
'The department is moving to a less prescriptive formula and that is a very
sensible development in view of the economic fragility of some of the new
fields,' he said.
'What was appropriate for a massive platform in deep water may not be
appropriate for a small, unmanned gas platform in the southern North Sea.'
Mr Eggar announced the first award of North Sea production licences outside
the usual licensing round procedure. Licences were awarded for blocks 39/1
and 39/2 to Amerada Hess and Premier Consolidated Oilfields because they
were 'prospects which merited early exploration'.
Mr Eggar said the arrangements were aimed to speed development of potential
reserves.

MR KEVIN MAXWELL used DM1.2m last March from a German account controlled by
one of his late father's secretive Liechtenstein-based trusts to pay a
German lawyer and ordered the rest sent to a bank in France, a parliamentary
select committee has been told.
Mr Peter Phillips, of Buchler Phillips - the receivers to Robert Maxwell's
personal estate - told the Commons social security committee that he had
then ordered the funds sequestrated in order to prevent further diversions
of funds.
Mr Phillips was testifying about efforts to recover funds stolen from
pension schemes controlled by the late Robert Maxwell.
Mr Phillips, however, said that the French-based funds, which may also be
claimed by liquidators for other parts of the Maxwell empire, will first be
subject to German taxes, and possibly taxes in Ireland and Canada as well,
leaving relatively little money available for pensioners.
Indeed, he testified, less has been recovered from parts of the empire than
it cost in fees to search, and so far, only Pounds 1.48m had been recovered.
Of that, nearly Pounds 1m must be shared with Arther Andersen or with Price
Waterhouse, liquidators for other parts of the Maxwell estate.
Meanwhile, the firm has charged more than Pounds 1m in fees for itself or
its solicitors, of which roughly Pounds 700,000 has been paid. A portion of
that has been paid by Mirror Group Newspapers, which agreed to indemnify the
firm against any costs not approved by the courts.
The firm identified up to Pounds 8.7m of 'potential gross realisations',
including up to Pounds 2.6m from to be earned eventually on the sale of
Oxford United Football Club.
The estate - whose assets may well be claimed by pensioners whose funds were
stolen - has also benefited from nearly Pounds 500,000 in foreign exchange
gains on assets held overseas.
He said that because of strict privacy laws in Liechtenstein, it is still
impossible to say whether Mr Maxwell has hidden any assets away.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Media watchdog proposed in bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR MP Mr Clive Soley yesterday proposed a new media watchdog, the
Independent Press Authority, to deal with standards of newspaper reporting.
Under his private member's bill, Freedom and Responsibility of the Press,
readers would have a statutory right to take legal action if editors refused
to publish corrections.
Mr Soley, the MP for Hammersmith, said readers should be given the right to
have factual inaccuracies corrected.
He explained: 'If an editor and a complainant cannot agree a correction
between themselves, an IPA complaints adviser will be able to intervene and
all sides will be invited to make their case.
'If the IPA finds in favour of the complainant and an editor refuses to
publish a correction, the IPA may refer the case to the High Court. Any
newspaper that still refuses to publish a correction would be in contempt of
court.'
Mr Soley said the bill was designed to enhance freedom of the press and
protect the public from the hazards of inaccurate reporting.
'I believe the press has nothing to fear from my bill, and much to gain. The
circulation war between national newspapers has sent journalistic standards
tumbling, and further damaged public attitudes to the press.'
Mr Soley's measure requires broad cross-party support if it is to stand any
chance of becoming law.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Mixed signs from trade and industry committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS good news and bad news for the government in the composition of the
cross-party trade and industry committee of MPs which met yesterday to
decide the terms of their inquiry into the coal industry.
The good news is that the six Tories who make up the majority of the
11-strong committee include Sir Cranley Onslow, a former chairman of the
1922 committee of Tory MPs, who is likely to be a loyalist; and also Mr
Keith Hampson, MP for Leeds north-west, who is still seen as a henchman of
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary.
Other committee members expect Mr Hampson to keep ministers in touch with
the committee's work, and indeed, believe it will be helpful, given that the
government's inquiry will be taking place at the same time.
The bad news for the government is that the Tories also include Mr Michael
Clark, the MP for Rochford in Essex who was one of the six Conservative MPs
to vote against the government on Wednesday night. Formerly chairman of the
all-party energy committee (which has been scrapped), he remains a trenchant
and knowledgeable critic, who emphasises the need for investment in areas
such as clean-coal technology, rather than simply spending money on
redundancy payments.
The Labour representation on the committee is in flux at present, with Mr
Doug Hoyle and Mr Jim Cousins both about to leave for other parliamentary
appointments.
Mr Michael Clapham, MP for Barnsley West and Penistone, is set to join the
committee. He is sponsored by the National Union of Mineworkers and several
mines in his constituency have already closed.
The other vacancy is likely to be filled by Mr Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal
Democrat trade and industry spokesman.
Mr Richard Caborn, a former Labour frontbench spokesman, is the first
opposition MP to chair this committee, and so is particularly keen to show
fairness as well as rigour in his approach.
Other Labour MPs are Mr Adam Ingram, who was parliamentary private secretary
to Mr Neil Kinnock, and Mr Stan Orme, former chairman of the Labour MPs and
opposition energy spokesman from 1983 to 1987.
Although the committee is realistic enough not to expect all its
recommendations to be approved by the government, its members are conscious
that the public furore over the government's original plans for pit closures
had given them an unusually influential position, and they will be keen not
to miss the opportunity.
The committee agreed yesterday to a wide investigation and set itself an
ambitious deadline of completing the inquiry by mid December, so that the
report can be prepared over the Christmas recess. Its terms of reference
take in the consequences of British Coal's pits closure programme for the
electricity consumer, the exchequer and the economy; and an examination of
alternative energy policies.
The first interrogation session will take place next Tuesday, when the MPs
will question Mr Heseltine.

Mr Soley came fourth in the ballot for private members' bills and his
measure requires broad cross-party support if it is to stand any chance of
reaching the statute book.
Yesterday, Tory MP Sir Teddy Taylor and Liberal Democrat Sir David Steel
indicated their backing for the bill.
Sir Teddy, MP for Southend East, expressed worries about 'anonymous
attribution' while Sir David, the former Liberal leader, attacked newspapers
which paid money for 'tittle-tattle' about public figures.
Supporters of the bill have arranged a series of public hearings in December
for individuals, organisations and editors to air their views.
MPs will debate the bill in the Commons on January 29.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Actuaries body wants tighter rules
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Institute of Actuaries called on the government yesterday to tighten
rules governing the way general insurance companies set reserves against
future claims.
The institute, one of two professional bodies of actuaries in the UK, said
general insurance companies should be required to obtain actuarial
certification of their reserves, especially against unpaid claims. Unpaid
claims are incurred but not yet reported.
The call comes in the wake of difficulties at Municipal Mutual, the UK's
ninth largest insurer, which withdrew from the market earlier this month.

BRITISH AIRWAYS may cancel its official airline status with Eurodisney, the
Paris theme park, because of disappointing demand from UK air travellers,
Daniel Green writes.
The present contract expires at the end of March next year and BA is
prepared to take a tough position in talks over any renewal.
The theme park opened last May and BA increased the capacity of its services
from five UK cities in anticipation of heavy demand.
But the 1.25m visitors so far from the UK have tended to travel by ship and
coach; P&amp;O, the ferry operator, and Wallace Arnold, the UK's largest coach
operator, are official partners of Eurodisney.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Confidence on lease plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's plans to give some 750,000 long leaseholders greater rights
would receive parliamentary approval in spite of some disquiet among Tories,
Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, insisted yesterday.
The proposals give many long leaseholders in flats the right to buy the
freehold of their flats collectively if two thirds of the tenants in the
block agree. Where such leaseholders live in buildings that do not qualify
under the proposal, they will have the option of buying 90-year extensions
to their leases. That is intended to enable them to keep their flats
saleable, and ministers expect the option to have a beneficial effect on the
property market.
The new rights, with changes to public-sector housing management and new
rights for council tenants, are set out in the Housing and Urban Development
Bill, published yesterday.
The bill, which also deals with the setting up of the Urban Regeneration
Agency to help develop derelict land in inner cities, is due to be debated
by MPs next month.
Mr Howard admitted that some people, including Conservatives, had expressed
reservations about the leasehold proposals, but said he hoped that they
would disappear once the context had been fully understood. He added that
there was no question of landlords facing 'confiscation'.
The government's confidence that the plans will get through is based partly
on the fact that Labour broadly welcomes this aspect of the bill.

FT  23 OCT 92 / TUC steps up campaign for pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Trades Union Congress is launching a national advertising campaign today
to attract support for the second demonstration against pit closures this
Sunday and to sustain the momentum of its broader Recovery Campaign.
The TUC Recovery Campaign has spent about Pounds 200,000 of union money on
the advertising and demonstration but hopes to raise much more money from
the public.
News of the intensifying media effort emerged after Mr Roy Lynk, president
of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, ended his seven-day sit-in at the
Silverhill mine in Nottinghamshire.
Mr Lynk also hinted that he might change his mind about not standing again
for the union leadership in next month's election.
UDM members, mainly based in Nottinghamshire, have been as outraged by the
pit closure announcement as their fellow miners in the Yorkshire-based
National Union of Miners, but there is little chance of a rapprochement
between the two unions and the UDM is unlikely to have an official presence
on Sunday's march.
Other publicity efforts include leafleting outside the Rugby League World
Cup Final between Great Britain and Australia on Saturday. The British team
is sponsored by British Coal.
Although the TUC hopes that its Sunday demonstration will attract broader
support than Wednesday's NUM demonstration, some officials fear that many
miners cannot afford to travel to London twice within a week.
The TUC committee co-ordinating the campaign yesterday urged affiliated
unions and TUC regional committees to establish links with the 10 'Heseltine
pits' that have won only a temporary reprieve.
The TUC may also attempt to build on the success of postponing British Coal
privatisation and give an extra push to the campaign against the
privatisation of British Rail.
Yesterday a campaign backed by more than 60 bodies including the rail
unions, was launched against privatisation.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bush tries to fuel maize price
recovery - Laurie Morse reports on a controversial election year boost for
ethanol production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CROP DUST and politics have formed a heady mix in the midwest in these final
weeks of autumn, as US farmers harvest a record maize crop and grumble about
Washington's failure to halt the slide in grain prices.
Maize prices traded for future delivery at the Chicago Board of Trade
dropped this week to their lowest level in four years and are now very close
to Dollars 2 a bushel. Out in the country prices are just as weak. A farmer
in central Illinois received an average price of Dollars 1.97 a bushel for
his maize harvest in September, a drop of 40 cents from last year.
With the US Department of Agriculture forecasting a maize crop of 9bn
bushels (56 lb each) and storage bins already bursting with 1.8bn bushels
carried over from last year's harvest, Washington has sweetened an array of
programmes, mostly credit guarantees, designed to push the excess overseas
and on to the plates of foreign customers.
At the same time the Agriculture Department has told farmers they must idle
10 per cent of their productive land - double the amount required in 1992 -
to qualify for next year's farm support programmes.
To offset the unpopular set-aside requirements, President George Bush has
produced another plan designed to boost domestic maize demand. In a
last-ditch effort to retrieve the farm vote Mr Bush this month relaxed
environmental regulations to allow maize-derived alcohol to be used as an
additive to a cleaner gasoline mix. The regulations are part of the new US
Clean Air Act, and the revision has angered environmentalists, who believe
the ethanol-gas mix will create more, rather than less, smog.
The regulatory re-write is expected to double the market for ethanol.
However, despite election year rhetoric, analysts say the ethanol programme
will do nothing to boost maize prices this year, and will pay limited
dividends to farmers in the longer term.
Last year processors, led by Archer Daniels Midland, based in Decatur,
Illinois, turned 378m bushels of maize into about 800m gallons of ethanol
and Mr David Miller, head of research at the American Farm Bureau, projects
that in ten years ethanol production could expand to consume about 1.2bn
bushels of maize a year.
But that rise in consumption does not necessarily translate into higher
maize prices. Mr Miller estimates that US maize production will continue to
rise by 1 or 2 per cent a year over the next decade, increasing the overall
annual crop size by almost 2bn bushels. 'Given these assumptions about
supply, and estimates of growth in the ethanol market,' Mr. Miller says,
'ethanol demand may just keep pace with production growth.'
Since most US maize farmers are compensated for the difference between the
market price for maize and the government's Dollars 2.75-a-bushel 'target'
price, ethanol production would have to rise far more than the most
optimistic projections to boost maize growers' bank accounts.
Better positioned to enjoy the ethanol windfall are the Midwestern maize
processing companies that generate alcohol from bargain-priced grain. First
among these is Archer Daniels Midland, which with its four ethanol plants
boasts more than two-thirds of the nation's production capacity. Other
agricultural interests have small production facilities, and some, like
Cargill, the Minnesota giant, are just entering the business.
Archer Daniels Midland is likely to retain its dominant market share,
however. Its primary business is processing maize into high fructose syrup,
and several of its plants have the capacity to swing production between the
two products.
The company, and its chairman, Mr Dwayne Andreas, are reported to have given
more than Dollars 1m to Republican campaign funds since 1988 in an effort to
support Mr Bush's presidency. Observers say the investment will pay off
handsomely in profits from the ethanol market expansion that comes from Mr.
Bush's regulatory revision.
A rarely mentioned aside in the domestic ethanol discussion is that
profitable ethanol production depends on a strong export market corn gluten
feed, a processing by-product. Each bushel of maize wet milled into ethanol
produces 13.5 lb of corn gluten feed. Nearly all is exported into the
European Community, where trade barriers bar the import of US maize in any
other form. Last year, nearly 2bn lb of US corn gluten feed were shipped to
the EC, and that figure is expected to rise as ethanol production expands.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Protests scupper Bolivian mine
investment strategy - Chris Philipsborn on what may prove to be a Pyrrhic
victory for the country's militant miners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS PHILIPSBORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLIGHT of the British coal miners now facing redundancy is a sadly
familiar one to the Bolivian mining industry. Seven years ago Comibol, the
state mining corporation, had to lay off more than 28,000 tin miners
following the market crash caused by the collapse of the International Tin
Council's buffer stock operation. This in a country with just 6.3m
inhabitants.
'For us, the free market fails to offer three fundamental things,' says Mr
Victor Lopez, executive secretary of the Federation of Bolivian Mine Workers
(FSTMB), the largest and most influential mining union in the country. 'It
pays no attention to the plight of the poor; there is no interest in long
term planning; and no attention is paid to the national interests.'
Bolivian miners' spirits are now high, however, following a notable victory
over their government.
Mining unions recently voted to occupy Comibol's mines in protest at the
drive to open up the corporation to joint venture and leasing contracts with
private companies. Mr Lopez reminded politicians that his members had
confronted both the military and the police in the past and assured them
that his members - 7,000 in the public sector and 5,000 in the private
sector - were prepared to do so again, even if loss of life resulted.
The message struck home. In a dramatic climbdown, the Bolivian government
has now suspended all joint venture contracts. By caving in so
comprehensively it has effectively halted the joint venture process, soured
any interest foreign investors might have had in the public sector and could
well have waved goodbye to a Dollars 35m mining development credit from the
World Bank.
Since the concept of joint ventures first saw the light of day last year,
only two have been signed, though leasing deals are fairly common. The two
joint ventures involved operations at the Tasna and Catavi mining centres.
The private companies concerned, Cominesa, a subsidiary of Specialty Metals
of the US and Mineracao Taboca, a subsidiary of Brazil's Parapanema, were,
however, unable to start up operations because of industrial action backed
by Mr Lopez's union.
On the face of it, however, Mr Lopez would seem to be indulging in an ego
trip which may ultimately prove devastating to his members. The Tasna mine
for instance is currently closed and supports a skeleton staff of just 21
workers. Cominesa has repeatedly said it wanted to invest Dollars 4m in the
mine and employ some 300 miners.
Tasna, though, was an important symbol for the unions. As Mr Fernando
Urquidi, a long time observer of the Bolivian mining scene explains: 'If the
mining unions had allowed the government to retake Tasna, they would have
lost the fight against joint ventures'.
Yet Mr Lopez and his union executive must realise that Bolivia, with legal
export earnings of just Dollars 800m and a looming trade deficit, is not in
a position to invest even in productive mines. Comibol itself will probably
make a loss of more than Dollars 10m this year. The corporation's total
losses between 1981 and 1991 were in the region of Dollars 662m.
The corporation has a new president, Marcelo Perez. Mr Perez has the right
free market credentials but no mining experience. He is poorly regarded by
unions, and performs his greatest exertions when attempting to avoid
questions from the press. Mr Perez's assertion that despite the government's
decision, Comibol '. . . remains firmly wedded to the belief that joint
ventures are the only way to reactivate mining centres', has a hollow ring
to it. According to industry officials, it is fairly certain that joint
venture contracts will now be shelved, at least until the general election
next year.
To be fair it must be said that the very concept of joint ventures negates
the last 40 years of Bolivian history. As Comibol general manager Mr Jose
Zambrana explains: 'The miners have had great influence because they were
the ones who took up arms during the 1952 revolution. They were in on the
birth of Comibol, which for the past 40 years has been run by the state. The
workers have had the right of veto in decisions and participated in
management. It is not easy for them to renounce these privileges'.
The government never really backed the joint venture process sufficiently.
Inevitable conflict was put off for so long that it seemed far easier to
give in altogether, rather than initiate a potentially bloody confrontation
just eight months away from the polls. Meanwhile, mines like Tasna which in
the hands of the private sector could be providing much needed employment
and export earnings, remain idle indefinitely.

COPPER prices surrendered some of their recent gains at the LME yesterday,
with the cash quotation closing Pounds 13.75 down at Pounds 1,382.50 a
tonne. Dealers said the downturn followed a failed attempt in the morning to
break resistance at the equivalent of Dollars 2,280 for three months metal.
ZINC also eased back in the afternoon, the cash position ending at Dollars
1,112 a tonne, down Dollars 6 from Wednesday's close. But the sharpest
turnround was in ALUMINIUM. Upside momentum generated by VAW's production
cut announcement (see story above) soon disappeared, dealers said, after the
three months price's brief excursion above Dollars 1,200 a tonne attracted
substantial selling. The price closed Dollars 7 lower on balance at Dollars
1,187.50 a tonne. At the London Futures and Options Exchange robusta coffee
prices edged up to fresh 8-month highs before meeting resistance. The
January futures position reached Dollars 899 a tonne before profit-taking
overwhelmed the upward momentum. The price closed at Dollars 891 a tonne, up
Dollars 6 on the day and Dollars 35 on the week so far.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Firmer metals prices forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TIGHTENING supply/demand balance and the spread of economic recovery in
Europe and Japan are likely to lead to firmer base metals prices across the
board next year, although the current weakness may be extended in the fourth
quarter of 1992, according to Rudolf Wolff, the London metals trader.
In a special report published yesterday, entitled The Outlook for Base
Metals in 1993, Wolff notes that, 'although we expect increased growth in
metal consumption, the metal industry is at the moment overshadowed by the
build up in stocks'. It suggests, however, that the apparent bottoming out
of the markets in early 1992 indicates that 'there are organisations
prepared to buy and hold metals at these relatively low prices'.
For copper, the report estimates that western world supply will fall short
of consumption by 13,000 tonnes this year, following a 191,000-tonne surplus
in 1991. Next year it forecasts that the supply deficit will grow to about
163,000 tonnes. It expects the three months delivery price to average
Dollars 2,550 a tonne in 1993, up from an estimated Dollars 2,350 this year.
A more modest recovery is expected for aluminium prices with the three
months price average climbing to Dollars 1,400 a tonne in 1993 from Dollars
1,320 in 1992.
'The increasing oversupply in the (aluminium) market and the realisation
that the West is likely to have to continue to absorb CIS exports, suggests
that further production cutbacks are inevitable,' Wolff says. 'For this
reason the potential for prices to sustain a downward move looks limited.'
The report says prospects for consumption are healthy. 'Once supply is
reined in and stocks show signs of falling, the aluminium market should be
able to focus on the encouraging consumption prospects.'
Wolff suggests that the zinc market's recovery in the first half of this
year 'may well have anticipated stronger economic recovery,' so 'prices may
now spend further time consolidating/correcting recent gains'. Nevertheless
the report sees the zinc price averaging Dollars 1,400 a tonne in 1993, up
Dollars 125 from the expected 1992 average.
The lead price average is forecast to rise by Pounds 50 to Pounds 380 a
tonne in 1993, while nickel's is put at Dollars 8,000 a tonne, up from
Dollars 7,350, and tin's at Dollars 7,000 a tonne, up from Dollars 6,200.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mine wastes responsibility
questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONVENTIONAL wisdom on responsibility for the costs of clearing up mining
wastes were challenged last night by Sir Derek Birkin, chairman of RTZ, the
world's biggest mining company.
'Society as a whole, rather than present mining companies and their
shareholders, benefited most from the creation of those wastes,' Sir Derek
told the London Metal Exchange annual dinner. 'It would be more honest, if
politically embarrassing, for the costs of cleaning up old mine wastes to be
recognised as the taxes that they are, rather than disguised as moral
commitments.'
He said modern mining companies strove to be 'responsible stewards of the
world's resources, and to tailor their mining and processing to minimise any
environmental degradation'. Governments, however, while relying increasingly
on market measures in most spheres of economic activity, seemed 'unduly
disposed' to regulation in the environmental field.
'Concern for the environment has become like motherhood,' Sir Derek
suggested. 'Too many people unquestioningly accept any policy put forward to
preserve it.' The scientific basis for many environmental policies was
questionable, he added, 'and their possible benefits out of all proportion
to the inevitable heavy costs.'

FT  23 OCT 92 / Albert Fisher declines to Pounds 52.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FALL in pre-tax profits from Pounds 89m to Pounds 52.1m completed what was
described as a 'traumatic year' for Albert Fisher, the UK-based food
processing and distribution group.
Mr Stephen Walls, who recently became chairman, said a review of the group
had discovered no 'black hole' in the balance sheet. However, trading
suffered from depressed economic conditions and a glut of fresh produce in
the second half.
Mr Walls took over in July from Mr Tony Millar, who built the group by
acquisition into a stock market star of the 1980s. Mr Millar stepped down
after a profits warning caused the shares to fall to 41p, compared with the
previous year's peak of 133p. Yesterday the shares closed  1/2 p lower at 41
1/2 p.
Mr Walls said shareholders had been given a rough ride and he was taking an
unsentimental look at the whole group. The priority was to focus on organic
growth, rather than acquisitions, although further infill purchases were not
ruled out.
Group turnover grew marginally from Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 1.18bn in the
year to August 31. Pre-tax profits were cut by an exceptional charge of
Pounds 10.01m - compared with a credit of Pounds 2m last time - comprising
Pounds 6m of restructuring costs in Europe and the US, and a Pounds 2.5m
writedown of assets. The remaining Pounds 1.5m of redundancy costs includes
Mr Millar's pay-off, to be detailed in the annual report.
An extraordinary debit of Pounds 10.27m covered losses from the disposal of
Holco, a Dutch mushroom and asparagus bottling plant, and other
mushroom-related activities.
Mr Walls said that, having cleaned out the balance sheet, he did not
anticipate further exceptional or extraordinary charges in the current year.
The group's net cash at the year-end fell from Pounds 70m to Pounds 30m.
Earnings per share fell from 10.02p to 5.6p. The final dividend of 1.9p (up
from 2p) maintained the total at 3.75p, even though dividend cover fell to
1.5 times. This was said to reflect the board's confidence about the future
and the group's strong cash position.
Mr Walls said: 'The actions currently under way should generate better
performance than the levels seen in the second half of 1992.'

FT  23 OCT 92 / Salomon earnings collapse to Dollars 6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
-TEGC
SHARES in Salomon plunged yesterday after the group announced a dramatic
decline in third-quarter earnings primarily due to a huge drop in trading
profits at its Wall Street securities subsidiary Salomon Brothers.
Lower investment banking revenues, and losses at Phibro, the group's oil
trading and refining unit, also contributed to the poor earnings report,
which sparked heavy selling of Salomon stock. The shares fell Dollars 4 1/2
to Dollars 33 1/2 by the close.
The results underlined Salomon's reliance on proprietary trading business
and its vulnerability to market and interest rate volatility, and stood in
contrast to the strong performance of other big securities houses in the
third quarter.
Salomon reported net income for the July-to-September period of just Dollars
6m (Pounds 3.6m), compared with the Dollars 85m it earned a year ago and the
Dollars 375m it earned before special charges in the second quarter. After
paying out dividend requirements on preferred stock, Salomon incurred a loss
of nine cents a share in the third quarter.
The chief cause of the huge slump in earnings at Salomon Brothers - where
net income fell from Dollars 194m to Dollars 51m - was the 65 per cent
decline in proprietary trading revenues to Dollars 215m. Although the firm
would not say what was behind the decline, it is believed to have been
related to fluctuations in US interest rates in the quarter.
Analysts suggested that at the end of last month, because of unexpected
shifts in interest rates, Salomon was left sitting on a large paper loss in
the complex fixed-income securities positions the firm holds for its own
account. Mr John Keefe, an independent securities analyst in New York, said:
'I suspect it's a very large pool of capital elaborately invested in bonds
around the world.'
It is still possible, however, that Salomon could recoup the paper losses
incurred during the third quarter if rates move in the firm's favour over
the next six to 12 months.
Salomon also suffered from a decline in investment banking revenues, which
fell 18 per cent to Dollars 119m, and a large increase in group compensation
and employee-related expenses, which rose sharply during the quarter to
Dollars 370m. Phibro, meanwhile, reported a Dollars 34m pre-tax loss because
of narrow refining spreads, poor world demand for energy products and flat
oil trading markets.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Willett quits Isosceles and Gateway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BOB WILLETT has resigned as a director of the Isosceles board and chief
executive of Gateway, its main trading subsidiary, in the latest twist in
the tale of the heavily borrowed buy-out.
Gateway was taken over by Isosceles in 1989 in a Pounds 2.1bn leveraged
deal.
Isosceles said Mr Willett's departure was a step towards combining the
boards of Isosceles and Gateway. It appears also to be an attempt to regain
control of Gateway's head office in Bristol. One insider said yesterday: 'It
is not a happy ship and that is a factor which weighed with the board.'
The group's banks were said not to have pressed for management changes,
although Mr Ernest Sharp, chairman of Isosceles, said they supported them.
Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes, who is chief executive of Isosceles and chairman
of Gateway, will take on Mr Willett's role as well.
Mr Bob Nellist, finance director of Isosceles, will become deputy chairman
of Gateway.
Mr Sharp said Mr Mitchell-Innes' first task was to go to Bristol and start a
'very close review of the organisation and structure'. There was speculation
Isosceles may seek to strengthen the board further, perhaps by appointing
someone with more retail experience.
Mr Mitchell-Innes, 57, was a non-executive director of Isosceles, and
stepped into his present shoes when Mr David Smith, the previous chief
executive, left last autumn. He was chief operating officer of the UK
subsidiary of Nabisco Brands between 1984 and 1988. Earlier he worked at
Unilever, including a spell running the supermarket division of
MacFisheries, and at Brooke Bond.
Mr Willett came in for criticism over Gateway's trading performance which
has failed to meet budgets since the financial year began at the end of
April. Mr Sharp said that business was tough, but that 'the figures are not
a million miles away from the ones we gave the banks in August' when a
financial restructuring was being finalised.
Lenders to Isosceles, which owes more than Pounds 1.2bn, have been concerned
by the group's ability to service its debt. A New York-based firm which
trades in the debt of highly leveraged companies, said yesterday senior
lenders to Isosceles had offered to sell at prices between 75 per cent and
80 per cent of face value.
Mr Willett has a contract until August 15 1995 at an annual salary of Pounds
195,000 but his compensation has not yet been negotiated.

FT  23 OCT 92 / GM director says board has discussed post of chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors appeared yesterday to be preparing to oust its chairman, Mr
Robert Stempel, as the company's top outside director admitted that the
board was discussing the future leadership of the deeply troubled carmaker.
GM's non-executive directors are believed to be unhappy at the slow pace of
the restructuring of the group, designed to restore it to profits, taking
place under Mr Stempel. His removal would send the company a blunt message
of the urgency of change and could also mark the start of a much more
radical restructuring programme.
Mr John Smale, the non-executive director who heads the executive committee
of the GM board, yesterday issued a statement in response to mounting press
speculation that Mr Stempel would be asked to step down.
He said the board had taken no action about any management changes. However
he added that 'the question of executive leadership is a primary concern to
the board of directors of any company and GM is no exception. The GM board
of directors continues to carefully reflect upon the wisest course for
assuring the most effective leadership for the corporation.'
Significantly, the statement included no explicit words of support for Mr
Stempel. It contrasted sharply with previous denials from GM spokesmen of
moves to oust the chairman.
The board is thought to be undecided who might best succeed Mr Stempel. One
possibility is Mr Smale, the 63-year-old former chairman of Procter &amp;
Gamble, who last April led a coup by non-executive directors, frustrated at
the slow pace of change at GM, which clipped Mr Stempel's powers by removing
him as head of the executive committee.
The non-executives also replaced Mr Stempel's right hand man, Mr Lloyd
Reuss, as president and head of the troubled North American auto operations
with Mr John Smith, previously head of international operations.
Mr Stempel was admitted to a hospital in Washington DC last week suffering
from high blood pressure. He quickly returned to work, but directors might
use the illness as a pretext for his resignation. The next scheduled meeting
of the board is in New York on November 2.
GM is expected next week to report third quarter losses of up to Dollars
850m (Pounds 520m) due to the inefficiency of its North American car
operations.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Big Blue decides small is beautiful: Louise Kehoe explains a
revolution in culture and operations at the world's biggest computer company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If IBM is to recover its reputation as the world's best-run company, much
hangs on the performance of one man: Mr Robert Corrigan.
Mr Corrigan, 52, with 30 years at Big Blue under his belt, is president of
the seven-week-old IBM Personal Computer Company (IBM PCC) and he must
reverse the big drop in PC sales, a prime cause of IBM's poor third-quarter
results; and pioneer the group's newly decentralised management style, as a
'federation of free-standing businesses'.
'What we've begun here is far more than a restructuring, we are changing the
culture of IBM, and changing it very quickly,' Mr John Akers, IBM chairman,
recently told employees. 'Performance has already replaced conformance;
entrepreneurship is quickly overtaking decision-by-committee; and teamwork
is supplanting hierarchy.'
The PC business was an obvious place for IBM to start. Founded in 1981 by a
handful of IBM mavericks who developed the prototype for IBM's first PC
product in only three months, the PC operation has always retained some of
its rebel style.
Far from resisting change, employees of IBM PCC have welcomed the
restructuring as an opportunity for the PC unit to 'return to its roots' and
throw off the Big Blue blanket that many feel has reduced its
competitiveness.
The PC business also represented one of IBM's most pressing problems, as the
dismal third-quarter results have confirmed. IBM has been losing market
share to lower-priced PCs.
IBM PCC 'is a slimmed-down company with a more efficient management system
where decisions can be made and implemented more quickly', says Mr Corrigan.
'It is an organisation with control over all elements of cost and expense
and, most importantly, a company that brings together in one organisation
all the skills necessary to create and deliver products to our customers.'
'The (PC) industry is moving to shorter and shorter product development
cycles,' explains Mr James Cannavino, IBM vice-president and general manager
of personal systems.
'Today, with the average industry cycle at six to eight months the
boundaries between development and manufacturing and distribution must
disappear.'
The restructured IBM PCC will have total worldwide responsibility for
product development, manufacturing and merchandising, promotion and
distribution.
The new company's costs have been significantly reduced. It begins life with
about 10,000 employees, down from the 15,000 who focused on IBM's PC
products a year ago. It has also thrown off the yoke of corporate overhead
charges for administration, research and development.
'Now, if we need some research activity we pay for what we need, and only
what we need, at a fair market value,' says Mr Ed Rogers, chief financial
officer of the new company. The same applies to components purchases.
Mr Rogers can also set or change prices for IBM PCs. 'A year ago, if we
wanted to change a price, marketing would first make a request to the
manufacturing and development people, then it would go to the North America
management level . . . The procedure once took weeks and sometimes months.'
Now that decisions are made without reference to committees, 'it takes us
just a day or two'.
To inject entrepreneurial spirit into the new organisation, IBM PCC has
formed 'brand teams', focused on different segments of the PC market,
ranging from consumers to corporate buyers.
'Large is no longer fashionable at IBM,' says Mr Tony Santelli, who heads
development of PS/1 products. 'The prowess of IBM executives used to be
measured by the size of their organisations. Now the feeling is that anybody
can get the job done with 1,000 people, but only the superstars can do it
with 100.'
It is a measure of the cultural changes underway within IBM that members of
Mr Santelli's PS/1 group have become almost folk heroes. Three years ago
they were given the task of developing a 'home computer'. They took a
non-conformist approach and set up shop in a disused warehouse in Lexington,
Kentucky.
'We recruited (IBM) people who had the zeal to enter a great adventure, but
they had to be willing to take a big demotion, to work in a windowless
warehouse with no guarantees of success. We picked up battle-scarred
veterans and bushytails who didn't know any better. It was a totally crazy
bunch,' Mr Santelli recalls.
The 'blue-grass' team, as it became known, brought the PS/1 home computer to
market in 18 months and although its first product flopped, the group set
important precedents for the small-team approach and went on to develop the
latest PS/1 which is a strong seller.
'You don't need the same communications processes or structures as you have
in larger groups. There are no part-time players and rank has no privilege,'
says Mr Santelli, in what amounts to an heretical statement from an IBM
executive.
Gone is IBM's preoccupation with ensuring that one of its products does not
compete with another. Now 'the cannibals are king', says Mr Santelli. 'If we
don't cannibalise our markets, our competitors will do it for us.'
Yet for all of its enthusiasm, IBM PCC faces enormous challenges. The
hard-driving entrepreneurial culture it is attempting to adopt is already
native to many competitors. The 'small' brand teams it has formed still
appear huge compared with the lean and mean companies whose prices they must
match - and the bureaucracy it has thrown off is foreign to most PC makers.
Competitors in the US say IBM PC has not affected their sales. None the
less, IBM PCC's birth was well-timed. It comes as PC sales are booming. IBM
PCC may also benefit from a strong trend away from the 'no-name clones' made
by little-known manufacturers.
With the launch of its Valuepoint product range, IBM PCC has laid all its
cards on the table. Customer response to these products will be a key to
fourth-quarter performance of the world's largest computer company - and a
strong indicator of how successful IBM will be in restructuring its
worldwide operations.

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (10): Europe is
stifled by the Bundesbank's interest-rate policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DUST still has to settle from last month's fracture of the European
exchange rate mechanism, but the equity markets are already sorted into two
groups. Ahead of any further realignment of the ERM, they have divided
themselves into what are perceived as the winners and losers of September's
currency crisis.
On the upside stand the Deutsche Mark/French franc group, including
Switzerland and the Netherlands; while the downside includes Spain, Italy,
the Nordic countries and the UK. This was reflected in their respective
performances in the past quarter in the FT-Actuaries World indices, although
significantly this also highlights a 16 per cent fall, in local currency
terms, in Germany, emphasising weaknesses in its domestic economy.
In dollar terms, a broader picture emerges, which reflects comparative
currency strengths: Germany declined by 9.5 per cent, France by 2.1 per
cent, Spain (21.2 per cent) and Italy (25.7 per cent). The FT-A World index,
meanwhile, improved by 1.4 per cent in dollar terms, boosted by Switzerland,
Japan and the US.
The volatility in the European money markets, particularly in the second
half of September, which saw the devaluation of sterling, the lira and the
peseta, a revaluation in the D-Mark, the dollar's weakness, and an
inconclusive French vote on Maastricht, has caused a shift in analysts'
views regarding the fourth-quarter performance of equity markets.
With the Bundesbank so far resisting calls for additional interest-rate
cuts, economic and corporate growth in other EC states has effectively been
stifled.
Melissa Carrington, strategist at Hoare Govett, says that 'domestic demand
in Italy and Spain is expected to fall even further next year, while the
effective revaluation of the currencies of the core members of the ERM will
hit their exports.'
She adds that, as EC governments attempt to rein in their budgetary
deficits, 'there will be no growth impetus from fiscal policy. As a result,
it is difficult to see whence the impetus for European growth will come.'
Andrew Bell, European strategist at BZW, is even more pessimistic, observing
that 'the cumulative effect of the monetary squeeze and fiscal tightenings
in several economies has finally brought growth to a halt.' He has revised
downwards his corporate earnings expectations for Europe (excluding the UK)
for 1992 to 1.6 per cent, against 6.1 per cent.
The situation among the Nordic countries has been particularly bleak over
the past three months. The unsuccessful efforts by Uni Storebrand of Norway
and Hafnia of Denmark to accumulate a 47 per cent stake in Sweden's Skandia
led to the former two insurers suspending payments in August. Both markets
subsequently fell to all-time lows.
Sweden, which last month raised overnight lending rates to 500 per cent,
since lowered to 24 per cent, continues to deteriorate. Peter Bradshaw and
Gordon Maclean, Scandinavian analysts at Robert Fleming, fear that worse is
to come, and that the government may be forced to devalue, following Finland
which announced in early September that it would allow the markka to float
freely, for the second time in under a year.
In Spain, the re-imposition of capital controls, which followed the 5 per
cent devaluation of the peseta, saw share prices fall by 15 per cent in the
last few weeks of the quarter. These measures drove away foreign investment
and had a serious effect on the electricity sector,
which has a large amount of foreign currency debt in issue.
As a historic safe haven, Switzerland is still regarded as having good
investment potential. Guy Rigden, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
comments that 'a stable earnings background will give solid support to the
market over the next 6-12 months, when other 'hard currency' European
markets may still be vulnerable to downgrades.'

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (12): Japan's
emergency package helps the market to recover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TOKYO stock market went on a roller-coaster ride in the third quarter,
as the Japanese government's emergency economic package calmed fears of a
meltdown in the financial industry and the market.
In mid-August, the Nikkei index of the leading 225 shares plunged to a
six-year low of 14,309.41 (down 64 per cent from its peak), but it finally
rose to finish the quarter at 17,399.09. Strong buying followed the
announcement of the government's support measures for the banking system and
the faltering economy.
Worries about a deepening recession and a slower-than-expected recovery of
corporate profits had depressed share prices in July and early August, and
the government's hands-off policy towards the stock market's fall added to
the pessimism.
However, strong buying followed the announcement of the fiscal package -
which included Y10,700bn (Pounds 53.6bn) in public-works spending - and
prompted a return to the Tokyo market.
The size of the package reflected deep concern among the authorities and
their determination to prevent further loss of confidence. Plans to set up a
Japanese version of Resolution Trust Corporation (the US federal agency
responsible for disposing of assets of failed savings and loan groups), to
buy up land held as collateral from the ailing banks, soothed concern over
the health of the financial system.
The government also included measures to support the stock market, by adding
to demand through the increase of public investment allotted to the market,
and by limiting supply by warning financial institutions not to sell shares.
New offers of former government-owned companies, such as Nippon Telegraph &amp;
Telephone and JR East, the railway concern, were also suspended.
Investors expected some Y1,800bn released in public money, including postal
savings and public welfare funds, by the end of September, to support the
market. A further Y1,100bn is also expected to be invested into the equity
market when the supplementary budget has been passed by parliament next
month.
However, with an increasing number of companies reducing their earnings
forecasts, the market may have looked overvalued at the end of the quarter.
The yen's strength, a result of worries about the US economic recovery,
could also affect the profitability of leading exporting companies in the
electronics and automobile industries.
For the final quarter of the year, most market participants forecast a price
adjustment to suit economic fundamentals, such as corporate earnings and
asset values, before share prices can look up again.
Meanwhile, worries over Sino-US trade relations and the failure to obtain
Chinese approval for airport financing caused the Hong Kong market to fall
sharply during the third quarter.
The Hang Seng index closed 9.8 per cent off from the end of June, at
5,505.44, and market participants expect the market to remain volatile in
response to the spate of political deadlines and meetings to define China's
(and consequently the colony's) relationship with countries such as the UK
and US.
Volatility on the currency markets have hit the Australian stock market,
where the All Ordinaries index closed down 9.7 per cent on the quarter at
1,485.10. The weakening of the Australian dollar
dented the resources sector, while the industrial sector provided support,
as corporate earnings remained close to expectations.
In Thailand, the victory of the pro-democracy parties in the mid-September
election has given a positive signal to the economy, which is confirming its
reputation for resilience in the face of political uncertainty. The SET
index rose 12.4 per cent on the quarter, to close at 847.

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (11): Exhausted US
investors prepare for a difficult final quarter

<TEXT>
US STOCK markets put in a resilient third-quarter performance, considering
what happened during a remarkable three months.
Against a background of overseas markets in turmoil, an international
currency crisis (starring a plunging dollar and the breakdown of European
monetary union), the ghostlike return of Saddam Hussein, an anaemic domestic
economy, the biggest natural disaster in US history, and the entry,
withdrawal and re-entry of a potential presidential election spoiler, the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 - the broadest measure of leading share prices -
gained 2.3 per cent in value between July and September, rising to 417.80.
Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4 per cent to 3,271.66
during the period, taken between them, the performance of the Dow and the
S&amp;P showed that US investors were not unduly rattled by the economic,
financial and political chaos that swirled around them.
The key to the reasonable showing of US markets was liquidity. July opened
with yet another interest-rate cut by the US central bank, the Federal
Reserve, which responded to a dreadful June employment report by lowering
the discount rate from 3.5 per cent to 3 per cent.
With interest rates at their lowest levels since the Kennedy presidency,
investors poured out of low-yielding short-term assets and into equities in
search of a better return. The flow of funds into the stock market provided
ballast to share prices at a time when economic fundamentals were
unpromising. Throughout the quarter, market sentiment was subjected to a
steady drip-drip of poor economic news.
Although share prices put in a sudden burst in late July (in the process
sending the S&amp;P to an all-time high), the rush of demand was sparked by the
bond market's reaction to more bad economic news. A sharp fall in long-term
bond yields cheered equity investors, who believed cheaper credit would
boost economic activity in the latter half of the year.
August proved a difficult month, with a string of second quarter corporate
earnings reports disappointing the market. General Motors' figures were
typical. The carmaker's profits came in below expectations, and were
released alongside a warning about future earnings from GM chairman Robert
Stempel that could have been applied to the entire economy: 'Sustaining the
rate of progress we experienced in the first half of this year appears
extremely challenging.'
August ended with investors reacting negatively to President Bush's speech
at the Republican convention and the Democratic candidate, Governor Bill
Clinton, holding a solid lead in the polls. (Although the markets later grew
to learn to live with the likelihood of a Clinton victory, analysts felt
that, by the start of the final quarter, investors had not yet fully
discounted a Democratic win.)
September opened with another dreadful employment report and a tumbling
dollar, which may have prevented the Fed from cutting the discount rate
again.
By the end of the quarter, investors appeared exhausted; and the 90-point
Dow loss in the first three trading days of October, prompted by renewed
concern about the economy, political uncertainty and corporate earnings,
pointed towards a difficult final three months of the year.
Canada had its own problems, including a weak economy, a sudden rise in
interest rates provoked by an attack on the Canadian dollar, and growing
fears that the October 26 referendum on whether Que-
bec should stay part of Canada could lead to a split in the federation.
During the quarter, the Toronto Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.3 per
cent to 3,297.88.
Although the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and
Mexico was finally signed in the third quarter, the Mexican Bolsa index fell
16.5 per cent to 1,327.07 amid concern about the slowing domestic economy
and higher interest rates.

FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: GKN spends Dollars 50m expanding US side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GKN, the automotive components, engineering and industrial services group,
is to invest Dollars 50m (Pounds 31m) expanding its US automotive components
manufacturing activities.
It is planning to increase its capacity for producing constant velocity
joints and driveshafts, the company's main driveline products, to meet an
expected 60 per cent increase in sales in the next three years.
GKN said that it was studying a variety of locations for the new investment
including expansion at its existing sites at Sanford and Alamance in North
Carolina, or the establishment of an additional manufacturing site. The
existing plants have been working at full capacity since April to meet
increased demand.
GKN is the world leader in the supply of constant velocity joints with a
world market share of about 30 per cent.
The company said yesterday that it was benefiting from the large increase in
demand for US-sourced components from Japanese vehicle makers, which have
established assembly plants in the US.
At the same time US vehicle makers are fitting more constant velocity joints
in light trucks, multi-purpose vehicles and four-wheel drive leisure/utility
vehicles with the increasing trend towards front-wheel drive vehicles.
In North America GKN is now supplying Mazda for its US-built MX6 and Mazda
626 models, as well as Ford and Nissan for their jointly developed Nissan
Quest/Mercury Villager multi-purpose vehicle.
The Mazda contract has resulted in extra annual sales of about Dollars 15m
for GKN Automotive Inc, the US subsidiary.
Earlier this year GKN also gained substantial new contracts from vehicle
makers in the US, which will come on stream progressively from 1993 to 1995.
The volume of vehicle driveline component sets to be delivered in North
America will jump from 1.7m in 1991 to 2.1m this year and to about 3.3m in
1995-96.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Castle Communications, the USM-quoted video and audio group, almost doubled
pre-tax profits for the year to June 30.
Turnover fell from Pounds 38.2m to Pounds 31.6m as a result of recession and
closure of unprofitable activities.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.36m, against Pounds 782,000. The latter figure
was restated to reflect the change to a more conservative accounting policy
towards origination costs of items such as sleeve design and artwork.
Profits this time were struck after an exceptional provision of Pounds
351,000 against the fall in value of freehold properties.
The pre-tax figure was helped by lower interest costs of Pounds 1.2m (Pounds
1.44m) and an increased contribution from an associate of Pounds 144,000
(Pounds 55,000).
Earnings per share came out at 10.4p (8p). An unchanged final dividend of
4.5p is recommended for a maintained total of 8.5p.

FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Debt burden slows recovery drive - John
Thornhill considers Isosceles' problems as Gateway chief leaves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BOB Willett's departure yesterday as chief executive of the Gateway
grocery chain again brings into sharp focus the severe problems besetting
the UK's biggest leveraged buy-out and raises renewed doubts about whether
it will ever be able to succeed in floating the business.
When the Isosceles investment vehicle won its bitterly-contested Pounds
2.1bn takeover battle for Gateway in 1989 it held out the prospect of
slimming the business, disposing of its peripheral assets and returning the
grocery chain to the market within three to five years, realising generous
returns for its backers in the process.
The practice has proved infinitely more treacherous than the theory.
Delays in disposing of assets, the severe and lingering recession, and the
intensification of trading pressures as a result of competitors opening new
stores have combined to throw the scenario askew.
Three years on, Isosceles finds itself saddled with Pounds 1.2bn of debt and
little prospect of being able to reduce that, even if it could finally
succeed in disposing of Herman's, the US sporting goods subsidiary.
City analysts suggest Isosceles is now caught on the horns of an acute
financial dilemma. The company is under immense short-term pressure to pay
the interest on its debt, but can only survive in the long term if it
invests in upgrading its core stores and developing its new Somerfield
format.
Mr Willett was a vigorous advocate of developing the business but his
ambitions were kept severely in check by the demands of the bankers. He
considered an annual capital expenditure budget of Pounds 100m was
insufficient to convert enough Somerfield stores to give the chain critical
mass.
Mr Bill Myers, food retailing analyst at stockbrokers Henderson Crosthwaite,
said: 'Somerfield is the core of a good idea. It has been very well-received
by the public and seems to be trading very well.'
To date, however, Isosceles has only opened 60 Somerfield stores and still
has more than 600 Gateway stores which are continuing to face severe
competition.
The trading performance of Gateway's mainstream stores is believed to be
well below budget and was one of the contributory factors in Mr Willett's
departure.
Analysts suggest that Isosceles's remaining businesses can only have a
current market value of about Pounds 600m. 'There is a glaring great hole in
the company's valuation and I am sure that the banks must know that. It is a
grisly scenario,' said one.
It is clearly in the interests of the buy-out's backers to continue to
support the company until some kind of exit route can be found. No bank is
likely to want the embarrassment of crystallising its loss, least of all
Wasserstein Perella, the New York investment boutique which owns 40 per cent
of Isosceles' equity.
It seems improbable that any company would want to buy the entire Gateway
business. The only likely contender, Tengelmann of Germany, has its gaze
fixed firmly on eastern Europe.
Yet Isosceles may still be able to dispose of parcels of its stores to other
retailers and attempt to float a far smaller business at some point down the
line.
Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes, who takes over the operational reins, certainly
faces a formidable task in trying to restore morale at the company's Bristol
headquarters, re-invigorate the trading performance of the core business and
squeeze enough cash from its operations to keep the bankers sweet.

<TEXT>
AER LINGUS, the Irish Republic's state-run national airline, was told
yesterday that it should consider linking up with another airline and that
manpower cuts must be made 'from the top-down' in any rationalisation plan
implemented to stem mounting losses.
Mr Albert Reynolds, prime minister, said yesterday that such links are 'the
way the world aviation business has been moving for a number of years and
that is the way Aer Lingus should be looking.'
Ms Maire Geoghegan Quinn, the Irish transport and communications minister,
said: 'I am very concerned . . . in relation to job maintenance and job
creation in the country.
The airline is currently undertaking a review of its entire operations. This
could result in a substantial pruning of its route network and more than
1,000 redundancies from its 6,500 workforce. Losses are running at IPounds
40m (Pounds 43.4m) a year.
In what appeared to be an implicit criticism of the airline's management, Ms
Geoghegan Quinn said: 'If sacrifices have to be made in the company, then
those sacrifices have to start at the top down'.
Yesterday, the directors of Aer Lingus said: 'Bearing fully in mind the
concerns expressed by the minister, the company is determined to take the
actions necessary to restore the air transport division to profitability'.
On Wednesday Mr Ray Burke, a former industry minister and prominent
backbencher in the ruling Fianna Fail party, called for a cash injection
into the airline saying it would be 'national sabotage' if it were allowed
to undertake a plan of compulsory redundancies.
Ms Geoghegan Quinn was non-committal over Mr Burke's proposal.

<TEXT>
THE HIGH Court yesterday adjourned a case brought by the Department of Trade
and Industry concerning former directors of Polly Peck International, the
fruit, electronics and leisure conglomerate which collapsed in 1990.
The DTI had sought to extend the period during which it could launch
proceedings to have some of the former directors disqualified from becoming
company directors again.
The law allows such proceedings to be brought within two years of the date
of a company going into administration. Polly Peck was put into
administration on October 26 1990, with debts of Pounds 1.3bn.
Proceedings were adjourned so that a judge, as opposed to a registrar, could
hear the petition. The official date has yet to be fixed.

FT  23 OCT 92 / World Trade News: EFA weighs costs and commitment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SEVEN thick volumes, the industrial partners in the European Fighter
Aircraft have set out to meet the demands of the German government and try
to rescue Europe's most important collaborative military programme.
But their report, sent to the UK, German, Italian and Spanish governments
last Friday, could be shutting the stable door after the horse had bolted.
The horse in question is Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister. He is
adamant that the EFA programme, worked on by the four nations since 1984, is
a thing of the past.
The study was commissioned by defence ministers in August after Mr Ruhe
announced that Germany would not go ahead with EFA production. Its target
was to find a way of producing a fighter for 30 per cent less than the price
put forward six months ago and which Germany rejected as far too high.
It concludes that the 30 per cent target could be met using the current EFA
airframe and engines. These have absorbed most of the Pounds 5.5bn (Dollars
8.96bn) already spent on development.
Responding to Mr Ruhe's call for a new aircraft instead of the EFA, the
report examines seven alternative designs but concludes that these would
either be more expensive or fall well short of requirements.
Even if Germany were to stay, its share of the project, geared to the number
of aircraft bought, would be expected to drop from 33 per cent to 25 per
cent, and Britain's to rise from 33 per cent to over 40 per cent.
UK experts believe the 'significant cost savings' would still apply if
Germany quit the project. How the sums would work out if Britain decided to
pursue EFA completely on its own are still unclear, however.
The report was produced by Eurofighter, the Munich-based consortium of
British Aerospace, Deutsche Aerospace, Alenia of Italy and CASA of Spain,
together with the Eurojet engine grouping of Rolls-Royce, Deutsche
Aerospace's MTU subsidiary, Fiat and the Spanish company ITP.
Mr Ruhe has so far been dismissive of UK hopes of keeping even the basic EFA
plan, arguing that the partners should start again and design an aeroplane
for today's needs rather than a world war against the Warsaw Pact. He
attaches more weight to a parallel study being carried out by the four
chiefs of defence staff.
Britain believes the defence chiefs will want an aircraft similar to the
EFA, but Mr Ruhe has other ideas. The crunch is expected to come at a
defence ministers' meeting in early December. Meanwhile, British proponents
of EFA hope to exert pressure on other members of the German government.
Eurofighter's proposed cuts are set against the 'system price' it submitted
in April. This is a price definition used only by Germany, including
production tooling and the cost of keeping aircraft in service for 10 years.
Its figure was DM127m per aircraft, or about Pounds 43m at the exchange
rates of the time.
Eurofighter now says this can be reduced by 13 per cent without changing the
aircraft by reshuffling some of the work share arrangements and reducing the
allowance for logistical support. The aircraft is designed to be more
reliable and therefore cheaper to maintain than its predecessors.
Downgrading some equipment - with a loss of perhaps 4-5 per cent in
performance - would lower this cost to DM100m, a 21 per cent cut.
Eurofighter has dubbed this aircraft the New EFA. Further cuts would offer
more savings. With a limited electronic warfare capability and a current
radar instead of the one being specially developed for EFA, Germany could
achieve a target price of DM90m.
This would also be within the levels that Mr Ruhe says Italy and Spain
regard as a maximum. Both have initially made positive noises about the
report's conclusions. Proponents believe that offering a 'family' of
aircraft will also boost prospects for export to other countries.
Among the alternative new designs considered, only two worked out cheaper
than continuing with EFA, and then only fractionally. Both these would be
single-engined models using on the same EJ200 engine as the twin-engined
EFA. More powerful engines would make them costlier. They would not,
according to Eurofighter, fare well against improved versions of the latest
Russian-made fighters.
The EFA programme has already slipped nine months, and the target for

THERE were conflicting claims yesterday on whether talks between the EC and
US to get a breakthrough on the Uruguay Round were still on - as the
community argued - or off - as the Americans claimed. But there is little
doubt that the world trade liberalisation negotiations stood last night on
the brink of collapse.
On Monday night, US negotiators said the negotiations had reached a dead
end. They accused the EC of reopening arguments over cereals and cereal
substitutes trade which the Americans thought had been settled. This further
poisoned the separate bilateral dispute over the EC's oilseeds subsidy
regime.
Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, was last night due to
telephone US agriculture secretary Mr Ed Madigan, just before senior US
officials met to decide whether to activate Dollars 1bn in punitive tariffs
on EC food exports, because of the oilseeds row.
Mr MacSharry was expected to clarify the EC's bottom line, in the hope of
staving off a trade war and salvaging the Uruguay Round. If the US
introduced the sanctions, 'we will have no alternative but to
counter-retaliate,' Mr MacSharry said.
Senior Commission officials claimed the US was trying to exert pressure by
negotiating through the media. US officials accuse the commission of
backtracking under French pressure to conserve its lucrative food exports,
and German pressure to keep out cheap US cereals substitutes.
'They know that we know that they have a deadline,' an EC official said,
referring to President George Bush's hope for a Gatt deal to boost his
chances of re-election.
There are political issues for the French too. The Socialist government
faces defeat in next spring's elections. Under pressure from its farmers, it
is retreating from its commitments under May's reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy. The reforms entail cuts in farm prices and output which
enable the EC to make farm trade cuts within Gatt.
The US says it has no further room for manoeuvre on the oilseeds dispute.
The Gatt has twice ruled against the EC oilseed subsidy regime, and pressure
from powerful US soya producers and trade lobbies mounted as a deal on farm
trade got nearer last week.
Yet only half-a-million tonnes of soya appear to separate the two sides.
Washington wants EC oilseed output cut to 9m tonnes a year. The EC says CAP
reform, reducing the area sown with oilseeds, would yield a 9.5m tonne crop.
'We can't do any more than that without opening up the CAP reform; they're
playing into the hands of the French,' one EC official said.
On subsidised exports, the Gatt prescribes a 24 per cent cut in volume. The
US offered 22 per cent. The EC wants flexibility between product sectors, or
'swings'. That way it could sell, say, more wheat if it sold less barley, as
long as the uniform figure for both was met over six years. It has offered:
a 24 per cent cut with 10 per cent 'swings' in each sector; a 21 per cent
cut with 4 per cent swings; or a straight, no frills 18 per cent cut. All
three formulas deliver less than 22 per cent.
But negotiations were progressing until the commission, under German as well
as French pressure, reaffirmed its need for 'rebalancing' - some EC
protection against cheap US cereal substitutes such as corn gluten feed.
Breaking this impasse now appears to depend on whether the commission can
hold the French to their CAP undertakings, and get full-blooded support from
EC leaders. Brussels will also have to work out some formula on oilseeds
which will safeguard the EC's farm reform and relieve some pressure on Mr
Bush. Otherwise the chance to reform the world's trading regime may sink
with the seemingly electorally moribund governments in Washington and Paris.

<TEXT>
MR John Major, the British prime minister, yesterday rejected a French
assertion that a conclusion to talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade may now be several months away.
In response to reports that Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister,
believes any serious transatlantic dialogue in the Gatt negotiations is
'several months' away, whatever the result of next month's US presidential
election, Mr Major stated that European Community countries had agreed at
last week's Birmingham summit to complete the accord by the end of the year.
Reminding the House of Commons that he spoke as president of the EC council,
Mr Major said the differences between the EC and the US could be bridged.
'What is needed is for both sides to stay at the negotiating table and I
will do all I can to bring that about.'
He said his view was shared by Mr Frans Andriessen, the trade commissioner,
and 'the majority of member states.'
France, like other EC members, yesterday contested US suggestions that the
EC-US talks on Gatt and agriculture had come to a final rupture. But, in
contrast to London and Bonn, Paris regards the farm trade negotiations as
effectively in abeyance until a new US administration takes office in
January.
By that time, however, France will be weeks away from its own legislative
elections, strengthening the government's resistance to US demands on
cutting EC, chiefly French, farm exports.
Mr Major's counter-claims come against a background of mounting concern in
the UK that any delay in a conclusion of the Gatt talks would seriously
jeopardise the prospects of economic recovery.

FT  23 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Likely battle plans if war breaks out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Arthur Dunkel, the ever-patient director general of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), remains resolute that the latest setback in
farm trade negotiations between the European Community and the US will not
be fatal.
'I can't imagine that the US or the EC would take the responsibility of
breaking down the round at a time when we need so much a success as a signal
for the very sluggish world economy,' he said yesterday. Over the past 40
years, trade liberalisation under Gatt has been credited with much of the
global economic growth that has marked the post-war period.
But what if the unimaginable happened? What if the US administration
announced the immediate imposition of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) of punitive
tariffs on EC farm exports as a sop to oilseed farmers who have argued for
six years - and won Gatt support in their case - that the EC's oilseed
subsidy regime is damaging their exports?
The immediate response would be retaliation from the EC, which has already
drawn up, but not made public, a 'hit-list' of US farm exports that would be
targeted.
From here, the slippery slope to trade war is more difficult to chart. It is
likely that subsidy wars would be declared on a number of farm product -
wheat and beef would be early candidates. The price for taxpayers in the EC
and the US could be considerable, as funds are channelled into such subsidy
wars. The price for other farm exporters, like Australia, Argentina, Canada,
and many developing countries, could be even greater as exports are lost and
farm export prices fall.
A long-standing dispute over steel exports to the US would also quickly
spill over, perhaps with the US imposing countervailing duties on imports
from countries deemed to be dumping steel into the US market. A number of
other disputes have been held in abeyance while Uruguay Round negotiations
have continued in good faith and these would quickly rise to the surface.
Another casualty of a deterioration in trade relations would be the Gatt's
dispute-settlement system - the only multilateral forum in which trade
complaints can be dealt with. Already Mr Dunkel has talked of
'non-implementation of many (dispute) panel findings continuing to undermine
the effectiveness of the Gatt system'.
He said in his annual report in March that two-thirds of panel reports since
1986 needing domestic action had not been acted upon. Many countries have
linked action to a successful outcome of the Uruguay Round. Nine out of
every 10 cases involve Japan, Canada, the US or the EC.
The US has already warned that it has exhausted its patience with the Gatt
dispute settlement system as far as its dispute with the EC over oilseeds is
concerned.
Implicit is that the US will in future settle disputes bilaterally rather
than use Gatt.
A number of recent successes by the US in using its domestic 'Section 301'
legislation to force trade, or market opening compromises from countries
like China, India and Taiwan suggests that a Uruguay Round failure would see
rapid abandonment of multilateral dispute settlement procedures.
A further price of failure would be that areas of trade still outside the
multilateral framework - like trade in services, textiles and farm products,
and in protection of intellectual property - would remain hampered by
national trade barriers or regulation.

The US Department of Commerce has ruled that several Korean companies,

The Korean semiconductor industry fears that if the preliminary dumping
ruling stands it could cripple exports to the US, its biggest market.
The US accounts for 44 per cent of Korean Dram exports.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1979, thousands of American farmers rode their tractors into Washington
to protest about low farm prices.
Their timing was unfortunate. The protest blocked traffic for hours during a
Washington blizzard. The farmers' 'tractorcade' is still referred to with
bitterness.
Since then farm groups and their agribusiness colleagues have developed more
effective methods of bringing Congress and the White House to heel. They
have built strong coalitions with other farm groups and with both Democrats
and Republicans in Congress and the administration. Their influence is
reflected in letters signed by dozens of senators and congressmen,
distributed to the media and dispatched to apply pressure on officials in
the executive branch.
Europeans are often bemused by the power of these lobbies. A breakthrough
over agriculture in the Uruguay Round was all but achieved last week, when
it was vetoed by Mr Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau
Federation, who telephoned Mr Ed Madigan the US agriculture secretary,
during the negotiations.
Well-placed political contributions buy access for adroit Washington
representatives. Relationships are cemented in lunches and other social
functions, bought by the lobbyists, who themselves are often former
government officials.
Direct financial backing is distributed through political action committees,
(PACs) funded mostly by agribusiness, chemical and food companies, and
related manufacturers. Among the PACs financing the congressional elections
in 1990 were: the American Soyabean Association, the American Sugarbeet
Growers, Dow Chemical Company, General Mills and Phillip Morris.
The hard times in the farm belt have stretched the budgets of many farmer
organisations. The populist American Agriculture Movement has little extra
cash, but it helps farmers who come to Washington to lobby their
Congressman.
The American Soyabean Association - the group which filed the complaint over
EC oilseeds subsidies, which the US brought to the Gatt and won - receives
contributions from agribusiness and funding to promote exports of soyabeans
from the proceeds of some soyabean sales and the US agriculture department.
The group, which has strong ties all over Washington, has been urging the
administration to take strong action against the EC for refusing to phase
out its oilseeds subsidies since August.
It has no illusions about the stakes. Mr Steve Yoder, president of the
American Soyabean Association, says: 'I lay awake nights worrying about a
trade war.' But he also worries about the shrinking EC market, and sees no
alternative to sanctions.

FT  23 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Talks failure highlights rift in
commission

<TEXT>
THE latest frustrating episode in the effort to get a world trade deal has
highlighted a bitter rift inside the European Commission between its
president, Mr Jacques Delors, and agriculture commissioner, Mr Ray
MacSharry.
According to senior officials in Brussels, Mr Delors and Mr MacSharry have
clashed over how far the commission should go in granting concessions to the
US. Mr Delors is understood to feel that Mr MacSharry has already yielded
too much.
On the eve of last week's EC summit in Birmingham, Mr Delors, who is said to
nurse ambitions to succeed President Francois Mitterrand when he steps down
from the Elysee, said 'the adolescent (European) community should be able to
say no to its big brother (the US), provided it has a sound argument to do
so.'
Mr Delors' words left the impression in Brussels that he was taking his
native country's side. Last week, Mr Delors acknowledged there were rumours
to this effect but he vigorously dismissed this as 'pure slander'.
However, it is clear Mr Delors faces the dilemma of reconciling his duties
to the community as a whole with his emotional commitment to French farmers.
Mr Delors denied that he had been sitting on the fence during Gatt talks led
by Mr MacSharry and Mr Frans Andriessen, external affairs commissioner.
But both EC negotiators are understood to be privately disappointed that Mr
Delors has not come out unequivocally behind efforts which only last week
appeared on the brink of success.
Mr Delors said last week that the subsidised farm trade dispute was 'not
just a French problem,' arguing that 'there must be an equitable
arrangement' in any Gatt deal.
His criticisms of the food production restraints required by Gatt
nevertheless centred largely on tighter limits already put in place in May
within the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Mr Delors'
remarks came shortly after senior French officials had made clear in
Brussels that they did not believe the CAP reform would work or be adhered
to.
Senior commission officials interpreted this as a French retreat from its
commitments under the new CAP.
'It is clear now that France never really intended to comply with CAP
reform,' one said.
Nevertheless, Mr Delors, in his seven-and-a-half year stewardship of the
commission, has given it the strongest leadership it has had for 25 years.
Mr MacSharry and Mr Andriessen, along with other commission colleagues, are
looking to him to display the same political courage now.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Mackay criticised on fees: Law Society Conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MARK SHELDON, president of the Law Society, criticised the Lord
Chancellor yesterday for refusing to delay implementation of standard fees
for criminal legal aid work in magistrates' courts.
Mr Sheldon told the Law Society's annual conference in Birmingham that Lord
Mackay's proposals were 'ill-judged, ill-planned, ill-structured and unfair'
and posed a threat to the fair operation of the criminal justice system.
Lord Mackay, who is expected to reply in a speech at the conference on
Saturday, sees standard fees as a means of curbing legal-aid expenditure,
which will reach Pounds 1bn this year. At the present rate of growth,
legal-aid costs will double within three years.
Mr Sheldon, senior partner of City solicitors Linklater &amp; Paines, said Lord
Mackay should put his plans on hold until after the Royal Commission on
Criminal Justice had reported next summer.
The commission was bound to recommend fundamental changes in the way
criminal defence and prosecution work should be conducted. But Lord Mackay
had made clear that he would not take any changes into account when setting
fees in future, Mr Sheldon said.
'At a time when concern about the integrity of the criminal process has
never been greater is it right to be introducing standard fees which could
compromise the fair administration of criminal justice?' he asked.
Mr Sheldon also warned Lord Mackay on wider advocacy rights for solicitors
in the higher courts. He said the society would submit one application to
the Lord Chancellor covering all solicitors, including those employed by the
Crown Prosecution Service and the government legal service.
If the Lord Chancellor rejected that application, it would bring the whole
rights-of-audience process - the central plank of his reforms - to a halt,
Mr Sheldon warned.
The Lord Chancellor's advisory committee and Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief
Justice, are opposed to CPS lawyers having rights of audience in the Crown
Court.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Trade deficit eases to Pounds 1.06bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S visible trade gap narrowed slightly last month with a fall in both
exports and imports, official figures showed yesterday.
The value of imported goods was 2.7 per cent lower last month compared with
August, while the value of exports fell by 2 per cent.
That left a visible trade deficit of Pounds 1.06bn, compared with Pounds
1.15bn in August. The current-account deficit, which includes a projected
Pounds 0.1bn surplus on invisible items such as financial services,
government transfers and dividends, narrowed to Pounds 0.96bn against Pounds
1.05bn in August.
The Central Statistical Office, which published the figures, said sterling's
recent devaluation had yet to make an impact on the current account.
The only indication came from a 1 per cent increase in import prices, the
biggest rise for almost two years.
City commentators warned that Britain's trade position was likely to
deteriorate over the months ahead as more expensive imports pushed the
deficit on the current account wider than Pounds 1bn a month, about the
level at which it has been running since the beginning of the year.
Export growth is also likely to remain subdued as Britain's main markets in
Europe contract. The Treasury said last month's 2 per cent fall in exports
was 'not surprising, given the slowdown in world economies'.
The underlying trade deficit, which excludes earnings from oil and erratic
items such as aircraft and precious stones, also narrowed in September to
stand at Pounds 1.3bn compared with Pounds 1.65bn in the previous month.
The CSO pointed out that in the latest three months, the trade picture had
barely changed. In the latest quarter, the visible trade deficit was Pounds
3.3bn compared with Pounds 3.2bn in the second quarter.
The value of imports was Pounds 0.2bn lower than in the previous quarter
while the value of exported goods was Pounds 0.34bn lower.
Measured by volume, exports excluding oil and erratics rose 2.5 per cent
last month compared with August, but remained well below the peak reached in
May this year. Import volumes fell by 2 per cent from August's record high.
In the latest three months, export volumes fell 1 per cent compared with the
previous quarter, while imports rose 1.5 per cent.
Mr Gwyn Hacche, UK economist at James Capel, said: 'There is still this
puzzle of why imports are so strong, given the weakness of the economy, and
why the underlying trade deficit is so wide at the very bottom of a
recession.'
The strongest-performing export sectors in the third quarter were food,
drink and tobacco, fuels, cars and certain consumer goods. Exports of basic
materials and intermediate and capital goods fell.
There were big increases in import volumes of fuels, chemical and consumer
goods over the latest quarter. The surplus on oil fell from Pounds 251m in
August to Pounds 77m last month.
Exports to all areas other than to east Europe and north America, including
Canada, fell over the three months to September. Exports to oil-exporting
countries dropped 14 per cent compared with the second quarter.

<TEXT>
THE TREASURY is con-sidering publishing more details about its secret
assessments of the economy, carried out monthly with the Bank of England, as
part of a new policy of openness.
The option is one of several under discussion as Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, attempts to make it easier for financial markets and the public
to understand the basis for economic policy after the shock of the pound's
devaluation.
Mr Lamont is expected in his Mansion House speech next Thursday to give
information about efforts to make policymaking at the Treasury more open.
Under one idea being studied by the Treasury, a version of the minutes of
the Treasury's monetary assessment committee, which meets about the middle
of each month and considers the main econonomic indicators affecting policy,
would be published some time afterwards.
The committee is chaired by Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary,
and includes senior monetary officials from the Treasury and the Bank. Other
members include Mr Alan Budd, Treasury chief economic adviser, and Mr Tony
Coleby and Mr Ian Plenderleith, two of the Bank's directors.
Among the indicators considered by the committee in its monthly reviews are
growth in the money supply, retail sales, the state of the housing market
and other - anecdotal - evidence that can shed light on demand and inflation
pressures.
The Treasury will not want to publish advice given by specific officials to
mini-sters because doing so would infringe Civil Service convention.
The Treasury could find a way round that by publishing a broad assessment.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Pilkington arm wins chips deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A SUBSIDIARY of Pilkington, the UK glass company, has won an agreement to
license its semiconductor technology to Motorola, the US electronics and
communications group and fourth-biggest semiconductor manufacturer in the
world.
The agreement with Motorola is the third licensing deal for Pilkington
Micro-electronics, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the glass group, which
specialises in new designs for semiconductor chips. The first was in 1988
with GEC Plessey Semiconductors, followed by a licensing agreement in 1989
with Toshiba of Japan.
It takes the company forward in its ambitions to establish its technology as
a world standard in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), one of the
fastest-growing markets in the semiconductor industry. The market for FPGAs,
which are used in computers and instrumentation, is forecast to see compound
annual growth of about 60 per cent.
PMel - established in 1986 to license technologies to semiconductor
manufacturers - won the agreement over leading figures in the FPGA market.
The company does not disclose how much it has earned so far on down payments
and royalties. Mr Kenneth Austin, vice-chairman of PMel and inventor of the
technology being licensed to Motorola, said: 'Creating these strategic
alliances is the way forward.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PERKS such as company cars have been cut during the recession, according to
a survey of personnel staff by Reward Group, the employment consultancy.
The survey - based on returns from more than 4,000 members of the Institute
of Personnel Management - differs from findings recently published by the
Confederation of British Industry, which indicated that employee benefits
had not generally been cut.
Reward says provision of company cars has fallen this year to 25 per cent of
respondents compared with 31 per cent last year. Cars were also being
changed less frequently.

RETAILERS will have to restructure their businesses to cope with a permanent
era of low margins, the Verdict retail consultancy said yesterday, John
Thornhill writes. It expects weak demand and overcapacity to depress the
sector's profitability for the foreseeable future.
It suggests that devaluation of the pound will not spur an immediate rise in
retail price inflation because retailers can ill afford to pass on price
rises when consumer demand is so weak. Verdict also expects inflation in
shop prices to remain steady at about 4 per cent for the coming year, rising
to just over 5 per cent by 1996.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Specialist team urged to beat VAT avoidance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SPECIALIST team should be set up within the Customs and Excise department
to co-ordinate efforts to crack down on value added tax avoidance, the
National Audit Office, the government's spending watchdog, said yesterday.
In a report on the department's efforts to counter VAT avoidance, the NAO
said that, overall, the matter had been contained.
The report said: 'Nearly all significant avoidance schemes countered over
the years have come to light as a result of the vigilance of the
department's VAT control staff.'
Legislative methods over the past seven years to counter VAT avoidance have
resulted in the collection annually of an additional Pounds 500m.
Customs and Excise staff issue assessments for traders - rather than accept
a trader's own estimate of liability - only when they believe the trader has
arranged business affairs specifically to avoid paying VAT.
Sample cases outlined in the study include:
A publican who failed to pay VAT on bar meals, claiming those meals were a
separate catering service offered by his wife.
A manufacturer and known avid racing fan who avoided paying VAT on a
racehorse by saying the horse had been purchased for business promotion
purposes.
A large company that issued shares mainly for sale in the UK for which it
would have to pay 'input' tax tried to avoid it by first selling the shares
in the Channel Islands.
The NAO said an analysis of 'disaggregation' cases - those where it was
believed that a company had split itself into several independent parts to
avoid paying VAT - showed that the department won 75 per cent of all cases.
Cases were upheld where it could be clearly demonstrated that the business
split was solely for the purpose of avoiding tax.
The report also said taxpayers should be assessed for tax only when it was
fully justified and they should be treated fairly and consistently. The NAO
said that, so far, the department had used its legal powers fully but with
due care.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Outlook for orders 'still weak'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK EMPLOYMENT, home orders, exports and investment are all pointing
downwards, according to the latest quarterly survey from the British
Chambers of Commerce.
The chambers reported yesterday that Britain fell into a 'second leg' of the
recession in the third quarter, with business confidence in manufacturing
and services dropping to levels last seen in the winter of 1990-91, when the
recession's first dip was 'at its worst'.
The renewed decline has affected manufacturing worst, although services also
suffered a 'significant setback'. While the economy in the second quarter
had appeared poised between recession and growth, a renewed decline is set
to continue, the chambers said.
Manufacturers suffered an 'alarming decline' in orders in the third quarter.
The number of companies reporting a drop in domestic orders exceeded those
reporting an increase by 22 percentage points. Export markets were also weak
and the service sector reported virtually no growth.
The chambers said that the rate of job shedding increased nationwide in the
third quarter. In London, 29 per cent more manufacturers cut their
workforces than increased staff. Investment plans continued to be cut, while
less than one company in five is working at capacity.
The report, based on a survey of 8,242 companies with 1.3m workers, was
completed before the coal crisis, the cut in base rates to 8 per cent and
the change of emphasis in economic policy towards growth.
The chambers warned that a quick turnround in business conditions was
unlikely in spite of later changes because of the weak outlook for orders
and employment. London, the west Midlands and Wales fared worst in the
latest quarter.
The chambers found:
The north-east, the 'star region' in previous surveys, experienced a
pronounced 'double dip' into recession.
Merseyside was back in recession with a 'dramatic' fall in manufacturers'
home deliveries.
The east Midlands slipped back into economic decline after reporting
manufacturing growth in the second quarter.
The west Midlands, one of the worst performing regions, suffered a sharp
drop in manufacturing confidence.
Wales slipped back from the verge of recovery with the worst decline in home
orders, the lowest levels of recruitment and investment and the fewest
companies working at full capacity.
East Anglia's order books shrank at a faster rate than the rest of the UK.
The Thames valley was back in recession, although the high-tech industries
in the M4 corridor boosted exports.
The Southern region, covering Kent, Sussex, south-east Hampshire and Dorset,
suffered a sharp drop in confidence.
The northern home counties endured a very sharp decline in manufacturing
home and export orders, and have the most pessimistic employment
expectations. London, worst affected in job losses, faces a further wave of
redundancies.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Chambers call for capital spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Chambers of Commerce, the umbrella organisation for regional
chambers, called on the government yesterday to restore business confidence
through a 10-point programme embracing increased capital spending and
deregulation.
But after presenting a bleak survey of business conditions, Mr Christopher
Stewart Smith, British Chambers president, warned against 'a reckless dash
for growth'.
The British Chambers' members in manufacturing, construction and service
industries would not be best served by a new sharp cut in bank base rates
from their present 8 per cent level, he said. There were 'no simple fixes'
for the economy.
Mr Stewart Smith called on the government to:
Maintain vital capital spending, giving priority to infrastructure
investment, especially in transport.
Provide more support for export promotion.
Manage the public-sector pay round so that increases are less than
inflation.
Push for an agreement in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks.
Hold down the uniform business rate (UBR).
Proceed with deregulation, particularly by cutting red tape for small and
medium-sized businesses.
Improve public-sector payment terms so small companies are not left waiting
for bill payment. Exempt empty properties from the UBR.
Improve the support services given to businesses, especially small
companies. Liberalise European air transport.
Mr Stewart Smith said the cost of making business trips to Europe was
increasingly prohibitive, especially for small companies.
He said the government was in a strong position to boost business
confidence.
New roads to the east coast ports, the Channel tunnel link, and the Jubilee
and Crossrail lines in London were 'vital for the future competitive-ness of
British business and the efficiency of the capital'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
METROLINK, the operators of Greater Manchester's Pounds 130m tram system,
said yesterday it expected to submit plans to the government this year to
expand the network to Oldham and Rochdale.
Mr Chris Mulligan, director-general of Greater Manchester Passenger
Transport Executive said if approved, the local-authority-backed scheme
could see light railways from Manchester to the two towns operating next
year or in 1994.
Discussions were also under way about possible extensions to Salford Quays,
Trafford Park and Manchester airport.
Manchester's bid for the 2000 Olympics meant another possible extension, to
the city's east, where a cycling velodrome and Olympic stadium are planned.
Mr Chelvin Hibbert, Metrolink chief executive, said more than 3m people had
used the service between Bury, Manchester city centre and Altrincham since
it began six months ago. Metrolink says the electric trams, which run on
rail lines and the streets, have boosted retail shopping.
Up to 20 other British towns and cities might use similar systems, with
Sheffield due to begin services next in 1993, the operators said.

RETAILERS will have to restructure their businesses to cope with a permanent
era of low margins, according to a report from the Verdict retail
consultancy.
The report sees weak demand and overcapacity continuing to depress the
sector's profitability for the foreseeable future. It says the pound's
devaluation will not spur an immediate rise in retail price inflation for
three reasons:
Retailers can ill afford to pass on price rises when consumer demand is so
weak. Many retailers have bought forward their goods for several months
ahead and will only slowly feel an inflationary squeeze.
Retailers will review their sourcing arrangements and increasingly switch to
buying UK-manufactured goods.
The report says that companies such as Marks and Spencer, which buys more
than 80 per cent of its products in its home market, will be better able to
resist inflationary pressures.
The report predicts inflation in shop prices remaining steady at about 4 per
cent for the next year, rising to just over 5 per cent by 1996.
In the food retailing sector, the report predicts that J. Sainsbury, Tesco
and Safeway will increasingly dominate the superstore market.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England, as portrayed in the Bingham report, has spent the last
decade as the financial equivalent of the Wizard of Oz. Behind an impressive
facade of masonry, tradition and legal powers lurks a cowering midget,
uncertain of its strength and anxious, at all costs, to avoid putting it to
the test.
The history of the Bank's relationship with BCCI divides into three periods.
First comes a phase when BCCI is newly established in the UK and the Bank is
feeling its way as a newly-empowered banking supervisor.
This period is characterised by a failure by the Bank to grasp that it has
the duty to supervise BCCI directly under the 1979 banking act, rather than
merely treating it as a UK branch of a foreign bank. Just as seriously, it
fails to react to early signs of problems at BCCI, particularly the decision
by Bank of America to withdraw as a shareholder. Until this point, the Bank
has been placing great store in Bank of America's role.
At around this time, also, the Bank learns of the scale of BCCI's exposure
to the Gokal shipping empire. And it is aware of suspicions that BCCI has
been financing the purchase of 'a considerable tranche of its own shares'.
Yet it allows BCCI to obtain a deposit-taking licence in the UK.
The second period is one of drift. Throughout the 1980s, the Bank is
repeatedly told that there is something seriously wrong at BCCI and that the
group's principal supervisor, the Luxembourg central bank, is unable to
guarantee adequate supervision. There is a long internal debate inside the
Bank about what to do. Papers are drafted, redrafted, submitted, discussed.
Initiatives are started, falter, fail. Little of substance results.
Real crisis
Meanwhile, at BCCI there has been a real crisis: the treasury operation,
which has been trading actively in financial instruments and commodities,
has lost hundreds of millions of dollars. Some Bank officials think BCCI's
managers are reckless (and therefore presumably not 'fit and proper persons'
to be entrusted with the stewardship of a deposit-taking institution).
Others think this is a bit strong - but, says Bingham, 'none thought the
BCCI management had been other than seriously imprudent'. Yet they fail to
seize the moment, tending 'to lose sight of their primary duty to protect
the bank's UK depositors'.
The third period - from the late 1980s to the bank's closure in the summer
of 1991 - is the most frenzied. Price Waterhouse, by now BCCI's sole
auditors, discovers bad banking on a breathtaking scale, and clear signs
pointing towards management malpractice. At the same time, the Bank is
receiving a number of other warnings, from people who should have been
listened to.
Throughout this period, information does not flow as it should within the
Bank and between it and the outside world. At the last, revelation of the
scale of BCCI's fraud comes as a terrible shock to officials within the Bank
who should have been aware of it months before.
Problem of culture
The weaknesses Bingham describes are mainly a problem of culture. The report
describes the Bank's officials as 'rather easily deterred'; they shy away
from the risk of public criticism; they repeatedly make an 'inadequate
supervisory response'; they are apparently more concerned about preserving
the convention that 'the world attends on the Bank' than in visiting Abu
Dhabi to meet BCCI's shareholders.
The Bank, as an institution, on several occasions fails 'to measure up to
the task'. Middle-level supervisors fail to pass information on to their
seniors; their seniors fail to tell the Board of Banking Supervision - the
apex of the Bank's supervisory structure - of vital warnings.
The board itself asks the right questions, and at times tries to kick the
machinery into more forceful action; yet because it is starved of
information, it fails to enforce a change of course.
One solution to a cultural problem is to change the people who embody the
culture. The Bank's most senior executives have decided against personnel
changes, which increases the need for a cultural transformation. Without it,
the Bank's new legal and investigative units may well prove ineffective. The
next governor, who will succeed Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton sometime next year,
must be someone prepared to seize the Bank with both hands, and shake it
soundly.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Local lessons from Little Rock: Michael Prowse examines the
successes and failures of Bill Clinton's policies during his 12 years as
Arkansas governor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the closing stages of the election campaign President George Bush is
trying to win votes by convincing the public that Mr Bill Clinton has made a
hash of governing Arkansas. The state ranks at or near bottom on almost
every social and economic criteria, says Mr Bush. 'He would do for the
United States what he's done to Arkansas. We do not want to be the lowest of
the low.'
Arkansas is still one of the poorest states in the US. It ranks 47th in
terms of income, ahead of only Mississippi, Utah and West Virginia. Per
capita incomes are three-quarters of the national average, roughly the same
ratio as in 1979 when Mr Clinton was first elected governor. But while the
scale of Mr Clinton's achievement in Arkansas is disputed, the implication
that he has done nothing right in 12 years is unwarranted.
Mr Clinton's first gubernatorial term was a failure. The youthful governor,
then in his early 30s, charged in 'like a knight on a white horse to set the
world straight' recalls Ms Diane Blair, a campaign official and old friend.
'He tried to do too much, too soon and stepped on just about every economic
toe in Arkansas.'
Defeat in 1980 by a Republican was a seminal event in Mr Clinton's life. He
returned to the governor's mansion in 1983 a wiser politician, committed to
consensus, rather than controversy, and convinced that he could make
progress only on one or two fronts at a time.
The priorities he chose were economic development and educational reform.
The statistics point to significant achievements in both fields. Mr Clinton
has also been innovative in welfare reform, pioneering forms of 'work-fare'
that make benefits conditional on acceptance of jobs or skill training. But
his record since 1983 can be criticised in many other respects. For example,
he has relied too heavily on an unfair tax system, paid too little attention
to the environment, failed to pass civil rights legislation, and done less
than some other states to reform a poorly functioning health-care system.
In promoting industrial development Mr Clinton has struck a balance between
free enterprise and government intervention. 'I know Bill well enough to
know he's fully committed to the free market,' says Mr Warren Stephens,
president of Stephens Inc, a financial services group based in Little Rock.
Mr Stephens is backing Mr Clinton in the presidential race, having always
previously favoured Republicans.
But while welcoming competition, Mr Clinton believes government must create
an environment conducive to growth. His 'hands on' approach was tested in
1985 when International Paper threatened to close down its plants in Pine
Bluff and Camden, mill towns in southern Arkansas. 'Clinton went nuts,' says
Mr John Brummett, political editor of the Arkansas Times. After hectic
negotiations, he persuaded the company to expand its operations in Arkansas,
but only after creating an unusually generous investment tax credit worth
seven cents on the dollar.
Mr Dave Harrington, the head of Arkansas's Industrial Development
Commission, says the state's goal is to forge a partnership between the
private and public sectors. 'We're in trouble in this country because many
people believe government and business should be separated. Elsewhere there
is a unity of purpose, a complementarity. Mr Clinton has brought a lot of
that to Arkansas.'
The commission has targetted high-tech sectors, such as aerospace, in its
bid to strengthen Arkansas's manufacturing base. Along with development
agencies in other states it also energetically promotes inward investment,
offering both tax incentives and special support services. 'We guarantee to
a company that we will tailor-train its workforce,' says Mr Harrington. 'We
do whatever it takes, including, for example, sending workers to Germany for
training.'
The Arkansas economy has revived during the Clinton years, creating jobs
faster than the nation, especially in the past three years. Manufacturing
employment has grown about 12 per cent since 1980 compared with a 9 per cent
contraction nationally, and accounts for about 20 per cent of employment
against 15 per cent nationally. Some 109 foreign companies, including big
names such as British Aerospace and Dassault, the French aerospace group,
have sizeable investments in the state, three times as many as in 1979.
How much of this progress reflects active industrial policies is uncertain.
Companies have also been attracted by Arkansas's low wages, weak unions and
central location. During the Bush years, the state may have looked
artificially strong because other regions experienced a hangover after the
speculative excesses of the 1980s.
In the longer-term, Arkansas hopes that educational reforms will pay
economic dividends. In the late 1970s Arkansas schools were widely regarded
as among the nation's worst. On some measures they still lag badly: Arkansas
ranks 25th out of 28 states using the American College Test, a popular
college admission exam. This is a few places worse than in 1979.
Mr Burton Elliott, Arkansas's director of education, says the lack of
improvement reflects a rise from 38 per cent to 51 per cent in the
proportion of students attending college; many of the weaker pupils tested
today would have been drop-outs a decade ago. But he readily concedes the
benefits of many reforms are yet to be realised. 'School improvement is a
process, not an event; it takes time.'
Mr Clinton's main schools legislation was passed in 1983, following a year
of state-wide consultations led by his wife, Hillary. The measures included
an increase in teachers' salaries, then the lowest in the US; tougher course
requirements (many schools in rural areas had not previously offered
advanced courses in maths, science or languages); a reduction in average
class sizes; and regular testing of pupils to check progress.
In the past two years, Mr Clinton has built on this foundation with a
'second wave' of reforms. He has encouraged more competition within the
public sector by allowing students a free choice of schools and by making
school districts publish 'report cards' measuring their relative
performance. Teachers' salaries have again been increased, rising by 14 per
cent in the past year. .
Mr Mahlon Martin, head of the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation in Little
Rock, says Mr Clinton's real achievement has been to change attitudes. A
state that previously paid little attention to schooling has been persuaded
that 'the long-term solution to economic problems lies in a commitment to
education'. In a poor region, money speaks louder than words. Mr Clinton has
repeatedly persuaded a sceptical legislature to finance educational reforms
by big increases in sales taxes.
He has done so partly by taking on the teachers' unions. The 1 cent sales
tax to finance the 1983 reforms was agreed only after Mr Clinton insisted on
competence tests for teachers. Some 1,400 teachers lost their jobs, causing
a rupture in relations between union leaders and Mr Clinton.
While grudgingly acknowledging some achievements, Mr Clinton's critics in
Arkansas find plenty to complain about. 'He has been a tax-and-spend
governor who believes in intervention,' says Mr Charles Venus, a Little Rock
economic consultant with a free market bent.
'Within six months or a year' of entering the White House, a President
Clinton would be pressing for a national value-added tax to pay for social
reforms, he warns. The figures, however, hardly suggest that Mr Clinton has
created a Leviathan in Arkansas: the ratio of state and local taxes to
personal incomes is still the fifth-lowest in the nation.
Ms Meredith Oakley, a political columnist for the conservative Arkansas
Democrat-Gazette, is even more scathing. 'I'd rate him only average as a
chief executive. It's not his vision that I have problems with, it's his
ability to translate it into something worthwhile. Millions of Americans are
going to be disappointed.'
Mr Brummett of the Arkansas Times, while better disposed towards Mr Clinton,
echoes her theme. 'The bottom line is that he could have got a lot more done
if he had pushed harder. He has a tendency to compromise quickly. He is
obsessed with trying to please people.'
Critics cite two instances where Mr Clinton has fallen short. The governor
has repeatedly relied on increases in sales taxes which are 'regressive' -
in the sense that they inevitably absorb a larger proportion of the incomes
of the poor than the rich. The excuse was that this was unavoidable because
a three-quarters majority of the legislature is needed to pass an increase
in income taxes. Mr Brummett and others, however, say Mr Clinton had the
authority to insist on a fairer solution; he could at least have won
exemptions for commodities such as food.
The environment is a second example. 'He went for jobs, jobs, jobs when he
could have been truer to his instincts,' says one critic. Mr Clinton has
been widely attacked for standing back while big companies, such as poultry
producers, badly polluted Arkansas's rivers.
No governor who has served as long as Mr Clinton can avoid mistakes or
expect to be free of controversy. But what general conclusions for a Clinton
presidency can be drawn from his Arkansas record?
His belief in education as a vehicle for economic and social advance is hard
to question. If elected, he would be certain to use the power of the
presidency to promote this cause. Perhaps more surprising, he has just as
solid a record in promoting business; he differs with many conservatives
only in instinctively rejecting a laissez-faire approach. Rightly or
wrongly, he is likely to regard his Arkansas record as evidence that active
industrial policies can indeed 'grow manufacturing jobs'.
The biggest doubt lies over his toughness: will he have the determination to
overcome the formidable interest group pressure blocking reform in
Washington? One reason for optimism is Mr Clinton's remarkable ability to
bridge social and economic gaps: it is striking, for example, that he wins
90 per cent of the vote in the poorest regions of Arkansas while also
attracting enthusiastic support from the state's elite business leaders. If
Mr Clinton wins this election, the White House will be occupied by a
pragmatic moderate with a talent for building diverse coalitions. After the
ideological infighting of the past decade this could prove a recipe for
constructive change.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Stalling of Russian reform
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TENSIONS which have been building up within the Russian legislative and
executive structures are now boiling over. Ministers are warning of coups,
the parliamentary speaker talks of threats to his life, the parliament
prepares to overturn the government and the president talks of future
constitutional chaos. Some of this is the hyperbole attendant upon Russian
political life. But much of it is real in substance, even if the forms can
look like comic-opera.
The battle lines which have been drawn are shifting: but the issues around
which the struggle is intensifying are clear enough.
Economic reform, of the kind advertised a year ago by President Boris
Yeltsin and Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, is largely stalled.
Mass unemployment and even more rapid falls in production have meant that
enterprise restructuring has not happened. Two weeks ago Mr Gaidar promised
a return to a tighter monetary policy. There is, as yet, no sign of that
either.
It is not, however, true to say that the government has executed a U-turn;
rather it is wallowing in a trough in which the old policy has not been
abandoned, but no new one explicitly adopted. At one extreme, the
communist/nationalist opposition calls for a restoration of the
administrative-command system. The centrist case, put forward by General
Alexander Rutskoi, the vice president, and Mr Arkady Volsky, the leader of
the industrialists' union, is for a 'Chinese variant': a strong state, which
probably would have few pretensions to democracy, and a controlled infusion
of capitalist relations. Mr Gaidar poured scorn on this, reminding deputies
that the Chinese model had no place for an institution like the one in which
they were sitting, but Mr Yeltsin is not so sure.
In the political arena, the struggle is between the presidency and the
parliament - with the presidentially-appointed government becoming more
exposed as Mr Yeltsin shifts away from it. The parliament is not so much
dominated by communists, as by people who have come under the influence of a
national-populist mentality that rejects economic reform as a western
imposition and a democratic state as weak.
Irrespective of his personal bent - which has not, in practice, been
particularly authoritarian - Mr Yeltsin is being corralled into autocracy
because neither his own nor any other of the new institutions of power has
roots in civil society, which is itself only under construction. Thus the
political struggle is personal, factional and ultimately lawless.
This gives Russian foreign policy a nervy edge. The emphasis now being given
to the country's national interests impinges most obviously on the former
Soviet republics. It is clear that the Soviet military is in the ascendancy
in this sphere, successfully insisting on keeping armies in Moldova, central
Asia, the Caucasus and, most recently, the Baltics, to guarantee the
security of the Russian diaspora. Further abroad this is less clear, though
the failure of efforts to broker a deal over the Kuriles shows that the
nationalist current has set limits on what can be 'given away'. The
scheduled negotiations with the IMF next month will reveal how far western
assistance, meagre so far, is a factor in the reform process.
Russia is an unstable, poor, but massive and militarily powerful state
surrounded by even more unstable and poor republics, in which the pressures
released by the collapse of the old system have not yet produced
law-governed market democracies. The sharp drop in foreign attention is
dangerous, for the outcome of the struggles now going on is global in its
implications.
The conference of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries on aid to
the former Soviet states next week should be a forum for reassessing what
can be done. The dilemma is a long-standing one: waiting for the Russian
authorities to come up with a coherent programme of reform, before providing
large-scale assistance, would ensure the failure of reform. Meanwhile,
active engagement, with provision of sufficient funds to 'buy' a tolerable
transition for the economy, would not guarantee success. Yet to persist in
choosing certain failure over an uncertain success must be folly.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Technology: Taking health to heart - How much cholesterol is
too much? Continuing a series on drug discoveries, Paul Abrahams explores
the debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until recently, cholesterol-lowering drugs were the fastest-growing sector
in the pharmaceuticals industry. The market's expansion - 34.3 per cent a
year for the last five years - was phenomenal even by drug industry
standards.
But cholesterol-lowering drugs have become dogged by controversy. Earlier
this year a study in the British Medical Journal suggested that although
patients taking these medicines may benefit from a fall in coronary heart
disease mortality, they may also suffer an overall increase in mortality.
The US market for cholesterol-lowering drugs is now flattening out, says
Jonathan Tobert of the clinical research department of Merck, the world's
largest drug company. According to industry analysts, the growth in the
number of prescriptions in the US has slowed from 33 per cent last year to
only 22 per cent this year.
At stake is more than pharmaceuticals companies' earnings growth. Coronary
heart disease is the developed world's biggest single killer. In the UK
alone, as many as 300,000 people suffer a heart attack each year. Of these
more than half die. In the US, 600,000 people die every year from coronary
heart disease.
There is little doubt of cholesterol's role in increasing the risk of heart
disease and mortality. The question is whether cholesterol-lowering drugs
are safe.
Cholesterol, a natural lipid or fat, is almost insoluble. In order to move
cholesterol around the body, the liver attaches it to protein molecules to
create lipoproteins.
These lipoproteins come in a number of different types, but the most
important are high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and low-density lipoproteins
(LDL). HDL carries cholesterol out of cells and is therefore known as 'good'
cholesterol, while LDL carries cholesterol into cells and is associated with
increased risk of heart disease.
Perversely, too little cholesterol can be as dangerous as too much. William
Sigmund, senior director of medical research at Warner-Lambert's
pharmaceuticals division Parke-Davis, explains that too little HDL is a risk
because less cholesterol is carried away to the liver for disposal.
Conversely, too much LDL leads to cholesterol being deposited in cells that
become trapped in blood vessels. Other cells then attach themselves and form
scar-tissue. This tissue is capable of creating a blockage that prevents
oxygen reaching the heart, a process known as atherosclerosis. The heart
muscle then dies from lack of oxygen.
Other risk factors implicated in heart disease include smoking, alcohol
consumption, stress, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, lack of
exercise and genetic traits.
But cholesterol remains a prime target. Tobert explains that for every 1 per
cent reduction in blood cholesterol levels there is a 2 per cent reduction
in coronary events, such as heart attacks.
The available treatments include:
Bile acid sequestrants. These drugs bind to the bile acids in the
gastro-intestinal tract and prevent them from being reabsorbed into the
body. Since bile acids include cholesterol, the amount reabsorbed is
reduced, leaving the liver to find cholesterol elsewhere in the body.
Richard Stokvis, group product manager for Lescol at Sandoz, the Swiss drugs
company, says these drugs can reduce blood cholesterol levels by between 15
and 20 per cent, but cause problematic gastro-intestinal side-effects.
Fibrates. These limit production of very-low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) in
the liver. Since VLDLs are precursors of LDLs, their reduction limits
production of LDL. The most common drug in this class is Parke-Davis's
Lopid.
HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, also known as statins. These block the
production of hydroxymethylglutary coenzyme A (HMG CoA), a key enzyme
required for cholesterol synthesis in the liver and intestine. This is the
latest and most effective class of drug, reducing LDL blood levels by up to
40 per cent. They also increase levels of HDL - good cholesterol - up to 15
per cent.
HMG CoA reductase inhibitors include Merck's Mevacor and Zocor, and
Pravachol, a drug developed by Sankyo of Japan and licensed to Bristol Myers
Squibb in the US.
For some, the case for pharmaceuticals appears proven. Even the drugs'
critics would agree that they are essential for those who have already had
heart attacks and therefore have a high risk of further attacks. Those of a
certain age with abnormally high cholesterol levels because of their genetic
make-up should also be treated.
But it is unclear whether patients with high cholesterol levels who have not
had heart attacks and have few or no other risk factors should use the
drugs. Desirable levels of cholesterol are between 200 and 239 milligrams
per decilitre in the US and between 5.2 and 6.2 millimoles per litre in the
UK, according to the Family Heart Association, the British charity.
The problem is that although the drugs reduce coronary heart disease
mortality, they may increase mortality through other causes.
Take an on-going study of Finnish businessmen. The trials have shown so far
that of 2,051 people taking the drug only 16 died of coronary heart disease,
compared with 28 of 2,030 in the control group. This suggests the drugs
reduce heart disease-related mortality. However, 43 of those on the drugs
died from other causes compared with only 27 in the control group. Overall,
59 of those on drugs have died, compared with 55 of those not taking them.
The evidence is not conclusive. Although large numbers of patients are
involved, the trials are small, with few mortality figures to evaluate.
Sigmund at Parke Davis says immense studies would be required to find an
answer.
The critics contend that on the basis of available evidence it is difficult
to justify the rapid expansion in the number of prescriptions issued by
doctors for these drugs. Healthy people enter the doctor's surgery and leave
as patients, possibly for life, even though they may not be ill. About 3.5m
people in the US take cholesterol-lowering drugs.
In an editorial last month in Circulation, the journal of the American Heart
Association, Stephen Hulley, professor of epidemiology at the University of
California, called for a change in the US government's cholesterol reduction
policy. He asked for a reduction in universal cholesterol screening and in
the use of drugs prescribed to healthy patients to prevent coronary heart
disease.
'Until we know for sure that they have any benefit, we shouldn't be giving
people drugs, especially when it involves decades of treatment for otherwise
healthy people,' says Hulley.
Tobert says that in the US about 40 per cent of patients presently on the
drugs have coronary heart disease, while a further 40 per cent have other
risk factors. He estimates that only 11 per cent of patients have high
cholesterol but no diseases creating the symptoms.
Scrip Reports, the market researchers, estimate that worldwide sales of
cholesterol-lowering drugs would reach Dollars 3.8bn next year and Dollars
5bn by 1995. Merck should increase its sales of Mevacor, its best-selling
hypolipaemic, from Dollars 1.1bn last year to Dollars 1.6bn next year,
according to Mehta and Isalay, the New-York analysts. Although the overall
market is slowing, sales of Merck's Zocor are growing as the drug takes
market share away from older medicines, says Tobert.
Large studies are required to resolve the drugs' overall efficacy and
safety. Such a study, involving 20,000 patients, is being planned at the
Radcliffe Infirmary at Oxford. The clinical trial service unit has been
looking for money for two years. So far it has received only partial
funding.
Meanwhile, there are concerns that fears about the drugs' safety may put off
doctors and patients from using them even when they are clearly beneficial.
Anthony Keech, a cardiologist and epidemiologist at the Radcliffe
Infirmary's clinical trial service unit, explains: 'Most drugs carry some
risk. You have to weigh up the benefits with the expected risk. Many people
who ought to take these drugs just aren't being given them, particularly
those who have sustained heart attacks or have congenitally high cholesterol
levels.'
The series will continue next month by looking at the latest methods of
fighting infection.

Doodling and defacing pictures in books and magazines is the kind of
mischief that children of all ages indulge in, but this week saw the UK
launch of a product enabling adults to join in without feeling guilty.
Photograffiti starts with a 35mm negative of the customer's boss, spouse,
mother-in-law etc. This is enlarged, encapsulated in rigid clear plastic,
and returned to the customer with a white plastic speech bubble and a pack
of five coloured felt tip pens.
Photograffiti, from London-based Graham Associates, can be used, with or
without speech bubble, as a memo board or for recreation and amusement, and
can be wiped clean with a damp cloth for re-use time and again. When not
being used it becomes a portrait.
It comes in two sizes, 10in by 14in for Pounds 12.99 and 12in by 18in for
Pounds 14.99. Photograffiti: UK, 081 392 9304

FT  23 OCT 92 / Technology: Sizing up the human body - Worth Watching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rapidly-changing lifestyles - especially dietary habits - can have a big
effect on human body measurements, and have implications for industries
producing everything from clothing and furniture to cars.
Conventional three-dimensional measuring instruments can size up a human
body without touching it, but the process can be time-consuming and suffer
from poor data accuracy. NKK of Japan says it has overcome many of these
problems with its Voxelan system, which can take 187 three-dimensional
measurements in 30 seconds.
The speed is due to a combination of laser-slit light scanning and a
specially developed image encoder. The system is being used to measure
50,000 Japanese men and women over the next two years in an industry-backed
research project to investigate how measurements are changing. Other
versions measure small and moving articles. NKK: Japan, 33 217 2138.

<TEXT>
Most electric motors only reach full load for a few seconds when they start
up. But the motor itself has no way of adjusting the amount of electricity
it consumes, wasting large amounts of energy as heat and vibration.
Now a Cornwall company, Somar Environmental Systems, has come up with an
innovative intelligent power controller that works with any AC induction
motor and cuts energy consumption by as much as 40 per cent.
The Somar Powerboss uses the most advanced microcomputer of its type in the
world to sense automatically what load is being placed on the motor, and
then supply precisely the right amount of electricity.
Companies installing the Powerboss have cut their electricity bills by
between 20 and 40 per cent, says Somar, so the unit pays for itself within a
matter of months. Somar Environmental Systems: UK, 0872 223000.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Cold fusion hopes revived by work in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON and STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEBATE over 'cold fusion', once hailed as a source of limitless energy
and then dismissed as a deception by many scientists, is likely to revive
following an announcement yesterday that Japanese researchers have got
reproducible evidence for the phenomenon.
The scientists from Nippon Telegraph and Telephone will present their full
results tomorrow at the third international cold fusion conference in
Nagoya. Other research groups from the US and Japan are also reporting
evidence for cold fusion - heat production or nuclear fusion products or
both - but the NTT work will be particularly influential as it comes from
one of the world's leading industrial laboratories.
Mr Eiichi Yamaguchi, senior NTT scientist, said it was too early to draw
firm conclusions about cold fusion as a practical source of energy. But he
said: 'Now I believe we can use this in real energy generation, sometime.'
Cold fusion releases energy by joining together light atoms such as
deuterium at relatively low temperatures, in contrast to hot fusion research
which attempts to harness the process in large and expensive reactors
operating at millions of degrees centigrade.
The NTT experiments appear to answer a serious criticism of the original
cold fusion discovery, announced by Professors Martin Fleischmann and
Stanley Pons in 1989 - that positive results could not be distinguished
clearly from background effects and could not be repeated in a predictable
way.
Unlike the Fleischmann-Pons fusion cell, which had a palladium electrode
immersed in heavy water, the NTT experiments were conducted in a vacuum,
thus eliminating most background effects.
Mr Yamaguchi used a plate of palladium, which was saturated with deuterium
gas, placed in a vacuum and heated to 100 deg C. After several hours the
temperature rose to 200 deg C and helium-4, which was not previously
present, appeared in the vacuum chamber.
The helium-4 could only have been produced by the fusion of deuterium atoms,
the researchers said. They believe the reaction occurs as the deuterium
atoms collect beneath the surface of the plate before they are drawn out
into the vacuum.
But there are still many questions to be answered. The heat released (one
kilojoule) was 100,000 times less than expected - and less than the heat
output claimed by other cold fusion experimenters, including Profs
Fleischmann and Pons, who are now working in a private laboratory in France
with Japanese funding.
According to Prof Fleischmann, several hundred researchers around the world
are working on cold fusion. Unlike many others, Mr Yamaguchi has been able
to repeat the procedure five times with identical results.
If laboratories elsewhere can repeat his experiment, some of the doubts
about cold fusion may start to disappear. A lot more evidence will be needed
to convince mainstream scientists that cold fusion not only exists but is a
practical energy source for the future.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Islamic zealotry presents Cairo with hard choices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IF ANY doubts lingered about a resurgent Islamic movement in Egypt, they
will have been dispelled by a string of incidents in the past months,
culminating in Wednesday's slaying of a British tourist.
The killing of 28-year-old Ms Sharon Hill by gunmen, who ambushed her tour
bus near the extremist stronghold of Assiut south of Cairo, could hardly
have delivered a more unpleasant message to a government seemingly bereft of
new ideas as to how to deal with the fundamentalist challenge.
For a hard-pressed country whose fortunes are heavily dependent on tourism
revenues - now easily Egypt's main foreign exchange earner apart from
workers' remittances - it was a disturbing development which the authorities
cannot ignore.
The death of Sharon Hill may come to be regarded as a critical moment in the
continuing war between the security forces and Islamic extremists. If
nothing else, it underscored the enormous difficulties faced by the
authorities in combating zealots, now well established in the dusty,
decaying towns and villages of the Egyptian hinterland.
The episode is almost certain to add to persistent domestic criticism, some
of it voiced from within the ruling National Democratic Party, of methods
used to cope with the many faces of the Islamic tendency.
Official tactics have been to seek to co-opt the Islamicists by allowing the
ostensibly moderate mainstream Moslem Brotherhood limited access to
institutions such as parliament, while cracking down hard on militants who
espouse a more confrontational Islam.
But an increasing problem for the authorities is how to distinguish between
the mainstream and zealots committed to the violent overthrow of the
established order. While formal links may not exist, the two streams share a
common interest in getting rid of the status quo.
As President Hosni Mubarak and his advisers review options available to them
in light of the latest rash of incidents - a Nile ferry was fired on earlier
this month, among other instances of Islamic-inspired violence - the
temptation will be to crack down even harder on individuals suspected of
association with the al-gama'a al-Islamiyah or Islamic groups, but this is
likely to prove counter-productive.
The government risks further alienating individuals who already feel
confined to the margins of society without jobs or the reasonable hope of a
better life. Throughout Egypt, disaffected youth is inevitably drawn to the
deceptively simple proposition that 'Islam is the solution' to all their
problems.
Many Egyptian liberals, who feel increasingly beleaguered in the face of the
Islamic tide, are openly critical of what they regard as the government's
failure to deal effectively with the threat of extremism. These critics
advocate more openness rather than more repression, and a greater commitment
to democracy to allow countervailing secular forces to flower.
They fault the government for seeking to co-opt the fundamentalists by
facilitating increased religious influence in the education system and in
the media. These tools are now being used, critics say, to undermine Egypt's
broadly secular institutions.

SOUTH AFRICAN President F W de Klerk has been roundly condemned for his
decision to force through legislation letting the state pardon officials who
committed apartheid crimes.
The African National Congress (ANC) yesterday described the step as
unacceptable and repeated its warning that it would nullify any amnesty
legislation introduced by the existing government.
The Further Indemnity Bill, described by one parliamentarian as a 'charter
for crooks, criminals and assassins', was also severely criticised by Mr
Colin Eglin, chairman of the Liberal Democratic party. 'This is really
minority domination when they should be demonstrating a sensitivity for
power-sharing. They are forcing this through despite overwhelming
opposition,' said Mr Eglin.
Following the defeat of the bill in parliament on Wednesday, Mr de Klerk
decided to refer the legislation to the President's Council, the appointed
body widely considered to be a means of rubber-stamping legislation that has
failed to gain parliament's assent.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Board sackings raise doubts over Nigerian LNG project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NIGERIAN government yesterday sacked its representatives on the board of
the country's liquefied natural gas joint venture, two months ahead of a
financing deadline for the Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 2.8bn) project.
The unexpected decision raised concern about the completion timetable of a
venture which dates back over two decades and which has suffered setbacks in
the past.
Nigeria LNG is 60 per cent owned by Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,
20 per cent by Royal Dutch/Shell and 10 per cent each by Italy's Agip and
Elf Aquitaine of France. The plant would draw on Nigeria's proven natural
gas reserves of 2,600bn cubic metres, and would be able to produce up to
4.5m tonnes a year of liquefied gas.
The decision comes two weeks after the board discussed bids by international
consortia for the Dollars 2.6bn main contract at Bonny, 540km from Lagos,
project officials said. Bids will become invalid if at least tentative
financing, including some Dollars 2bn in guaranteed loans, is not in place
by December 22, they said.
The officials said there were doubts over prospects for financing by the
deadline. One consortium bidding for the main contract includes Kellogg of
the US and France's Technip. The other is led by Bechtel of the US and
Japan's Chiyoda.
The news was greeted with astonishment by western bankers and donors,
anxious about the future of a project.
But industry officials were cautious in their assessment of the impact on
the project. 'The Nigerians have three competent international partners,'
said one last night. He went on to warn, however, that 'if momentum is lost
because of political or other uncertainties, the project will unravel. And
if they don't make this one they can forget it.'
Mr Chu Onkongwu, the petroleum minister, said that the government
representatives on the board of Nigeria LNG had been 'unable to share
government objectives'. These were to ensure the project incorporated best
available technology, the most favourable investment terms and the maximum
possible transfer of technology to Nigeria.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Bush on path to improve Vietnam links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush said yesterday he had a 'road map' for normalising
relations with Vietnam and 'significant progress' to that end had recently
been made. But he questioned a published report that his goal was to achieve
this by Inauguration Day in January.
In a TV interview he said it was 'a major breakthrough' that officials in
Hanoi last weekend showed a visiting US delegation 4,000 pictures and other
documents relating to Americans held prisoner of war or missing in action
during the Vietnam war.
But he added 'I need to know exactly how major' this breakthrough was. There
would be no full normalisation of relations, including an end to the 17-year
US trade embargo on Vietnam, 'until I can say in total clear conscience' to
the families of POWs and MIAs that there was a full acounting of the fate of
their relatives.
Mr Bush is to be briefed in the White House today by the US delegation, led
by retired general John Vessey and Senator John McCain, the Republican from
Arizona who spent 1967-73 as a prisoner of the Vietnamese.
Mr McCain said he recognised pictures of himself taken as he was fished from
a lake near Hanoi after his aircraft was shot down. He added: 'I have seen
no proof of live Americans' still in Vietnam, an assertion that contradicts
claims made at Congressional hearings this year that some are still being
held.
The Los Angeles Times, quoting mostly Asian diplomatic sources in
Washington, reported yesterday that the US 'road map' involved a series of
steps, some of which, including allowing group travel by Americans to
Vietnam and the restoration of telephone links, have already been taken.
Among the next moves would be to permit US companies to sign contracts in
Vietnam and open representative offices there. Assuming a full accounting of
missing Americans, this could be followed by the ending of the embargo and,
after a democratically elected government is installed in Cambodia, by the
restoration of full diplomatic relations.
In the course of this process Vietnam would be allowed to borrow from the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to help in its
infrastructural reforms. Japan and France are among nations actively pushing
the US to end its block on such credit. US commercial interests are also
concerned they might lose out in competition for new business in Vietnam.
Mr Bush confirmed this approach by saying: 'I'd like to see full relations.
. . and see that nation become democratic and to fit into Asia.' But he went
on: 'We're not there yet.'
If Mr Bush loses the November 3 election, he would still be free to pursue
this course before a new president takes over in January.
This might let Governor Bill Clinton, if he wins, off a hook since he may be
reluctant quickly to restore full commercial and diplomatic ties, given
controversies about his opposition to the Vietnam war.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Threat of split in Japanese faction
</HEADLINE>

THE largest faction of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) was in
danger of splitting last night as a former chief cabinet secretary, Mr Keizo
Obuchi, was formally chosen as its chairman in spite of continuing
opposition to his appointment.
Mr Obuchi, 55, is supposed to replace the fallen LDP 'godfather', Mr Shin
Kanemaru, who resigned last week. But he will have far less control over the
faction than his predecessor and could be quickly replaced in an attempt to
keep the 109-member faction together.
The selection followed a plea yesterday from Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime
minister, for the faction members to reach a conclusion quickly, as the
continuing negotiations had been mocked by the Japanese media and inspired
protests in front of the party's offices.
Mr Miyazawa was particularly concerned that Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance
minister, has spent the last week in hotel rooms arguing over the choice of
his faction's leader, instead of focusing on the weakening Japanese economy
or the troubled banking system.
The finance minister is at the centre of the dispute, as he and Mr Ichiro
Ozawa, two of the faction's most influential officials, opposed Mr Obuchi
and boycotted the announcement of his appointment late last night.
Mr Ozawa, a former LDP secretary general, was chosen by Mr Kanemaru as his
successor and has wide support from younger members of the faction, who were
not directly involved in the appointment of the new chairman.
He argued that the five of eight senior officers who chose Mr Obuchi were
merely following orders from Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister,
who claims credit for founding the faction and is attempting to reassert his
authority.
Mr Kanemaru resigned after a month of controversy over his having received a
Y500m (Pounds 2.5m) donation from a scandal-tainted parcel delivery company,
Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, in violation of the Political Funds Control Law. His
resignation was prompted by the public outcry over his lenient treatment by
prosecutors, who fined him only Y200,000 and did not directly question him.
The lingering dispute over the succession has encouraged further public
debate over the role of the LDP's factions, which are small parties in
themselves with their own office buildings and staff.

FT  23 OCT 92 / West still cautious on Iraq oil sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN countries are still cautious about United Nations suggestions that
Iraq should be allowed to sell oil, Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN special
commission on Iraq, said yesterday after talks in London with senior British
officials, writes Robert Mauthner.
In the talks, he explored the possibility of adding 'a carrot', the sale of
oil, to 'the stick' of the programme to eliminate Iraq's advanced weapons.
Mr Ekeus said the UN oil embargo, introduced in August 1990, was costing
Iraq an estimated Dollars 30m a day. Stressing that Baghdad was continuing
to obstruct UN weapons inspectors, he said: 'We have to ask whether those
weapons are so valuable that they (the Iraqis) are prepared to lose the oil
income?'
